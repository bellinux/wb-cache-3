5|$|Starfish do {{not appear}} to have any {{mechanisms}} for <b>osmoregulation,</b> and keep their body fluids at the same salt concentration as the surrounding water. Although some species can tolerate relatively low salinity, the lack of an <b>osmoregulation</b> system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many estuarine environments.|$|E
5|$|A {{study on}} the fully aquatic Archegosaurus shows that it's heat balance, gas exchange, <b>osmoregulation,</b> and {{digestion}} were more {{similar to those of}} fish than those of modern aquatic amphibians like salamanders.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain stem}} (or myelencephalon) is the brain's posterior. As well as {{controlling}} some muscles and body organs, in bony fish at least, the brain stem governs respiration and <b>osmoregulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} <b>osmoregulation</b> is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|During <b>osmoregulation,</b> fluid {{is added}} to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to extracellular fluid, cytosol {{has a high}} concentration of potassium ions and a low concentration of sodium ions. This difference in ion concentrations is critical for <b>osmoregulation,</b> since if the ion levels were the same inside a cell as outside, water would enter constantly by osmosis - since the levels of macromolecules inside cells are higher than their levels outside. Instead, sodium ions are expelled and potassium ions taken up by the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, potassium ions then flow down their concentration gradient through potassium-selection ion channels, this loss of positive charge creates a negative membrane potential. To balance this potential difference, negative chloride ions also exit the cell, through selective chloride channels. The loss of sodium and chloride ions compensates for the osmotic effect of the higher concentration of organic molecules inside the cell.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in <b>osmoregulation.</b> Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits {{along the side of the}} head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding <b>osmoregulation.</b> Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol is {{a complex}} mixture of {{substances}} dissolved in water. Although water forms {{the large majority of}} the cytosol, its structure and properties within cells is not well understood. The concentrations of ions such as sodium and potassium are different in the cytosol than in the extracellular fluid; these differences in ion levels are important in processes such as <b>osmoregulation,</b> cell signaling, and the generation of action potentials in excitable cells such as endocrine, nerve and muscle cells. The cytosol also contains large amounts of macromolecules, which can alter how molecules behave, through macromolecular crowding.|$|E
5|$|Rather slow-swimming, the pyjama shark {{spends most}} of the day resting in caves or crevices or amongst kelp, {{emerging}} at night to actively forage for food. Many individuals may congregate at a single spot, particularly in summer. This species falls prey to larger sharks, {{and is one of the}} cartilaginous fish most frequently consumed by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). When threatened, it often curls into a circle with its tail covering its head, in a similar fashion to the shysharks (Haploblepharus). Its eggs are fed upon by the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, which can pierce the outer covering to extract the yolk within. Like other sharks, the pyjama shark maintains osmotic balance with the environment by regulating its internal concentration of urea and other nitrogenous wastes. Experiments have shown that the shark's capacity for <b>osmoregulation</b> is dependent on how well it has fed.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through <b>osmoregulation.</b> Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the bull}} shark's closest living {{relatives}} {{do not have the}} capabilities of <b>osmoregulation.</b> Its genus, Carcharhinus, also includes the sandbar shark, which is not capable of <b>osmoregulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nitrogenous {{waste is}} {{excreted}} {{in the form}} of ammonia through the body wall, and is not associated with any specific organs. However, the structures for excreting salt to maintain <b>osmoregulation</b> are typically more complex.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa is {{an eating}} {{disorder}} that is characterized by low appetite and {{a strong desire to}} lose weight, be thin, and fears of gaining weight. People suffering from anorexia nervosa frequently have an abnormally low body weight, which can cause muscle dysfunction and weak <b>osmoregulation.</b> It can also accompany emotional symptoms such as depression.|$|E
25|$|Acclimation is {{a process}} that is {{performed}} when adding new marine life to an aquarium, particularly for invertebrates, who lack <b>osmoregulation.</b> This process slowly introduces the organisms to the water composition of the new environment, preventing shock resulting from sudden changes in water chemistry. There are several different methods of doing this, including the use of a drip line, or of a measuring cup or other device to slowly mix water from the aquarium tank into a container with the new animal.|$|E
25|$|Road salt {{ends up in}} fresh-water {{bodies and}} could harm aquatic plants and animals by disrupting their <b>osmoregulation</b> ability. The omnipresence of salt poses a problem in any coastal coating application, as trapped salts cause great {{problems}} in adhesion. Naval authorities and ship builders monitor the salt concentrations on surfaces during construction. Maximal salt concentrations on surfaces are dependent on the authority and application. The IMO regulation is mostly used and sets salt levels {{to a maximum of}} 50nbsp&mg/m2 soluble salts measured as sodium chloride. These measurements are done by means of a Bresle test.|$|E
25|$|Salmon {{eggs are}} laid in {{freshwater}} streams typically at high latitudes. The eggs hatch into alevin or sac fry. The fry quickly develop into parr with camouflaging vertical stripes. The parr stay {{for six months}} {{to three years in}} their natal stream before becoming smolts, which are distinguished by their bright, silvery colour with scales that are easily rubbed off. Only 10% of all salmon eggs are estimated to survive to this stage. The smolt body chemistry changes, allowing them to live in salt water. Smolts spend a portion of their out-migration time in brackish water, where their body chemistry becomes accustomed to <b>osmoregulation</b> in the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Examinations of the {{respiratory}} systems of Eurypterus have led many paleontologists {{to conclude that}} it was capable of breathing air and walking on land for {{a short amount of}} time. Eurypterus had two types of respiratory systems. Its main organs for breathing were the book gills inside the segments of the mesosoma. These structures were supported by semicircular 'ribs' and were probably attached {{near the center of the}} body, similar to the gills of modern horseshoe crabs. They were protected under platelike appendages (which actually formed the apparent 'belly' of Eurypterus) known as Blatfüsse. These gills may have also played a role in <b>osmoregulation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Xylem sap {{consumption}} may {{be related}} to <b>osmoregulation.</b> High osmotic pressure in the stomach, caused by high sucrose concentration, can lead to water transfer from the hemolymph to the stomach, thus resulting in hyperosmotic stress and eventually to the death of the insect. Aphids avoid this fate by osmoregulating through several processes. Sucrose concentration is directly reduced by assimilating sucrose toward metabolism and by synthesizing oligosaccharides from several sucrose molecules, thus reducing the solute concentration and consequently the osmotic pressure. Oligasaccharides are then excreted through honeydew, explaining its high sugar concentrations, which can then be used by other animals such as ants. Furthermore, water is transferred from the hindgut, where osmotic pressure has already been reduced, to the stomach to dilute stomach content. Eventually, aphids consume xylem sap to dilute the stomach osmotic pressure. All these processes function synergetically, and enable aphids to feed on high-sucrose-concentration plant sap, as well as to adapt to varying sucrose concentrations.|$|E
25|$|As they {{approach}} {{the time when they}} are ready to migrate out to the sea the parr lose their camouflage bars and undergo a process of physiological changes which allows them to survive the shift from freshwater to saltwater. At this point salmon are called smolt. Smolt spend time in the brackish waters of the river estuary while their body chemistry adjusts their <b>osmoregulation</b> to cope with the higher salt levels they will encounter in the ocean. Smolt also grow the silvery scales which visually confuse ocean predators. When they have matured sufficiently in late spring, and are about 15 to 20 centimetres long, the smolt swim out of the rivers and into the sea. There they spend their first year as a post-smolt. Post-smolt form schools with other post-smolt, and set off to find deep-sea feeding grounds. They then spend up to four more years as adult ocean salmon while their full swimming ability and reproductive capacity develop.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{blood or}} haemolymph's main {{function}} {{is that of}} transport and it bathes the insect's body organs. Making up usually less than 25% of an insect's body weight, it transports hormones, nutrients and wastes and has a role in, <b>osmoregulation,</b> temperature control, immunity, storage (water, carbohydrates and fats) and skeletal function. It also plays an essential part in the moulting process. An additional role of the haemolymph in some orders, can be that of predatory defence. It can contain unpalatable and malodourous chemicals that will act {{as a deterrent to}} predators. Haemolymph contains molecules, ions and cells; regulating chemical exchanges between tissues, haemolymph is encased in the insect body cavity or haemocoel. It is transported around the body by combined heart (posterior) and aorta (anterior) pulsations, which are located dorsally just under the surface of the body. It differs from vertebrate blood in that it doesn't contain any red blood cells and therefore is without high oxygen carrying capacity, and is more similar to lymph found in vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lay amniotic eggs {{covered with}} leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion, chorion, and allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, {{but it is}} flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the {{inside and outside of}} the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in <b>osmoregulation</b> and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. Viviparity and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of viviparity varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of viviparity in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited viviparity, such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.|$|E
500|$|The {{renin-angiotensin system}} regulates {{the amount of}} fluid and sodium {{concentration}} in the body. Reduction of blood pressure and sodium concentration in the kidney result {{in the production of}} renin, which in turn produces aldosterone and angiotensin, retaining sodium in the urine. When the concentration of sodium increases, the production of renin decreases, and the sodium concentration returns to normal. The sodium ion (Na+) is an important electrolyte in neuron function, and in <b>osmoregulation</b> between cells and the extracellular fluid. [...] This is accomplished in all animals by Na+/K+-ATPase, an active transporter pumping ions against the gradient, and sodium/potassium channels. Sodium is the most prevalent metallic ion in extracellular fluid.|$|E
500|$|No {{living species}} of crocodilian can be {{considered}} truly marine; although the saltwater crocodile and the American crocodile are able to swim out to sea, their normal habitats are river mouths, estuaries, mangrove swamps, and hypersaline lakes, though several extinct species have had marine habits, including the recently gone [...] "Gavialis" [...] papuensis, which occurred in a fully marine habitat in the Solomon Islands coastlines. All crocodilians need to maintain the concentration of salt in body fluids at suitable levels. <b>Osmoregulation</b> {{is related to the}} quantity of salts and water exchanged with the environment. Intake of water and salts takes place across the lining of the mouth, when water is drunk, incidentally while feeding, and when present in foods. Water is lost from the body during breathing, and both salts and water are lost in the urine and faeces, through the skin, and via salt-excreting glands on the tongue, though these are only present in crocodiles and gharials. The skin is a largely effective barrier to both water and ions. Gaping causes water loss by evaporation from the lining of the mouth, and on land, water is also lost through the skin. Large animals are better able to maintain homeostasis at times of osmotic stress than smaller ones. Newly hatched crocodilians are much less tolerant of exposure to salt water than are older juveniles, presumably because they have a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Many turtles, tortoises, and lizards have {{proportionally}} {{very large}} bladders. Charles Darwin {{noted that the}} Galapagos tortoise had a bladder which could store up to 20% of its body weight. [...] Such adaptations {{are the result of}} environments such as remote islands and deserts where water is very scarce. Other desert-dwelling reptiles have large bladders that can store a long-term reservoir of water for up to several months and aid in <b>osmoregulation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 3. Proctodeum (hindgut): This {{is divided}} into three sections; the {{anterior}} is the ileum, the middle portion, the colon, and the wider, posterior section is the rectum. This extends from the pyloric valve which is located between the mid and the hindgut to the anus. Here absorption of water, salts and other beneficial substances take place before excretion. Like other animals, the removal of toxic metabolic waste requires water. However, for very small animals like insects, water conservation is a priority. Because of this, blind-ended ducts called Malpighian tubules come into play. These ducts emerge as evaginations at the anterior end of the hindgut and are the main organs of <b>osmoregulation</b> and excretion. These extract the waste products from the haemolymph, in which all the internal organs are bathed). These tubules continually produce the insect’s uric acid, which is transported to the hindgut, where important salts and water are re-absorbed by both the hindgut and rectum. Excrement is then voided as insoluble and non-toxic uric acid granules. Excretion and <b>osmoregulation</b> in insects are not orchestrated by the Malpighian tubules alone, but require a joint function of the ileum and/or rectum.|$|E

2500|$|Gill remodelling {{happens in}} only a few species of fish, and it {{involves}} the buildup or removal of an inter-lamellar cell mass (ILCM). [...] As a response to hypoxia, some fish are able to remodel their gills to increase respiratory surface area, with some species such as goldfish doubling their lamellar surface areas in as little as 8 hours. The increased respiratory surface area comes as a trade-off with increased metabolic costs because the gills are a very important site for many important processes including respiratory gas exchange, acid-base regulation, nitrogen excretion, <b>osmoregulation,</b> hormone regulation, metabolism, and environmental sensing.|$|E
2500|$|Taurine (...) , or 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that is widely distributed in animal tissues. [...] It {{is a major}} constituent of bile {{and can be found}} in the large intestine, and accounts for up to 0.1% of total human body weight. Taurine has many fundamental biological roles, such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidation, <b>osmoregulation,</b> membrane stabilization, and modulation of calcium signaling. It is essential for cardiovascular function, and development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. Taurine is unusual among biological molecules in being a sulfonic acid, while the vast majority of biologically occurring acids contain the more weakly acidic carboxyl group. [...] While taurine is sometimes called an amino acid, and indeed is an acid containing an amino group, it is not an amino acid in the usual biochemical meaning of the term, which refers to compounds containing both an amino and a carboxyl group.|$|E
