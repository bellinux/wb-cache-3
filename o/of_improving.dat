40|$|Using a farm {{household}} {{data from}} 3 agroecological zones of Ghana, this paper investigates the causal {{relationship between the}} adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> maize variety and technical efficiency or productivity. The empirical results show {{a positive relationship between}} the adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> maize variety and technical efficiency or productivity of farmers in the Semi-deciduous forest and Guinea Savannah zones. Generally, adopters <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> maize variety are about 6 % to 8 % more efficient than non-adopters. The estimated percentage increase in productivity due to the adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> maize variety is about 53 %. In the Semi-deciduous forest agroecological zone, adopters <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> maize variety are about 25 % to 36 % more efficient than non-adopters whilst in the Guinea Savannah agroecological zone, adopters <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> maize variety are about 15 % to 26 % more efficient than non-adopters. The estimated percentage increase in productivity due to adoption <b>of</b> the <b>improved</b> maize variety is about 8 % in the Semi-deciduous forest zone and about 11 % in the Guinea Savannah zone. The impact of adoption on technical efficiency in the Transitional zone is however negative. Adopters <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> maize variety are 7 % to 8 % less efficient than non-adopters and the estimated percentage decrease in productivity due to adoption <b>of</b> the <b>improved</b> maize variety is about 15 %.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume technologies and welfare impacts <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume varieties specifically on income, consumption expenditure and calorie intake in Bale highlands of Ethiopia. The study focused particularly on the identification of factors determining adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume technologies, evaluation of welfare impacts of adoption status and intensity <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume varieties, identifying intra-household impact dynamics due to adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> legume varieties and spotting out the major challenges and opportunities faced by smallholders in their adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume technologies [...] This study used cross sectional data that acquired from a total of 600 households, which were randomly and proportionately sampled from 12 major legume producer kebeles in 3 districts of Bale highlands by using three-stage sampling technique. Probit and Clog-log binary model were estimated to identify the underlying factors that determine adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume varieties; and fertilizer and pesticide, respectively and separately. PSM model was estimated to evaluate the welfare impacts <b>of</b> adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume varieties. In addition, continuous treatment effects model (GPS) was also employed to estimate the welfare impact of intensity of adoption by discarding non-adopters from the analysis. The results from probit and clog-log indicate that age, livestock holding, farm size, membership in farmers cooperatives, contact with agricultural research center, household head participation in off-farm activity, distance from agricultural extension office and main market; and location (district dummy) were factors that significantly determine farmers decision to adopt improved food legume technologies. The study also indicates that adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume technologies can motivate farmers to shift from the monocropping system to diversified one, improve income since they fetch higher prices than common cereals and they are the major source of protein for the household who cannot acquire it from animal products. However, adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume technologies is highly constrained by labor-intensive nature of the production, lack <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume technologies especially water logging tolerant varieties and market irregularities. The outputs from PSM indicate that adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume varieties has positive and significant impact on the income and the adopter receive 25 % higher income than non-adopter. The intra household analysis indicated that households with productive labor force receive better treatment effect while households with economically dependents female members receive considerably lower treatment effects from adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> food legume varieties, suggesting the prevalent intra-household differences. The result of GPS also confirms the positive effect of intensity of adoption on income, consumption expenditure and calorie intake. The results generally suggests the need to design interventions enhancing adoption of food legume technologies focusing on improving adoption rates and minimizing intra household difference in income.

40|$|If dryland legumes are to {{meet the}} {{expectations}} of reducing poverty and hunger in the semi-Arid Tropics, there will be need for a full understanding of their potential for diffusion and the barriers to adoption. We apply a program evaluation technique to data obtained from Tanzania to derive estimates of the actual and potential adoption rates <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> pigeonpea varieties and their determinants. The study reveals that only 33 % of the sampled farmers were aware <b>of</b> the <b>improved</b> pigeonpea varieties which consequently restricted the sample adoption rate <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> varieties to only 19 %. The potential adoption rate <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> pigeonpea if all farmers had been exposed to improved varieties is estimated at 62 % and the adoption gap resulting from the incomplete exposure of the population to the improved pigeonpea is 43 %. We further find that the awareness <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> varieties is mainly influenced by attendance of Participatory Variety Selection activities. The adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> varieties is more pronounced among farmers with smaller landholdings suggesting that farmers facing land pressure intensify pigeonpea production through the adoption <b>of</b> <b>improved</b> high yielding varieties. The findings are indicative of the relatively large demand for improved pigeonpea varieties suggesting that there is scope for increasing their adoption rate in Tanzania once the farmers are made aware of the existence of the technologies. ...|$|R
