5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Milnrow {{during the}} Middle Ages was a hamlet located within the {{township}} of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale. It was named by the Anglo-Saxons, but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, the descendants <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>families</b> successfully agitated for a chapel of ease to be constructed in Milnrow by {{the banks of the}} River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Despite this distinction, Milnrow did not increase much further in size or population until the dawn of the woollen trade in the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{indicate}} the Gurdons or Gordons occupied the village {{from at least}} the 13th century when Sir Adam de Gurdon held property. In 1472 the Gurdon holding was purchased by Winchester College who would increasingly grow to dominate the parish over the next 500 years. The Sandals holding later merged with the Gurdons and documents exist indicating {{the existence of the}} Sandals in 1255 and another in 1329, witnessed by a John de Sandale. For centuries, village life centred on the old farm holdings of the Manor; the Shelleys, Freres, Sandals and Gurdons (now merged into Old House Farm), and the Heathers, Clays, Porters, Park, Smiths and some descendants <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>families</b> continue to live in the village today and many old farm buildings still exist. The naturalist and ornithologist Gilbert White immortalised the localities of the region, including East Worldham, in his The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789).|$|E

25|$|There were {{a number}} of European {{families}} who achieved status in the area. These included the Campbell family, and the Palmer family.

25|$|For the Spanish period, in 1684 the Prince of Chimay had 2,600 {{soldiers}} {{under his}} command (1,700 infantry and 900 cavalry). The military population {{was not limited to}} troops: many soldiers and officers also had wives and children. In 1655, in the upper town alone, a third of the 660 soldiers were listed as married, and about half <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>families</b> had children. Then there were also the servants employed by the officers. The total military population of the upper town was therefore 1,170, almost twice as many as the number of actual troops.|$|E
25|$|After the {{issuance}} of Spain's Alhambra Decree in 1492, {{a large proportion of}} the unconverted Jews chose exile rather than conversion, many of them crossing the border to Portugal. In Portugal, however, the Jews were again issued with a similar decree just a few years later in 1497, giving them the choice of exile or conversion. Unlike in Spain, however, in actual practice Portugal mostly prevented them from leaving, thus they necessarily stayed as ostensible converts to Christianity whether they wished to or not, after the Portuguese King reasoned that by their failure to leave they accepted Christianity by default. For this reason, crypto-Judaism was far more prevalent in Portugal than in Spain, even though many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>families</b> were originally of Spanish rather than Portuguese descent.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{children}} experience parental separation and formation of stepfamilies. Research into the impact <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>family</b> transitions on children’s adjustment by family sociologists and psychologists has greatly increased; changes in research perspectives {{over the last two}} decades are discussed, including a focus on individual differences in children’s responses and the risk and protective factors implicated, on parent-child relationships as mediators of adjustment, on the significance of within-family differences and of biological relatedness (not solely family type), and on intergenerational patterns of associations. The importance of taking account of children’s perspectives on family change, and of including investigation of children’s relationships and experiences beyond the immediate household, to clarify the significance of children’s relations with their nonresident parents and grandparents is increasingly recognized. Controversial issues are noted, and the lessons learned for research design, if we are to understand better the implications <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>family</b> changes, which are of major social and developmental significance, are summarized...|$|R
25|$|As late as 1927, {{only two}} houses had {{received}} {{permission from the}} city {{to be built in}} Marshall Heights. Illegally built homes were far more numerous, and many residents were so poor that they grew the food they ate. Drinking water was obtained from a spring near Central Avenue. In the early 1930s, developers began actively marketing lots in Marshall Heights to African Americans. African Americans fleeing the Deep South, which had been particularly hard-hit by the Great Depression, were able to buy lots in Marshall Heights and erect shacks there. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>families</b> were so poor, they were forced to camp on the land they purchased until they could scrape together a combination of money and building materials to build a home.|$|E
25|$|Most of the park’s vegetation, {{especially}} around the canyon, is dense tropical rainforest. Most species {{found in the}} park {{are members of the}} Fabaceae family with 59 species and the Asteraceae family with 25 species, which reflect the abundance <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>families</b> statewide. Other important families include the Orchidaceae and Euphorbiaceae, each with 22 species, the Convolvulaceae family with 17 species, and the Cactaceae with 11 species. 122 species are considered valuable as ornamental plants with 46 having medicinal uses and 31 species valuable for logging. These mostly come from the rainforest areas. The rainforest vegetation is mostly deciduous, shedding leaves in the dry season. However, there are perennial rainforests, forests of pine and oak, grasslands (mostly induced) and areas with secondary vegetation.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, and many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>families</b> were in opposition to these programs due {{to the belief that}} it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/pre-school centers serving over 25,000 children. Though every government center is required to have an early childhood center, at present, no governmental policies deal with early childhood and no institutions have either the responsibility or the capacity to provide such services.|$|E
