For an assessment of the current policy mix in place in China for the deployment <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies,</b> the article compares the national Chinese regulations for <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> and China's specific CDM rules for their impact: where do general and CDM-specific regulations for the promotion <b>of</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> provide synergies, where does the policy-making on these two levels collide?Clean development mechanism <b>Renewable</b> <b>energies</b> China Project financing Project additionality Project risk assessment...|$|R
