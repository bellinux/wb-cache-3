5|$|The {{architects of}} early skyscrapers faced a number <b>of</b> <b>challenges.</b> The most fashionable {{architectural}} {{style in the}} late 19th century was the French Beaux-Arts movement, sometimes termed the Italian Renaissance style, which applied Classical aesthetic principles to modern buildings. American architects trained in the Beaux-Arts style at the Parisian Académie des Beaux-Arts began to return home in the 1880s, bringing these ideals and standards with them. Applying contemporary Beaux-Arts standards to early skyscrapers, however, was not straightforward. The buildings that the Beaux-Arts movement influenced were typically much shorter and broader than any skyscraper, and {{it was difficult to}} accurately reproduce the style in a tall, narrow building.|$|E

5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence <b>of</b> <b>challenges.</b> These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
40|$|Background: The prevalence, {{persistence}} and often early onset <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in individuals with severe intellectual disabilities allude {{to the potential}} of early intervention. Identification of children at high risk <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour would enable effective implementation of this strategy. Method: Questionnaire studies examined the association between child characteristics and the presence <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour {{at one point in}} time and 18 months later using the Challenging Behaviour Screening Questionnaire (CBSQ). Natural observations, questionnaires and objective measures were utilised to assess the validity of the CBSQ. The functional and communicative nature <b>of</b> the <b>challenging</b> behaviour demonstrated by participants at high risk was examined using experimental functional and descriptive analyses. Results: The relative risk <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour at one point in time and its persistence 18 months later was significantly increased by repetitive, restricted, overactive and impulsive behaviour. The concurrent and convergent validity of the CBSQ was demonstrated. Much <b>of</b> the <b>challenging</b> behaviour demonstrated by high risk participants appeared functional and closely associated with communicative behaviours. Discussion: Theoretical underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in this population are examined with emphasis on the interaction between child characteristics and environmental variables and the potential success of early intervention programmes for these children proposed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the frequency and severity <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in adults with Down’s syndrome with and without signs of dementia. Care staff were interviewed using the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community version (M. G. Aman & N. N.

Individuals’ ‘dementia status’ was assessed by using the Dementia Scale for Down’s syndrome (Gedye Research and Consulting, Vancouver, 1995). The {{results showed that the}} dementia group displayed more frequent and severe forms <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour than the nondementia group. The difference in reported levels <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour <b>of</b> both groups with the general learning disabilities population was not considered to be clinically significant and levels fell predominantly within the ‘normal range’. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} frequent and severe forms <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour in adults with Down’s syndrome is more likely to be a behavioural symptom associated with the onset of a dementing illness and not due to normal ageing alone...|$|R
5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward I died in 1307 {{he left a}} range <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> for his son to resolve. One of {{the most}} {{critical}} was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} of a number <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then {{figure out a way}} to help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra honeycombs that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a showcase for visual improvements, Lost Coast acted as a testbed for Valve's commentary system. When the feature is enabled, additional items appear in the game that can be interacted with to play an audio commentary. Each audio piece ranges from ten seconds to a minute of commentary. Players hear the developers {{talk about what the}} player is seeing, what is happening, why they made certain decisions, and what kinds <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> they faced. Commentary tracks are represented by floating speech bubbles called commentary nodes. Valve intended for players to first play the level with commentary disabled, and after completing the level, play it again with commentary enabled, learning about each new stage as they progress. The company has since made the commentary system standard in all of its later video games.|$|E

The shopping task consisted of nine separate challenges from previous editions of Big Brother, in which housemates had to compete against former contestants (see the week seven shopping task section). The housemates failed to pass the required number <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> and therefore failed the overall task. On Day 44, five new housemates, Kenneth, Bea, David, Hira and Tom entered the House and Karly became the seventh person to be evicted with 50.4% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
5|$|London was {{the premier}} centre for boxing because the aristocratic {{supporters}} of the sport dispersed to their country estates {{during the summer months}} but tended to congregate in the city for the winter period. Birmingham was often portrayed as second only to London for the sport and in 1789 there were a series <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> issued by fighters from the Birmingham area to opponents based around London. The challenges were intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers and their supporters. Three of these challenges were accepted, including that from Perrins to Tom Johnson. Perrins had already issued a general challenge, offering to fight any man in England for a prize of 500 guineas, having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham.|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that an {{approach}} characterised by either genetic or environmental determinism fails to adequately describe the contingencies involved in the evocation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviors in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

This argument is illustrated through a conceptual model for the development <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behaviour and recently gathered data on differences in the functions <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behavior in children with different genetic syndromes. The findings are further discussed in the context of a developmental systems model, in which neither the influence of genetic nor environmental contributions can be fully understood without taking account of the other. This expanded model may hold important implications for the understanding <b>of</b> <b>challenging</b> behavior...|$|R

By the end of July {{there were more than}} 200shipwrights at Skenesborough.

5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set <b>of</b> <b>challenges.</b> Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E
5|$|The match {{began as}} a scrappy affair, with plenty <b>of</b> <b>challenges</b> and little {{expansive}} football on show. The game's first notable chance went to Rooney, but Kolo Touré intervened and blocked his effort. Rooney then played in Giggs, whose shot was closed down by Sol Campbell. It took a while before Arsenal gained composure and played their usual passing game, and a move involving Edu and Fredrik Ljungberg in the 19th minute resulted in Rio Ferdinand carelessly tackling the latter. Ferdinand was not shown a card for his challenge – the first controversial decision referee Riley made during the match, which surprised Arsenal as the defender made a professional foul to prevent Ljungberg running clear on goal. Bergkamp exchanged passes with Reyes {{to open up the}} United defence, but the Dutchman's shot was saved by Roy Carroll. The United goalkeeper was on hand to save Henry's low shot three minutes before the break, after the striker was put through by Edu. During the first half action, both Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) were booked for fouling Reyes. Ashley Cole also received a yellow card for his tackle on Rooney. The Arsenal defender was {{on the receiving end of}} a challenge by Van Nistelrooy minutes after, as he attempted to shield the ball and hold on to possession. Television replays showed Van Nistelrooy ran his studs down Cole's shins, but the striker was not punished by Riley despite the action being in full view of his assistant at the touchline.|$|E
