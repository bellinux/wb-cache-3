5|$|The Convention delegates were {{a younger}} {{generation}} raised in the Second American Party System of Democrat Jefferson Davis and Whig Henry Clay. Unlike the three generation Convention of 1829–30, the delegates were primarily in their twenties and thirties at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers</b> in the professions and industry, without large land holdings, and without gentry family ties.|$|E
5|$|All six {{ships of}} the class spent the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers</b> abroad, primarily in Germany's colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific. Seeadler visited the United States in March 1893, along with the protected cruiser , for the belated celebrations for the 400th anniversary of Columbus's crossing of the Atlantic. In July of that year, while assigned to the East Asia Division, Bussard and Falke assisted in the suppression of Mata'afa Iosefo's revolt in Samoa, along with a British corvette. Throughout the 1890s, Seeadler was assigned to Germany's colonies in East Africa and Southwest Africa, where she suppressed local uprisings.|$|E

5|$|All six ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers,</b> primarily in Africa and the south Pacific, where they assissted in the suppression of uprisings such as the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Sokehs Rebellion in the Caroline Islands. Cormoran participated in the seizure of the Kiautschou Bay concession in China in 1897, and Falke {{was involved in the}} Venezuela Crisis of 1902–03. Bussard and Falke were broken up for scrap in 1912, but the remaining four ships were still in service following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|Before Wilhelm, the knuckleball was {{primarily}} mixed in to older pitchers' repertoires {{at the end}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers</b> to offset their slowing fastballs and to reduce stress on their arms, thereby extending their careers. Wilhelm broke with tradition when he began throwing the pitch as a teenager and threw it nearly every pitch. The New York Times linked his knuckleball with that of modern pitcher R.A. Dickey, as Wilhelm taught pitcher Charlie Hough the knuckleball in 1971, and Hough taught it to Dickey while coaching with the Texas Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Both Regina Margherita and Benedetto Brin {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} {{for the first few}} years <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers,</b> and participated in the peacetime routine of fleet training. Regina Margherita frequently served as the fleet flagship before the completion of the new s. On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the Italo-Turkish War. The two ships saw action during the war in the 3rd Division in the 2nd Squadron. Benedetto Brin took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Italian fleet {{for the first}} decade <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers.</b> They saw action in the Italo-Turkish War of 19111912, where they participated in the seizure of Cyrenaica in North Africa and operations in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. They were reduced to training ships by World War I, and both ships were lost with heavy death tolls during the conflict. Benedetto Brin exploded in Brindisi in September 1915, and Regina Margherita struck a mine and sank in December 1916.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the threat}} of American {{submarines}} and aircraft carriers, both Yamato and Musashi spent the majority <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers</b> in naval bases at Brunei, Truk, and Kure—deploying on several occasions in response to American raids on Japanese bases—before participating in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, as part of Admiral Kurita's Centre Force. Musashi was sunk during the battle by American carrier airplanes. Shinano was sunk ten days after her commissioning in November 1944 by the submarine , while Yamato was sunk by US naval air power in April 1945 during Operation Ten-Go.|$|E
5|$|Kahin {{helped develop}} Indonesian {{studies in the}} United States {{at a time when}} the {{majority}} of material on Indonesia was held at Leiden University in the Netherlands. At Cornell, he introduced a postgraduate education program for diplomats from around the world who were in the middle <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers.</b> He also helped many Indonesian intellectuals, including Deliar Noer and sociologist Selo Soemardjan, obtain education in the United States. Several of Kahin's students and associates, including Herbert Feith, went on to establish similar programs at the universities where they subsequently taught.|$|E

5|$|Other artists {{influenced}} by modernism included James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–49). Both trained in Glasgow, but spent most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers</b> {{in and around}} their respective native cities of Dundee and Montrose. Both were {{influenced by}} surrealism {{and the work of}} Bruegel. They focused on landscape, {{as can be seen in}} McIntosh Patrick's Traquair House (1938) and more overtly Baird's The Birth of Venus (1934). Before his success in painting, McIntosh Patrick gained a reputation as an etcher. Leading figures in the field in the inter-war period included William Wilson (1905–72) and Ian Fleming (1906–94).|$|E
5|$|Swing clarinetists such as Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman led {{successful}} big {{bands and}} smaller groups from the 1930s onward. Duke Ellington, active from the 1920s to the 1970s, used the clarinet as lead instrument in his works, with several {{players of the}} instrument (Barney Bigard, Jimmy Hamilton, and Russell Procope) spending a significant portion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers</b> in his orchestra. Harry Carney, primarily Ellington's baritone saxophonist, occasionally doubled on bass clarinet. Meanwhile, Pee Wee Russell had a long and successful career in small groups.|$|E
5|$|The 1954 {{season was}} a {{transitional}} {{one for the}} Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers.</b> Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight {{in a row and}} earned another shot at the championship, again against the Lions. This time, the Browns won 56–10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more. He announced his retirement after the game.|$|E

5|$|The Colbert {{class were}} {{a pair of}} armored frigates built for the French Navy during the 1870s. The ships served as the flagships of the {{commander}} and deputy commander of the Mediterranean Squadron for most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers.</b> The sister ships {{took part in the}} French conquest of Tunisia, notably shelling and landing troops in Sfax in 1881. They were relegated to second-line roles in 1894–95 before being condemned in 1900. The ships were finally sold for scrap in 1909.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} ships, Strassburg and Stralsund, {{remained}} with the High Seas Fleet {{for the duration}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers.</b> They saw action at the major engagements, including Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank, though neither ship was present at Jutland. Both ships survived the war; Strassburg was surrendered to Italy and renamed Taranto. She served through World War II and was sunk by Allied bombers in 1944. Stralsund became the French Mulhouse, though she served {{for only a few}} years and was withdrawn from service by 1925 and scrapped a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{remained}} in the Mediterranean until she was assigned the Grand Fleet in December 1914 and rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron. The other three ships remained with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron for most <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>careers</b> and {{did not participate in}} any of the early naval battles of the war. Natal was sunk by a magazine explosion near Cromarty on 30 December 1915, killing an estimated 390–421 persons on board. Most of her wreck was slowly salvaged over the decades until the remnants were demolished in the 1970s so they were no longer a hazard to navigation.|$|E
