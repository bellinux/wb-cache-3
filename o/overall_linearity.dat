40|$|Spiking neural {{networks}} (SNNs) are being explored {{in an attempt}} to mimic brain's capability to learn and recognize at low power. Crossbar architecture with highly scalable Resistive RAM or RRAM array serving as synaptic weights and neuronal drivers in the periphery is an attractive option for SNN. Recognition (akin to reading the synaptic weight) requires small amplitude bias applied across the RRAM to minimize conductance change. Learning (akin to writing or updating the synaptic weight) requires large amplitude bias pulses to produce a conductance change. The contradictory bias amplitude requirement to perform reading and writing simultaneously and asynchronously, akin to biology, is a major challenge. Solutions suggested in the literature rely on time-division-multiplexing of read and write operations based on clocks, or approximations ignoring the reading when coincidental with writing. In this work, we overcome this challenge and present a clock-less approach wherein reading and writing are performed in different frequency domains. This enables learning and recognition simultaneously on an SNN. We validate our scheme in SPICE circuit simulator by translating a two-layered feed-forward Iris classifying SNN to demonstrate software-equivalent performance.

Moreover, its readout plane can be finely segmented to perform Particle Flow reconstruction of jets at a future linear collider or high luminosity LHC experiment. For this application, sparks that would result from the potentially very large ionisation released in the gas during a shower can be avoided by means of resistive eletrodes. By slowing down the charge evacuation to ground through an RC-network, they allow a field reduction when the avalanche grows too large. While this mechanism efficiently quenches sparks, it might compromise the Micromegas intrinsic proportionality and the <b>overall</b> calorimeter response <b>linearity.</b> A study was conducted to determine the resistive configuration that best suppresses sparks and preserves proportionality. Several configurations were implemented on small prototypes, with a resistivity varying over five orders of magnitude. Charging of the resistive electrodes depends on the detector current, therefore the gain dependence on the rate and the dependence on the charge density (or dE/dx) were examined separately. Then, the spark quenching efficiency was assessed in a high intensity hadron beam used to generate showers that propagate through the prototypes.

40|$|To {{realize a}} {{passband}} gain whose accuracy remains stable over {{the lifetime of}} the part, so that the standard error of the measured data is consistent even as the gain itself is programmed between 0 − 20 dB, the LNA cannot assume an open-loop topology. Furthermore, we must augment a traditional passive outer feedback loop with an active inner feedback loop around the transistors that generate the open loop gain such that its sensitivity is significantly reduced. To realize this strategy, the topology of the LNA is adapted from [3] {{in the context of}} instrumentation amplifiers and shown in the figure below. LNA Architecture Under both 60 Co γ-ray and 50 -MeV H+ exposures, the DC gain is accurate to ± 0. 05 dB up to 1 Mrad), and the flatness of the passband gain (as measured by the 3 σ ripple), is preserved to within 0. 19 dB over the same range. This marked improvement over the- 18 % degradation in peak-β for the npn devices in this process highlights the efficacy of our feedback techniques. Similarly, the drop in the 3 -dB bandwidth at 1 Mrad TID is approximately- 15 % for both sources, confirming that the predominant TID damage mechanisms consist of interface states and oxide trapped charge; displacement damage is negligible. LNA TID Radiation Results The normalized SFDR as a function of dose for one of two cases where the undesirable harmonics are most pronounced (37. 4 mVp-p, 10 kHz input tone) is plotted in the figure to the left. More illuminating than the absolute distortion levels, on the order of 75 -dB (73 -dB) SFDR for the 1 kHz (10 kHz) input, is the lack of any declining trend up to 1 Mrad total dose, regardless of source.

However, direct analysis of the 13 C/ 12 C ratio in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool {{has proved to be}} difficult. Recently, several systems have been developed to measure isotope ratios in DOC by coupling a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. However these systems were designed for the analysis of fresh and marine water and no results for soil solutions or 13 C-enriched samples have been reported. Because we mainly deal with soil solutions in which the difficult to oxidize humic and fulvic acids are the predominant carbon-containing components, we preferred to use thermal catalytic oxidation to convert DOC into CO 2. We therefore coupled a high-temperature combustion TOC analyzer with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, by trapping and focusing the CO 2 cryogenically between the instruments. The analytical performance was tested by measuring solutions of compounds varying in the ease with which they can be oxidized. Samples with DOC concentrations between 1 and 100 mg C/L could be analyzed with good precision (standard deviation (SD) 0. 6), acceptable accuracy, good <b>linearity</b> (<b>overall</b> SD = 1) and without significant memory effects. In a 13 C-tracer experiment, we observed that mixing plant residues with soil caused a release of plant-derived DOC, which was degraded or sorbed during incubation.

This is proved on observations of point-like sources for which we obtain a best sensitivity (averaged over all valid detectors) of 40 and 14 mJy. s^ 1 / 2 for optimal weather conditions for the 1. 25 and 2. 14 mm arrays, respectively. NIKA observations of well known extended sources (DR 21 complex and the Horsehead nebula) are presented. This performance makes the NIKA camera a competitive astrophysical instrument...|$|E
40|$|As the {{resolution}} of electrical ADCs gets limited at higher sampling rates due to sampling clock jitter, low-jitter mode-lock laser based photonic ADCs are starting to gain more attention. As well as low-jitter and high-linearity operation at very high speeds, photonic ADCs provide the opportunity to de-multiplex electrical signals to enable the parallel sampling of signals which increases the total sampling speed dramatically. However, even in photonic systems, a careful optimization between the degree of de-multiplexing, the optical non-linearities and receiver front-end noise has to be performed to enable resolution and sampling rate gains to materialize. Electrical components still constitute the bottleneck for a photonic ADC system. Photo-detector front-end, {{which is responsible for}} the current-voltage transformation of the samples, {{is one of the most}} critical components for the <b>overall</b> <b>linearity,</b> noise and jitter performance of photonic ADC systems. This work focuses on photo-detector front-ends and investigates the performance of several structures as well as evaluating the performance of photonic ADC systems depending on the amount of photo-detector current. Integrator and trans-impedance amplifier flavors of the front-end circuits are designed, implemented, simulated and laid out for 6 ENOB and 10 ENOB linearity and noise performance at 1 GS/s. The circuits are implemented on 45 nm SOI process and integrated with on-chip photonic components which allow on-chip and off-chip ADC implementations. by Oğuzhan Uyar. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The bimodal {{diagnostic}} {{systems like}} ultrasound/scintigraphic ones {{have the benefit}} of providing both morphological and physiological information. In the case in which it intends to develop a compact bimodal probe it is important that, as the readout electronics are doubled, the acquisition system is the most compact possible. In this paper we present the characterization and preliminary measurements on a multi-channel readout ASIC for PSPMTs. The chip is equipped with 32 readout channels, as different works show that single channel readout allows to exploit the performances of a gamma detector, especially for linearity. Each single channel readout is composed by a variable capacitor CSA, a sample and a variable gain amplifier (VGA). The possibility to change the gain of the amplifier allows to compensate for the differences in gain of the anodes of the PSPMT, while the possibility of changing the integrator capacitor allows to adapt the input dynamic of the chip depending on the PMT used (BA or SBA photocatode) and on the scintillation crystal coupled to the PMT itself. The preliminary measurements show that a 200 kHz maximum sampling rate is achievable, with 1 V input dynamic and an <b>overall</b> <b>linearity</b> of the whole channel with respect to the input charge impulse of than 2 %. To validate the performances of the ASIC different operative measurement was made in two configurations: with a single chip and two R 11265 -M 16 PMTs, and, parallelizing two chips with a single PMT H 8500. The tubes were coupled with scintillation crystals with different response speeds, from CsI to LaBr 3. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Latest {{standards}} for wireless communications {{have resorted to}} the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique to reduce channelimpairments. Multipath fading and intersymbol interference (ISI) can belimited {{with the use of}} multiple orthogonal sub-carriers. Nevertheless this OFDM signal exhibits large instantaneous signal amplitudes comparedto its average values. This compels the use of linear amplifiers working with several dB in backoff from their 1 dB compression point (P 1 dB). In this way, the entire OFDM signal is amplified linearly; however at thecost of a very poor efficiency. This increases the energy consumption and reduces the battery life of mobile terminals. Hence, providing linearamplification with high efficiency {{has become one of the}} major challenges for current RF amplifier design for wireless communications. Several techniques are under research to tackle this problem. These techniques can be classified as efficiency and linearity oriented techniques. Predistortion, feedforward and feedback techniques are examples of the first sort of techniques, which mainly correct the inherent distortionof the amplifier by providing an inversion function of the amplifier orby comparison with the original input signal. Examples of the second type of technique are dynamic biasing, dynamic load and Envelope Elimination and Restoration (EER), which basically vary the bias or load of the amplifier according to the input signal. This thesis has focused on Doherty amplifiers (dynamic load technique) and high efficiency class-E amplifiers (main amplifier in EER) applied to WiMAX application at 3. 5 GHz. In the design process of these amplifiers, the concept of equivalent capacitance is introduced and applied successfully. Measurements of the designed Doherty amplifier confirm the potential benefits of this technique in terms of <b>overall</b> efficiency and <b>linearity</b> in comparison with legacy class-AB amplifier. Nonetheless, this design task is not possible without a reliable and sturdy device model. Hence, the task of constructing a non-linear model for a GaAs HEMT device was undertaken in this thesis, which gave satisfactory outcomes. The conjunction of this reliable model with the equivalent capacitance concept has made possible the contemporization of aged techniques to face the stringent requirements of modern wireless communications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Wireless {{communication}} systems are moving towards a heterogeneous solution, where small-cell base stations such as pico-cells and femto-cells are used concurrently with macro- cell base stations in high data traffic areas. Small-cell networks {{are expected to}} provide much larger wireless data rates and capacity in small areas while only consuming {{a fraction of the}} power. However, power amplifier nonlinearity does not scale down with the size of the base station; a similar degree of nonlinearity correction is required in both small-cell and macro-cell base stations, meaning that the power consumed by the signal linearization circuits is the same. An analog-radio frequency pre-distortion (ARF-PD) solution, operating at a fraction of a conventional digital pre-distortion's power consumption, has been proposed to support the unrestrained growth of wireless communication. This thesis forms part of an ongoing research project aimed at developing a fully integrated ARF-PD solution - a promising, low-power alternative to digital pre-distortion for future wireless communications. Specifically, it focuses on delivering an integrated design of a low-power high-linearity broadband radio frequency (RF) vector multiplier, which can be used as part of the ARF-PD solution. An RF vector multiplier {{is considered one of the}} major function blocks in analog pre-distortion solutions, as it allows the analog pre-distorter to interface with the undistorted signal in the RF domain. In the thesis, two RF vector multiplier designs are proposed and implemented in integrated circuits. In the first implementation, the RF vector multiplier is designed to directly apply pre-distortion to the RF signal. This architecture imposes a need for high gain in the RF vector multiplier, which results in large transistor size and high power consumption in the output stage. The design is able to achieve promising simulation results, however, performance limitations and disadvantages are also clearly exposed compared to commercial products. To resolve the issues discovered, an alternative ARF-PD architecture is adopted to relax the output power level needed from the RF vector multiplier. In addition, a self-linearized variable gain amplifier topology is proposed to improve system <b>linearity.</b> <b>Overall,</b> the second design shows significant improvement in bandwidth, linearity and output noise level, while only consuming half of the power consumed by the first design. Ultimately, simulation results have shown satisfying performance for both RF vector multipliers as part of an ARF-PD system. However, both of the proposed integrated circuit designs should be validated by measurement...|$|R

The Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment {{is designed to}} directly detect elastic scatters of weakly-interacting massive dark matter particles (WIMPs), on target nuclei in semiconductor crystals composed of Si and Ge. These scatters would occur very rarely, in an overwhelming background composed primarily of electron recoils from photons and electrons, {{as well as a}} smaller but non-negligible background of WIMP-like nuclear recoils from neutrons. The CDMS~II generation of detectors simultaneously measure ionization and athermal phonon signals from each scatter, allowing discrimination against virtually all electron recoils in the detector bulk. Pulse-shape timing analysis allows discrimination against nearly all remaining electron recoils taking place near detector surfaces. Along with carefully limited neutron backgrounds, this experimental program allowed for ``background-free'' operation of CDMS~II at Soudan, with less than one background event expected in each WIMP-search analysis. As a result, exclusionary upper-limits on WIMP-nucleon interaction cross section were placed over a wide range of candidate WIMP masses, ruling out large new regions of parameter space. These results, like any others, are subject to a variety of systematic effects that may alter their final interpretations. A primary focus of this dissertation will be difficulties in precisely calibrating the energy scale for nuclear recoil events like those from WIMPs. Nuclear recoils have suppressed ionization signals relative to electron recoils of the same recoil energy, so the response of the detectors is calibrated differently for each recoil type. The <b>overall</b> normalization and <b>linearity</b> of the energy scale for electron recoils in CDMS~II detectors is clearly established by peaks of known gamma energy in the ionization spectrum of calibration data from a $^{ 133 }$Ba source. This electron-equivalent (keV$_mathrm{ee}$) energy scale enables calibration of the total phonon signal (keV$_mathrm{t}$) by enforcing unity yield for electron recoils, in aggregate. Subtracting an event's Luke phonon contribution from its calibrated total phonon energy (keV$_mathrm{t}$), as measured by the ionization signal, results in a valid measure of the true recoil energy (keV$_mathrm{r}$) for both electron and nuclear recoils. I discuss systematic uncertainties affecting the reconstruction of this recoil energy, the primary analysis variable, and use several methods to constrain their magnitude. I present the resulting adjusted WIMP limits and discuss their impact in the context of current and projected constraints on the parameter space for WIMP interactions...|$|R
