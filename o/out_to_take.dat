5|$|New York was {{eventually}} captured, but Newport, Rhode Island {{in the hands}} of the Americans posed a threat as a base for recapturing New York, so in November 1776 a fleet, which included Lord Sandwich 2 carrying Hessian Troops, set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Rhode Island, which was taken but not subdued, and Lord Sandwich 2 was needed as a prison ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} the three {{companies}} of 4-503 were chosen to set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Because of intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach the beleaguered battalion. On the afternoon of 21 November both battalions moved <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the crest. During fierce, close-quarters fighting, some of the paratroopers {{made it into the}} PAVN trench line but were ordered to pull back as darkness fell.|$|E
5|$|Unusually in Japan, where photographers tend to join or form groups, Kikai {{has never}} been in any group, preferring to work by himself. When not setting <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> photographs, Kikai does not carry a camera with him. He leaves photographing his own family to his wife Noriko, and it is she who has the camera if they go on a trip together.|$|E

5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{military}} importance of Jersey, the British government had ordered that the island be heavily fortified. On 6 January 1781, a French invasion force of 2,000 men set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the island, but {{only half of the}} force arrived and landed. The Battle of Jersey lasted about half an hour, with Britain successfully defending the island. There were about thirty casualties on each side, and the British took 600 French prisoners whom were subsequently sent to England. Both British and French commanders were slain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{unsuccessful}} conference in Persia, Tiribazus returned to Susa to report on events, and a new general, Struthas, was sent <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> command. Struthas pursued an anti-Spartan policy, prompting the Spartans to order their commander in the region, Thibron, to attack him. Thibron successfully ravaged Persian territory for a time, but was killed along with a number of his men when Struthas ambushed one of his poorly organized raiding parties. Thibron was later replaced by Diphridas, who raided more successfully, securing a number of small successes and even capturing Struthas's son-in-law, but never achieved any dramatic results.|$|E

5|$|On 30 October, Nani {{scored a}} {{controversial}} second goal as United beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 at home. He scored {{into an empty}} net after Tottenham goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes rolled the ball <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a free-kick he thought had been given for handball; however, play was allowed to go on as referee Mark Clattenburg did not blow his whistle. On 27 November, Nani scored United's fifth goal in a 7–1 home win over Blackburn Rovers. Nani netted his first goal of 2011 as he scored the winning strike in a 2–1 home victory over Stoke City on 4 January.|$|E
5|$|Though he sympahtized {{with the}} PAN during his early life, Buendía later lost {{interest}} in the party. His mother {{died of natural causes}} on 21 June 1941, and Buendía returned to Zitácuaro. After a few years, he was awarded a scholarship at Instituto Patria, a Jesuit high school in Mexico City. Upon graduation he attended the Escuela Libre de Derecho, a private Law school in Mexico City, but dropped <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of his family following {{the death of his father}} in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The communists moved <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Plain of Jars {{again in}} 1967. Laotian {{victories}} were {{few and far}} between {{and by the end of}} the year the situation had become critical, even with the support provided by the American and Laotian Air Forces. PAVN, having a complete understanding of the American military system, began to attack TACAN facilities. U.S. intelligence indicated that between December 1967 and August 1968, the combined strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces increased from about 51,000 to over 110,000. The PAVN contingent comprised an estimated 34,000 combat troops, 6,000 advisors, and 18,000 support troops. On 6 December Lima Site 44 was overrun and on the 25th PAVN forces captured Lima Site 61, the site of a mobile facility. All of these attacks were part of a coordinated effort to reduce the ability of the Americans to strike the communist logistical system during the Tet Offensive.|$|E

25|$|English Electric Canberra squadrons {{were present}} during the mid-1950s when Westonzoyland {{was used as}} a work-up station prior to {{overseas}} assignments. By 1958 the station was once more deserted of aircraft and, although retained by the Air Ministry for another ten years, it never reopened for military flying. Some of these Canberras flew <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Australia <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the British atomic tests at Maralinga.|$|R

5|$|Yardley {{continued}} to make progress in his batting in 1937. For Cambridge, he scored fifties against the Army and Surrey. Against Hampshire he took four for 47 and five for 41, and when Cambridge collapsed to 35 for six chasing a victory target of 141, he scored 64 not <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the side to a win. Playing Sussex, he scored a century and took four for 36, while in the University match, he scored 101 in {{two and a half}} hours. Yardley's form saw him selected for the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, although he scored only 7 and 4, and when he joined Yorkshire after the Cambridge season, he made his first century for the county against Surrey, as well as three other fifties. His overall first-class figures were 1,472 runs at an average of 33.45 and 31 wickets at an average of 21.87. He was picked for the winter MCC tour of India, under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson, where he scored 519 runs at an average 25.95 but only took one wicket. No official Tests were played on the tour, but Yardley played in the representative matches which took place, scoring 96 in the first game, but his highest score in four other innings was 31.|$|E
5|$|Kilner made a {{good start}} to 1912 for Yorkshire Second XI, scoring centuries in two {{consecutive}} games; in the second he also took twelve wickets for 75 runs. These performances, coupled with continued good form for Harrogate, led to Kilner's recall to the Yorkshire first team in June. He replaced the injured all-rounder George Hirst for a match against Nottinghamshire. On the first morning, Kilner {{was used as the}} sixth bowler and proved successful; he finished with four wickets for 66 runs. Although failing to score in the first innings, he came in to bat in the second innings with Yorkshire 133 for four, needing 249 for victory. He shared a partnership of 113 for the fifth wicket and scored 83 not <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Yorkshire to a five wicket win. This performance kept Kilner in the team {{for the remainder of the}} season, even after Hirst's return. He played 23 times for Yorkshire. He scored 570 runs at an average of 22.80 and took 16 wickets at an average of 22.12, figures regarded as respectable for a first full season. Yorkshire won the County Championship that season. Apart from one game in the 1913 season, he ceased playing for Harrogate. In his years there, he scored 967 runs, averaging 38.68, and took 71 wickets at an average of less than ten runs per wicket.|$|E
