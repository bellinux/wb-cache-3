500|$|Little {{damage was}} caused by the raid on Yawata. On 18June a USAAF Fourteenth Air Force {{aircraft}} overflew the city and photographed the target area. These photos showed that only a single bomb had landed within the Imperial Iron and Steel Works complex, and it had hit a power house [...] from the nearest coke <b>oven.</b> <b>Light</b> damage had also been inflicted on Kokura Arsenal and other industrial and civilian buildings in the area. Despite a USAAF policy of encouraging factual reportage of B-29 operations, the raid's results were overstated in the U.S. media. The light combat losses suffered by the raiders and electronic intelligence collected by the B-29s revealed the ineffectiveness of Japanese radar and air defenses. As a result, the USAAF dispatched a single photo reconnaissance B-29 to overfly much of Japan and Korea on 21June. This sortie was successful, and greatly improved U.S. intelligence holdings on these areas.|$|E

The final result is a relatively <b>light</b> <b>oven</b> in which a stable temperature can be realized very quickly. Since less dead mass (insulating material) is heated, also considerable energy savings can be realized.

40|$|Microwave-generating {{magnetrons}} impact {{our life}} {{through a variety}} of ways: they are used in microwave <b>ovens,</b> <b>lighting</b> systems, radar systems and even electronic warfare or solar energy transfer systems. However, magnetrons are relatively low-power devices. The ability to synchronize multiple magnetrons to achieve higher total power output would increase the usefulness of magnetrons. It is impossible for most current magnetrons to achieve this ability because they use thermionic emissions, which is the emission of electrons by heating up a central cathode filament. That method is chaotic and unstable. Our solution is using gated field emission to inject electrons directly into the magnetron 2 ̆ 7 s interaction space. This research explores the hypothesis that a phase-controllable magnetron system, which could be used in a magnetron array, can be created using gated field emission devices modulated at the correct frequency. In the past few months, I was involved in setting up the experiment. Such as testing current monitors, and writing a program for driver circuits through LabView. Our research on developing a phase-controlled magnetron would permit the construction of magnetron arrays to generate high-powered microwaves. This will give rise to advancements in the fields of weather detection, clean energy, and warfare...|$|R

30|$|The {{environment}} {{within each}} plot was characterized during the 2009 growing season by its soil chemical and physical properties, stand basal area, light availability in the understory, and leaf litter biomass. Detailed {{methods and results}} of these measurements are presented in a previous article (Boothroyd-Roberts et al. 2013). Briefly, we collected five soil samples distributed systematically within each plot for chemical analysis, which were then combined into one composite. Samples {{were taken from the}} mineral soil at a depth of between 5  cm and 10  cm, corresponding to the principal rooting zone of herbaceous plants. We measured pH in a soil-water suspension. The available potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) contents were determined through extraction with BaCl 2 and detection by atomic absorption. The extractable phosphorus (P) content was measured using the Bray- 2 method (Bray and Kurtz 1945) (modified by F. Lambert). The total nitrogen (N) and total carbon (C) were measured using dry combustion, high-temperature reduction of the combustion products, and thermo-conductometric detection. Soil moisture at a depth of 10  cm was sampled twice, in June and August, corresponding to dry periods with no significant rainfall events in the 48  hours prior, and measured gravimetrically after <b>oven</b> drying. <b>Light</b> availability at a height of 90  cm was measured using a digital hemispheric photograph, taken at the centre of the plot, to determine canopy openness and the average light received during the growing season. Leaf litter was collected after almost all the leaves had fallen from every tree from a 50  cm[*]×[*] 50  cm microplot and was subsequently dried and weighed.|$|R
50|$|Dylan's health {{continues}} to destabilize, as he becomes increasingly paranoid {{about going to}} sleep and fears Freddy Krueger even though Heather has never shown him her films. She visits Wes Craven, who suggests that Freddy is a supernatural entity drawn to his films, freed after the film series halted following the release of Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, and now focuses on Heather, as Nancy, as its primary foe. Robert Englund also has a strange knowledge of it, describing the new Freddy to Heather, only shortly after disappearing from all contact. After another earthquake, Heather takes a traumatized Dylan to the hospital, where the head nurse, suspecting abuse, suggests Dylan stay for observation. Heather returns home for Dylan's stuffed dinosaur while his babysitter Julie tries to keep the nurses from sedating the sleep-deprived boy. Dylan falls asleep after the nurses sedate him, and Freddy brutally kills Julie in Dylan's dream. Capable of sleepwalking, Dylan leaves the hospital of his own accord while Heather chases him home across the interstate as Freddy taunts him and dangles him before traffic. Upon returning home, Heather realizes that John has established his persona as Don Thompson. Upon Heather's compliance in embracing Nancy's role, Freddy emerges completely into reality and takes Dylan to his world. Heather finds a trail of his sleeping pills and follows him to a dark underworld. Freddy fights off Heather and chases Dylan into an oven. Dylan escapes the oven, doubles back to Heather, and together they push Freddy into the <b>oven</b> and <b>light</b> it. This destroys the monster and his reality altogether.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{age at which}} House Fly Larvae (HFL) is {{harvested}} and method of drying the larvae, on its proximate values were studied. Larvae were harvested on three different days representing three different ages and the harvested larvae were dried using both <b>oven</b> and sun <b>light.</b> Results revealed that protein content of HFL processed into meal after drying significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced as the age of larvae increased from 55. 4 % on 2 day old, through 50. 2 % on three-day old, to 47. 1 % on four day old. On the other hand, fat content increased with increase in age of HFL, from 20. 8 % at age of 2 days, through 22. 2 % at age of 3 days to 25. 3 % {{at the age of}} 4 days. Fibre content minimally increased with age. Oven-dried maggots had mean higher protein content (50. 9 %) and less fat (22. 8 %) than sun dried maggots (47 and 26. 4 % respectively). Therefore, for maximum protein yield, HFL should be harvested at 2 days old. However, where maggot fat is needed in a diet, increased biomass and or ease of harvesting, processing at later age (4 days old) became desirable. Oven-drying is recommended for superior protein and in rainy season, while sun drying produced higher fat and was cheaper...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{potential}} for (final and primary) energy and CO 2 emission reductions and cost effectiveness of replacing existing household electric appliances and light bulbs with most popular or most energy efficient appliances in a multifamily {{apartment building in}} Växjö city is studied. The results showed that there is significant potential to reduce electricity demand and thereby to reduce primary energy use and CO 2 emissions. The greatest potential lies with replacing existing incandescent bulbs with LED bulbs, while the lowest savings seem to be with replacement of microwave ovens. Assuming that reduced electricity demand reduces electricity generation in coal-based steam turbine (CST) technology, annually about 63 MWh of primary energy and 25 ton CO 2 emissions could be reduced from the investigated building if the existing refrigerator/freezer, stove/oven, microwave <b>oven,</b> televisions and <b>light</b> bulbs are replaced with the most energy efficient alternatives available in the market today. Also, the results from ‚discounted payback period‛ and ‚cost of conserved energy‛ analyses also showed that it is cost-effective to install the most energy efficient appliances. This study for a single building is based on limited number of interviews, selected appliance types, and number of assumptions about marginal electricity production systems. To generalize the results more such studies in different conditions with measurement of actual energy use of all the household appliances should be conducted, which would help to fully understand the potential of primary energy savings and CO 2 emission reductions in Swedish apartment buildings...|$|R
