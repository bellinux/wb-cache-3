25|$|In the {{original}} 1971 Molten Salt Breeder Reactor proposal, uranium reprocessing was scheduled every ten days {{as part of}} reactor operation. Subsequently, a <b>once-through</b> fueling design was proposed that limited uranium reprocessing to every thirty years {{at the end of}} useful salt life. A mixture of uranium-238 was called for to make sure recovered uranium would not be weapons grade. This design is referred to as denatured molten salt reactor. If reprocessing were to be prohibited then the uranium would be disposed with other fission products.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{reduces the}} volume of high-level waste, but by itself does not reduce radioactivity or heat generation and therefore does not {{eliminate the need for}} a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), and because of its high cost compared to the <b>once-through</b> fuel cycle. Several different methods for reprocessing been tried, but many have had safety and practicality problems which have led to their discontinuation.|$|E

Notably, they have no high pressures or flammable components in the core. The prototype was the MSRE, which also used the Thorium fuel cycle. As a breeder reactor type, it reprocesses the spent fuel, extracting both Uranium and transuranics, leaving only 0.1% of transuranic waste compared to conventional <b>once-through</b> uranium-fueled light water reactors currently in use. A separate issue is the radioactive fission products, which are not reprocessable {{and need to be}} disposed of as with conventional reactors.|$|E

25|$|Water is {{also used}} in many large scale {{industrial}} processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is generated on site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal grey water. Industrial consumption of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial grey water to be treated {{and returned to the}} environment. Thermoelectric powerplants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the cooling process. The withdrawal, however, is lower than in <b>once-through</b> cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{unveiled}} the , an online tool that estimates {{the full cost}} of electricity produced by three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle. Two years in the making, this interactive calculator is the first generally accessible model to provide a nuanced look at the economic costs of nuclear power; it lets users test how sensitive the price of electricity is to a full range of components—more than 60 parameters that can be adjusted for the three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle considered by this tool (<b>once-through,</b> limited-recycle, full-recycle). Users can select the fuel cycle they would like to examine, change cost estimates for each component of that cycle, and even choose uncertainty ranges for the cost of particular components. This approach allows users around the world to compare the cost of different nuclear power approaches in a sophisticated way, while taking account of prices relevant to their own countries or regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} group Riverkeeper {{took note of}} the long-overdue renewal of the plant's discharge permit from the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In common with Roseton and Indian Point Energy Center, its use of <b>once-through</b> cooling, in which river water was pumped in, used to cool the plant, then pumped out warm, dated to the 1950s and was responsible for large fish kills in the river. A state judge had voided the permit, but it was reversed on appeal. After DEC rebuffed Riverkeeper's effort to force it to accelerate the process, and ruled that closed-cycle cooling, the {{environmental group}}'s preferred alternative, was not feasible at Danskammer, Riverkeeper filed suit against DEC and Dynegy alleging violations of state administrative-procedure law in issuing the new permit. They alleged that DEC had accepted Dynegy's argument that it didn't have space to install closed-cycle cooling despite the company owning large tracts of adjacent vacant land, {{and that it had}} allowed Dynegy to account for its water withdrawals in an unrealistic fashion. Dynegy says there are cheaper alternatives to the cooling towers a closed-cycle system would require.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{does not}} reduce {{the volume of}} high-level waste, it separates out the useful isotopes leaving an increased volume of liquid high-level waste {{as a result of}} the solution-based chemical processes used to dissolve fuel rods and extract useful isotopes. It does reduce total radioactivity of the total waste, however the overall volume of the waste is higher and it does not eliminate waste nor heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), the environmental risks of the aqueous and organic waste streams, and because of its high cost compared to the <b>once-through</b> fuel cycle. In the United States, the Obama administration stepped back from President Bush's plans for commercial-scale reprocessing and reverted to a program focused on reprocessing-related scientific research. Nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in Europe, Russia and Japan.|$|E
25|$|If {{that same}} plant had no cooling tower and used <b>once-through</b> cooling water, {{it would require}} about 100,000 cubic metres an hour A large cooling water intake {{typically}} kills millions of fish and larvae annually, as the organisms are impinged on the intake screens. A large amount of water {{would have to be}} continuously returned to the ocean, lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant. Furthermore, discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem. Elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms (see thermal pollution), or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae. A cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water. Evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes (other than rain somewhere), whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used.|$|E

500|$|Weinberg {{was fired}} by the Nixon {{administration}} from ORNL in 1973 after 18 years as the laboratory's director, because he continued to advocate increased nuclear safety and molten salt reactors (MSRs), instead of the Administration's chosen Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) that the AEC's Director of Reactor Division, Milton Shaw, was appointed to develop. Weinberg's firing effectively halted development of the MSR, as it was virtually unknown by other nuclear laboratories and specialists. There was a brief revival of MSR research at ORNL {{as part of the}} Carter administration's nonproliferation interests, culminating in ORNL-TM-7207, [...] "Conceptual Design Characteristics of a Denatured Molten-Salt Reactor with <b>Once-Through</b> Fueling", by Engel, et al., which is still {{considered by many to be}} the [...] "reference design" [...] for commercial molten salt reactors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{very high}} {{temperature}} reactor concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a <b>once-through</b> uranium fuel cycle, using helium or molten salt as the coolant. This reactor design envisions an outlet temperature of 1,000°C. The reactor core {{can be either}} a prismatic-block or a pebble bed reactor design. The high temperatures enable applications such as process heat or hydrogen production via the thermochemical iodine-sulfur process. [...] It would also be passively safe.|$|E
2500|$|MSRs, {{especially}} those with the fuel dissolved in the salt differ considerably from conventional reactors. Reactor core pressure can be low and the temperature much higher. In this respect an MSR is more similar to a liquid metal cooled reactor than to a conventional light water cooled reactor. [...] MSRs are often planned as breeding reactors with a closed fuel cycle – {{as opposed to the}} <b>once-through</b> fuel currently used in U.S. nuclear reactors.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, the {{engineering}} technology division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory published a paper entitled [...] "Conceptual Design Characteristics of a Denatured Molten-Salt Reactor with <b>Once-Through</b> Fueling." [...] In it, the authors [...] "examine the conceptual feasibility of a molten-salt power reactor fueled with denatured uranium-235 (i.e. with low-enriched uranium) and operated {{with a minimum}} of chemical processing." [...] The main priority behind the design characteristics is proliferation resistance. Lessons learned from past projects and research at ORNL were considered. Although the DMSR can theoretically be fueled partially by thorium or plutonium, fueling solely with low enriched uranium (LEU) helps maximize proliferation resistance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{supercritical}} water reactor (SCWR) is {{a reduced}} moderation water reactor concept that, {{due to the}} average speed of the neutrons that would cause the fission events within the fuel being faster than thermal neutrons, it is more accurately termed an epithermal reactor than a thermal reactor. It uses supercritical water as the working fluid. [...] SCWRs are basically light water reactors (LWR) operating at higher pressure and temperatures with a direct, <b>once-through</b> heat exchange cycle. As most commonly envisioned, it would operate on a direct cycle, much like a boiling water reactor (BWR), but since it uses supercritical water (not {{to be confused with}} critical mass) as the working fluid, it would have only one water phase present, which makes the supercritical heat exchange method more similar to a pressurized water reactor (PWR). [...] It could operate at much higher temperatures than both current PWRs and BWRs.|$|E
2500|$|The World Nuclear Association has {{reported}} that nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999. Several previous international studies and assessments, suggested {{that as part of}} the portfolio of other low-carbon energy technologies, nuclear power will continue {{to play a role in}} reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Historically, nuclear power usage is estimated to have prevented the atmospheric emission of 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent as of 2013. Public concerns about nuclear power include the fate of spent nuclear fuel, nuclear accidents, security risks, nuclear proliferation, and a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive. Of these concerns, nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive fuel/"waste" [...] have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide. Although generally unaware of it, both of these glaring public concerns are greatly diminished by present passive safety designs, the experimentally proven, [...] "melt-down proof" [...] EBR-II, future molten salt reactors, and the use of conventional and more advanced fuel/"waste" [...] pyroprocessing, with the latter recycling or reprocessing not presently being commonplace as it is often considered to be cheaper to use a <b>once-through</b> nuclear fuel cycle in many countries, depending on the varying levels of intrinsic value given by a society in reducing the long-lived waste in their country, with France doing a considerable amount of reprocessing when compared to the US.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{long-lived}} waste. LFTRs can dramatically {{reduce the}} long-term radiotoxicity of their reactor wastes. Light water reactors with uranium fuel have fuel {{that is more}} than 95% U-238. These reactors normally transmute part of the U-238 to Pu-239, a long-lived isotope. Almost all of the fuel is therefore only one step away from becoming a transuranic long-lived element. Plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,000 years, and is the most common transuranic in spent nuclear fuel from light water reactors. Transuranics like Pu-239 cause the perception that reactor wastes are an eternal problem. In contrast, the LFTR uses the thorium fuel cycle, which transmutes thorium to U-233. Because thorium is a lighter element, more neutron captures are required to produce the transuranic elements. U-233 has two chances to fission in a LFTR. First as U-233 (90% will fission) and then the remaining 10% has another chance as it transmutes to U-235 (80% will fission). The fraction of fuel reaching neptunium-237, the most likely transuranic element, is therefore only 2%, about 15kg perGWe-year. This is a transuranic production 20x smaller than light water reactors, which produce 300kg of transuranics per GWe-year. Importantly, because of this much smaller transuranic production, {{it is much easier to}} recycle the transuranics. That is, they are sent back to the core to eventually fission. Reactors operating on the U238-plutonium fuel cycle produce far more transuranics, making full recycle difficult on both reactor neutronics and the recycling system. In the LFTR, only a fraction of a percent, as reprocessing losses, goes to the final waste. When these two benefits of lower transuranic production, and recycling, are combined, a thorium fuel cycle reduces the production of transuranic wastes by more than a thousand-fold compared to a conventional <b>once-through</b> uranium-fueled light water reactor. The only significant long-lived waste is the uranium fuel itself, but this can be used indefinitely by recycling, always generating electricity.If the thorium stage ever has to be shut down, part of the reactors can be shut down and their uranium fuel inventory burned out in the remaining reactors, allowing a burndown of even this final waste to as small a level as society demands. The LFTR does still produce radioactive fission products in its waste, but they don't last very long - the radiotoxicity of these fission products is dominated by cesium-137 and strontium-90. The longer half-life is cesium: 30.17 years. So, after 30.17 years, decay reduces the radioactivity by a half. Ten half-lives will reduce the radioactivity by two raised to a power of ten, a factor of 1,024. Fission products at that point, in about 300 years, are less radioactive than natural uranium. What's more, the liquid state of the fuel material allows separation of the fission products not only from the fuel, but from each other as well, which enables them to be sorted by the length of each fission product's half-life, so that the ones with shorter half-lives can be brought out of storage sooner than those with longer half-lives.|$|E
