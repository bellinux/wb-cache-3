40|$|Strip loins from steers with genotypes {{containing}} zero, one, or {{two copies}} of the inactive myostatin mutation (IM) (n = 20, 22, and 16, respectively) were obtained. Loins were cut into 1 -inch steaks where total number <b>of</b> <b>steaks</b> and total numbers <b>of</b> <b>steaks</b> with gluteus medius (often called vein steaks) were noted. Loins from zero copy cattle had a higher total number <b>of</b> <b>steaks,</b> but no difference in proportion <b>of</b> <b>steaks,</b> both with and without the gluteus medius compared to one and two copy cattle.

Strip loins from heterozygous dominant heifershad a greater number <b>of</b> non-vein <b>steaks</b> and decreased percentage <b>of</b> vein <b>steaks</b> compared to homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive samples.

25|$|When Genghis Khan's {{grandson}} Kublai Khan (1215–1294) invaded Moscow, {{he and his}} warriors introduced minced horsemeat to the Muscovites. This {{was later}} called steak tartare. The city states {{of what is now}} Germany took to this ground meat product and created many of their own dishes by adding capers, onions and even caviar to the blend and selling it on the streets. It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared. While not providing a clear name, the first description <b>of</b> <b>steak</b> tartare was given by Jules Verne in 1875 in his novel Michael Strogoff. There are certain similarities between steak tartare and the German dishes Labskaus and Mett. Other similar raw, chopped meats appeared in the 20th century, such as the Italian carpaccio, which itself was invented in 1930 at Harry's Bar in Venice. Similarly, one of the oldest references to a Hamburgh Sausage appeared in 1763 in the cookbook entitled Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy by Hannah Glasse (1708–1770). Hamburgh Sausage is made with minced meat and a variety of spices, including nutmeg, cloves, black pepper, garlic, and salt, and is typically served with toast. A wide variety of traditional European dishes are also made with minced meat, such as meatloaf, the Serbian pljeskavica, the Arab kofta, and meatballs.|$|E

40|$|Steaks from {{cows are}} tougher {{than those from}} young steers and heifers. This {{difference}} is often attributed to the increased cross-linkage of collagen in muscle of mature animals that is considered very stable and more resistant to postmortem degradation. Aging steaks from young steers and heifers is a common postmortem practice used to improve tenderness <b>of</b> <b>steaks</b> from the ribeye roll and strip loin. Improvement in tenderness because of aging {{has been attributed to}} enzymatic degradation of, primarily, the myofibrillar fraction of muscle and is most beneficial for low connective tissue muscles. Because muscles from mature cows have more collagen cross-linking, postmortem tenderization methods, such as blade tenderization and enzymatic tenderization, are often used to increase tenderness <b>of</b> <b>steaks</b> from mature cows. However, few studies have investigated the effect of aging on tenderness <b>of</b> longissimus muscle <b>steaks</b> from fed mature cows. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine effects of aging on tenderness <b>of</b> longissimus <b>steaks</b> <b>of</b> fed mature cows from different management strategies...|$|R

During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy.

500|$|In the 1968 season, the Jets, Raiders, San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs {{established}} {{themselves as}} the leading teams. Going into Week 11 of the AFL season, each team had lost only two games; the Chiefs, {{who had not yet}} had a bye week, had eight wins, the others seven. In an era with no wild card teams, the Raiders needed a victory over the Jets in Week 11 to avoid falling a game and a half behind the Chiefs in the AFL West – finishing second, however good their record, would end their season. The Jets, on the other hand, would clinch at least a tie for the AFL East title with a victory over the Raiders in their only regular season meeting. Depending on the results of other games, the Jets could win the division if they beat the Raiders, gaining the right to host the AFL Championship Game, the winner of which would play the NFL champion in the Super Bowl. The ill-feeling of previous years was resurrected by an immense blown-up photograph, posted at Raider headquarters, of Davidson smashing Namath in the head.
