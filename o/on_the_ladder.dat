5|$|The Roar {{missed the}} finals {{in the first}} two A-League seasons, {{finishing}} sixth in 2005–06 and fifth in 2006–07 on goal difference to Sydney FC, who finished fourth. In the 2007–08 season the roar finished in 4th placed in the regular season and 3rd place after the finals series, and in 2008–09 the team finished 3rd <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> but again were eliminated in the finals, finishing 3rd. The Roar would suffer their worst season to date in 2009–10, finishing 2nd last <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> of 10 teams. This would all change a season later, where the Roar would do the double by winning both the premiership and championship, topping the cake with an Australian sporting record of 28 unbeaten games {{at the end of the}} season, which continued into the 2011–12 A-League season, ending at 36 games. The record was brought to an end by Sydney FC on a wet and windy afternoon in Sydney's west by 2 goals to nil.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted to climb a ladder while he pinned Neville under the ladder, but Neville used his legs to push the ladder over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off the ropes to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used the ropes to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder. Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb the ladder to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E
5|$|Selwood and Geelong {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 19-3 win-loss record to qualify for the finals series in second position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> Following consecutive wins against Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final and West Coast in the Preliminary Final, Geelong progressed through to the Grand Final against Collingwood. Selwood's performance in the final, during which he gathered a team-high 28disposals, laid 7tackles, and kicked 2goals, were recognised as he placed runner-up in Norm Smith Medal voting for the adjudicated best afield player. Geelong defeated Collingwood to record a 38point victory and earn Selwood his third premiership medallion in five seasons.|$|E

50|$|Swan Districts {{finished}} seventh <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WANFL <b>ladder</b> winning {{seven out}} of 21 games in their debut season in 1934. The presence of established WANFL players like inaugural captain-coach “Judda” Bee from East Fremantle and Fred Sweetapple from West Perth was critical to the fledgling club’s competitiveness. In 1935, Swans finished sixth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WANFL <b>Ladder</b> with six wins and twelve losses and George Krepp won the Sandover Medal. The 1936 season saw the Swans pick up nine wins and eleven losses but still finish seventh <b>on</b> <b>the</b> League <b>Ladder.</b>|$|R

5|$|For the 1888 season, Wilson {{was made}} {{captain of the}} Launceston Grammar School {{football}} team. He also became a leading player for the Launceston Football Club. Wilson kicked two of his team's three goals in a school match against Horton College, and was named in Launceston's best players in several games, including matches against South Launceston and City that counted towards the premiership. In a match that was to decide the premiership, against South Launceston, Wilson put in a creditable performance. The game ended in a draw, which left the teams even <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> and a subsequent game was scheduled for two weeks later. In that match, Wilson kicked one of Launceston's five goals as they ran out two-goal victors to win their first Northern Tasmanian Football Association (NTFA) premiership. He was named in Launceston's best players for the match by the Launceston Examiner. For the following cricket season, Wilson moved to play with St. Leonards.|$|E
5|$|Harley {{endured a}} {{difficult}} start {{to his first}} season as captain, as he ruptured a finger tendon during the club's round one loss to the Western Bulldogs. After undergoing surgery on his finger, Harley made his return through the club's reserves team in the VFL but failed to earn a recall to the senior team until round ten. After playing {{the majority of his}} career at Geelong as a centre half back, Harley struggled to find his niche in the defence following the emergence of the younger Matthew Egan in the key position. He soon adjusted himself as a floating defender capable of playing on small forwards, and retained his position in the side after achieving career-best averages of 14 disposals and 5 marks a game. Harley helped the team compile an 18-4 win-loss record {{at the conclusion of the}} home and away season, earning them their eighth McClelland Trophy and securing first position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> leading into the finals series. Harley led the defence to the number one defensive record in the league during the season, by letting only 1664 points be scored against them. After wins against North Melbourne and Collingwood in the Qualifying and Preliminary finals respectively, Geelong earned a spot in the Grand Final against Harley's former team Port Adelaide. Collecting 13 disposals and 7 marks, Harley helped the club to an AFL-record 119 point win and secure its first premiership in 44 years. Harley became the first Geelong captain of a premiership-winning side since Fred Wooller in 1963, and achieved the rare distinction of becoming a premiership-winning captain in his first year at the helm.|$|E
5|$|Harley's {{achievements}} at {{the club}} were recognised prior to the 2008 AFL season when he {{was inducted into the}} Geelong Football Club Hall of Fame. Following the success of 2007, Harley and the club were expected to feature prominently in the 2008 finals series once more. Harley featured in all 22 home-and-away fixture games and 3 finals games. He set career-highs of 14 marks (round three) and 14 handpasses (Preliminary Final) in the process, and helped the club achieve the number one defensive record during the season for the second consecutive year. During the season, he was also selected to the initial squad for the AFL Hall of Fame all-star game, although he failed to make the final teams. Geelong compiled a 21–1 win-loss record to once again capture the McClelland Trophy and qualify for the finals series in first position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> After successive wins against St Kilda and the Western Bulldogs, Harley led the team to their second straight Grand Final appearance. During the Grand Final, Harley suffered mild concussion following a collision prior to the half-time break. As a result, he struggled to contribute {{for the rest of the}} game as Geelong lost to Hawthorn by 26 points.|$|E

5|$|Having helped Geelong finish first <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> {{and win the}} McClelland Trophy, Selwood {{made his}} finals debut in the 2nd Qualifying Final against the Kangaroos (now North Melbourne) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). In front of nearly 80,000spectators, Selwood amassed 22disposals, five marks, five clearances, six inside 50s, five tackles, and five score assists, helping Geelong to a club finals record 106point victory. Although Selwood {{struggled}} to contribute in the Preliminary Final against Collingwood two weeks later, he returned to form for the 2007 AFL Grand Final at the MCG against Port Adelaide. With 18disposals, five marks, five clearances—the most of any Geelong player—seven inside 50s, four tackles, and an equal game-high four score assists, Selwood helped the Cats to a record 119point win. At 19years of age, Selwood became the youngest person {{to play in a}} winning Grand Final team in 10years. He was also the first to win the AFL Rising Star Award and play in a premiership side within the same season, making him one of the most accomplished firstyear players in league history. Selwood's debut year achievements resulted in him becoming the highest-paid first–year player in AFL history.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match was the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal, {{the winner of}} which would become the number one {{contender}} to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. It involved Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Gail Kim, Jackie Moore, ODB, Salinas, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. This contest involved two stages; {{the first was a}} standard battle royal. After all but two wrestlers were eliminated, stage two, a ladder match, began. The winner of the ladder match would become the number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship; the loser would have her head shaved. The final four were Kim, Laveaux, Love, and ODB. The next eliminated was ODB, followed by Love; both were eliminated by Laveaux. Only Kim and Laveaux remained for the ladder match portion. Kim had won immunity on the May8 episode of Impact!, so if Laveaux won the match, then Love's head would be shaven. Love and Sky interfered in the contest several times. During the bout, as Kim and Laveaux stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder,</b> Kim flipped over Laveaux, grabbed her around the legs, and slammed her into the mat back-first with a powerbomb. Laveaux's head was legitimately cut open during this stage. Later, while Laxeaux climbed the ladder in an attempt to retrieve the contract, Love interfered by pushing the ladder over. Kim followed by climbing the ladder and grabbing the contract to win the encounter at ten minutes. Afterwards, Laveaux was forced to have her head shaven.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> to the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied {{as a result}} of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder.</b> By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country zoning failed to help, as the Riverina Football League proved {{to be one of the}} least profitable zones.|$|E

It catalysed a nine-match winning streak, with a Round 23 victory against eventual grand-finalists Sydney raising Richmond to 8th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ladder</b> and putting the club into its first back-to-back finals appearance since 1975.

Two weeks later the Suns hosted Collingwood in front of a record crowd at Metricon Stadium. In what would prove to be a significant moment for the team's 2014 campaign, Gary Ablett Jr suffered a season-ending injury just prior to half time.
