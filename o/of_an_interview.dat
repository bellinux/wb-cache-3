5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} were good, enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and {{the slow pace of}} the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, Narayan, ever fond of conversation, would spend almost every evening with N. Ram, the {{publisher}} of The Hindu, drinking coffee and talking about various topics until well past midnight. Despite his fondness of meeting and talking to people, he stopped giving interviews. The apathy towards interviews was the result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with Time, after which Narayan had {{to spend a few}} days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take photographs that were never used in the article.|$|E

He made this the subtext of the film to have something deeper than the average rockumentary. He {{said one of the}} hardest aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the sheriff-substitute, the procurator fiscal and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was in the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with the Edinburgh Courant that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.|$|E

25|$|Although rough notes <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> with {{a witness}} are producible, under Jencks Act where such notes are a {{substantially}} verbatim recital of the witness’ oral statements, {{failure to do}} so is probably harmless where the notes are substantially the same as a report based on the notes and released to the defense.|$|E
