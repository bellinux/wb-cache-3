Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power with a sense <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s {{with the addition of}} the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The front wall of the middle tier {{is one of the last}} surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing. The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.|$|E

25|$|Despite this {{formidable}} array <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> scholarly opinion, the Oxford Franciscans William of Ware {{and especially}} Blessed John Duns Scotus defended the doctrine.

Rather it {{was the result of a}} more perfect redemption given to her on account of her special role in history.|$|E
25|$|Alberdina Houtman {{and colleagues}} theorize {{that while the}} Mishnah was {{compiled}} {{in order to establish}} an authoritative text on halakhic tradition, a more conservative party opposed the exclusion of the rest <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> produced the Tosefta to avoid the impression that the written Mishnah was equivalent to the entire oral Torah. The original intention was that the two texts would be viewed on equal standing, but the succinctness of the Mishnah and the power and influence of Yehuda Ha-Nassi made it more popular among most students of tradition.|$|E

25|$|Symbolism was {{a device}} to {{distinguish}} the main features of the Revolution and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate {{the differences between the}} new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.|$|E
25|$|In {{general and}} across cultures, public {{indications}} of sexual arousal are commonly regarded as embarrassing, {{both to the}} person aroused and the onlooker, {{and for this reason}} those parts of the human body that would indicate arousal are normally covered. Arousal is most evidently indicated by the sex organs and women's breasts, which are routinely covered, even when {{other parts of the body}} may be freely uncovered. Yet the nudity taboo may have meanings deeper than the immediate possibility of sexual arousal, for example, in the cumulative weight <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> habit. Clothing also expresses and symbolizes authority, and more general norms and values besides those of a sexual nature.|$|E
25|$|Persian {{carpets and}} rugs of various types were woven in {{parallel}} by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines <b>of</b> <b>tradition,</b> <b>and</b> reflect the history of Iran and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the Safavid court manufactories of Isfahan during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections {{all over the world}} today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.|$|E

25|$|The final Masorah {{is located}} at the end of biblical books or after certain {{sections}} of the text, such as {{at the end of the}} Torah. It contains information and statistics regarding the number of words in a book or section, etc. Thus, Book of Leviticus 8:23 is the middle verse in the Pentateuch. The collation of manuscripts and the noting of their differences furnished material for the Text-Critical Masorah. The close relation which existed in earlier times (from the Soferim to the Amoraim inclusive) between the teacher <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> the Masorete, both frequently being united in one person, accounts for the Exegetical Masorah. Finally, the invention and introduction of a graphic system of vocalization and accentuation gave rise to the Grammatical Masorah.|$|E
25|$|Mustafa Kemal {{presented}} himself as revolutionary to the communists, protector <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> {{order to the}} conservatives, patriot soldier to the nationalists, and a Muslim leader for the religious, so {{he was able to}} recruit all Turkish elements and motivate them to fight. The Turkish National Movement attracted sympathizers especially from the Muslims of the far east countries. The Khilafet Committee in Bombay started a fund to help the Turkish National struggle and sent both financial aid and constant letters of encouragement. Not all of the money arrived, and Mustafa Kemal decided not use the money that was sent by the Khilafet Committee. The money was restored in the Ottoman Bank. After the war, it was later used for the founding of the Türkiye İş Bankası.|$|E
25|$|Likewise H.D.’s {{revision}} {{of the story of}} Helen of Troy in Helen is an attempt to exonerate women from the blame of the Trojan War. In this sense, form inexorably serves the function and meaning of the poem by indicating to the reader that the poem is, if not an epic, epic-like and therefore a history. For some female authors using the well known form of an epic is a way to legitimize their stories, but by slightly altering the epic tradition they also indicate that the traditional way is unacceptable and insufficient for their purposes. Embodying the modernist dilemma, the long poem as epic often contains the seeming belief in the futility <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> <b>and</b> history paired with the obvious dependence on them.|$|E
