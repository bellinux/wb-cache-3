5|$|The Brabham BT46 is a Formula One {{racing car}} {{designed}} by Gordon Murray for the Brabham team, owned by Bernie Ecclestone, for the 1978 Formula One season. The car featured several radical design elements, {{one of which}} was the use of flat panel heat exchangers on the bodywork <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> replace conventional water and oil radiators. This concept did not work in practice and was removed before the car’s race debut, never to be seen again. The cars, however, powered by a flat-12 Alfa Romeo engine, raced competitively with modified nose-mounted radiators for most of the year, driven by Niki Lauda and John Watson, winning one race in this form and scoring sufficient points for the team to finish third in the constructors championship.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV. All goes well until Hans tries to kiss her goodnight; Selma envisions herself as the mother of several ugly, blind children and kicks Hans out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> prevent that future from happening. Lisa then suggests to Selma that she go through artificial insemination.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} was revised too, {{with the center}} console split from the dashboard, and the climate controls relocated. Pininfarina tweaked the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> better integrate the spoilers and engine cover and update the design {{in line with the}} recently released 348.|$|E
25|$|Having raced the Esprit in GT2 and GT3 classes Lotus {{began to}} develop a new version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> race in GT1. Development of the car was {{entrusted}} to the newly formed Lotus GT1 Engineering group, which included many staff from the recently dissolved Team Lotus.|$|E
25|$|Originally flatcars {{fitted with}} cabins or {{modified}} box cars, they later became purpose-built with projections above {{or to the}} sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> allow crew to observe the train from shelter. The caboose also served as the conductor's office, and on long routes included accommodation and cooking facilities.|$|E

50|$|However, {{just four}} months later on September 29, the braking system on the roller coaster failed, causing one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>to</b> jackknife. Although no one was injured, this was <b>the</b> final ride <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coaster.|$|R
25|$|During 1979 {{a number}} of changes were made on the car, namely an engine {{enlargement}} to 2.0 (leading to a renaming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> 200B), and a mild facelift, using new dual rectangular headlights and a new grille. Due to New Zealand's favour for smaller-engined models, a 1.6-litre 160B variant was also introduced.|$|E
25|$|The current New Generation V8 Supercar {{regulations}} are an {{evolution of the}} previous Project Blueprint regulations. The regulations control many aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> ensure parity between the manufacturers, allowing for minor differences in the engines and body shapes so that the cars bear some resemblance to their production counterparts. The regulations were also designed to lower the costs of building and repairing a car.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe {{attacked}} 20-year-old Marcella Claxton in Roundhay Park, Leeds, on 9 May. Walking {{home from}} a party, she accepted an offer of a lift from Sutcliffe. When she got out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> urinate, Sutcliffe hit her from behind with a hammer. She was left alive and testified against Sutcliffe at his trial. At {{the time of this}} attack, Claxton had been four months pregnant, and subsequently suffered a miscarriage.|$|E

25|$|Imagine {{for example}} using a {{stopwatch}} to mark-off tiny increments {{of time as}} a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> <b>To</b> understand {{the power of this}} theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed {{to look out the window}} of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.|$|E
25|$|Components of the {{bodywork}} {{were replaced}} with slightly revised carbon fibre and kevlar panels. The under tray {{was replaced with}} a flat version for better stability at high speeds. A second seat and leather upholstery were installed in the cramped cockpit, {{as well as a}} video screen for DVD playback in later years. A small compartment was added to the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> carry luggage. A hydraulic suspension system was also added to meet German ride height requirements for street cars.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 AMP Energy 500 - {{the fall}} race at Talladega, Ryan Newman was spun {{backwards}} {{at high speed}} in a late race crash, and then flipped backwards (landing upside down on Kevin Harvick's hood) and ended up on his roof. Mark Martin also barrel rolled in a crash during the same race, but instead of lifting {{in the air like}} Newman, his car was hit from behind, causing the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> shift to one side and pull the car onto its roof, rolling once.|$|E
25|$|By September 10, 2008, Tesla had {{delivered}} 27 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>to</b> customers. It was {{also reported that}} a newer, better transmission had been developed and that production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was hoped <b>to</b> reach 20 per week by December 2008, and 40 per week by March 2009. Over the next 20 days, however, only 3 more cars had been delivered to customers which brought the total to 30 as of September 30, 2008.|$|R

25|$|The pure {{style of}} the {{prototype}} was progressively altered by the evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> improve its performance, handling, tractability, and ability to meet mandated requirements. This began with the first production model, which included several vents that Lamborghini found necessary to cool the engine adequately. These included the iconic NACA duct on the doors and rear fenders. The car design changes ended with a large engine vent directly behind the driver, reducing the rear view. Later additions—including fender flares, spoilers, carburetor covers, and bumpers—progressively changed the car's aesthetic values.|$|E
25|$|Tata {{launched}} the Indica in 1998, the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car. Although initially criticised by auto-analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine and an aggressive marketing strategy made {{it one of}} the best selling cars {{in the history of the}} Indian automobile industry. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass-favorite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large quantities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> South Africa. The success of Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors.|$|E
25|$|Other advancements {{on the car}} {{include the}} {{clutchless}} direct shift technology within the gearbox, a new fluid traction control system to replace the previous 2001 traction control system, and upright aerodynamically shaped periscopic exhaust outlets at the rear. The latter technology was incorporated both to use the hot exhaust gases for aerodynamic effect and to raise these gases higher and out {{the way of the}} rear suspension. On previous occasion Ferrari's non chimneyed top exiting exhaust outlets had caused the rear suspension and other elements at the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> overheat or even melt when minor cracks occurred.|$|E
500|$|French {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> V8-engined <b>cars</b> {{ended in}} <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 1961, by when 173,288 had been produced, although a Simca Chambord was {{exhibited at the}} Paris Motor Show in October of that year, suggesting that Simca still had some stock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>to</b> clear. [...] <b>The</b> small-engined 4-cylinder Ariane, of which 166,363 were produced, survived until 1963.|$|R

50|$|The D-Type {{never again}} {{achieved}} a podium finish at Le Mans. Its success waned as support from Jaguar decreased and cars from rival manufacturers became more competitive. Although it continued {{for a time}} <b>to</b> be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>to</b> beat in club racing and national events, by the early 1960s it was obsolete.|$|R
25|$|Cruise control {{automatically}} {{controls the}} rate of motion of a motor vehicle. The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named Ralph Teetor. His idea {{was born out of}} the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the main}} options {{included}} the sunroof $2390, satellite navigation $3800, rear-seat DVD players $3900, Xenon headlights $1800, tyre pressure monitoring system $1395. Inside it features Nappa leather on the seats. The braking system on the Senator comes with ABS with twin-piston front callipers and grooved discs. The specially designed rear suspension has a self-levelling feature, so if the Senator was towing a trailer, instead of the weight forcing the back down and causing the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> go up, the rear suspension would harden itself and therefore keeping the car levelled and aerodynamic. This feature {{is also on the}} current E-series Senator Signature and has been optioned on Holden models as far back as WH Caprice in 1999.|$|E
25|$|When Emma regains consciousness, {{she gets}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>to</b> confront Ingrid, believing that she was there. But Emma refuses to believe Ingrid when she warns her that Gold only wanted to hurt her for his own self-benefits. Emma notices that the image is an {{illusion}} {{as she tries to}} touch Ingrid, so she returns to the car and speeds off to the mansion. As Emma arrives at the place, Gold sets up the hat to absorb her and her powers in a closed room. Emma waits for Gold at the other side, and before she opens the door, Gold appears behind her, telling Emma that everything will be fine once her powers are gone, and that she will be able to live a normal life. Emma then thanks Gold, not knowing will happen next as she ponders about opening the door.|$|E
