25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{had backed}} Edwards' Glamorgan {{campaign}} was the barrister, William Vaughan of 'Glanelai', (Lanelay), Pontyclun, near Cardiff, after whom Nash Vaughan Edwards (1811-1868) had been named. When Mr Vaughan died in 1829, he left {{father and son}} his estate, on condition that they took on the Vaughan surname. Thus they became John Edwards-Vaughan and Nash Vaughan Edwards-Vaughan, and acquired properties at Lanelay and at Clase, Llangyfelach, near Swansea.|$|E

Despite stories to the contrary, no reliable evidence indicates Jack Benny was aboard Eastland or scheduled {{to be on the}} excursion; possibly the basis for this report was that Eastland was a training vessel during World War I and Jack Benny received his training in the Great Lakes naval base, where Eastland was stationed.|$|E
25|$|Mathis {{was also}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> helped bail Valentino {{out of jail}} {{when he was arrested}} for bigamy, having married Natacha Rambova without finalizing his divorce to Jean Acker.

25|$|The {{image of}} the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC {{scriptwriter}} Anthony Coburn, {{who lived in the}} resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine.

In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.|$|E

25|$|Dolci died on December 30, 1997 in Trappeto, {{from heart}} failure. He was survived by the five adopted {{children}} {{he had with}} his first wife, Vincenzina, and by two children from his second marriage. His death has triggered a curious mixture of reactions. While the chief Antimafia prosecutor in Palermo, Gian Carlo Caselli, said Dolci was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> gave him the keys to do his job, the national press gave him surprisingly short shrift, describing him as a historical curiosity whose work has long since been forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Kellogg's Grove, {{originally}} {{known as}} Burr Oak Grove, {{was a high}} point along a Native American trail between Peoria and Prairie du Chien, later the trail was used by fur traders. During the 1820s people began to move from southern Illinois into the lead producing areas in and around Galena, Illinois in the far northwestern corner of the state.

In April 2015, Iliescu confirmed that he had granted a CIA request for a site in Romania, but was not aware {{of the nature of the}} site, describing it as a small gesture of goodwill to an ally in advance of Romania's eventual accession to NATO. Iliescu further stated that had he known of the intended use of the site, he would certainly not have approved the request.|$|E

25|$|City's relegation to the Conference National in 2003 kick-started a {{major change}} in the club's structure. On 14 May 2003, John Russell and Mike Lewis were arrested over {{allegations}} of financial irregularities at the club. It later emerged that Uri Geller was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had contacted the police. Following Russell and Lewis' arrest, then Trust chairman Ian Huxham, chief executive Terry Pavey and Julian Tagg, all of which were prominent members of the Exeter City Supporters' Trust at the time, were appointed as directors of the club. Shortly after, Doble asked the Trust to take over the day-to-day running of the club. Complex legal arguments with both Inland Revenue and football authorities meant that City's first season of non-league football was plagued by off-the-field uncertainty. The claim was finally dropped in June 2004.|$|E
25|$|Born in Dublin, he {{was educated}} at the Jesuit school Gonzaga College, then at University College Dublin {{where he became}} auditor of the UCD Law Society. He later {{attended}} the King's Inns in Dublin where he achieved the Barrister-at-Law degree in 1974. McDowell was a junior counsel on the legal team that defended the murderer Malcolm MacArthur in the notorious GUBU case. In 2002, McDowell excused himself from considering MacArthur's parole report, to avoid any possible conflict of interest arising from this representation. He was appointed a Senior Counsel in 1987. He became involved in politics, initially supporting Fine Gael. When Desmond O'Malley was expelled from Fianna Fáil in 1985, McDowell immediately wrote to him in support, and ended up becoming <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> helped him establish the Progressive Democrats. He is the husband of UCD accountancy Professor Niamh Brennan and brother of UCD economics lecturer Moore McDowell.|$|E
25|$|In early January 1949, {{two people}} {{identified}} {{the body as}} that of 63-year-old former wood cutter Robert Walsh. A third person, James Mack, also viewed the body, initially could not identify it, but an hour later he contacted police to claim it was Walsh. Mack stated that the reason he did not confirm this at the viewing was {{a difference in the}} colour of the hair. Walsh had left Adelaide several months earlier to buy sheep in Queensland but had failed to return at Christmas as planned. Police were skeptical, believing Walsh to be too old to be the dead man. However, the police did state that the body was consistent with that {{of a man who had}} been a wood cutter, although the state of the man's hands indicated he had not cut wood for at least 18 months. Any thoughts that a positive identification had been made were quashed, however, when Elizabeth Thompson, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had earlier positively identified the body as Walsh, retracted her statement after a second viewing of the body, where the absence of a particular scar on the body, as well as the size of the dead man's legs, led her to realise the body was not Walsh.|$|E
