5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused <b>on</b> <b>money</b> and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} invest in pumpkins, but loses his entire investment. Late on a {{mortgage}} payment and short <b>on</b> <b>money,</b> he tries to borrow some, but to no avail. Homer keeps his money troubles secret from Marge. Meanwhile, Patty and Selma have received a promotion at the DMV. As a last resort, Homer asks the two if they will lend him the money, and they agree {{on the condition that}} he become their loyal servant. Marge finds out about the loan after she sees the IOU note, and her sisters tell her what happened.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Russia {{submitted}} the Su-27M and Su-37 for South Korea's F-X programme, which sought a 40-aircraft {{replacement for the}} Republic of Korea Air Force's F-4D/Es, RF-4Cs and F-5E/Fs. The two Russian designs competed against the Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon, and F-15K Slam Eagle. Sukhoi proposed a design which featured a phased-grid radar and thrust-vectoring engines, and offered full technology transfer as well as final assembly in South Korea. The US$5billion contract would have been partially financed through a debt-reduction deal <b>on</b> <b>money</b> Russia owed to South Korea. However, the Su-27M was eliminated early in the competition, which was won by the F-15K.|$|E

5|$|Relying <b>on</b> <b>money</b> {{donated by}} neighbors, Du Bois {{attended}} Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1885 to 1888. His travel to and residency in the South was Du Bois's {{first experience with}} Southern racism, {{which at the time}} encompassed Jim Crow laws, bigotry, suppression of black voting, and lynchings; the lattermost reached a peak in the next decade. After receiving a bachelor's degree from Fisk, he attended Harvard College (which did not accept course credits from Fisk) from 1888 to 1890, where he was strongly influenced by his professor William James, prominent in American philosophy. Du Bois paid his way through three years at Harvard with money from summer jobs, an inheritance, scholarships, and loans from friends. In 1890, Harvard awarded Du Bois his second bachelor's degree, cum laude, in history. In 1891, Du Bois received a scholarship to attend the sociology graduate school at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{pay-per-view}} {{opened with}} the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking <b>on</b> <b>Money</b> Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used {{their size and}} power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept {{him away from the}} corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for laundering, and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business selling drugs, laundering money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian customs stamps to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown <b>on</b> <b>money</b> laundering by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's new image was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a conference on the role of the military in Central America's wars, a speech which received a lot of attention in Panama's pro-government press.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short <b>on</b> <b>money,</b> and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, {{he was forced to}} take out a second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded with a series of attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
5|$|Some {{degree of}} {{self-regulation}} occurs whereby {{banks and other}} financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force <b>on</b> <b>Money</b> Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the European Banking Authority (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E
50|$|Gibson {{joined the}} Nationwide Tour in 1990. He won the Ben Hogan Tri-Cities Open in 1991 and also earned his PGA Tour card that year through {{qualifying}} school. In his rookie {{year on the}} PGA Tour, Gibson finished 105th <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list while recording three top-10 finishes. He finished 110th <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list in 1993. In 1994 he recorded two top-10 finishes while finishing 129th <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list, four spots shy of retaining full-time status on the Tour but he went to qualifying school and earned his card for 1995. He finished 109th <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list in 1995 while recording one top-10 finish. His best year on Tour came in 1996 when he finished 69th <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list while recording two top-10 finishes. He finished in a tie for third at the Las Vegas Invitational, his best finish on Tour in his career. His success continued in 1997 when he finished 92nd <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list with a top-10 finish and also finished in a tie for 28th at the U.S. Open. His performance fell off in 1998, he finished 139th <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list earning only partial status on Tour for 1999 {{and spent most of}} his time that year on the Nationwide Tour. He won the Nike Oregon Classic that year and recorded six top-10 finishes en route to a 13th-place finish <b>on</b> the <b>money</b> list, earning him his PGA Tour card for 2000. In his return to the PGA Tour he only made 12 cuts out of 30 events entered so he returned to the Nationwide Tour for 2001. He split time between Tours from 2002 to 2004 and played in a limited amount of tournaments after that.|$|R

5|$|The Lords {{would only}} be able to delay money bills for one month, {{effectively}} ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or <b>on</b> <b>money</b> provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. It did not however, cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some Finance Bills have not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills have. The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker's certificate. The Local Government Finance Bill 1988, which introduced the Community Charge ("Poll Tax"), was not certified as a Money Bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst Finance Bills are not considered Money Bills, convention dictates that those parts of a Finance Bill dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an Act alone, would constitute a Money Bill) are not questioned.|$|E
