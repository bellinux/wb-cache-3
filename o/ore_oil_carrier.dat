The surveyor must have the three last cargos to know the problems of compatibility (IMDG code) Older is the vessel, more the controls are made frequently (especially for the <b>oil</b> <b>carriers</b> to avoid the Erika disaster as an example). For the dry bulk cargo, it is compulsory to apply a product a gas rats to avoid problems with this animal.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inoculant}} carrier, temperature, and storage period on {{the survival of}} Rhizobium strains were determined by plate count and most-probable-number analyses. Preliminary experiments showed that survival of rhizobia was affected by each of these factors and their interactions. Results of further studies indicated that six strains of rhizobia survived better at high temperatures when lyophilized and suspended in an <b>oil</b> <b>carrier</b> as compared to finely ground peat. The oil base inocula contained ca. 105 viable rhizobia per g after 56 days of incubation at 60 °C, whereas peat base inocula contained ≤ 10 rhizobia per g. These results suggest that an <b>oil</b> <b>carrier</b> will protect rhizobia from rapid death at usually lethal high temperatures...|$|R

BACKGROUND INFORMATION Aromatherapy {{is the use of}} essential oils distilled from plants and administered by inhalation, massage, or used in hydrotherapy. The use of the essential oils is believed to influence mood, and be associated with antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antiseptic, anti-inflammatory, and sedative benefits. The two 1, 2 types of oils used are essential <b>oils</b> and <b>carrier</b> <b>oils.</b> Essential oils are flammable and evaporate rapidly to form vapours, and should only be used externally, and never undiluted. The <b>carrier</b> or base <b>oils</b> are used to blend the essential oils e. g. grape seed, olive oil, and apricot kernel <b>oil.</b> <b>Carrier</b> <b>oils</b> inhibit evaporation of the essential oils and encourage absorption into the skin. The oil should be cold pressed to prevent changes in the oil composition which occurs if heated. 2 KEY POINTS 1. Two randomised controlled trials indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommen...|$|R
