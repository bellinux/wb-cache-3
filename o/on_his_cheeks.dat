5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of LÃ©on Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b> The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Myers as Austin Powers, {{receiving}} {{a call from}} his boss Basil Exposition (Michael York) who warns him against a dangerous spy describing her as a [...] "master of disguise". The screen of his car depicts five images of Madonna wearing different looks, and Exposition clarifies {{that she has been}} [...] "seducing our top agents". He also warns Powers [...] "whatever you do don't fall in love. We've already lost 007 and 008". As the video continues, Powers finds Madonna at a club performing in front of a crowd, which includes Verne Troyer in character as Mini-Me. As he watches her perform Powers finds himself fantasizing about the two of them dancing in front of a white background with psychedelic fluorescent whirls. He also visualizes them riding a car together, where Madonna dances suggestively and licks Powers' face while rubbing her crotch and bottom <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks.</b>|$|E

500|$|With Robey's {{popularity}} came an {{eagerness to}} differentiate {{himself from his}} music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened {{from the neck down}} with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled top-hat. He applied thick white face paint and exaggerated the redness <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as [...] "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he fixed his audience with his basilisk stare." ...|$|E

60|$|Tony's {{excitement}} was great, but {{the effect}} of his late training {{was seen in the}} suppression of all feeling, save that which escaped through the eyes. Paint and charcoal concealed the flush <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> effectually.|$|E

60|$|The lawyer made no reply. As Cuthbert {{spoke the}} ruddy color <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cheeks</b> had been {{replaced}} by a ghastly pallor. An expression of bewilderment had come across his face, the perspiration stood out in big drops on his forehead.|$|E
