5|$|Kohlberg's theory centers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> {{justice is}} the {{essential}} characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology and eudaimonia.|$|E

40|$|The role of whitecapping {{losses of}} waves is {{investigated}} {{in a simple}} model based on conservation laws. It is shown that, for Airy waves, {{at least as much}} energy is lost in gradual reequilibration as is lost in the whitecapping events themselves. This model is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> waves and losses are small enough that some narrow spectrum of frequencies reappears over time...|$|R
50|$|Social {{constructionism}} or {{the social}} construction of reality (also social concept) is a theory of knowledge in sociology and communication theory that examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world that form the basis for shared assumptions about reality. <b>The</b> theory centers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> human beings rationalize their experience by creating models of the social world and share and reify these models through language.|$|R

5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E
5|$|Hitsugaya {{lived with}} his {{grandmother}} and with Momo Hinamori, whom he considers a very close friend. Hitsugaya excelled in the Soul Reaper academy, becoming the youngest captain {{in the history of}} Soul Society with command over Squad 10. Introduced to the Gotei 13, Hitsugaya suspected Squad 3 captain Gin Ichimaru of foul play as the circumstances surrounding the coming execution of Rukia Kuchiki become more complicated. When Hinamori is manipulated into thinking that Hitsugaya killed Sōsuke Aizen, Hitsugaya attacks Gin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> he tricked her. The fight is interrupted when Hitsugaya dodges an attack that almost kills Hinamori, only to be intercepted by his lieutenant Rangiku Matsumoto. Seeing how destructive Rukia's execution is becoming, Hitsugaya tries to stop it by appealing to the Chamber 46, only to discover all members were murdered by Aizen, who faked his death. When Hitsugaya discovers Hinamori injured, Hitsugaya tries to kill Aizen but is defeated.|$|E

5|$|In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E

25|$|The {{territorial}} dispute {{is a major}} source of nationalistic tensions. Since the South Korean government bases its legitimacy partly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> it defends South Korea from North Korea in the North and from Japan from the south, nationalism has been stoked over this issue. Korean tourists visit the remote, inhospitable island, in order to show national solidarity. In Japan, maps mark the islands as being Japanese territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{segmented}} assimilation for second-generation immigrants is highly researched in the sociological arena. Segmented assimilation focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> people take different paths {{in how they}} adapt {{to life in the}} United States. This theory states that there are three main different paths of assimilation for second-generation immigrants. Some immigrants assimilate smoothly into the white middle class of America, others experience downward assimilation, and others experience rapid economic success while preserving the values of their immigrant community.|$|E

After a chance encounter with Pete, who has reformed and married, Alex finds himself taking less and less pleasure in acts of senseless violence. He begins contemplating giving up crime himself to become a productive member of society and start a family of his own, while reflecting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> his own children {{will be just as}} destructive as he has been, if not more so.|$|E
25|$|Deliberative {{democracy}} is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> {{democracy is}} government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, {{for a democratic}} decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E
25|$|As yet an {{alternative}} {{set of rules}} that takes this into account has not been fully developed. Most {{progress has been made}} based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> stellation is the reciprocal or dual process to facetting, whereby parts are removed from a polyhedron without creating any new vertices. For every stellation of some polyhedron, there is a dual facetting of the dual polyhedron, and vice versa. By studying facettings of the dual, we gain insights into the stellations of the original. Bridge found his new stellation of the icosahedron by studying the facettings of its dual, the dodecahedron.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} merits and practicalities {{of using a}} multi-framing {{approach}} in problem solving and decision making, through applying it to a real situation. We provide a rationale for the multi-framing approach, which is founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no one}} correct way to approach most real problems, and that single-frame approaches can induce frame blindness. The case analysis demonstrates benefits of multi-framing that include building frame awareness, overcoming frame blindness, and understanding the development of perspectives that contribute to more robust and acceptable ‘solutions’. We describe our experiences of using framing as a meta-framework for problem solving and illustrate how the approach may be used in the classroom. In doing so, we indicate how the nature and success of problem-solving interventions can be frame dependent. ...|$|R
25|$|Geobiochemistry {{is similar}} to biogeochemistry, but differs by placing {{emphasis}} {{on the effects of}} geology on the development of life’s biochemical processes, as distinct from the role of life on Earth’s cycles. Its primary goal is to link biological changes, encompassing evolutionary modifications of genes and changes in the expression of genes and proteins, to changes in the temperature, pressure, and composition of geochemical processes to understand when and how metabolism evolved. Geobiochemistry is founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> life is a planetary response because metabolic catalysis enables the release of energy trapped by a cooling planet.|$|E
25|$|Another {{explanation}} is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of catastrophic events that impact the investment. This explanation depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect {{is referred to as}} the liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.|$|E
25|$|Somali {{nationalism}} is centered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notion</b> <b>that</b> Somalis in Greater Somalia {{share a common}} language, religion, culture and ethnicity, and as such constitute a nation unto themselves. The ideology's earliest manifestations are often {{traced back to the}} resistance movement led by Mohamed Abdullah Hassan's Dervish State {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. In northwestern present-day Somalia, the first Somali nationalist political organization to be formed was the Somali National League (SNL), established in 1935 in the former British Somaliland protectorate. In the country's northeastern, central and southern regions, the similarly-oriented Somali Youth Club (SYC) was founded in 1943 in Italian Somaliland, just prior to the trusteeship period. The SYC was later renamed the Somali Youth League (SYL) in 1947. It became the most influential political party in the early years of post-independence Somalia.|$|E

40|$|Studies in {{cognitive}} psychology, marketing, and education indicate that humor distracts attention from non-humorous information {{presented at the}} same time. Two experiments investigated why humor distracts attention. The two basic components of humor comprise (1) incongruency resolution, which poses cognitive demands and (2) positive affect. We disentangled the contributions of cognitive demands and positive affect on distraction based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>notions</b> <b>that</b> (a) both components are possible sources of distraction, and (b) the components were always confounded in previous research. In an evaluative conditioning paradigm, novel products were consistently paired with humorous stimuli, whereas other products were paired with stimuli that were either (1) equally demanding but neutral, (2) equally positive but undemanding, and (3) undemanding and neutral. The results showed that cognitively demanding stimuli distracted attention, irrespective of stimulus positivity. These {{findings suggest that the}} cognitive demands of humor, not the positive affect it evokes, underlie the distraction effect...|$|R
