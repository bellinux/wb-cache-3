Bizet was awarded the prize after a ballot {{of the members of}} the Académie des Beaux-Arts overturned the judges' initial decision, which was in favour of the oboist Charles Colin. Under the terms of the award, Bizet received a financial grant for five years, the first two to be spent in Rome, the third in Germany and the final two in Paris. The only <b>other</b> <b>requirement</b> was the submission each year of an [...] "envoi", a piece of original work to the satisfaction of the Académie.

2500|$|To {{bring the}} UK back into {{compliance}} with basic standards in international law, the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 was introduced. The minimum wage takes effect in every worker's contract. Workers {{do not need}} to show [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] or any <b>other</b> <b>requirement</b> except that they personally perform work for a wage and is not a client. One curious exclusion, however, is a pupil barrister who in Edmonds v Lawson was held to not be [...] "working" [...] but be [...] "conscientious in receiving instruction". The minimum wage rate is reset annually after guidance from the Low Pay Commission, and on 1 October 2014 it stood at £6.50 for over-21-year-olds, £5.13 for 18- to 20-year-olds, £3.79 for under-18-year-olds finished with compulsory education. Since 2010, the minimum was cut for [...] "apprentices", and stood in 2014 at £2.73. The National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 spell out the details of how the minimum wage should be calculated. Total pay received is divided by the hours actually worked over an average [...] "pay reference period" [...] of one month. This definition has given rise to litigation in cases where a worker can stay at home but must answer phone calls, is allowed to rest or sleep during shifts, or must make themselves available [...] "on call" [...] over a long period. Generally speaking, it is irrelevant whether one is at home or not. If a worker is given sleeping facilities and is not awake, the minimum wage need not be paid. And if a worker is [...] "on call", then this time still counts at work if the worker is bound to stay within the vicinity of the workplace. However, an exception in regulation 28 allows an employer to agree with a worker what the hours worked actually are, if they would ordinarily be unmeasured. In Walton v Independent Living Organisation Ltd a worker who cared for a young epileptic lady had to be on call 24 hours a day, 3 days a week, but could do her own activities outside tasks such as going shopping, making meals and cleaning. Her company made an agreement with her that her tasks took 6 hours and 50 minutes a day, which resulted in her £31.40 allowance meeting the minimum wage. Certain deductions may be made including £4.51 per day for any accommodation the employer provides, though extra bills, such as for electricity, should not ordinarily be charged. The minimum wage can be enforced individually through an ERA 1996 section 13 claim for a shortfall of wages in a Tribunal. A worker may not be subjected to any detriment for enquiring, or requesting records or complaining about it. However, because many workers will not be informed about how to do this, or have the resources, a primary enforcement mechanism is through inspections and compliance notices issued by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. A remedy of up to 80 times the minimum wage is available to the worker and HMRC can enforce a penalty of twice the minimum wage per worker per day.|$|E
