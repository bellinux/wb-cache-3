5|$|As {{an escaped}} POW, Pechersky was conscripted into a special penal battalions, {{conforming}} to Stalin's Order No. 270 {{and was sent}} to the front to fight German forces in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> engagements of the war. Pechersky's battalion commander, Major Andreev, was so shocked by his description of Sobibor that he permitted Pechersky to go to Moscow and speak to the Commission of Inquiry of the Crimes of Fascist-German Aggressors and their Accomplices. The Commission listened to Pechersky and published the report Uprising in Sobibor based on his testimony. This report was included in the Black Book, one of the first comprehensive compilations about the Holocaust, written by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} the men of the AIF were selected under some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed that roughly 30 per cent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. In order to enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and they had to be at least five foot six inches tall (168 centimetres), with a chest measurement of at least 34inches (86 centimetres). Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew. Indeed, casualties among the initial volunteers were so high, that of the 32,000 original soldiers of the AIF only 7,000 would survive {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One multiscalar microlaminate {{comprising}} 66 thin strong layer {{stacks of}} NiCoCrAl / ZrO 2 - 8 wt. %Y 2 O 3 (YSZ) and 5 thick tough phase layers of NiCoCrAl whose thicknesses ranged from 5 µm to 25 µm was fabricated by Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EB-PVD) {{and followed by}} hot pressing treatment. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the microstructures and failure mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> phase layers. Tensile tests and nanoindentation tests were performed to evaluate <b>the</b> mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> phase layers. <b>The</b> influence <b>of</b> thicknesses of tough phase layers on their microstructure and mechanical properties was investigated. It was found that with <b>the</b> increasing thicknesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> phase layers, their hardness decreased, but their plasticity increased. There was a critical thickness for <b>the</b> <b>tough</b> phase layers between 13 µm and 20 µm. <b>The</b> <b>tough</b> phase layers with thickness less than the critical value displayed the different microstructure and failure mode from those with thickness more than the critical value...|$|R

5|$|Roberts {{announced}} that the 1983 season would be his final year in Grand Prix competition. Yamaha team manager Giacomo Agostini {{had been unable to}} agree on a contract with rider Graeme Crosby, so AMA Superbike champion Eddie Lawson was brought in as Roberts' new teammate. The 1983 battle for the championship between Roberts and Honda's Spencer would be considered one of the greatest seasons in motorcycle Grand Prix history, along with the 1967 500cc duel between Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini. Roberts began the season with his YZR500 having problems with overheating and rear suspension, while Spencer started strongly, winning the first three races and five out of the first seven. Roberts was leading the second race in France, when his Yamaha split an expansion chamber causing it to lose power as Spencer won, with Roberts falling to fourth place. In Round 3 at Monza, Roberts crashed while leading Spencer three laps from the finish. Roberts came back to win the German Grand Prix, but then finished second to Spencer in Spain in a race Spencer called one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>toughest</b> of his career. Things began to go Roberts' way at the Austrian Grand Prix as Roberts won while Spencer's Honda suffered a crankshaft failure. In the Yugoslavian Grand Prix, Roberts' Yamaha failed to start immediately, while Spencer charged to an early lead, leaving Roberts to fight through the field to finish in fourth place. Roberts then went on a three-race winning streak with victories in the Netherlands, Belgium and England, while Spencer stayed close with a third place and two second-place finishes.|$|E
