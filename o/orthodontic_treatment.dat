25|$|One {{trial in}} {{adolescents}} who had <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatment</b> comparing {{the removal of}} impacted mandibular wisdom teeth with retention was identified. It only examined the effect on late lower incisor crowding and was rated 'highly biased' by the authors. The authors concluded {{that there is not}} enough evidence to support either the routine removal or retention of asymptomatic impacted wisdom teeth. Another randomised controlled trial done in the UK has suggested that it is not reasonable to remove asymptomatic disease-free impacted wisdom tooth merely to prevent incisor crowding as there is not strong enough evidence to show this association.|$|E
2500|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review {{concluded that there}} is insufficient evidence to determine {{the effectiveness of these}} therapies. Opinion is that they are effective for moderate crowding of the front teeth, but are less effective than conventional braces for several other issues [...] and are not recommended for children. In particular they are indicated for [...] "mild to moderate crowding (1–6 mm) and mild to moderate spacing (1–6 mm)", in cases where there are no discrepancies of the jawbone. They are also indicated for patients who have experienced a relapse after fixed <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatment.</b> [...] Despite patent infringement litigation, no manufacturer has obtained an injunction against another manufacturer.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Orthodontic</b> <b>treatment,</b> as {{described}} earlier, is sometimes {{listed as a}} possible predisposing factor {{in the development of}} TMD.

Another systematic review investigating the relationship between orthodontics and TMD concluded the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There is no {{evidence}} to support or refute the use of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatment</b> for the treatment of TMD. In addition, there are no data which identify a link between active orthodontic intervention and the causation of TMD.

30|$|In this {{retrospective}} study, it {{has been}} demonstrated {{that there is a}} close link between vertical craniofacial development and the morphology of cross-sectional sites of the maxillary and mandibular bodies for patients referred for <b>orthodontic</b> and orthognathic <b>treatment.</b> Understanding this biological link is important in connection with many comprehensive dental- and <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments.</b>|$|R

30|$|Today, it {{is still}} very {{challenging}} to reduce the duration of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments.</b> It {{is one of the}} common deterents that faces orthodontist and causes irritation among adults plus increasing risks of caries, gingival recession, and root resorption.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{further studies}} {{evaluating}} {{a larger number}} of patients and, possibly, the three-dimensional evaluation of the airways using CBCT, where legally and ethically acceptable, could be useful to assess more precisely the possible correlations between <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments</b> and airway space.|$|R
50|$|The type of braces used {{to correct}} {{malocclusion}} is {{unrelated to the}} biology necessary for accelerated <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatment.</b> Self-ligating brackets are a type of bracket that is reputed to shorten treatment time, but current research does not support this claim. While some dentists choose to undertake <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatment</b> on a non-extraction basis occasionally incorporating tooth size reduction, this method is not always appropriate as dental extractions are occasionally unavoidable if crowding is to be alleviated.|$|E
5000|$|While dentists may treat some {{orthodontic}} {{conditions in}} {{very short time}} periods, for example, [...] "Six Month Smiles", this approach may not address all the features which would otherwise be treated in an extended <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatment</b> program.

30|$|Non-extraction <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments</b> are {{becoming}} more popular nowadays.

40|$|Background and aims. Since most {{orthodontic}} {{patients are}} children and adolescents, {{it is believed}} that teachers can help find these patients and make them aware of their orthodontic problems. Therefore, teachers are expected to have proper knowledge about these problems. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine teachers’ awareness about <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments</b> in Tabriz and Saqqez and compare it in different educational levels. Materials and methods. A questionnaire was given to 384 teachers (204 in Tabriz and 180 in Saqqez) in randomly selected schools of different levels. The questionnaire had 17 questions in 3 sections, including general information, age, and costs of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments.</b> The teachers’ awareness in two cities was analyzed with independent t-test and in educational levels with one-way ANOVA.

40|$|In recent years, {{the public}} demand of less {{invasive}} <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments</b> {{has led to}} the development of appliances that are smaller, lower profile and more transparent with respect to conventional brackets and wires. Among aesthetic appliances, removable thermoplastic aligners gained instant appeal to patients since able to perform comprehensive <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments</b> without sacrificing comfort issues. The aligner must deliver an appropriate force in order to move the tooth into the expected position. However, at present, the relationship between applied force and aligner properties (i. e., aligner’s thickness) is poorly understood. In this paper, a patient-specific framework has been developed to simulate orthodontic tooth movements by using aligners. In particular, a finite element model has been created in order to optimise the aligner’s thickness with regard to the magnitude of the force-moment system delivered to a mandibular central incisor during bucco-lingual tipping...|$|R

40|$|Finite element method {{analysis}} of the periodontal ligament in mandibular canine movement with transparent tooth correction treatment Yongqing Cai 1 *, Xiaoxiang Yang 2, Bingwei He 2 and Jun Yao 3 Background: This study used the 3 D finite element method to investigate canine’s displacements and stresses in the canine’s periodontal ligament (PDL) during canine’s translation, inclination, and rotation with transparent tooth correction treatment. Methods: Finite element models were developed to simulate dynamic <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments</b> of the translation, inclination, and rotation of the left mandibular canine with transparent tooth correction system. Piecewise static simulations were performed to replicate the dynamic process of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>treatments.</b> The distribution and change trends of canine’s displacements and stresses in the canine’s PDL during {{the three types of}} tooth movements were obtained.
