5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} {{recovery}} {{was made possible}} due {{to the efforts of}} the Komnenian dynasty. This is sometimes referred to as the Komnenian restoration. The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.|$|E
5|$|Arguably, {{the most}} famous {{locomotive}} {{to come out of}} the Rogers shops was built in 1855.

5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber.

However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b> In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E

2500|$|Ann Hironaka, {{author of}} Neverending Wars, divides the modern history <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> into the pre-19th century, 19th century to early 20th century, and late 20th century. In 19th-century Europe, the length <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> fell significantly, {{largely due to}} the nature of the {{conflicts}} as battles for the power center of the state, the strength of centralized governments, and the normally quick and decisive intervention by other states to support the government. Following [...] II the duration <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> grew past the norm of the pre-19th century, largely due to weakness of the many postcolonial states and the intervention by major powers on both sides of conflict. The most obvious commonality to <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> are that they occur in fragile states.|$|R
5|$|Chad's {{currency}} is the CFA franc. In the 1960s, the Mining industry of Chad produced sodium carbonate, or natron.

In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{outbreak}} of the First Muslim Civil War and the priorities on other fronts, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century. The Khazars, on their part, only launched a few raids into the Transcaucasian principalities that were loosely under Muslim dominion: in 661/662, they launched a raid into Albania but were defeated by the local prince; in 683 or 685 (also a time <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> in the Muslim world), a large-scale raid across Transcaucasia was more successful, capturing much booty and many prisoners.|$|E
5|$|During Charles' illness, Orléans became financially {{powerful}} {{as the official}} tax collector, and in the following decade Isabeau and Orléans agreed to {{raise the level of}} taxation. In 1401, during one of the King's absences, Orléans installed his own men to collect royal revenues, angering Philip the Bold who in retaliation raised an army, threatening to enter Paris with 600 men-at-arms and 60 knights. At that time Isabeau intervened between Orléans and Burgundy, preventing bloodshed and the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> on income per-capita growth {{at home and}} in neighbors for four regional groupings of countries: Africa, Asia, Latin America, and a pooled Asian and Latin American sample. Both macroeconomic and civil-war influences on growth differ by region. With the use of a distance measure, we demonstrate that the spatial reach from the negative consequences <b>of</b> a <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> are region and time period specific. Generally, there was less dispersion in Africa than in Asia and Latin America. Moreover, Africa demonstrates a greater ability to recover from the adverse effects <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> than the other regions tested. <b>Civil</b> <b>Wars,</b> Economic Growth, Spatial Econometrics, Africa, Asia, Latin America,...|$|R
