5|$|After scoring two {{consecutive}} ducks in the Test series against Sri Lanka, Pathan was elevated to {{opening in the}} second innings of the Second Test in Delhi, after regular opener Virender Sehwag was down with illness. Having taken 3/34 from 22 overs in the first innings, Pathan scored 93 runs, building <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> innings lead of 60 to help set up a winning target of 436. In the following match in Ahmedabad, he scored 82 runs and combined in a century stand with V. V. S. Laxman to revive India after an early batting collapse saw five wickets fall {{during the first half}} of the opening day. He also took seven wickets at an average of 26.00 runs in the series, which India won 2–0. Pathan later admitted that he had been disappointed in failing to score a Test century. Following his strong performances in 2005, Pathan was promoted in December to an A-grade contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.|$|E

5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> attempt after the repeated {{failure to do}} so with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in {{the last part of the}} game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1916, as his {{battalion}} attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien {{came down}} with trench fever, a disease carried by the lice. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.

Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed {{on the first day of}} the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the same battle when a German artillery shell landed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.|$|E
5|$|Sawtooth National Forest {{receives}} {{over one}} million visitors a year. Two visitor centers, one at the SNRA headquarters north of Ketchum and one at Redfish Lake, provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays and are staffed by either forest service interpreters or volunteers. The forest's ranger stations also provide these services, but without interpretive displays. Along the roadways, exhibits showcase key parts of the forest, and there are plentiful day use and picnic areas. There are more than 81 campgrounds in the forest, with 12 in the Fairfield District, 6 in the Ketchum District, 25 in the Minidoka District, and 38 in the SNRA.

5|$|The Scottish Parliament is a unicameral {{legislature}} with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and {{are elected}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> past the post system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the additional member system. MSPs serve for a four-year period (exceptionally {{five years from}} 2011–16). The Parliament nominates one of its Members, who is then appointed by the Monarch to serve as First Minister. Other ministers are appointed by the First Minister and serve at his/her discretion. Together they make up the Scottish Government, the executive arm of the devolved government. The Scottish Government is headed by the First Minister, who is accountable to the Scottish Parliament and is the minister of charge of the Scottish Government. The First Minister is also the political leader of Scotland. The Scottish Government also comprises the Deputy First Minister, currently John Swinney MSP, who deputises for the First Minister {{during a period of}} absence of overseas visits. Alongside the Deputy First Minister's requirements as Deputy, the minister also has a cabinet ministerial responsibility. Swinney is also currently Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills. The Scottish Government's cabinet comprises nine cabinet secretaries, who form the Cabinet of Scotland. There are also twelve other ministers, who work alongside the cabinet secretaries in their appointed areas. As a result, junior ministers do not attend cabinet meetings.|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>first</b> name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
