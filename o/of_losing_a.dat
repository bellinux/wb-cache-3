5|$|Homesick for Florida, Valencia {{sought to}} {{transfer}} to the University of Miami after his freshman year, even though it only offered him a modest scholarship. UNC-Greensboro initially agreed to release Valencia from his scholarship, but later refused, placing him in jeopardy <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> year of college eligibility under NCAA Division I rules. He appealed to a university committee which ruled in his favor, allowing him to leave while preserving his eligibility.|$|E
5|$|On the day decreed, Le Gris and Carrouges {{travelled}} through Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in the city's Northern suburbs. The abbey's field {{had been}} converted from a jousting ground to a wooden arena especially for the combat, surrounded by banks for the spectators and a royal box. Attending the duel {{was not only the}} King and his uncles John, Duke of Berry, Philip the Bold and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother the Duke of Orléans, but thousands of ordinary Parisians, Normans and visiting French. Thousands of people had flooded into the city {{in the days before the}} combat to see the spectacle but all had been warned not to physically aid the combatants on pain of death, nor call out during the fight on pain <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> hand.|$|E
5|$|Raw's {{role in the}} Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 was controversial. During the engagement, he {{initially}} refused to allow No. 9 Squadron to fly ammunition to D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment after it was heavily engaged and nearly surrounded, as {{he believed that the}} heavy rain at the time made flying too dangerous. The commander of the 1st Australian Task Force, Brigadier David Jackson, was angered by this decision and argued that the risk <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> few helicopters was unimportant compared to the possibility of having 200 infantrymen killed if the unit was overrun {{due to a lack of}} ammunition and other supplies. Raw eventually allowed the resupply flight to proceed after the most experienced of the helicopter pilots present stated that the mission needed to be flown regardless of its risk.|$|E

25|$|Normally {{governments can}} easily survive {{for a full}} {{parliamentary}} term on a majority of more than 20 seats over all other parties.

50|$|Some {{studies show}} that the cost <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>an</b> {{employee}} (which can include advertising for, interviewing, and training a replacement) is often greater than the cost of providing sick days to retain existing employees.

25|$|As in Guinea, {{the slave}} trade became {{the basis of the}} local economy in Angola. Excursions {{traveled}} ever farther inland to procure captives that were sold by African rulers; the primary source of these slaves were those captured as a result <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> war or inter-ethnic skirmish with other African tribes. More than a million men, women and children were shipped from Angola across the Atlantic. In this region, unlike Guinea, the trade remained largely in Portuguese hands.

25|$|Throughout this period, {{the ending}} of the Cold War led to {{dramatic}} changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons. At the same time, progress was being made on what would become the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which would ban all criticality testing. This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.|$|E

25|$|If a wicket falls {{near the}} end of a day's play, {{especially}} if the light is failing, or if the bowlers seem particularly confident, the captain may choose to send in a non-specialist batsman, referred to as a nightwatchman. If the nightwatchman does not get out before the end of that day's play then the specialist batsman will have been protected, and will not need to bat until the following day when conditions are likely to have improved. If the nightwatchman does get out, the cost <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> late wicket will have been minimised, because the specialist batsman is still available to bat.|$|E
25|$|For Major League baseball, the Metrodome {{was widely}} {{thought of as}} a hitter's park, with a low (7ft) left-field fence (343ft) that favored {{right-handed}} power hitters, and the higher (23ft) but closer (327ft) right-field Baggie that favored left-handed power hitters. Because the roof is very nearly the same color as a baseball, and transmits light, the Metrodome had a far higher error incidence than a normal stadium during day games, so instead <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> fly ball in the sun, as is common for non-roofed stadiums, fly balls could easily get lost in the ceiling. Unlike most parks built during this time, Metrodome's baseball configuration had asymmetrical outfield dimensions.|$|E
25|$|One {{positive}} outcome {{has been the}} end of jurisdictional warfare between the UFW and Teamsters. The UFW signed an agreement with the Teamsters in March 1977 in which the UFW agreed to seek to organize only those workers covered by CALRA, while the Teamsters agreed to organize all other agricultural workers. The agreement also led the UFW to end its boycott of lettuce, grapes, and wine in February 1978. Why did the two unions sign the agreement? UFW officials claimed the Teamsters were on the verge <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> <b>a</b> jurisdictional battle for 50,000 workers being decided by the ALRB, but at least one press report indicated that the scandal-scarred union wished to burnish its public image.|$|E
