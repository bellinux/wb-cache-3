5|$|The {{painted turtle}} hunts along water bottoms. It quickly juts its head {{into and out}} of {{vegetation}} to stir potential victims <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> water, where they are pursued. The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet. It also consumes plants and skims {{the surface of the water}} with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.|$|E
5|$|A {{town meeting}} is held to discuss Mr. Burns' actions. Mr. Burns arrives, {{armed with a}} gun after his {{encounter}} with Homer. Despite the whole town standing up to him, he activates the sun-blocking device, thinking himself invincible. He walks into an alley, obscured from view, and struggles with someone until a gunshot is heard. He stumbles <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> wounded, and collapses on the town's sundial. The townspeople find him and Marge tells all of them that since Mr. Burns has angered so many people recently, just about anyone {{could have been the}} shooter.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west. In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds.|$|E

5000|$|Drones will congregate to {{specific}} sites known as drone congregation areas, and queens will mate at these sites {{when she is}} out on her mating flight. When a queen encounters a drone, she can choose to exercise choice of mates before mating, although there is currently no evidence of this preferential treatment. A drone will then hold on to a queen and turn his endophallus inside <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>opened</b> sting chamber of the queen. This then will paralyze him, and the distal part of his genitalia will break off the sting chamber will be filled with sperm. The queen will then return from her mating sight with a mating sign that protrudes from the sting chamber ...|$|R

5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey {{came out from}} cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E
5|$|This corvid {{is known}} to join mixed-species flocks with other species {{including}} unicolored jays and emerald toucanets. It is also known to travel in groups with two to ten other azure-hooded jays. It is a skulking and secretive species, rarely coming <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b> Because of this habit, the bird {{is extremely difficult to}} observe in the wild and not much is known about its ecology. Mates are known to preen each other, a process which entails one bird bending over {{in front of the other}} and tugging on its throat feathers. The feathers of the crown are often moving swiftly, and it is believed that the condition of a mate can be determined by this movement.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy {{took his}} men {{around the bend}} behind cover, then sent his American medic, Corporal John Alan Coey of Columbus, Ohio, <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> {{streambed}} to render medical assistance. Though his prominent Red Cross flag was clearly visible, the hidden cadres immediately opened fire on Coey, who was killed almost instantly by a shot through the head. His body fell at du Plooy's feet. The stand-off continued {{for the rest of}} the day, during which time du Plooy and one other RLI man were wounded. The security forces were only able to gather their dead for evacuation when darkness fell. During the night, the Rhodesians deployed stops in ambush positions around the insurgents' position to prevent an escape. When the guerrillas attempted to sneak through the security force perimeter in the early hours, they ran into Corporal Jannie de Beer's RLI men and a fire fight ensued; the nationalists shot de Beer dead and wounded one of his troopers as they broke through and quickly left the area. The morale of 2 Commando's men took a noticeable hit after this unsuccessful Fireforce in which the cadres had killed four Rhodesian soldiers and wounded four more.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jeffrey Lockwood, {{author of}} [...] (a book about EW), the {{earliest}} incident of entomological warfare {{was probably the}} use of bees by early humans. The bees or their nests were thrown into caves to force <b>the</b> enemy <b>out</b> and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b> Lockwood theorizes that the Ark of the Covenant may have been deadly when opened because it contained deadly fleas.|$|R

5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} the platoon, including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As night fell the North Vietnamese refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying more than two dozen wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through the North Vietnamese lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again stepped <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven {{other members of the}} platoon were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded. The North Vietnamese forces lost 49.|$|E
25|$|American commanders, in particular, {{misunderstood}} the impassability of {{the dense}} Hürtgen Forest {{and its effects}} of reducing artillery effectiveness and making air support impracticable. The better alternative of breaking through south-east <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> valley where their advantages in mobility and airpower could come into play and then head northeast towards the actual objectives {{seems not to have}} been really considered by the higher headquarters.|$|E
25|$|Only {{two out of}} six bunkers {{targeted}} for capture were subsequently occupied, and the Australians attempted to flush the Chinese <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b> However, the assaulting force was unable to dislodge the remaining Chinese defenders, nor were they able to capture a prisoner. A Company remained in possession of Hill 227 stronghold for 90 minutes, before being directed to withdraw due to running out of ammunition.|$|E
50|$|Preferred {{habitat of}} Galaxias vulgaris is fast flowing {{sections}} of stream which are well aerated and with open tussock grassland. Here, they inhabit the areas between and under rocks {{during the day}} and venture <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> more <b>open</b> areas of water to feed in the evening and night as Galaxias vulgaris generalized is solitary, nocturnal and largely cryptic invertebrate predator. Due to introduced trout, they are often excluded from the main base of rivers, or smaller over crowded rivers, but they can be found in side braids and tributaries.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. This {{could not be a}} visitor at so late an hour. A patient, evidently, and {{possibly}} an all-night sitting.

60|$|When {{the captain}} had gone <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> air, he was {{followed}} {{by the rest of the}} party, for, if there were no danger, they all wanted to see what was to be seen. What they saw was a party of six black men on the plateau, Maka in the lead. There could be no doubt that the newcomers were the remainder of the party of Africans who had been enslaved by the Rackbirds, and the desire of the captain and his companions to know how they had got away, and what news they brought, was most intense.|$|R
25|$|When Gates {{arrived at}} Jamestown, {{he decided to}} {{evacuate}} the settlement because he thought the government's plan was not feasible. As the colonists were about to leave the Bay and head <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea, they were met by the incoming fleet of Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. Taking command as governor, de la Warre ordered the fort reoccupied. He plotted conquest of the surrounding tribes.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{eventually}} became a waiting game in which the Muslims {{did not want to}} attack an army that could possibly be numerically superior and wanted the Franks to come <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b> The Franks formed up in a thick defensive formation and waited for them to charge uphill. The battle finally began on the seventh day, as 'Abd-al-Raḥmân did not want to wait any longer with winter approaching.|$|E
25|$|While chasing Napoleon, di Borgo {{stretches}} a rope {{across a}} road that Napoleon is likely to take. As expected, Napoleon rides toward the rope, but he draws his saber and cuts it down. Napoleon continues at high speed to the shore where he finds a small boat. He abandons the horse and gets into the boat, discovering {{that it has no}} oars or sail. He unfurls the French flag from Ajaccio and uses it as a sail. He is drawn <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea.|$|E
60|$|A {{little before}} twelve o'clock Mrs. Stonehouse and Pearl arrived, and were shown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> room where Lady de Lannoy awaited them. The high sun, {{streaming}} {{in from the}} side, shone on her beautiful hair, making it look like living gold. When the Americans came in they were for an instant entranced by her beauty. One glance at Mrs. Stonehouse's sweet sympathetic face was enough to establish her in Stephen's good graces forever. As for Pearl, she was like one who has unexpectedly seen a fairy or a goddess. She had been keeping guardedly behind her mother, but on the instant she came <b>out</b> fearlessly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b>|$|R
60|$|But here, as at {{the other}} prisons, there was a method {{in the work of}} murder. The agents of the Commune took {{possession}} of the hall at the entrance and permitted none to pass farther <b>into</b> <b>the</b> prison, the warders and officials bringing down the prisoners in batches, and so handing them over for slaughter. In vain Harry tried to penetrate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inner part of the prison. He was roughly repulsed by the men guarding the door; and at last, finding that nothing could be done, he forced his way <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> air, and hurrying away for some distance, threw himself on the ground and burst into a passion of tears.|$|R
6000|$|From out {{the screen}} of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a miner's pick and shovel and gold-pan. Then he crawled <b>out</b> himself <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b> He was clad in faded {{overalls}} and black cotton shirt, with hobnailed brogans on his feet, and on his head a hat whose shapelessness and stains advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and camp-smoke. He stood erect, seeing wide-eyed the secrecy of the scene and sensuously inhaling the warm, sweet breath of the canyon-garden through nostrils that dilated and quivered with delight. His eyes narrowed to laughing slits of blue, his face wreathed itself in joy, and his mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud: ...|$|R
25|$|Although {{it is his}} {{intention}} to avoid notice, Caine's training and sense of social responsibility repeatedly force him <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> to fight for justice or protect the underdog. After each such encounter he must move on, both to avoid capture and prevent harm from coming to those he has helped. Searching for his family, he meets a preacher (played by real-life father John Carradine) and his mute sidekick Sonny Jim (played by brother Robert Carradine), then his grandfather (played by Dean Jagger).|$|E
25|$|Plesiosaurus fed on belemnites, {{fish and}} other prey. Its U-shaped jaw and sharp teeth {{would have been like}} a fish trap. It {{propelled}} itself by the paddles, the tail being too short to be of much use. Its neck could have been used as a rudder when navigating during a chase. It is unknown if Plesiosaurus laid eggs on land like sea turtles or gave live birth in the water like sea snakes. The young might have lived in estuaries before moving <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> ocean.|$|E
25|$|The Nixon administration, {{looking for}} a way out, pursued a less {{restrained}} course under the brief but devastating Operation Linebacker and Operation Linebacker II bombing raids. These attacks removed many of the restrictions upon previous American targeting, seeded Northern waters with mines that cut Soviet and Chinese imports to a trickle, exhausted national air-defenses and crippled whatever significant remaining industrial plant and transportation network was left in the North. LINEBACKER caused more damage to Northern lines of communication, than the previous 3 years of ROLLING THUNDER, particularly as the Easter Offensive brought communist forces <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Swift, {{in writing}} this [...] "Proposal," [...] {{did not take}} {{advantage}} of any [...] special occasion, as he did later in the matter of Wood's [...] halfpence.

60|$|He turned away, leaving Hemmingway {{standing}} in the doorway still distraught and hesitating. Nor did the young man recognize the delicacy of Jules' leave-taking until he had unstrapped his portmanteau and found himself alone, free to make his toilet, unembarrassed by company. But even then he would have preferred the rough companionship of the miners in the common dormitory of the general store to this intrusion upon the half-civilization of the women, their pitiable little comforts and secret makeshifts. His disgust of his own indecision which brought him there naturally recoiled in the direction of his host and hostesses, and after a hurried ablution, a change of linen, and an attempt to remove the stains of travel from his clothes, he strode <b>out</b> impatiently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> air again.|$|R
60|$|It {{was half}} an hour before he went on again with his {{garments}} ensanguined as the result of Alton's treatment with the knife, and he gasped with relief when after a march of four miles, which occupied most of {{what was left of the}} day, they came <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> more <b>open</b> spaces of a big brulee. Some time in the hot autumn a fire had passed that way, and the great trees towered above them, stripped and blackened columns, that seemed to stretch between earth and sky. There was no limb left them, and they rose, majestic in their cylindrical symmetry, in apparently endless battalions, a vista of plutonic desolation. Underfoot there was charcoal, and feathery ashes that whirled aloft, and sprinkling the men with a fine grey powder slowly settled again.|$|R
25|$|In January, 1866 Russian ships {{appeared}} {{on the east coast}} of Korea demanding trading and residency rights in what seemed an echo of the demands made on China by other western powers. Native Korean Christians, with connections at court, saw in this an opportunity to advance their cause and suggested an alliance between France and Korea to repel the Russian advances, suggesting further that this alliance could be negotiated through Bishop Berneux. The Heungseon Daewongun seemed open to this idea, though it is uncertain whether this was ruse to bring the head of the Korean Catholic Church <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open.</b> Berneux was summoned to the capital, but upon his arrival in February 1866, he was seized and executed. A roundup then began of the other French Catholic priests and native converts.|$|E
25|$|Web-based spiders have poor spatial {{appreciation}} and {{get much of}} their information from reading tensions and movement in their web. P. africana, P. fimbraba and P. labiata can use their eight legs and two palps to pluck another spider's web with a virtually unlimited range of movements, using a trial and error method, until it finds and repeats a set of movements that either lures the prey <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> or calms the prey while the Portia walks slowly close enough to bite the victim. If the prey stops being controlled by the sequence, the Portia tries new combinations until one works, and then repeats the new sequence. While such hunting shows use of least short-term memory, as of 2011 researchers {{do not know how}} long a Portia can retain such memories nor whether a Portia may use different trial and error starts for some prey species.|$|E
25|$|Pat disowned his {{entertainer}} father, Simon Reynolds, {{when the}} latter {{came out as}} a homosexual. Simon has made efforts to reconcile with his son, which Pat has disgustedly repulsed. The entire topic of his father is off limits to Pat, suggesting repression issues. The comic has hinted at this complexity of his character for some time. In 2006, his own latent homosexuality was forced <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> by the magical Mexican realism camera. Apparently both Pat and his father magically became homosexual due to the curse of Gladdington castle, wherein an ancestor of theirs was cursed such that all of his sons and their sons thereafter would become homosexual {{at the age of}} 26. Pat has since become much more comfortable about his homosexuality, using perceived persecution as just another reason to be angry at the world, and has been dating Rod Huggins, a gay porn star.|$|E
60|$|He {{unlocked}} a gate {{with a key}} {{which he}} took from his pocket, and hand in hand they ascended a steep path which led between a grove of pine trees. <b>Out</b> once more <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>open,</b> they crossed a patch of green turf and came to another gate, set in a stone wall. This also Rochester opened. A few more yards, and they climbed up to the masses of tumbled rock which lay about on {{the summit of the}} hill.|$|R
60|$|His companions were wiry, dark-faced and dark-haired {{men whose}} French-Canadian blood had in it {{a strain of}} the Indian--hard to beat at river work or travel through the wilds. Toiling strenuously, they drove the light craft over the short seas, with the spray {{whipping}} their faces and the foam washing in at the bows. Now and then they made no headway {{for a minute or}} two against a savage gust, but when it lulled they slowly forged on again, though they knew that to find a canoe among the maze of islands was as difficult a task as could be set them. When they labored <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> more <b>open</b> spaces of <b>the</b> lake as dusk was closing in, Carnally roused himself to keen alertness.

30|$|So, it is {{not right}} to say that the Impersonal idea will lead to a {{tremendous}} amount of evil in the world, as if the other doctrine never lent itself to works of evil, as if it did not lead to sectarianism deluging the world with blood and causing men to tear each other to pieces. ‘My God is the greatest God, let us decide it by a free fight’. That is the outcome of dualism all over <b>the</b> world.
