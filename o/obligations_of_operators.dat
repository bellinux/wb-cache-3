40|$|On 20 October 2010, a new European Union Regulation {{was adopted}} {{detailing}} the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> who place timber and timber {{products on the}} market. This landmark legislation aims to eliminate illegal timber from the European markets by introducing ‘due diligence’ requirements and prohibition requirement to place illegal timber on the market. Despite its far-reaching objectives, the decision-making process within the EU has led to significant compromises that could, in the future, hinder the Regulation's effectiveness. This article analyzes controversial provisions of the Regulation, such as the ‘simple prohibition requirement’ and the penalty system, {{as well as their}} history. The Regulation is also compared to the Lacey Act in the United States, and differences between these two pieces of legislation and their significance are explained.

This article presents the analysis of the national system of harvested timber registration on its compliance with the latest EU initiatives. The system of voluntary certification scheme FSC meets the requirements on the control of sources of raw timber origin.

40|$|The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decided {{cases in}} 2008 that {{addressed}} {{the scope of}} agency discretion in several contexts. In an issue of first impression under the Clean Air Act (CAA),the {{court held that the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) properly exercised its discretion in not objecting to the issuance of an operating permit to a power company that the agency had earlier formally accused of violating the CAA. In another case, the court held that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had the discretion to protect endangered species while administering the National Flood Insurance Act and thus was required to comply with the Endangered Species Act to ensure that its actions did not jeopardize endangered species. In a case involving the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the court held that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida had not afforded the EPA the proper deference in reviewing the agency’s Environmental Impact Statement prepared pursuant to NEPA, and the agency’s subsequent decision to issue Clean Water Act permits allowing mining in wetlands. The court also held that the EPA did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in issuing a final rule altering the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> of underground injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Finally, the court held that the government’s remediation plan at a federal facility that had not been listed on the National Priorities List was selected pursuant to provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act that deprived the federal district court of jurisdiction to hear a citizen suit challenging the sufficiency of the plan...|$|E
40|$|According to data {{collected}} from Dolomiti Superski, in the season 2013 / 2014 nearly ten million days of ski passes have been sold {{for a total of}} about 149 million "beeps", and that only in the Alpine area that ranges from San Martino di Castrozza to Plan de Corones, Val di Fassa, Alta Pusteria. These data give a measure of the size reached by this sport nowadays. Beautiful landscapes and bashed slopes, that seem snooker tables, attract millions of enthusiasts every winter, children and adults, from beginners to the more experienced ones. Unfortunately, due to the crowding of ski areas, due to the harsh weather conditions occurring sometimes, due to the imprudent skiers or careless operators of the lifts or ski instructors, accidents occur as a result of which often skiers suffer damage, even serious ones, and hence the assault to the Courts to ask for compensation. The legislator, pushed by the growing number of the ski area visitors and, with it, the number of accidents, enacted Law 363 / 2003 in order to regulate the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>operators</b> of ski areas and the behavior of skiers. The main purpose of this law is to prevent accidents through a more careful and aware exploit of the slopes, both on the part of managers and users [...] . but once the incident occurred, however, the law in question fails to provide operators with the right elements to determine the consequences of accidents, and respond to requests for damages. The article 4 of Law n. 363 / 2003, for example, states that, in case of accidenti s identifiable a civil liability of the operator of ski areas, but it gives no indications about the nature of that responsibility. No Law, nor the 363 / 2003 or L. n. 81 / 1991 - specifically dedicated to the profession of the ski instructor - tells us if the ski instructor can be considered responsible for the damages occurred to the pupils during lessons and which kind of responsibility the ski instructor has to face. In absence of law evidence, the search for criteria and solutions about the responsibility of the operator, the ski instructor, the school, the costumer, in case of an accident, is left to the ingeniousness of the interpreters. The task assigned to the jurist is complex and intricate because the field of civil liability is full of nuances and the reality of the litigation is varied and multifaceted: the same ski accident is often assessed either through the rules of tort liability either through those of the contractual liability, with significant differences in terms of burden of proof and time limitation for the actor. ...|$|E

40|$|The European Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive 96 / 61 /EC aims to {{introduce}} a European-wide system of integrated prevention and control of pollution {{in order to secure}} a high level of protection to the environment as a whole. It places obligations on the Member States (MS) {{to introduce}} controls that ensure operators comply with the Directive. In this framework, {{as a part of the}} implementation process leading to formal accession of Cyprus to the European Union, the National Technical University of Athens has examined all documents related to the Best Available Techniques (BATs) published by Institutes and Organisations, such as the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies in Spain, the Environmental Protection Agency in Ireland, the World Bank Group and the Ministry for the Environment, Planning and Public Works in Greece. A series of guidelines were developed for the application of BATs for 14 categories of the Cypriot industry that fall into the IPPC Directive. The concept of BATs plays a central role in the Directive because it provides a basis for setting Emission Limit Values (ELVs) as well as the principal benchmark for determining the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>operators</b> in respect <b>of</b> pollution prevention and control.

It begins with a description of the development of European Union electronic communications legislation, the currently valid Electronic Communications Act and its relation to the Code of Administrative Procedure. The paper then presents the legal regulation of administrative supervision, competition law, public consultation procedure, notification procedure and the procedural regulation of adopting a measure of general nature. The authority and the organization of the Czech Telecommunication Office (CTO) and a classification of the business models used by mobile virtual network operators is then detailed. The second part of the text addresses legal rules directly governing mobile virtual operators, commencing with the legal prerequisites for the provision of electronic communications services and a notification of intention to commence the provision of these services. A thorough exploration of the legal regulation of the access and interconnection and reference offers based upon this regulation is then included. The paper [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Intelligent Transport System (ITS) {{technology}} {{is seen as}} a cost-effective way to increase the conspicuity of approaching trains and the effectiveness of train warnings at level crossings by providing an in-vehicle warning of an approaching train. The {{technology is}} often seen as a potential low-cost alternative to upgrading passive level crossings with traditional active warning systems (flashing lights and boom barriers). ITS platforms provide sensor, localization and dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technologies to support cooperative applications such as collision avoidance for road vehicles. In recent years, in-vehicle warning systems based on ITS technology have been trialed at numerous locations around Australia, at level crossing sites with active and passive controls. While significant research has been conducted on the benefits of the technology in nominal operating modes, little research has focused on the effects of the failure modes, the human factors implications of unreliable warnings and the technology adoption process from the railway industry’s perspective. Many ITS technology suppliers originate from the road industry and often have limited awareness of the safety assurance requirements, operational requirements and legal <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> railway <b>operators.</b> This paper aims to raise awareness of these issues and start a discussion on how such technology could be adopted. This paper will describe several ITS implementation cenarios and discuss failure modes, human factors considerations and the impact these scenarios are likely to have in terms of safety, railway safety assurance requirements and the practicability of meeting these requirements. The paper will identify the key obstacles impeding the adoption of ITS systems for the different implementation scenarios and a possible path forward towards the adoption of ITS technology...|$|R
40|$|Air {{transport}} {{is subject}} to various risks. One of them is bird strike hazard. Despite numerous regulations concerning prevention from this type of occurrence, {{it is not possible}} to eliminate them entirely. Bird strikes most often take place during take-off and landing, that is on or in the vicinity of an airport. For that reason airport operators are the first parties that can be made accountable for this occurence. International law imposes numerous responsibilities on airport <b>operators</b> in terms <b>of</b> bird strike hazard prevention on air operations, thus placing airport operators in a “key position” in the system of safety. However, the party that suffers significant damages in the first instance, is the aircraft operator. If a bird strike takes place on or in the vicinity of an airport, an aicraft operator can sue the airport <b>operator</b> for compensation <b>of</b> damages. Generally, the issue of indemnity {{is subject to}} out of court negotiations, however instances in which there is a lack of agreement between the parties, i. e. airport operator, aircraft operator or their insurers, lead to legal proceedings for compensation.

This difference of treatment {{raises questions about the}} drivers of the European Commission actions. Understanding and grabbing the main differences between the national hydropower regimes is then of particular interest. This report aims at providing a benchmarking of hydropower concession regimes in Europe, describing hydropower regimes in 14 European countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, France, Germany, Great-Britain, Greece, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) and regions when appropriate (e. g. cantons in Switzerland or Lands/States in Germany).

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain.
