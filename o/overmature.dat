The Santiago River Member is composed of limestones and calcareous sandstones. The Yuquianza Member is a monotonous sequence of black shales. The Patuca Member consists of a sequence of sandstones, greywackes, and shales, intercalated with lava flows and dikes. The fine-grained sediments of the three members are characterized by a high content of particulate organic matter (POM).

40|$|Complex {{dielectric}} variations {{can address}} neatly the maturity of organic-rich mudrocks. We, therefore, apply an open hemispherical cavity resonator to measure complex dielectric permitivitties of five thin sections of oil (bakken) shales (with different maturity) of ∼ 30 μm thickness on glass-substrates around 2. 15 mm thick in 100 - 165 GHz. The real part of complex dielectric permittivity (ϵ_re) are constant but show {{significant differences in}} magnitude based on maturity: (1) lowest, ∼ 1. 9, for immature or early maturation stage, (2) higher than the immature one, ∼ 3. 0 (also bundled up together), for three oil-matured stages, and (3) highest, ∼ 4. 9, for late or <b>overmatured</b> stage.

5000|$|Harvesting vanilla fruits is as labor-intensive as pollinating the blossoms. Immature, {{dark green}} pods are not harvested.

[...] "Current methods for determining the maturity of vanilla (Vanilla planifolia Andrews) beans are unreliable. Yellowing at the blossom end, the current index, occurs before beans accumulate maximum glucovanillin concentrations. Beans left on the vine until they turn brown have higher glucovanillin concentrations but may split and have low quality. Judging bean maturity is difficult as they reach full size soon after pollination. Glucovanillin accumulates from 20 weeks, maximum about 40 weeks after pollination. Mature green beans have 20% dry matter but less than 2% glucovanillin." [...] The accumulation of dry matter and glucovanillin are highly correlated.To ensure the finest flavor from every fruit, each individual pod must be picked by hand just as it begins to split on the end. <b>Overmatured</b> fruits are likely to split, causing a reduction in market value.

50|$|Clear cutting {{areas for}} even-aged timber {{management}} can also benefit many wildlife species. The abundance of coarse woody debris {{added to the}} forest floor is beneficial to salamander and snake species, while the release of understory shrubs provides an increase of berry-foraging opportunities for bear and songbirds. In general, the immature, grassy forest regenerated after a clear cut fulfills specific habitat requirements for many species that cannot be found in mature forests. In the boreal forest, for example, wildfire has been suppressed by humans, resulting in many <b>overmature</b> stands. Even aged timber management restores the successional cycle and allows early successional species to recolonize immature habitat.|$|E

A major influence on local hydrocarbon-maturation levels on Queen Charlotte Islands is proximity to the mostly Jurassic and Cenozoic igneous plutons. Similar potential-field anomalies suggest massive igneous bodies may be present beneath eastern Queen Charlotte Sound, and correlations with mainland igneous suites of the Anahim Volcanic Belt put their age at Miocene.

Depositional environments of this group include lakes, swamps, and floodplains. This group is the economic basement of the Halibut Field, meaning it is the stratigraphically lowest group for hydrocarbon production potential. This is known due to burial of 8 km or more in the offshore portion of the basin, which places the group in the <b>overmature</b> range.

50|$|Red {{ring rot}} {{is one of}} the most common and {{destructive}} heart rot pathogens in the Western United States. In Engelmann spruce it is the most common type of fungal decay and causes the largest decay columns of all the fungal heart rots, rendering the tree useless for harvesting. It is a particularly important disease in lodgepole pine and subalpine fir as well. Studies have shown that 64% of all defects in these three species were caused by Phellinus pini. It has been estimated that over three-fourths of the total 17% of decayed, <b>overmature</b> Douglas-fir is the Pacific Northwest were in decline due to red ring rot. Apart from the economic impacts of this disease, red ring rot decay may lead to mechanical failure of live trees, which may cause a potential hazard in recreational or public areas.|$|E
50|$|The spruce beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby (formerly D. obesus Mannerheim (== D. engelmanni Hopk.), about 6 mm long, {{is one of}} {{the larger}} bark beetles found in spruce (Rose and Lindquist 1985).

Outbreaks of the spruce beetle, a transcontinental North American species, have been devastating to white and Engelmann spruces throughout western North America, from Arizona to Alaska, while smaller outbreaks have occurred in Alberta and Saskatchewan (Ives and Wong 1988). The spruce beetle is the most serious pest of mature and <b>overmature</b> interior spruce in British Columbia (Cottrell 1978); small-diameter, rapidly growing trees were least susceptible to attack or death from spruce beetle and the greater susceptibility of large-diameter, slowlygrowing trees was more closely related to recent radial growth than to diameter (Hard et al. 1983).

5000|$|The Newfoundland marten {{range is}} now {{condensed}} into approximately 13,000 square kilometers {{in the western}} part of the island, with a large portion of key habitat in the Little Grand Lake area. Due to the unregulated pulpwood harvest during the last century, the forest age-class distribution is skewed to the younger regeneration stage of forest succession, which led to the majority of the island being contiguous blocks of second-growth forest. The behavioral patterns of habitat use by Newfoundland martens are altered by the ecological conditions of low prey biomass and high natural forest fragmentation that occur in Newfoundland. A wide spectrum of habitat types are used throughout the geographic range, however, it has been found the Newfoundland Marten has a strong association with old successional forest. Old-growth forest is defined as unharvested stands that are older than 80 years of age. [...] The stand-scale habitat use includes mature coniferous forest being the dominant cover types used proportionately more than the availability, along with coniferous scrub and insect-defoliated stands used in proportion to the availability, whereas open areas and fire disturbed area are avoided. However, the fire disturbance is minimized because of the lack of prolonged dry periods on the island. Due to infrequent fires, the episodic defoliation by the spruce budworm and hemlock looper are the primary form of natural stand-replacing disturbance. Newfoundland martens have a preference to mature (61-80 years old) and over mature (>80 years old) coniferous stands since it is critical for foraging habitat. More recent studies have found that martens will use forests with a variety of height and canopy closure conditions creating a wider variety of habitat types than previously thought; this variety includes areas that are disturbed by insects, mid-successional forests, precommercially thinned forests, along with the areas of mature and <b>overmature</b> forests.|$|E

Better understanding of organic carbon structure and nanostructure constitutes a key point for estimating the oil and gas in-place at the local and basinal scale. Here we characterize, a maturation series from Mississippian Barnett Shale at multiple scales down to the nanometer scale. Organic petrography, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and Raman microspectroscopy are used to determine the organic matter properties (e. g. maturity, type, TOC content). Organic pore network attributes (e. g. pore size distribution, surface area, polyaromatic layers characteristics) are estimated using low-pressure gas adsorption analyses and direct imaging by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Based on Raman data we show that Barnett Shale organic matter has only reached the level of carbonization, even within <b>overmature</b> samples; graphitization has not yet been triggered. Interestingly, the investigated samples exhibit an additional broad Raman band centered at about 1480 cm- 1, likely due to the presence of retained hydrocarbons within the organic matter nanoporosity. Low pressure gas adsorption analyses evidence a positive correlation between surface areas, mesopores (pores of about 2 - 50 nm of diameter) and maturity level. HRTEM images confirm Raman data: even the <b>overmature</b> organic matter remains disordered. Such disorientation of nanometer-sized polyaromatic layers creates a nanoporosity network in organic matter that appears mostly developed in samples of gas window maturity.

Few data exist, however, on the utility of set-aside plantations for this purpose, or {{the value of this}} habitat type for biodiversity relative to old-growth semi-natural ecosystems. Here, we evaluate the contribution of forest type relative to habitat characteristics in determining species richness and composition in seven forest blocks, each containing an ancient old-growth stand (> 1000 yrs) paired with a set-aside even-aged planted stand (ca. 180 yrs). We investigated the functionally important yet relatively neglected ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), a group for which the importance of forest age has not been assessed in broadleaved forests. We found that forest type was not an important determinant of EMF species richness or composition, demonstrating that set-aside can be an effective option for conserving ancient EMF communities. Species richness of above-ground EMF fruiting bodies was principally related to the basal area of the stand (a correlate of canopy cover) and tree species diversity, whilst richness of below-ground ectomycorrhizae was driven only by tree diversity.

After pepsin digestion, the % recovery of total phenolics, relative to the original starting material, increased, whereas the % anthocyanins did not change. Following pancreatic digestion and dialysis, the total phenolics in the IN (serum-available) fraction was about 26 – 30 % and the OUT (colon-available) fraction was about 77 – 101 %. The anthocyanin content in the IN fraction was 15 – 21 %, and in the OUT fraction, it was 52 – 67 %. Skeena, Lapins, and Sweetheart cultivars contained higher levels of total phenolics and anthocyanins, which resulted in higher concentrations of these compounds in the IN and OUT fractions. The potential bioavailability of phenolic compounds was also assessed in Bing and Lapins cultivars at three ripening stages. Immature cherries had higher % total phenolics in the IN fraction than mature or <b>overmature</b> cherries. However, immature cherries had the lowest concentrations of these compounds, making the actual bioavailable amounts of these compounds lower than for mature and <b>overmature</b> fruit.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Peas (Pisum sativum) are an {{important}} constituent in the diet of many people. Peas may be cooked and eaten as green peas shortly after harvest, stored for short periods in the pods, or, after suitable treatment, stored for long periods before consumption. Many factors influence the yield and quality of frozen peas but maturity requires careful consideration because of the relation of maturity to color, flavor, and texture. The objectives of this thesis were {{to determine the effect}} of the maturity stage {{on the quality of the}} frozen peas during processing and storage and to correlate the interactions between the sensory evaluation panel with the physical and chemical quality factors measured. Venus pea variety grown under commercial conditions at the Sublimity area east of Salem, Oregon, were used in this study. The trials were randomized, for three stages of maturity with three replications per each stage of maturity. Each of the three maturity stages was harvested; vined; blanched by steaming at 98. 8 °C (210 °F) for 30 sec for the immature peas, 60 sec for the mature peas, and 90 sec for the <b>overmature</b> peas; frozen at - 37. 2 °C (- 35 °F) for 24 hr in an air blast freezer and stored at - 23. 3 °C (- 10 °F) for 4 and 8 month. During processing and. storage the following factors were determined: tenderometer value, total solids, alcohol insoluble solids, peroxidase activity, ascorbic acid., total sugars and sensory evaluation. In the sensory evaluation analysis starchiness, sweetness and tenderness intensity, as well as texture, flavor and overall desirability were measured. Analysis of variance and least significant difference were used to compare the effect of pea maturity during processing and storage on the different quality factors measured. Correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationship between these factors. Immature peas had lower tenderometer value than <b>overmature</b> peas. Tenderometer value of peas decreased, during processing. The highest total solids content was observed, in the <b>overmature</b> peas and the lowest total solids content in the immature peas. This behavior was also observed in the alcohol insoluble solids content. Raw peas in the three maturity stages had the same initial peroxidase activity and the significant effect of the maturity level found in the residual peroxidase was affected by the different blanching time applied at each maturity stage. The ascorbic acid content was significantly affected, by the maturity level and was reduced during the blanching treatment. Total soluble sugar content was higher in immature peas and lower in <b>overmature</b> peas. All the sensory evaluation parameters measured were affected by the maturity. In general, the taste panel found higher flavor desirability on the mature peas but when texture and overall desirability were measured immature and mature peas were equally preferred. Significant correlations were found between physical, chemical, and sensory parameters analyzed, some of them are tenderometer value and alcohol insoluble solids; total solids and alcohol insoluble solids; alcohol insoluble solids and overall desirability...|$|E

Some gas seeps including the one at Himriganga are characterized as those of thermal origin, whereas some others are of bacterial origin. The gas seeps, in general, are characterized by high nitrogen concentration. On the other hand, gas shows in the wells, namely, JMI#â, Nurpur#á (both Dharamsala Formation) are methane rich with small nitrogen concentration and are dry gases of thermogenic origin (C 2 + < 2 % in JMI#â). Carbon isotopic composition of methane in these wells suggests a deep <b>overmature</b> source for these gases (δ 13 C 1 ~- 32. 0 ‰). Coals/carbonaceous shales within the underlying deeply buried Subathu are believed to be the probable source rocks for this gas as Dharamsala Formation has no source potential. The outcrop studies have also suggested poor organic matter richness and remaining hydrocarbon generation potential in samples representing different formations, however, the coals within Subathu exhibit better chance to have acted as source rock for gaseous hydrocarbons wherever they are developed in the subsurface. The genesis of nitrogen and the factors controlling its distribution in natural gases are poorly understood. However, nitrogen may be an important component to define deeply buried humic (coaly) source rock or other <b>overmature</b> source rocks (e. g., Proterozoics).
