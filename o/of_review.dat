5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board <b>of</b> <b>review,</b> a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board <b>of</b> <b>Review</b> consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for Boys on life-saving and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards <b>of</b> <b>review.</b> Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board <b>of</b> <b>Review</b> had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no one would ever earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board <b>of</b> <b>Review,</b> the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E

5|$|Eldred {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Oceanside, Long Island, New York by his mother after his father died. Eldred’s older brother, Hubert W. Eldred, was {{instrumental}} in starting Troop 1 of Oceanside, Long Island, New York in November 1910. Troop1 was fully uniformed and their appearance so impressed Chief Scout Executive James E. West that he asked the troop to serve as honor guard for the visit of Baden-Powell, the founder of Scouting. West paid the expenses for the troop to travel to New York harbor for Baden-Powell's arrival {{in the morning of}} January 31, 1912. Baden-Powell inspected Troop1, and spoke with Eldred at some length.

We provided these review history lists to three Ph.D. {{students who were}} experienced online buyers. Their feedback suggested that 10 and 40 reviews could be treated as low number <b>of</b> <b>reviews,</b> but a list with only 10 reviews was usually not enough to form an attitude towards an advisor. Therefore, we set the value <b>of</b> low <b>review</b> number to 40. The feedback also suggested that a list with 200 reviews was beyond normal processing capacity, so we set the value <b>of</b> high <b>review</b> number to 200.|$|R

Moreover, the percentage <b>of</b> negative <b>reviews</b> has a greater effect than that <b>of</b> positive <b>reviews,</b> confirming the negativity bias.

Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, the scope <b>of</b> <b>review</b> is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the scope <b>of</b> <b>review</b> extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E
