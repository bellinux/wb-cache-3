5|$|The plot of Strawberry Panic! {{revolves}} around the lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools which share a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story {{revolves around}}, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds {{trying to work out}} where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill.

60|$|There is no harder {{scientific}} fact in {{the world}} than the fact that belief can be produced in practically unlimited quantity and intensity, without observation or reasoning, and even in defiance of both, by the simple desire to believe founded on a strong interest in believing. Everybody recognizes this {{in the case of the}} amatory infatuations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescents</b> who see angels and heroes in obviously (to others) commonplace and even objectionable maidens and youths. But it holds good over the entire field of human activity. The hardest-headed materialist will become a consulter of table-rappers and slate-writers if he loses a child or a wife so beloved that the desire to revive and communicate with them becomes irresistible. The cobbler believes that there is nothing like leather. The Imperialist who regards the conquest of England by a foreign power as the worst of political misfortunes believes that the conquest of a foreign power by England would be a boon to the conquered. Doctors are no more proof against such illusions than other men. Can anyone then doubt that under existing conditions a great deal of unnecessary and mischievous operating is bound to go on, and that patients are encouraged to imagine that modern surgery and anesthesia have made operations much less serious matters than they really are? When doctors write or speak to the public about operations, they imply, and often say in so many words, that chloroform has made surgery painless. People who have been operated on know better. The patient does not feel the knife, and the operation is therefore enormously facilitated for the surgeon; but the patient pays for the anesthesia with hours of wretched sickness; and when that is over there is the pain of the wound made by the surgeon, which has to heal like any other wound. This is why operating surgeons, who are usually out of the house with their fee in their pockets before the patient has recovered consciousness, and who therefore see nothing of the suffering witnessed by the general practitioner and the nurse, occasionally talk of operations very much as the hangman in Barnaby Rudge talked of executions, as if being operated on were a luxury in sensation as well as in price.|$|E

(Psychology) <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to examine the {{influence}} that the parent-child relationship has over development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> This isdone through <b>the</b> theoretical concept <b>of</b> individuation. <b>The</b> basic assumption <b>of</b> {{this study is}} that it is not only <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> that undergoes certain developmental changes during individuation, but that the relationship context wherein he finds himself, also changes. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> and his context influence one another mutually. Individuation does not just pose certain demands on <b>the</b> <b>adolescent,</b> but also on the parent-adolescent relationship as well as the family system. It is also evident that family functioning has an important influence over the type and quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent-adolescent relationship. Therefore the dynamic interaction between family functioning, <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent-adolescent relationship, and <b>the</b> personality development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> is being examined according to developmental theories as well as the family system approach. In order to examine the relation between <b>the</b> personality characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> and <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parent-adolescent relationship, a single conceptual model is used in which the common theoretical traits that occur in both the developmental and systems approach, is integrated.

40|$|Thesis (M Social Work (Social Work)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Goal: <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to use the Gestalt {{approach}} to explore, and to make use of sandplay to describe and observe <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> client, in order to lead the social worker to gain insight and understanding to <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> This study was done because the researcher observed that sandplay achieved very positive effects with children, adolescents and adults. This study was motivated by the desire to provide recommendations to the social workers in practice about the value and use <b>of</b> sandplay in <b>the</b> exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> <b>The</b> literature study focussed on a) <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> life-phase {{in order to determine the}} specific developmental aspects and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent,</b> b) to define <b>the</b> possibilities <b>of</b> sandplay as an exploration medium, as well as c) assessing the Gestalt approach as orientation theory and as practice theory with sandplay. In this research, a qualitative methodology was used combined with a case-study research design. Sandplay was used as a medium for exploration with three adolescent participants. They were selected by means of a non-probability sampling. The researcher used detailed, in-depth, data gathering methods which included six measuring instruments. These instruments included: a standardised questionnaire to give an indication <b>of</b> personality-traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants; two questionnaires to determine the behaviour, thought patterns and domestic circumstances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants; semi-structured interview-schedules to explore <b>the</b> sandtrays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants; photographs to accurately capture and record the sandtrays; as well as observations recording the behaviour and non-verbal communication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants. The researcher concludes that, according to the Gestalt-approach, exploration with sandplay is an effective method to explore <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> This method provides adequate information to the social worker to understand <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> client. Sandplay, according to the Gestalt approach, contributes value to social work practice, because it enhances <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> exploration and intervention. Sandplay provides the social worker with comprehensive information about <b>the</b> <b>adolescent,</b> and enables <b>the</b> social worker to identify <b>the</b> core problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> expeditiously. Sandplay involves <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> in a sensory, cognitive and emotional manner, which contributes to more information being exposed that leads to more effective interventions. This method is also novel, interesting and challenging to the social worker and <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> <b>The</b> researcher recommends sandplay for <b>the</b> exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> be preceded by establishing a therapeutic relationship with <b>the</b> <b>adolescent.</b> Once a relationship is established a number of sandtrays can be built, and thoroughly explored. The first sandtray should be non-directive. Directive sandtrays are subsequently recommended to explore specific themes and to handle trauma and/or issues which <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> may experience. It is also recommended that the social worker utilizes hypotheses, which can be postulated from <b>the</b> symbolic meanings <b>of</b> miniatures, as well as interpretations from other sandplay research in his/her exploration <b>of</b> sandtrays. <b>The</b> social worker, who uses sandplay to explore <b>the</b> world <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adolescent</b> according to <b>the</b> Gestalt approach, should be knowledgeable about sandplay, <b>the</b> symbolic meaning <b>of</b> miniatures, sandplay research and the Gestalt approach as orientation theory and practice theory. This study was done with three Afrikaans-speaking adolescent foster children, and the findings may not apply to other populations. Additional research needs to be done with a wider sample of adolescents, that covers different cultures, language and domestic backgrounds...|$|R
