5|$|Alexander's most {{immediate}} legacy was {{the introduction of}} Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia.

Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands <b>or</b> <b>under</b> Greek influence for the next 200–300years.

5|$|An Order in Council {{is a law}} made {{directly}} by the British Crown {{in the exercise of}} its prerogative law-making power it previously possessed in respect of Singapore.

5|$|An old {{belief is}} that the {{southwest}} corner of a basement provides the most protection during a tornado. The safest place is the side or corner of an underground room opposite the tornado's direction of approach (usually the northeast corner), or the central-most room on the lowest floor. Taking shelter in a basement, under a staircase, <b>or</b> <b>under</b> a sturdy piece of furniture such as a workbench further increases chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, <b>or</b> <b>under</b> vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E

5|$|Bobcat {{activities}} {{are confined to}} well-defined territories, which vary in size depending on the sex {{and the distribution of}} prey. The home range is marked with feces, urine scent, and by clawing prominent trees in the area. In its territory, the bobcat has numerous places of shelter, usually a main den, and several auxiliary shelters on the outer extent of its range, such as hollow logs, brush piles, thickets, <b>or</b> <b>under</b> rock ledges. Its den smells strongly of the bobcat.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests of leaves and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, <b>or</b> <b>under</b> rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves <b>or</b> <b>under</b> ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E

5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the {{concepts}} of functional analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying the role of prices as normal vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over time <b>or</b> <b>under</b> uncertainty {{require the use of}} infinite–dimensional function spaces, because agents are choosing among functions or stochastic processes.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank <b>or</b> <b>under</b> logs.

5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds.

Their habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybin (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a prodrug that is {{converted}} into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin {{in the body}} by a dephosphorylation reaction. This chemical reaction takes place under strongly acidic conditions, <b>or</b> <b>under</b> physiological conditions in the body, through the action of enzymes called alkaline phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|Sea anemones {{are found}} in both deep oceans and shallow coastal waters worldwide.
