5|$|Historian {{of science}} Thierry Bardini argues that Engelbart's complex {{personal}} philosophy (which drove all his research) foreshadowed the modern {{application of the}} concept of coevolution to the philosophy and use of technology. Bardini points out that Engelbart was strongly influenced by the principle of linguistic relativity developed by Benjamin Lee Whorf. Where Whorf reasoned that the sophistication of a language controls the sophistication of the thoughts that can be expressed by a speaker of that language, Engelbart reasoned that the state of our current technology controls <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> manipulate information, and that fact in turn will control <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> develop new, improved technologies. He thus set himself to the revolutionary task of developing computer-based technologies for manipulating information directly, and also to improve individual and group processes for knowledge-work.|$|E
5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is a non-fiction book by Canadian {{academic}} Thomas Homer-Dixon. It {{was written}} {{over the course}} of eight years from 1992 to 2000 when it was published by Knopf. The book argues that the nature of problems faced by our society are becoming more complex and that <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> implement solutions is not keeping pace. Homer-Dixon focuses upon complexities, unexpected non-linear results, and emergent properties. He takes an inter-disciplinary approach connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, and ecology.|$|E
5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E

40|$|Viewing Zimmerman (2001) as {{propagating}} for an economics-based monolithic paradigm to {{be adopted}} in management accounting research, we examine the nature and implications of such Kuhnian 'normal science'. Acknowledging that normal science can produce cumulative knowledge efficiently, we examine its risks as well. Similarly as with any normal science, that based on economics also inherently offers a narrow window to the world, and creates areas of 'non-discussables'. We illustrate how such a regime would limit <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> construct and examine interesting propositions and develop meaningful stories about management accounting in its social, organizational and behavioural contexts. Accepting the rule of a monolithic economics-based paradigm would limit <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> develop a critical stance, and threatens the ability of management accounting research community for good scientific conversation and progress. Hence, in contrast to Zimmerman, we argue for remaining open for heterogeneity in management accounting research. ...|$|R
40|$|Many common tasks {{require us}} to individuate in {{parallel}} two or more objects out of a complex scene. Although the mechanisms underlying <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> {{count the number of}} items, remember the visual properties of objects and to make saccadic eye movements towards targets have been studied separately, each of these tasks require selection of individual objects and shows a capacity limit. Here we show that a common factor [...] salience [...] determines the capacity limit in the various tasks. We manipulated bottom-up salience (visual contrast) and top-down salience (task relevance) in enumeration and visual memory tasks. As one item became increasingly salient, the subitizing range was reduced and memory performance for all other less-salient items was decreased. Overall, the pattern of results suggests that <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> enumerate and remember small groups of stimuli are grounded in an attentional priority or salience map which represents the location of important items...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The strong {{similarity}} {{between the use of}} ostension and that of a simple demonstrative to predicate something of an object seems to conflict with equally strong intuitions according to which, while “this” does usually refer to an object, the gesture of holding an object in your hand and showing it to an audience does not refer to the demonstrated object. This paper argues that the problem is authentic and provides a solution to it. In doing so, a more general thought is given support by the approach used. Namely, the thought that <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> directly refer to things require some basic referential abilities exhibited in ostension and the use of demonstratives which, in their turn, rest upon <b>our</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> cooperate in performing non-communicative actions on our environment. Several concepts introduced in order to solve the initial problem can be used to articulate this thought in more detail...|$|R

25|$|Many {{commentators}} have since rejected {{this understanding of}} Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in {{the idea that it}} is our knowledge, and not <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{biologists}} {{are skeptical}} of the claim that syntactic knowledge is transmitted in the human genome.

25|$|For example, Avicenna’s 'Refutation against astrology' Resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm, argues {{against the}} {{practice}} of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God's absolute power over creation. Avicenna considered that {{the movement of the}} planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the capability of determining the exact influence of the stars.

25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to <b>our</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E
