25|$|Polo did {{not entirely}} {{understand}} what he saw, however. As explained in the Aobo Tu, workers actually sprinkled sea water on the fields which then filtered through sand or fine ash into pits, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> could have seen “earth salt” derived from soil.|$|E
25|$|Crowned (1989) tackles {{a similar}} theme, {{but from the}} {{perspective}} of the founding fathers. The film, based on a play by author Yaakov Shabtai (adapted by Ephraim Sidon and Ram Loevy), is an intense comedy based on the final days of the biblical King David. As his life approaches its end, he faces the most difficult task of his forty-year reign—giving up his crown to the next generation. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> might even find a way to keep the crown for himself. The fact that this film was aired when Israel was itself forty years old was not lost on its audience.|$|E
500|$|The novel raises {{questions}} about determinism and free will. For example, critic Dan Falk asks, [...] "Given that [...] journey has 'already happened,' should he not simply be compelled to act precisely as he remembers seeing himself act? (<b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> is compelled, and merely feels he has a choice...?)." [...] Although Henry seemingly cannot alter the future, the characters do not become [...] "cynical" [...] and, according to Lee-Potter, the novel demonstrates that people can be changed through love. Walter notes {{that there is a}} [...] "quasi-religious sense" [...] to the inevitability of Henry's and Clare's lives and deaths. Niffenegger, however, believes that the novel does not depict destiny but rather [...] "randomness and meaninglessness".|$|E
50|$|One {{need not}} suppose, of course, that Plato {{intended}} {{this as a}} literal discussion of metempsychosis <b>or</b> reincarnation: <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> meant it figuratively.|$|R
5000|$|Ben Myers, in a Guardian article calling Naked Mike Leigh's [...] "finest work" [...] and [...] "the best British film {{in recent}} history," [...] {{elaborated}} {{on the many}} theories film-goers have had on who Johnny might represent: [...] "...a modern, albeit highly flawed, Jesus attempting to change people's lives. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he's</b> the devil himself. Others have suggested it is a post-AIDS morality movie, or a classic urban existentialist tale." ...|$|R

2500|$|One might {{question}} Leonardo's {{concern for}} human life, given his weapon designs. Nothing came of his designs for offensive weapons.

2500|$|Still, some {{scholars}} have held the view that while this event took place, it was not miraculous: Albert Schweitzer, for example, suggested that the disciples saw Jesus walking on the shore, but were confused by high wind and darkness; {{some scholars}} who accept this [...] "misperception thesis" [...] argue that Mark originally wrote that Jesus walked on the seashore {{rather than on the}} shore, and that John had a more accurate version. Others have held that the entire episode is a [...] "pious legend" [...] (B.H. Branscomb, 1937), based perhaps on some lost incident; perhaps Jesus waded through the surf (Vincent Taylor, 1957), <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> walked on a sand bar (Sherman Johnson, 1972, J.D.M. Derrett, 1981).|$|E
2500|$|At {{this point}} Elijah proposes a direct {{test of the}} powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of Asherah are summoned to Mount Carmel. Two altars are built, one for Baal and one for God. Wood is laid on the altars. Two oxen are {{slaughtered}} and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. [...] "At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, ‘Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> is asleep and must be awakened.’" [...] They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.|$|E

6000|$|The single gentleman, <b>perhaps</b> because <b>he</b> had {{met with}} such things in his travels, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> because <b>he</b> WAS a single gentleman, evinced no surprise, but merely inquired 'Wife or Sister?'--'Sister,' said Dick.--'So much the better,' said the single gentleman, 'he {{can get rid of}} her when he likes.' ...|$|R

You must go to his tomb {{one of these days}} and inquire. Bukta will {{probably}} attend to that. He was asking me before you came whether by any ill-luck you had already bagged your tiger. If not, he is going to enter you under his own wing. Of course, for you of all men it's imperative. You'll have a first-class time with Bukta." ...|$|R

60|$|Asad frowned. Here was truth indeed, {{something}} that he had entirely overlooked. Yet justice compelled him still to defend Sakr-el-Bahr, <b>or</b> else <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> but reasoned to prove to himself that {{the case against the}} corsair was indeed complete.|$|R
5000|$|Pileo {{was the son}} of Bianchino [...] and Iselgarda da Carrara. He {{was born}} in Concordia Sagittaria <b>or,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> Padua. <b>He</b> was bishop of Treviso in 1352, then bishop of Padua (1359), {{founding}} the Collegio Pratense, and archbishop of Ravenna (1370).|$|R
60|$|But though Kells, by {{a strange}} stroke, {{had been made}} wholly master of the Legion, he did not show the old elation <b>or</b> radiance. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>he</b> saw more clearly than ever before. Still he was quick, decisive, strong, equal to the occasion.|$|R

It was a great venture for her to try such a journey, and if she came there, why, perhaps the Commissioner man had gone, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> will not listen, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> cannot come.

60|$|I searched here, there, and everywhere, {{and failed}} to find her. The place was so quiet, it looked so deliciously pure and bright, after smoky dreary London, that I {{sat down at the}} further end of the garden and let my mind take me back to Philip. What was he doing at that moment, while I was {{thinking}} of him? Perhaps he was in the company of other young ladies, who drew all his thoughts away to themselves? <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was writing to his father in Ireland, and saying something kindly and prettily about me? <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was looking forward, as anxiously as I do, to our meeting next week.|$|E

50|$|Di Xin paid {{very little}} {{attention}} to these, as he viewed himself as the rightful ruler of China, a position appointed by the heavens, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> because <b>he</b> was becoming engrossed with his personal life with his beautiful consort Da Ji, {{to the exclusion of}} all else.|$|R

5000|$|... "The McKay Avenue School & The Vogue Theatre" [...] - Edmonton’s oldest {{surviving}} brick schoolhouse was {{the site}} of the first Alberta legislature in 1906-07. It was eventually to become the McKay Avenue School for young children. The sound of children laughing can still be heard in its halls. Not only are there ghostly children in this building; the eerie apparition of a man is often seen walking its halls. He is believed to be a maintenance worker who fell to his death while repairing the roof.The Vogue Theatre opened in 1941 as a movie theatre and performing arts house. For most of its history, it actually played host to more movie showings than live performances. Nobody knows who the ghost is but, <b>perhaps</b> <b>he</b> was a performer who once played at the Vogue Theatre. <b>Or</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>he’s</b> simply an audience member who, even after death, still longs to be in the limelight.|$|R
