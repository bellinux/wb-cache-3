5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within the reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> the audience he most wanted to serve. One {{way that he}} reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great care with the printing {{of many of his}} books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of {{elements}} of Portland's industrial laundry era, {{and its relation}} to the women’s labor movement and the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in the United States, are factors in the building's listing on the National Register. Built and first operated by businessman Charles F. Brown, the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company, a power-laundry consortium. American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing, a maker of automotive fabrics, used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950. Acquired by Alter LLC in 2008, the building is home to Yale Union (YU), a contemporary arts center.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{from most}} of the {{architectural}} periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.|$|E

Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{belongs to}} the group of least {{developed}} countries, according to the United Nations. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs, Christianity, or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> , the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low {{for the majority of the}} Malagasy population.|$|E

5|$|On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, {{took power}} in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He {{was a far}} more {{formidable}} opponent than al-Kudsi, and the Iraqi Regional Branch managed to take power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics – the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party {{a force to be}} reckoned with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the plotters because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his worries, and launched the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the plotters were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task of reporting to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, Playford and the LCL's {{share of}} the vote {{declined}} continually despite the economic growth, and they clung to power mainly due to the Playmander. Playford became less assured in parliament as Labor became more aggressive, their leading debater Don Dunstan combatively disrupting the previously collaborative style of politics, targeting the injustice of the Playmander in particular. Playford's successful economic policies had fuelled a rapid expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> which wanted more government attention to education, public healthcare, the arts, the environment and heritage protection. However, Playford was an unrelenting utilitarian, and was unmoved by calls to broaden policy focus beyond economic development. This was exacerbated by Playford and his party's failure to adapt to changing social mores, remaining adamantly committed to restrictive laws on alcohol, gambling and police powers. A turning point in Playford's tenure was the Max Stuart case in the 1950s, when Playford came under heavy scrutiny for his hesitation to grant clemency to a murderer on death row amid claims of judicial wrongdoing. Although Playford eventually commuted the sentence under heavy criticism of the judicial review process, the controversy was seen as responsible for his government losing its assurance, and he eventually lost office in the 1965 election. He relinquished the party leadership to Steele Hall and retired at the next election, serving on various South Australian company boards {{until his death in}} 1981.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment and the decline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps {{and the use of}} outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E

25|$|As {{with all}} social {{classes in the}} United States, there are no {{definite}} answers {{as to what is}} and what is not middle class. Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey have brought forth class models in which the middle class is divided into two sections that combined constitute 47% to 49% of the population. The upper middle or professional class constitutes the upper end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> which consists of highly educated, well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> – called either lower middle class or just middle class – consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised.|$|E
