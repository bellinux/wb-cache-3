5|$|In {{the event}} that a person lacks standing, there is a {{possibility}} that he or she may be able to ask the Attorney-General to allow him or her to bring a relator action. In this scenario, the Attorney-General would be the nominal plaintiff in the judicial review proceedings, but the case would actually be conducted by the individual. Bringing a relator action is <b>one</b> <b>means</b> of circumventing the requirement of standing on the part of the individual applicant, because the Attorney-General has an interest in upholding the law for the public benefit.|$|E
5|$|Nellie Forbush, in {{her journey}} from Little Rock, Arkansas, to {{serving as a}} Navy nurse {{and on to the}} domesticity of the final scene of South Pacific, {{parallels}} the experience of many American women of the period. They entered the workforce during the war, only to find afterwards a societal expectation that they give up their jobs to men, with their best route to financial security being marriage and becoming a housewife. <b>One</b> <b>means</b> of securing audience acceptance of Nellie's choices was the sanitization of her sexual past from her counterpart in the Michener work– that character had a 4-F boyfriend back in Arkansas and a liaison with Bill Harbison while on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} peoples of Taiwan face {{economic and social}} barriers, including a high unemployment rate and substandard education. Since the early 1980s, many aboriginal groups have been actively seeking {{a higher degree of}} political self-determination and economic development. The revival of ethnic pride is expressed in many ways by aborigines, including the incorporation of elements of their culture into commercially successful pop music. Efforts are under way in indigenous communities to revive traditional cultural practices and preserve their traditional languages. The Austronesian Cultural Festival in Taitung City is <b>one</b> <b>means</b> by which community members promote aboriginal culture. In addition, several aboriginal communities have become extensively involved in the tourism and ecotourism industries with the goal of achieving increased economic self-reliance and preserving their culture.|$|E
5|$|Finance chair Walter M. Gibson, {{supported}} by Minister of the Interior Samuel G. Wilder, pushed a new currency law through the 1880 legislature. It allowed the kingdom to purchase {{gold and silver}} bullion to be struck into new Hawaiian coins. Having the kingdom issue its own coins was <b>one</b> <b>means</b> by which the government hoped to improve Native Hawaiian morale, as their numbers and their influence had both been declining over the previous few decades. The king became more interested in coinage bearing his likeness during his world tour of 1881. During this journey, he was contacted by {{the owner of a}} New Caledonia nickel mining company hoping to use the metal in coinage, and sample five-cent pieces were sent to the king after his return to Honolulu. They found little favor, possibly because Hawaii's motto was misspelled. No action was taken until 1882, when the king appointed Gibson to lead the government. He moved forward with the coin idea; the currency was to have the king's image on the obverse side, and Hawaii's coat of arms and motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono (The Life of the Land is Perpetuated in Righteousness) on the reverse. The 1880 law specified that the silver coins were to be in denominations of one dollar, fifty cents, twenty-five cents, and twelve and one-half cents. Twelve and one-half cents, or one bit (one Spanish colonial real) was sometimes the day's pay for a laborer.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} other {{mathematical}} concepts {{that can be}} used to represent complete lattices. <b>One</b> <b>means</b> of doing so is the Dedekind-MacNeille completion. When this completion is applied to a poset that already is a complete lattice, then the result is a complete lattice of sets which is isomorphic to the original one. Thus we immediately find that every complete lattice is isomorphic to a complete lattice of sets.|$|E

This God is emotionally unsatisfying... it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity.|$|E
25|$|The same {{scenario}} {{applies to}} scorers. Some teams {{may have an}} official scorer who attends all of their home games, but often it is simply left to the batting side to keep score.

25|$|Peaches are {{considered}} self-fertile because a commercial crop {{can be produced}} without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop. Apples {{are considered}} self-incompatible, because a commercial crop must be cross-pollinated. Many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones, genetically identical. An orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically a single plant. Many growers now consider this a mistake. <b>One</b> <b>means</b> of correcting this mistake is to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer (generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so.|$|E

In 1967, a Mayoral Executive Order closed the Civil Defense Headquarters and placed full responsibility of the Civil Defense wardens with the NYPD. The NYPD retitled the division Auxiliary Police, changed the uniform to reflect police officer uniforms, and revised the duties of Auxiliary Police. During the 1960s when crime was on the rise, uniformed Auxiliary Police patrols were <b>one</b> <b>means</b> to deter crime.|$|E

50|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the responses to the}} questions in their questionnaire, the 14 countries were clustered into five main groups, which they labeled Nordic-European (Denmark, Germany, Norway, and Sweden), Latin-European (Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain), Anglo-American (England and the United States), Developing (Argentina, Chile, and India), and Japan (by itself). One important thing from this analysis is the various mean standardized scores that the five groups presented with respect to autonomy and self-actualization. For these figures, positive <b>ones</b> <b>mean</b> greater satisfaction of need than for the average manager across all 14 countries, while negative <b>ones</b> <b>mean</b> lesser satisfaction. Their results are presented in Table 1.|$|R
25|$|Rotations {{of plants}} with nematode-resistant species or {{varieties}} is <b>one</b> <b>means</b> of managing parasitic nematode infestations. For example, marigolds, grown over {{one or more}} seasons (the effect is cumulative), {{can be used to}} control nematodes. Another is treatment with natural antagonists such as the fungus Gliocladium roseum. Chitosan, a natural biocontrol, elicits plant defense responses to destroy parasitic cyst nematodes on roots of soybean, corn, sugar beet, potato, and tomato crops without harming beneficial nematodes in the soil. Soil steaming is an efficient method to kill nematodes before planting a crop, but indiscriminately eliminates both harmful and beneficial soil fauna.|$|E
25|$|As {{the quality}} of health care has {{increasingly}} become an issue around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality {{is one of the}} most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is <b>one</b> <b>means</b> by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission from the USA, the Trent Accreditation Scheme from Great Britain, and Haute Authorité de santé (HAS) from France.|$|E
25|$|With the Industrial Relations Act {{coming into}} effect, at the {{beginning}} of August 1972 Adamson agreed with Victor Feather of the TUC to set up an independent conciliation and advice service. According to Feather both sides saw this as <b>one</b> <b>means</b> of minimising the use of the Act. Through 1973 the government, CBI and TUC tried to establish a working relationship which suited all, but were unable to do so before the economic effects of the oil price rise caused profound disruption to the British economy. On other issues Adamson was strongly supportive of the Government, including giving consistent backing to entry to the European Communities. His leadership in this area was said to be crucial.|$|E
