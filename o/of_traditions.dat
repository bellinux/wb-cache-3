40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{interrogate}} {{some of the}} common uses and assumptions surrounding the musicological concept <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> and its empirical study from recordings. In particular, I take issue with certain style-analytical approaches for investigating performance traditions from recordings. From a theoretical perspective, I consider how the operation <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> resides beyond the substantive content of performance style, and how such an understanding <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> fares against quantitative measurements of style and the historical periodization of performance practice. Through a series of empirical case studies based on two of Grieg's Lyric Pieces I investigate the relevance <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> as an analytical category for studying the transmission of performance practices from recordings. Using beat tempo data extracted from these recordings as an empirical marker of transmission processes, the case studies illustrate how stylistic kinship between performers captures the operation <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in different contexts. Findings suggest that stylistic relationships function best as heuristic tools for tracing the presence <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in this repertoire: the data {{do not support the}} more conventional understanding <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> as collective style or historically patterned trend, nor do stylistic similarities between performers always verify the operation <b>of</b> <b>tradition.</b> Finally, in seeking to understand tradition beyond the dimension of performance style, I turn to ethnographic data which reveal the operation <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> as a subjective feeling of connection and ultimately as ontological potential...|$|R

40|$|In this Article, Professor Pritchard and Professor Zywicki {{examine the}} role <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in {{constitutional}} interpretation, {{a topic that}} has received significant attention in recent years. After outlining the current debate over the use <b>of</b> <b>tradition,</b> the authors discuss the efficiency purposes of constitutionalism [...] precommitment and the reduction of agency costs [...] and demonstrate how the use <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in constitutional interpretation can serve these purposes. Rejecting both Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s majoritarian model, which focuses on legislative sources <b>of</b> <b>tradition,</b> and Justice Souter 2 ̆ 7 s common-law model, which focuses on Supreme Court precedent as a source <b>of</b> <b>tradition,</b> the authors propose an alternative model [...] the 2 ̆ 2 finding model 2 ̆ 2 [...] from which constitutionally significant traditions can be identified. This model looks to the common law and state constitutional law as its sources <b>of</b> <b>tradition.</b> Finally, using specific examples, the authors demonstrate how this model can aid the Court in two specific contexts: construing ambiguous but enumerated federal constitutional rights and recognizing unenumerated rights...|$|R
5|$|Henry was {{allegedly}} buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something that was}} thought to be his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation <b>of</b> <b>traditions</b> in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E
5|$|Iravan is {{also known}} in Indonesia (where his name is spelled Irawan). An {{independent}} set <b>of</b> <b>traditions</b> have developed around Irawan on the main island of Java where, for example, he loses his association with the Naga. Separate Javanese traditions present a dramatic marriage of Irawan to Titisari, daughter of Krishna, and a death resulting from a case of mistaken identity. These stories are told {{through the medium of}} traditional Javanese theatre (Wayang), especially in shadow-puppet plays known as Wayang Kulit.|$|E

The comic's style and themes include elements from science, fantasy creatures, mythology from a variety <b>of</b> <b>traditions,</b> and alchemical symbols and theories; the literary style is heavily influenced by mystery fiction and manga.|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{the fate}} <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in modernity {{has emerged as}} a central concern in recent social theory. Prominent {{analyses}} have pointed to contemporary processes of detraditionalisation, and in some cases retraditionalisation, particularly in the realm of personal relationships, and of ‘the invention of tradition’, especially in connection with nationalist and ethnic movements. The ongoing presence and influence <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in modernity is also a central theme within the emerging paradigm of ‘multiple modernities’. For this increasingly influential perspective, however, the significance accorded to the presence <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in modernity has a markedly different basis. The traditions it is concerned with are those which define civilisations, and its central claim is that diverse civilisational traditions shape modern constellations and coconstitute multiple forms of modernity. In this paper, I suggest that the multiple modernities perspective’s broader frame of reference and distinctive conceptual framework provide important background to all debates around the operation <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in modernity. In the limited space available, I make this case in relation to the idea of the invention <b>of</b> <b>tradition.</b> An analysis <b>of</b> the underlying premises of the two approaches suggests that the multiple modernities perspective can shed new light the phenomena referred to as the invention <b>of</b> <b>tradition,</b> and bring to the fore aspects of the influence <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> that it tends to obscure...|$|R

5|$|The {{origin of}} Turkish theatre dates back {{thousands}} of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend <b>of</b> <b>traditions</b> occurred between the Seljuk Turks {{and those of the}} inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. After the Tanzimat (Reformation) period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the declaration of the second Constitutional Monarchy in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the Turkish State Theatres.|$|E
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>traditions.</b> Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must {{return it to the}} clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E
