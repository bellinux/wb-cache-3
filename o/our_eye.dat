25|$|As an example, {{suppose that}} {{light in the}} orange range of {{wavelengths}} (approximately 577nm to 597nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference {{is the basis of}} our perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering <b>our</b> <b>eye</b> and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.|$|E
25|$|Unification {{is based}} upon {{triggering}} events creating unified energy fields. Taking light as an example, receptors in our eyes turn on and off at approximately 110 milliseconds. A photon is not a particle but is an accumulation of light energy at a receiving source. At the time of reception, a photon mass force is created triggering the receptor. Once a rod or cone in <b>our</b> <b>eye</b> is triggered our brain energy field merges with the energy field of the object being viewed. During this 110 ms ON interval events at the source and at the receiver are happening at the same time. Since the 4th dimension, time equals zero, the merged three dimensional energy field remains. This allows us to perceive depth and instantaneous movement at the source. It also applies to sub atomic particles as well where electromagnetic energy causes triggering events and unified fields.|$|E

[...] From this Pächt views the perspective as deliberately lacking cohesion, as [...] "the relationship between the parts of the building is not shown in full... The transition from foreground to background is ingeniously masked by the figure of the Madonna herself, who obscures the crossing pier; the middle ground is practically eliminated and <b>our</b> <b>eye</b> crosses over it without our becoming aware of it." [...] The illusion is enhanced by the use of colour to suggest light: the interior is dim and in shadow while the unseen exterior seems bathed in bright light.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the minus sign, the spacetime {{interval}} between two distinct events can be zero.

2500|$|Nayral himself celebrated this {{collaborative}} process in his {{preface to the}} Cubist exhibition held at the Galerie Dalmau in Barcelona, April - May 1912 (the second Cubist manifestation held outside of Paris): 'You see a portrait in a landscape' wrote Nayral, 'is it simply the reproduction of some lines that permit <b>our</b> <b>eye</b> to recognize a head, clothes, trees? Photography would be sufficient'. Nayral answers the query: 'a thinking human {{in harmony with the}} surroundings, in accordance with them', one must 'reveal the concert of all these forms of life that are the thought of this man, the perfume of this flower, the brilliance of this plant, the vibration of this light, this is the task of the artist'. In essence, write Antliff and Leighten in Cubism and Culture, [...] "this synthetic vision was the product of Gleizes's sympathetic response to the expressive acts and physiognomic traits he deemed indicative of the poet's character. Both form and content in the work were the result of Gleizes's mental associations while working from memory.|$|E

[...] In the first few episodes of the storyline, Derek asks for Kat's help to keep Joey in Walford, which Inside Soap said would mean he would owe Kat a favour, and Derek defends Kat when she is insulted by the rival football team's manager. Inside Soap also pointed out [...] "serious" [...] flirting between Jack and Kat, when she teases him about being out of shape, and she names him 'Legs of the match' after the team play their first football match. They spotted that Kat has a [...] "smouldering tete-a-tete" [...] with Max and she knows how frustrated he is by his family problems, and he is also seen on the phone {{at the same time as}} Kat.

2500|$|In nature, a {{light source}} emits {{a ray of}} light which travels, eventually, to a surface that {{interrupts}} its progress. [...] One can think of this [...] "ray" [...] as a stream of photons traveling along the same path. [...] In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray: [...] absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. [...] A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting {{in a loss of}} intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light. [...] It might also reflect {{all or part of the}} light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any transparent or translucent properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the spectrum (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more. [...] A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of [...] the incoming rays. [...] Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit <b>our</b> <b>eye,</b> causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.|$|E
