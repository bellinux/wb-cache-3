The Macdonalds were devout Roman Catholics as well as ardent Liberal Party supporters.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial predictions, Edouard's {{effects were}} much less than expected. Strong waves struck much of the East Coast of the United States, killing 2 and {{injuring}} numerous others. In 2011 the National Hurricane Center reported that Edouard had caused a total of US$20million with the greatest damage occurring <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod, where moderate wind gusts resulted in $4.6million (2007USD).|$|E

5|$|In 1920 {{the heirs}} of Venancio Sanchez {{filed a lawsuit}} against James Deering, {{claiming}} an undivided half interest in his Cape Florida property. This brought development of the resort <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Florida to a halt. After many legal battles, the suit was finally decided in Deering's favor by the United States Supreme Court in 1926. The decision came too late for Deering; he had died the previous year.|$|E
5|$|Key Biscayne {{was first}} {{developed}} for coconut cultivation. The earliest mention of coconuts on Key Biscayne is a Spanish account from 1568, although the reference {{may be to}} cocoplums rather than coconuts. Mature coconut trees were <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Florida by the 1830s, likely grown from coconuts sent from Mexico by Henry Perrine to the first lighthouse keeper, John Dubose.|$|E
5|$|Moving east-southeast into {{southern}} Middlesex County, it continued producing severe winds (gusting up to 90mph; 145km/h) and very heavy rain. Another tornado touched down very briefly in Norfolk County, {{followed by two}} more brief touchdowns in Plymouth County near 5:30PM. The storm then weakened, but still managed to produce 60mph (95km/h) winds <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod, before finally moving out into the Atlantic and dissipating.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod, Vonnegut made most of {{his money}} writing pieces for {{magazines}} such as Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and Cosmopolitan. He also did a stint as an English teacher, wrote copy for an advertising agency, and opened the first American Saab dealership, which eventually failed. In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory workers {{have been replaced by}} machines.|$|E
5|$|Because a Hurricane Watch {{existed for}} the New York City {{metropolitan}} area, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani urged citizens to take preparations. In addition, city officials {{set up a}} hurricane helpline, activated the city's Emergency Command Center at the Police Headquarters, and distributed leaflets to flood-prone areas. Near New Bedford, Massachusetts, where landfall was predicted to occur, schools were prepared as shelters {{in case of a}} direct hit. New Bedford Mayor issued a state of emergency for the city. However, few people stayed in shelters during the storm's passage. <b>On</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod, thousands of tourists and summer residents evacuated in preparation for the storm, resulting in an 18-mile (29km) traffic backup. As a result, many beach resorts lost millions in potential revenue. Of those who remained <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod, 900 stayed in emergency shelters when the storm passed the area. In Boston's Logan International Airport, numerous flights were cancelled or delayed to move planes to safety. Many sailors removed their boats from the water prior to the storm. At one time in Mattapoisett Harbor, workers removed boats at a rate of one every eight minutes. In Maine, the Red Cross opened several emergency shelters, though they were never used. Like in Massachusetts, sailors removed their boats, and due to media coverage, residents were well-prepared for the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{immigration}} {{is also a}} factor in the state's population growth, causing the state's population to continue to grow as of the 2010 Census (particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower). 40% of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America, according to a 2005 Census Bureau study, with many of the remainder from Asia. Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent. Many areas of Massachusetts showed relatively stable population trends between 2000 and 2010. Exurban Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly, while Berkshire County in far Western Massachusetts and Barnstable County <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod were the only counties to lose population as of the 2010 Census.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Edouard passed about 95miles (150km/h) {{southeast}} of Nantucket while moving at only 12mph (19km/h), much slower than previous New England hurricanes. This resulted in {{several hours of}} strong waves, winds, and rain. The hurricane produced wave heights of up to 31feet (9.4m), which washed twelve boats ashore and damaged numerous others. The strong waves and a storm surge of up to 2.1feet (.6m) in Nantucket flooded a few coastal roads. Edouard also produced tropical storm force winds across much of Massachusetts, {{as well as one}} hurricane-force gust on Nantucket. In addition, there were unofficial reports of stronger gusts, including 77mph (124km/h) <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod, 80mph (129km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and 90mph (145km/h) on Nantucket. The strong winds caused power outages to 2/3 of Nantucket, all of Martha's Vineyard for six hours, and most of Cape Cod for several hours. Power outages, effecting 35,000 to 40,000 were reported throughout Massachusetts, though far from the power outages caused by Hurricane Bob five years prior. The winds also downed numerous trees, and blew off the roof of the fire station in Hyannis. Rainfall was moderate from the slow-moving hurricane, peaking at 6.37inches (162mm) in West Dennis with many other locations reporting over 3inches (76mm). The rainfall produced minor street flooding. Damage <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod totaled to $3.5million (1996USD, $4.6million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|In late July, a {{boy named}} John Billington became lost for {{some time in the}} woods around the colony. It was {{reported}} that he was found by the Nauset, the same group of Native Americans <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod from whom the Pilgrims had unwittingly stolen corn seed the prior year upon their first explorations. The English organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth. The Pilgrims agreed to reimburse the Nauset for the corn which they had taken in return for the Billington boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the Native Americans in the area.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the {{countries}} of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor exploration beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Cape Verde during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498. The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that discovered the Americas. The English crown under Henry VII sponsored the voyage of John Cabot (d. 1498) in 1497, which landed <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Breton Island.|$|E
5|$|No.75 Wing {{was raised}} on 13October 1943 at Garbutt in Townsville, Queensland, {{under the command}} of Wing Commander (later Group Captain) Edgar Bruce Courtney. On {{formation}} it had a staff of ten, including three officers. The wing was responsible for RAAF units at Horn Island, Thursday Island, and Higgins Field <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> York Peninsula. An advance party departed Garbutt for Horn Island on 21October, and the wing headquarters was fully established there six days later. The same month, No.84 Squadron, based at Horn Island and recently converted from CAC Boomerangs to P-40 Kittyhawks, was transferred from the control of No.72 Wing (headquartered at Merauke, New Guinea) to No.75 Wing.|$|E
5|$|Recent studies, {{as well as}} anecdotal evidence, {{show that}} fishers have begun making inroads into {{suburban}} backyards, farmland, and periurban areas in several US states and eastern Canada, {{as far south as}} most of northern Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Minnesota and Iowa, and even rural New Jersey. Having virtually dissapeared after the construction of the Cape Cod Canal in the early 1900's, some reports have shown that populations have become re-established <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod, although the populations are likely smaller than the populations {{in the western part of}} New England.|$|E

5|$|The 1977 Charter of the French Language {{established}} French as {{the official}} language of Quebec. Although more than 85 percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are substantial Francophone populations in New Brunswick, Alberta, and Manitoba; Ontario has the largest French-speaking population outside Quebec. New Brunswick, the only officially bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting 33 percent of the population. There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Breton Island, and through central and western Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{troops with}} their {{supplies}} and equipment {{had to be}} loaded on board the ships on 31 December 1943, just {{five days after the}} assault <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Gloucester. Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's VII Amphibious Force allotted 6 Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs), 10 High speed transports (APDs) and 17 Landing Craft Infantry (LCIs). A last minute hitch developed on 30 December when it was discovered that only nine APDs would be available. New embarkation tables were drawn up, shifting personnel not required in the assault waves to LCIs, and the landing schedule was revised {{in the light of the}} reduced number of landing craft.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of uranium}} {{in its natural}} oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE, when {{it was used to}} add a yellow color to ceramic glazes. Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a Roman villa <b>on</b> <b>Cape</b> Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. Starting in the late Middle Ages, {{pitchblende}} was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines.|$|E
50|$|Napoleon {{stopped at}} the <b>cape</b> <b>on</b> 1 July 1803 whilst making an {{inspection}} of the coast around Boulogne-sur-Mer and of his invasion troops. He then envisioned setting up a cross-Channel optical telegraph, with a semaphore <b>on</b> the <b>cape.</b> The first semaphore of this line was installed <b>on</b> the <b>cape</b> in 1805, without waiting for the planned French invasion of England. On 18 July 1805, a memorable naval battle took place off the cape. A British flotilla with strong numerical superiority pursued Dutch ships that were following the coast {{and trying to get}} back into harbour of Ambleteuse. Expecting an attack of this type, Napoleon had stationed a battery of 300 guns <b>on</b> the <b>cape,</b> and a barrage from this force obliged the British vessels to withdraw.|$|R
