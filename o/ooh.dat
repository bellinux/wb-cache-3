500|$|Incorporating an ease to her vocal {{delivery}}, Del Rey eased her vocal delivery by crooning {{the hook}} [...] "Move baby, move baby / <b>Ooh</b> baby, <b>ooh</b> baby" [...] throughout the chorus shift, {{in a style}} that recalls Stevie Nicks' [...] "Edge of Seventeen" [...] (1982). Del Rey uses an inexpressive, ventriloquizing tone in the song, with her voice being layered into the track's production by means of reverberation. In addition, her vocals use a more sensual and sinister tone than in her previous discography, and are often sung in an anxious and [...] "breathy" [...] style, and in an octave just above a whisper. She also sings the track's backing vocals which in part contribute to the song's ethereal feel, through distant, faraway moans. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern observed that Del Rey's voice skipped between [...] "breathy franticness and slurred, drugged-out ecstasy". Throughout the song, she restrains her delivery during its verses, but sings in a sweeping, cinematic style in its chorus.|$|E

500|$|In the lyrics, Goldfrapp and Gregory {{write about}} the passion found in romance and love; the former sings, [...] "I want your love / All of the time" [...] during a [...] "slippery bass synth" [...] sound in the production.

500|$|... "Womanizer" [...] is an uptempo electropop and dance-pop {{song with}} dark synths {{that runs through}} a dance {{oriented}} beat. It {{has been compared to}} previous Spears' songs such as [...] "Toxic" [...] (2004) and [...] "Ooh <b>Ooh</b> Baby" [...] (2007). It is written in the verse–pre-chorus–chorus form. The track opens with its characteristical sirens. According to Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times, Spears [...] "quick-witted" [...] vocals are similar to the style of The Andrews Sisters. It was also noted by Daily News writer Jim Farber that Spears' delivery has a [...] "tone of petulance". After the bridge, Spears sings the chorus one more time and the song ends while the beat drops and Spears sings the [...] "you’re a womanizer, baby" [...] hook.

500|$|Ringo Starr {{identified}} {{his initial}} inspiration for [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as having come from Marc Bolan, the singer and guitarist with English glam rock band T. Rex. In a 2001 interview with Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer, Starr described Bolan as [...] "a dear friend {{who used to}} come into the office when I was running Apple Movies, a big office in town, and the hang-out for myself, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon". Over dinner one evening at Starr's home outside London, Bolan had used the word [...] "boogaloo" [...] so often that it stuck in Starr's mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight. When discussing the composition on VH1 Storytellers in May 1998, Starr explained: [...] " [...] was an energised guy. He used to speak: 'Back off boogaloo... <b>ooh</b> you, boogaloo.' 'Do you want some potatoes?' 'Ooh you, boogaloo!'" [...] Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children's toys that night, in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song.|$|E
500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy {{when you hit the}} spot / <b>Ooh</b> ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, cousins Robert Diggs, Gary Grice, and Russell Jones formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, {{also known as}} the All in Together Now Crew. Each member {{recorded}} under an alias: Grice as The Genius, Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, and Jones as The Specialist. The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York rap scene and was recognized by rapper Biz Markie. By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels. The Genius released Words from the Genius (1991) on Cold Chillin' Records and Prince Rakeem released <b>Ooh</b> I Love You Rakeem (1991) on Tommy Boy Records. Both were soon dropped by their labels. Embittered but unbowed, they took on new monikers (The Genius became GZA while Prince Rakeem became RZA) and refocused their efforts. RZA discussed the matter in their release The Wu-Tang Manual (2005), stating [...] " [...] made the decision to sign House of Pain over us.

500|$|Moffat's script {{started by}} repeating Martha's departure. The script {{indicated}} that [...] "this time, we {{stay with the}} Doctor. As before ... the Doctor takes a moment, then slam the controls," [...] and described the Fifth Doctor as having a [...] "frock coat, cricket jersey, and a stick of celery on his lapel". Moffat included several references to Fifth Doctor stories in his script: the Tenth Doctor commented about the Fifth Doctor's attire and his disuse of the sonic screwdriver, saying: [...] "Ooh, I'm the Doctor, I can save the universe with a kettle {{and a piece of}} string and <b>ooh,</b> look at me, I'm wearing a vegetable." [...] A line about the effects of the paradox the TARDIS collision had caused gave an explanation of why the Fifth Doctor looked far older than normal, thus getting around the fact that Peter Davison had left the role over twenty years before. [...] And {{near the end of the}} episode, he refers to Tegan Jovanka, Nyssa, the Cybermen stories Earthshock and The Five Doctors, the Mara serials Kinda and Snakedance, the Time Lords' [...] "funny hats" [...] from Arc of Infinity, and the various Ainley Master stories during Davison's tenure.|$|E
500|$|Producer Jim Stewart had {{the idea}} to produce a duet album with Otis Redding and Carla Thomas, as {{he thought it would}} help their musical careers' progress, and that [...] " [...] rawness and [...] sophistication would work" [...] well together. Another reason to combine the two artists was in the hopes of {{achieving}} a success similar to that which Motown singer Marvin Gaye had with both Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston. Carla Thomas was already successful in the R business; she had already had many singles appear in both the Hot 100 and Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles charts, most recently her 1966 song [...] "B-A-B-Y". Redding agreed to record with Thomas, simply stating, [...] "Well, hey, you from Memphis, you from Tennessee, you can hang". At the time the album was recorded in January 1967, Thomas was studying at Howard University in Washington D.C. for an M.A. in English. Recorded in about six days (another source states only three days), the album features eleven songs: ten covers of soul classics, and an eleventh song, [...] "Ooh Carla, <b>Ooh</b> Otis", that Redding co-wrote with Al Bell. It features house band Booker T. & the M.G.'s, pianist Isaac Hayes, and the brass section The Memphis Horns. Six out of eleven songs were cut during their session; the rest were overdubbed by Redding in the following days owing to their concert obligations.|$|E
500|$|After [...] "Freakshow" [...] is Blackouts eight track, [...] "Toy Soldier", a R and dance-pop song {{reminiscent}} of Destiny's Child's song [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] (2004) that showcases a military drumroll and Spears singing about needing a new lover. In [...] "Hot as Ice", a R song featuring background vocals by T-Pain, she sings {{in a higher}} register: [...] "I'm just a girl {{with the ability to}} drive a man crazy / Make him call me 'mama', make him my new baby." [...] Blackouts tenth track [...] "Ooh <b>Ooh</b> Baby" [...] contains a flamenco guitar and blends the beat from Gary Glitter's [...] "Rock and Roll" [...] (1972) and the melody of The Turtles' [...] "Happy Together" [...] (1967). In the lyrics, she sings to a lover [...] "Touch me and I come alive / I can feel you on my lips / I can feel you deep inside". Kara DioGuardi said she was inspired by the relationship between Spears and her first son in the studio, saying: [...] "I would look at the two of them, the way {{they looked at each other}} and the way she would hold the baby. It kind of struck me as interesting. At times it'd be about a kid at times about a lover." [...] "Perfect Lover", an R song, has a propulsive, clattery belly-dance beat in which Spears sings lyrics such as [...] "Tick-tock / Tick-tock / Come and get me while I'm hot". The twelfth track is [...] "Why Should I Be Sad", a midtempo R song directed to her ex-husband Kevin Federline. One of the bonus tracks, [...] "Everybody", samples Eurythmics' [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] (1983). It features Spears singing about the dancefloor in a breathy lower register.|$|E
