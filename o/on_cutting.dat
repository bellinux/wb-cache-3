5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the century there were a number of major restoration projects on British castles. Before the outbreak of the First World War work was undertaken at Chepstow, Bodiam, Caernarfon and Tattershal; after the end of the war various major state funded restoration projects occurred in the 1920s with Pembroke, Caerphilly and Goodrich amongst the largest of these. This work typically centred <b>on</b> <b>cutting</b> back the vegetation encroaching on castle ruins, especially ivy, and removing damaged or unstable stonework; castles such as Beaumaris saw their moats cleaned and reflooded. Some castles such as Eilean Donan in Scotland were substantially rebuilt in the inter-war years. The early UK film industry took an interest in castles as potential sets, starting with Ivanhoe filmed at Chepstow Castle in 1913 and starring US leading actor King Baggot.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided <b>on</b> <b>cutting</b> 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did not endorse Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the changes that have occurred since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E

The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than <b>on</b> <b>cutting</b> taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.

5|$|In February 1920, Chauvel was {{promoted}} to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, back-dated to 31 December 1919. In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee's recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement {{in the face of}} defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922. On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff. Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. He attempted to maintain the Army's structure in the face of short-sighted politicians intent <b>on</b> <b>cutting</b> expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When conscription was abolished by Prime Minister James Scullin's government in 1929, it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.|$|E
5|$|Work began <b>on</b> <b>cutting</b> {{the ditch}} around Conwy Castle {{within days of}} Edward's decision. The work was {{controlled}} by Sir John Bonvillars and overseen by master mason James of St. George, and {{the first phase of}} work between 1283 and 1284 focused on creating the exterior curtain walls and towers. In the second phase, from 1284 and 1286, the interior buildings were erected, while work began on the walls for the neighbouring town. By 1287, the castle was complete. The builders recruited huge numbers of labourers from across England for the task. At each summer building season the labourers massed at Chester and then walked into Wales. Edward's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, but the total cost of the two projects came to around £15,000, a huge sum for the period.|$|E

Shortly after {{completion}} of production they brought the finished film to Warner Bros., along with several other scripts for potential projects at their newly founded company, American Zoetrope. However, studio executives strongly disliked all the scripts, including THX and demanded that Coppola repay the $300,000 they had loaned him for the Zoetrope studio, as well as insisting <b>on</b> <b>cutting</b> five minutes from the film.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the potential of single-node cuttings of potato (Solanum tuberosum) {{as a tool to}} assess genotypic differences in maturity type. Plants were exposed to different photoperiodic treatments (different photoperiods, different numbers of photoperiodic cycles), and cuttings were taken at different plant ages. Cuttings from early (and to a lesser extent also late) maturing varieties exposed to short photoperiods showed strong induction to tuberise, irrespective of plant age; the induction increased with {{an increase in the number}} of short photoperiodic cycles. The response of cuttings taken from early-maturing varieties exposed to long photoperiods depended <b>on</b> plant age: <b>cuttings</b> showed stronger induction when mother plants were older; cuttings from late-maturing varieties hardly tuberised after exposure to long photoperiods. The tuberisation of the cuttings did not depend on the length of the long photoperiod (18 or 24 h) or on the number of cycles of a photoperiod of 18 h. Tuberisation <b>on</b> <b>cuttings</b> did not properly reflect the tuber formation on the mother plants, although within varieties, significant correlations between tuberisation <b>on</b> <b>cuttings</b> and tuber yield per plant 9 weeks after planting were found with different numbers of photoperiodic cycles of 12 h. Our experiments show that the cutting technique cannot be used on older plants to assess the maturity type of potato varieties, as there are interactions between photoperiod, genotype, plant age and number of photoperiodic cycles, in the reflection of the degree of induction to tuberise <b>on</b> single-node <b>cuttings...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{practice}} of dissection flourished under Aryan rule during the 7th and 8th century. It was under their rule that medical education was standardized. This created {{a need to}} better understand human anatomy, so as to have educated surgeons. Dissection was limited by the religious taboo <b>on</b> <b>cutting</b> the human body. This changed the approach taken to accomplish the goal. The process involved the loosening of the tissues in streams of water before the outer layers were sloughed off with soft implements to reach the musculature. To perfect the technique of slicing, the prospective students used gourds and squash. These techniques of dissection gave rise to an advanced understanding of the anatomy and the enabled them to complete procedures used today, such as rhino-plasty.|$|E
