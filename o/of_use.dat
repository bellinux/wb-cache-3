40|$|The {{title of}} this paper is Errors in Compositions of The Students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the grammatical errors made by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang in practicing their English. The theory applied for this paper is Error Analysis, Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition (1974) edited by Jack C. Richards. The data of the analysis of this paper are taken from the compositions by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang. Then the errors were collected and classified based on the types of errors according to the theory applied. The finding shows that they made some errors when they made a sentence. Actually they seem to be clever to use English in writing grammatically, however they are lack of knowledge as seen in the errors encountered in their statement. The error found can be classified into error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> singular-plural, error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> word form, error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> word choice, error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> verb tense, error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> add word, error of omit word, error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> word order, error of spelling, error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> punctuation, error <b>of</b> <b>using</b> article, error <b>of</b> meaning not clear, error of run on sentence...|$|R

5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency <b>of</b> <b>use</b> at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo for MS patients.|$|E
