5|$|Hayward assumed {{command of}} the Naval <b>Ordnance</b> Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland in June 1954. He was the first naval aviator to do so, all the {{previous}} commanders having been naval <b>ordnance</b> officers. Under his guidance, the Naval <b>Ordnance</b> Laboratory developed the Mark 52 naval mine, an air-delivered weapon with acoustic, magnetic and pressure sensors. Hayward encountered some resistance with this project, as mine warfare was a neglected field in the Navy. The Naval <b>Ordnance</b> Laboratory also developed the Mark 90 nuclear bomb, a nuclear depth charge, which was tested during Operation Wigwam in May 1955.|$|E
5|$|In August 1867, the {{commander}} of the Department of Washington wrote to the Chief of <b>Ordnance,</b> asking how much longer he needed Fort Greble as an <b>ordnance</b> depot for materiel removed from dismantled forts. When it could do so, the <b>Ordnance</b> Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal, now Fort McNair, or transferred it to a still-garrisoned fort, though with post-war budget cuts, these were becoming few and far between.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the BAOR in 1979, Cross {{served as}} Adjutant to 1 <b>Ordnance</b> Battalion, before a tour in Cyprus, {{attached}} to the United Nations peace-keeping force in 1981. He studied for an MSc in guided weapons at Staff College, Camberley from 1982 to 1983 and was promoted major on 30 September 1983. Between 1984 and 1985, he was posted to Paris as a British liaison to the MILAN anti-tank missile programme, after which he rejoined 1 <b>Ordnance</b> Battalion as the company commander of 12 <b>Ordnance</b> Company. He was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 30 June 1988. Returning to Staff College, Camberley later that year {{as a member of}} the Directing Staff, he was heavily involved in the modernisation of the Command and Staff Course. In 1990, Cross returned again to Germany to take command of 1 <b>Ordnance</b> Battalion, in which he had previously been adjutant and a company commander, and, in a double-hatted post, was appointed Commander Supply, 1st Armoured Division. In the latter role, he was posted to Kuwait and later Iraq, as part of Operation Granby during the Gulf War.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate <b>ordnance</b> {{establishment}} at Little Rock was reactivated in August, 1862. Looking {{around for}} a suitable person to head this activity, General Hindman turned to the Confederate Navy and borrowed Lieutenant John W. Dunnington. Lt. Dunnington was {{the commander of the}} gunboat C.S.S. Ponchartrain, which had been brought to Little Rock in hopes of converting it to an ironclad. Dunnington was selected to head the <b>ordnance</b> works at Little Rock, and although he continued to draw his pay from the Confederate Navy Department, he was placed in charge of all Confederate <b>ordnance</b> activities (which included artillery functions) there with the rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|The P-9 Project was the codename given during World War II to the Manhattan Project's {{heavy water}} {{production}} program. The Cominco plant at Trail, British Columbia, was upgraded to produce heavy water. DuPont built three {{plants in the}} United States: at the Morgantown <b>Ordnance</b> Works, near Morgantown, West Virginia; at the Wabash River <b>Ordnance</b> Works, near Dana and Newport, Indiana; and at the Alabama <b>Ordnance</b> Works, near Childersburg and Sylacauga, Alabama. The American plants operated from 1943 until 1945. The Canadian plant at Trail continued in operation until 1956. Three nuclear reactors were built using the heavy water produced by the P-9 Project: Chicago Pile 3 at Argonne, and ZEEP and NRX at the Chalk River Laboratories in Canada.|$|E

5|$|A {{small number}} {{were used by}} the US Marine Corps' 1st Tank and 1st Scout Companies prior to the war. Some were {{employed}} on Western Samoa. None of those tanks saw action. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the <b>Ordnance</b> Committee determined that a few CTLS-4TAC and 4TAYs would be dispersed to the U.S. Army and employed in the Aleutian Islands campaign. Under <b>Ordnance</b> Committee Minutes (OCM) 18526, these examples were subsequently designated as the Light Tank T16 and Light Tank T14 respectively.|$|E
5|$|After {{pinpointing}} Hambleton's location, the Air Force bombarded {{the area}} around him {{for the next three}} days. On April 4, a flight of ten Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, half the total available in all of South Vietnam, attempted {{to pave the way for}} a SAR team, and it was badly shot up. Eight of the ten aircraft were damaged, two severely. The damage significantly affected the availability of the Skyraiders.At dusk, Major Jimmy D. Kempton flying F-4D 66-0265 with the 390th TFS (Danang Gunfighters) and a wingman entered from the coast under a descending 500 foot ceiling and dropped BLU 52 SAR <b>ordnance</b> on four sides of Hambleton's location, the last of SAR <b>ordnance</b> on April 4.|$|E
5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of <b>Ordnance</b> {{brought him a}} number of large military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of <b>Ordnance</b> became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war with}} Mexico ended, Stone {{returned}} to the Watervliet Arsenal in 1848, again taking up his position as Assistant <b>Ordnance</b> Officer. He then was granted {{a leave of absence}} from the U.S. Army, and proceeded to Europe to study military practices of the armies there for two years. In 1850 he resumed duty at the Watervliet Arsenal briefly, and then was given command of the Ft. Monroe Arsenal into 1851. Later that year Stone was appointed Chief of <b>Ordnance</b> for the Pacific Department, a post he held until 1855, and also began construction of the Benicia Arsenal in California that year. During this time he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant, effective February 26, 1853.|$|E

5|$|Groves and {{the wartime}} {{director}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, had begun the move of <b>ordnance</b> functions to Sandia in late 1945. The laboratory's <b>ordnance</b> engineering division, known as Z Division, after its first director, Jerrold R. Zacharias, was split between Los Alamos and Sandia. Between March and July 1946, Z Division relocated to Sandia, except for its mechanical engineering (Z-4) section, which followed in February 1947. Z Division worked on improving the mechanical and electrical reliability of the Mark 3 Fat Man bomb, but this work was disrupted by the Crossroads tests.|$|E
5|$|Major General Timothy Cross, CBE (born 19 April 1951) is {{a retired}} British Army officer and {{military}} logistics expert. He was commissioned in 1971 into the Royal Army <b>Ordnance</b> Corps {{and went on to}} serve in Germany, Northern Ireland and Cyprus, interspersed with staff duties and further education. He was posted to Paris in 1984, where he was involved {{in the development of the}} MILAN anti-tank weapon, before returning to his regiment as a company commander. He took command of 1 <b>Ordnance</b> Battalion in 1990 and was tasked with running logistics for 1st Armoured Division during the Gulf War. He went on to serve as Commander, Logistic Support for 3rd Infantry Division in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Near the Canadian {{side of the}} {{restored}} trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive <b>Ordnance</b> Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive <b>ordnance</b> disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system {{on the grounds of}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E

5|$|The Navy Bureau of <b>Ordnance</b> built 25 Little Boy {{assemblies}} in 1947 {{for use by}} the nuclear-capable Lockheed P2V Neptune {{aircraft carrier}} aircraft (which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers). Components were produced by the Naval <b>Ordnance</b> Plants in Pocatello, Idaho, and Louisville, Kentucky. Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets, although there were only enough initiators for six. All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E
5|$|The Office of <b>Ordnance</b> and Armoury Office {{were founded}} in the 15thcentury, taking over the Privy Wardrobe's duties of looking after the monarch's arsenal and valuables. As there was no {{standing}} army before 1661, {{the importance of the}} royal armoury at the Tower of London was that it provided a professional basis for procuring supplies and equipment in times of war. The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by the 16thcentury they had moved to a position in the inner ward. The Board of <b>Ordnance</b> (successor to these Offices) had its headquarters in the White Tower and used surrounding buildings for storage. In 1855 the Board was abolished; its successor (the Military Store Department of the War Office) was also based there until 1869, after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich (where the recently closed Woolwich Dockyard was converted into a vast <b>ordnance</b> store).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Ordnance</b> QF 25-pounder Short was an Australian {{variant of}} the British <b>Ordnance</b> QF 25-pounder field gun/howitzer. The gun was {{developed}} by modifying the 25-pounder's design to improve its mobility during jungle warfare. Development began in 1942, and the weapon first entered service with the Australian Army the next year. It was used by several Royal Australian Artillery regiments during fighting in the South West Pacific Area, before being declared obsolete in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Panzerkampfwagen IV (PzKpfw IV), {{commonly}} known as the Panzer IV, was a German medium tank developed in the late 1930s and used extensively during the Second World War. Its <b>ordnance</b> inventory designation was Sd.Kfz. 161.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{supported}} by the 4th Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery from the Royal Artillery. This battery had three troops, equipped with four <b>Ordnance</b> QF 6 pounders each, and provided the brigade's only anti-tank guns. Later in the war, the battery was increased to five troops, three of them retaining the 6pounder, while the other two had four <b>Ordnance</b> QF 17 pounders each. While the 6pounder could fit inside the Horsa glider, the size and weight of the 17pounder and its Morris C8 tractor unit required the larger Hamilcar glider. The 591st (Antrim) Parachute Squadron from the Royal Engineers and the 225th (Parachute) Field Ambulance of the Royal Army Medical Corps completed the brigade formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{older and}} more-stable forms of cannon were muzzle-loading {{as opposed to}} breech-loading— {{in order to be}} used they had to have their <b>ordnance</b> packed down the bore through the muzzle rather than {{inserted}} through the breech.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} guns, armor, <b>ordnance,</b> and design was {{changing}} rapidly, so experience could quickly become irrelevant. Combat {{experience in the}} Spanish–American War had shown the value of many smaller guns at close range, where the larger guns had been inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Then on 24 February Cochrane {{captured}} the French naval brig Caroline, of four guns, {{which had been}} carrying <b>ordnance</b> stores from Genoa to Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Two other tank {{designs were}} {{produced}} by Marmon-Herrington that branched {{directly from the}} CTLS. They were both intended to be shipped to the Dutch, but were overtaken by the <b>Ordnance</b> Department.|$|E

5|$|After its {{founding}} in 1915, a large source of the Avery Brundage Company's business was wartime government contracts. Brundage, who applied for a commission in the Army <b>Ordnance</b> Corps but was rejected, {{in the postwar period}} {{became a member of the}} Construction Division Association, composed of men who had built facilities for the military, and later became its president from 1926 to 1928.|$|E
5|$|An 1891 <b>Ordnance</b> Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had been filled in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as a reservoir, {{suggesting}} that the canal had ceased {{to be used as}} a way of transporting goods to and from the complex. By 1902, the canal basin had been filled in, however exactly when it was filled in is unknown.|$|E
5|$|As the {{existing}} supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient to meet {{requirements for the}} production of the M3, the <b>Ordnance</b> Department developed the M5 gun shield, which replaced the M2A3. The new design was designated as the M3A1 Gun Motor Carriage.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, Orizaba {{carried over}} 15,000troops in six convoy trips to France {{before the end}} of World War I. In one such voyage, Orizaba’s {{executive}} officer, <b>ordnance</b> expert William Price Williamson, worked closely with Commander Richard Drace White—Orizaba’s commanding officer, himself an <b>ordnance</b> expert—to develop a workable depth charge launcher which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a depth charge launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of <b>ordnance</b> carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and <b>ordnance</b> elevators, {{preventing}} torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns still on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself.
