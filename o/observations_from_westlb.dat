In this case, the errors are the deviations of the <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> the population mean, while the residuals are the deviations of the <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> the sample mean.|$|R

30|$|Our {{definitions}} for temporal completeness above {{apply to}} sets of <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> a single site/sensor.

For instance, we can compute lag and completeness for <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> locations within a cell in a spatial grid. In turn, we can define aggregates that include both spatial and temporal aspects of our data. We may do this if we allow “coverage” of the cell to come from multiple sites within the cell.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Observations</b> <b>from</b> the {{affected}} population {{can be an}} important source of information for disaster management and rapid loss estimation. New Internet technologies facilitate fast and easy data collection from the public. A major obstacle for using this information is its unknown quality. This research will develop methods to assess the quality of <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> {{the affected}} population for rapid loss estimation after flood events. It will yield an assessment of the fitness for use of flood <b>observations</b> <b>from</b> the public for empirical loss modeling and an automated procedure to evaluate the quality of these observations. ...|$|R
