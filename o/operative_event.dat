40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{management}} of combined carotid and coronary disease is controversial, and {{the outcomes of}} combined carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have not been determined on a community-wide basis. This study was undertaken to evaluate the community-wide outcomes of combined CEA and CABG and to evaluate the risk for adverse events. Methods: A complete medical record review of 10, 561 CEA procedures randomly selected from Medicare patients undergoing CEA in 10 states was performed. In this sample, 226 procedures were performed in combination with CABG in the same <b>operative</b> <b>event.</b> Results: Recent ipsilateral stroke or transient ischemic attack was the indication for the CEA in only 12 % of patients undergoing CEA/CABG, and 56 % were asymptomatic {{with respect to the}} carotid lesion. The combined stroke and death rate was 17. 7 % (25 nonfatal strokes, two fatal strokes, and 13 nonstroke deaths). Eighty percent of the nonfatal strokes were disabling. Proximal aortic arch atherosclerosis and symptomatic carotid stenosis were associated with stroke (P <. 05). Female gender, emergent operation, redo CABG, blood pressure on pump, total pump time, presence of left main disease, and number of diseased coronaries were associated with mortality (P <. 05). The strokes appeared {{to be associated with the}} <b>operative</b> <b>event,</b> but diagnosis was delayed and postevent carotid patency was not documented. Most strokes were not limited to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the CEA. Conclusion: The community-wide outcomes of combined CEA/CABG in the Medicare population are inferior to those reported in many single-institution reviews. Diagnosis of postoperative stroke is often delayed, and most strokes are not limited to the hemisphere ipsilateral to the CEA operative site. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 32 - 9. ...|$|E

40|$|Surgeons {{typically}} document <b>operative</b> <b>events</b> using dictation services. Dictated {{reports are}} frequently incomplete or delayed. Electronic note templates could potentially improve this process. Using a study design of alternating four week blocks, {{we compared the}} timeliness and comprehensiveness of operative notes created {{through the use of}} electronic templates (structured text documents for reuse) versus dictation services for five surgical procedures. Templates resulted in dramatically faster times to the presence of a verified operative report in the medical record compared to dictation services (mean 28 v. 22, 440 minutes). Templates increased overall compliance with national standards for operative note documentation and avoided transcription costs. Documentation with templates took slightly more time than dictation (mean 6. 77 v. 5. 96 minutes; P= 0. 036), not including the additional time necessary to subsequently verify dictated reports. We conclude that electronic note templates can improve the timeliness and comprehensiveness of operative documentation, while decreasing transcription costs and requiring minimal additional {{effort on the part of}} surgeons...|$|R

40|$|Background: Understanding {{the nature}} and causes of medical adverse events may help their prevention. This {{systematic}} re-view explores the types, risk factors, and likely causes of preventable adverse events in the hospital sector. Methods: MEDLINE (1970 - 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL (1970 - 2005) and the reference lists were used to identify the stud-ies and a structured narrative method used to synthesise the data. Results: <b>Operative</b> adverse <b>events</b> were more common but less preventable and diagnostic adverse events less common but more preventable than other adverse events. Preventable adverse events were often associated {{with more than one}} contribu-tory factor. The majority of adverse events were linked to individual human error, and a significant proportion of these caused serious patient harm. Equipment failure was involved in a small proportion of adverse events and rarely caused pa-tient harm. The proportion of system failures varied widely ranging from 3 % to 85 % depending on the data collection and classification methods used.

40|$|Purpose : To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} the Society for Vascular Surgery/American Association for Vascular Surgery (SVS/AAVS) anatomical severity grading (ASG) score and operative outcomes in fenestrated endovascular repair (f-EVAR) for juxtarenal aortic aneurysm. Methods : A review was conducted of all patients treated at our clinic with commercially available, custom-made f-EVAR devices between June 2007 and December 2011. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were analyzed in a dedicated vascular 3 -dimensional workstation for calculation of the ASG score. Of the 100 patients treated with f-EVAR during the study period, 88 (69 men; mean age 70 years, range 50 - 82) had high quality CT scans available for generating semiautomatic centerline-of-flow reconstructions needed to calculate the ASG score. The mean score was used to divide the patients into high and low score groups for comparison of operative outcomes. Results : A total ASG score ≥ 24 was associated with longer procedure time (357 ± 121 vs. 298 ± 131 minutes, p= 0. 03) and more frequent intraoperative adjunctive maneuvers (48 % vs. 29 % of patients, p= 0. 05). An ASG neck score ≥ 7 was associated with longer procedure time (365 ± 126 vs. 288 ± 119 minutes, p< 0. 01), more <b>operative</b> adverse <b>events</b> (31 % vs. 14 % of patients, p= 0. 05), higher radiation exposure (53828 ± 37341 vs. 38788 ± 25846 μGym (2), p= 0. 04), and more frequent postoperative complications (46 % vs. 18 % of patients, p< 0. 01). An ASG aneurysm score ≥ 5 was associated with <b>operative</b> adverse <b>events</b> (44 % vs. 19 % of patients, p= 0. 04).

In the brain, these events are associated with cellular degeneration and may reflect release of the FGF- 2 gene from cell contact inhibition. We used cultures of human astrocytes to examine whether expression of FGF- 2 is also controlled by soluble growth factors. Treatment of subconfluent astrocytes with interleukin- 1 �, epidermal or platelet-derived growth factors, 18 -kDa FGF- 2, or serum or direct stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate or adenylate cyclase with forskolin increased the levels of 18 -, 22 -, and 24 -kDa FGF- 2 isoforms and FGF- 2 mRNA. Transfection of FGF- 2 promoter–luciferase constructs identified a unique � 555 /� 513 bp growth factor-responsive element (GFRE) that confers high basal promoter activity and activation by growth factors to a downstream promoter region. It also identified a separate region (� 624 /� 556 bp) essential for PKC and cAMP stimulation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} <b>operative</b> procedures, pathophysiological <b>events,</b> management strategies, {{and clinical}} outcomes after acute intraoperative brain herniation during elective neurosurgery. METHODS: Review of clinical diagnoses, <b>operative</b> <b>events,</b> postoperative CT findings, intracranial pressure, and arterial blood pressure changes and outcomes {{in a series}} of patients in whom elective neurosurgery had to be abandoned because of severe brain herniation. RESULTS: Acute intraoperative brain herniation occurred in seven patients. In each patient subarachnoid or intraventricular haemorrhage preceded the brain herniation. The haemorrhage occurred after intraoperative aneurysm rupture either before arachnoidal dissection (three) or during clip placement (one); after resection of 70 % of a recurrent hemispheric astroblastoma; after resection of a pineal tumour; and after a stereotactic biopsy of an AIDS lesion. In all patients the procedure was abandoned because of loss of access to the intracranial operating site, medical measures to control intracranial pressure undertaken (intravenous thiopentone), an intraventricular catheter or Camino intracranial pressure monitor inserted, and CT performed immediately after scalp closure. The patients were transferred to an intensive care unit for elective ventilation and multimodality physiological monitoring. Using this strategy all patients recovered from the acute ictus and no patient had intracranial pressure > 35 mm Hg. Although one patient with an aneurysm rebled and died three days later the other six patients did well considering the dramatic and apparently catastrophic nature of the open brain herniation. CONCLUSIONS: There are fundamental differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms, neuroradiological findings, and outcomes between open brain herniation occurring in post-traumatic and elective neurosurgical patients. The surprisingly good outcomes in this series may have occurred because the intraoperative brain herniation was secondary to extra-axial subarachnoid or intraventricular haemorrhage rather than intraparenchymal haemorrhage or acute brain oedema. Expeditious abandonment of the procedure and closure of the cranium may also have contributed to the often very satisfactory clinical outcome...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background An unusual {{sequence}} of post <b>operative</b> <b>events</b> heralded by hemodynamic deterioration followed by dyspnea and rapidly progressive dilatation of superficial neck and facial veins, resembling a superior vena cava syndrome, two days post surgical resection of filamentous aortic valve masses, closure of a patent foramen ovale, {{and performance of}} a modified Maze procedure for atrial fibrillation in a patient that presented with transient neurologic findings is presented. Case Presentation Although both clinical findings and hemodynamic derangements completely resolved following tricuspid valve repair aimed to correct the new onset severe tricuspid regurgitation noted post operatively; a clear mechanism was not readily obvious and diagnostic testing data somewhat conflictive. We present a careful retrospective examination of all clinical data and review possible clinical entities {{that could have been}} implicated in this particular case and recognize that transesophageal echocardiographic findings were most useful in identifying the best course of action. Conclusion After reviewing all clinical data and despite the inconclusive nature of test results; the retrospective examination of transesophageal echocardiographic findings proved to be most useful in identifying the best course of action. We postulate that in our case, resolution of the suspected pulmonary embolism with anticoagulation and reestablishment of a normal right ventricular geometry with tricuspid valve repair worked in unison in restoring normal hemodynamics and resolving both dyspnea and venous dilatation. </p...|$|R

Subjects and MethodsAll consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic assisted colectomy were entered into a prospective database and this data analysed. Data collected included patient demographics, pre-operative diagnosis, <b>operative</b> <b>events,</b> post-operative morbidity and outcome. ResultsOver the thirty-six months period July 1, 2005 –December 31, 2005 and July 1, 2006 –December 31, 2008, thirty patients each underwent laparoscopic assisted colectomy for a colonic neoplasm. Their mean age was 63 years with M: F ratio of 1 : 2. Seventy-four per cent of the patients had carcinomas which was located {{on the right and}} sigmoid colon in 17 and 10 patients respectively. Mean operative time was 98  min for patients with right-sided lesions and blood loss for the entire group was minimal. Two patients were converted to open resections. Median duration of hospitalization was five days. There was no mortality but three patients had complications. After median follow-up of 30 months, there was no local or systemic recurrence. ConclusionsAppropriately selected patients with colonic neoplasms can be safely subjected to a laparoscopic assisted resection and expect to enjoy the advantages of this technique even in a developing country setting. The outcome of thirty consecutive laparoscopic assisted colectomies is reported demonstrating that this technique can be safely applied to selected patients with colonic carcinomas in developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Already evoked in {{the years}} 1970 by American economists such as Sargen, the concept of country risk {{returned}} {{to the front of}} the economic scene following the financial crises of the years 1990. The concept of country risk is not new insofar as it is inherent in the swaps between two economic entities of different countries. The country risk appears since the normal refunding of the foreign credit is opposed because of the economic, political, social and financial conditions prevailing in the country of the debtor. However, as no theory of the country risk really exists, it appeared necessary to us to highlight the inherent whole of dimensions to this concept. With this intention, it is convenient to release the various components, classified according to three complementary angles of incidence. The type of crisis refers to the nature of the entity which undergoes the country risk with the determination of the banking risk, the financial and industrial risk and, finally, of the commercial risk. The second approach is interested in nature of the risk, i. e. with the characteristics of the debtor entity. It is of the sovereign risk, the risk of transfer and the systemic risk. Lastly, the third angle of analysis sticks to the type of crisis, the origin of the <b>operative</b> <b>events</b> of crisis and this, thanks to the forward setting of the political risk and the economico-financial risk.

The advantages of such a regimen are its minimal effects on vital signs, protective reflexes and patient co-operation, the minimal requirement for monitoring and rapid recovery to street fitness [1]. Sedatives admin-istered by mouth can {{be as effective as}} those given i. v. and have the advantages of greater patient acceptability, ease of administration, safety and fewer sequelae [2, 3]. Temazepam, a safe and commonly-used benzo-diazepine with a short duration of action and no active metabolites, has been reformulated as an elixir which is thought to be more rapidly absorbed than the original gelatin capsules.

We have compared temazepam elixir admin-istered by mouth with i. v. Diazemuls in patients undergoing minor oral surgery and attempted to relate the plasma concentrations of temazepam with effect.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine outcome and durability of {{internal carotid artery}} bypass grafting with saphenous vein. MethodsData for 50 patients undergoing serial clinical and ultrasound surveillance were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. ResultsBypass grafting was performed in 50 patients between 1995 and 2002, the commonest reasons being excessive endarterectomy zone thinning or penetrating atheroma (n = 22), severe internal carotid artery coiling above the endarterectomy zone (n = 14), and patch infection (n = 5). Perioperative mortality was 2 %, and death and stroke rate was 6 %. Perioperative complications were associated with complex cardiovascular events, including hemorrhage after prosthetic patch infection, on-table thrombosis after endarterectomy, and synchronous carotid artery–cardiac reconstruction. One patient had a late ipsilateral stroke (10 months; normal scan). Cumulative stroke-free survival at 3 years (including <b>operative</b> <b>events)</b> was 91 %. Cumulative freedom from recurrent stenosis greater than 70 % or occlusion was 86 % at 1 year and 83 % at 3 years. Severe recurrent stenosis or occlusion developed in 7 patients, within 9 months of surgery in 6 patients and with 18 months in 1 patient. Angioplasty was performed without complication (no protection device, no stent) in 5 patients, 3 of whom required repeat angioplasty {{on at least one}} further occasion. ConclusionsIn common with venous conduits elsewhere, carotid artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein is associated with a high incidence of early graft stenosis. The long-term stroke risk, however, is low. Carotid artery bypass grafting is a safe and durable alternative when endarterectomy would prove hazardous or inadvisable, but regular surveillance is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Videolaparoscopic surgery {{has been}} used for {{treatment}} of almost all surgical abdominal diseases, mainly where there are no large ressections, or operative field is limited. In these situations, laparoscopic surgery has the advantages of less morbidity, quick recovery and good cosmetic results. Bezoars removal, or its mobilization, is probably included in these possible proceedings. Three non-laparotomic procedures were described: 1. endoscopic-laparoscopic; 2. videolaparoscopy and mobilization of intestinal bezoar to the cecum; 3. laparoscopy and gastrotomy for bezoar removal, through suprapubic incision or the umbilical punction. There have been only two publications describing the videolaparoscopic method for bezoar removal, and the methods applied can be complications or morbidity related. We describe one case where the applied technique is simple and easy to perform, time saving and probably less complications-related. This technique, with four trocars, utilized a plastic bag besides the stomach to be opened, followed by gastrotomy, bezoar removal and immediate introduction in the plastic bag, suture of gastrotomy and removal through the left subcostal trocar. This technique was feasible and easy to perform, with short operative time, and there were no intra or post-operative complications; the patient was discharged in the second post-operative day, and is without further problems after one year follow-up. We believe that this could be an adequate technique to perform laparoscopic gastric bezoar removal, and the rigid sequence of <b>operative</b> <b>events</b> allows a quick procedure, with minimal contamination. The videolaparoscopy seems to be an adequate access to surgical treatment of gastro-intestinal bezoars, with or without obstruction, and should be the ellected the procedure of choice to begin the surgical treatment, with convertion to laparotomy in case of any intra-operative adversity...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{use of the}} {{standard}} monopolar electrocautery is associated with significant risks of implant malfunction in patients on a cardiac pacemaker. It is also associated with a risk of adverse cardiac events due to blood loss and fluid absorption. The properties of the holmium laser prevent the occurrence of these adverse events. We report the successful use of this technology in resecting the gland in patients on a permanent cardiac pacemaker implant. MATERIALS AND Methods: Six patients with permanent cardiac pacemaker implant were treated with holmium laser resection of prostate {{over a period of}} two years. Treated patients had bothersome prostatic symptoms and failed to respond to medical therapy. All patients were operated under spinal anesthesia using a high power VersaPulse ® PowerSuiteTM Holmium laser source. Normal saline was used as irrigant. Intravesical tissue morcellator was also used to remove the larger fragments in two of the patients. Results : Median patient age was 60 years (range 56 - 73) and median prostate volume was 40 cc (range 20 - 48 cc). None of the patient required blood transfusion or had significant hyponatremia or Transurethral resection syndrome. No patients had any pacemaker malfunction or hemodynamic instability during the procedure or in immediate postoperative period. Improvement in maximum urine flow rate was observed from an average of 7 ml/sec in preoperative period to 22 ml/sec postoperatively at 3 month followup. Conclusions: Holmium laser prostatectomy offers the ideal modality of surgery in patients on a cardiac pacemaker. It helps to avoid additional preparation and minimizes the risk of device malfunction and adverse post <b>operative</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Hospital Information System, first {{developed}} at our main institute for {{the integration of}} clinical, administrative and management resources in Cardiology, has been recently extended for use at our section specialised in Cardiac Surgery. Extension of the electronic medical record (EMR) to the management of patients admitted in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery started {{with the development of}} a system for reporting operations in structured form and for estimating their complexity, according to a model set up in a previous study involving our institute and other two pediatric cardiac surgery centers. The international congenital heart surgery nomenclature, promoted in Europe by the Pediatric European Cardiac Surgical Registry (ECSUR) project, was adopted. The ECSUR data set with associated short lists (translated into Italian) of pre-operative risk factors, diagnoses, procedures and complications was implemented in our EMR. Minor coding expansions were suggested by both surgeons and cardiologists. EMR interface was developed to record, for each operation, diagnoses and procedures, patient findings and conditions, <b>operative</b> <b>events</b> and methods.

From the combination of underlying diagnosis and procedure each operation was classified in terms of 3 -level complexity according to the developed multicenter model. The system is used daily for reporting operations in our Pediatric Cardiac Surgery department. All operations since January 2000 were archived (a total of 547 in two years) and data were periodically exported and submitted to the ECSUR database center.

The {{aim of this study}} was to show that dipyridamole stress scintigraphy could be a prognostic aid for patient selection. Between 1991 and 2000, 275 patients underwent dipyridamole stress myocardial scintigraphy before peripheral arterial surgery of the lower limbs (49 %), the aortic (33 %) or carotid arteries (18 %). A perfusion defect was observed in 145 patients suggesting myocardial ischaemia in 79 cases and myocardial infarction in 66 cases. Twenty-seven of the 79 ischaemic patients underwent a preoperative coronary revascularisation. The <b>operative</b> adverse coronary <b>events</b> (5 %) were: 7 non-fatal myocardial infarctions and 7 acute coronary syndromes. The 79 ischaemic patients had a higher risk of adverse coronary events: 11 % (ischaemia) versus 3 % (no ischaemia) (p < 0. 01). Myocardial scintigraphy allowed stratification of patients with an intermediate risk of Eagle's score into high coronary risk (15 %, ischaemia) or low coronary risk (2 %, no ischaemia) (p < 0. 01). The extent of the ischaemia was associated with a higher risk of adverse coronary events: 4 zones (20 %) versus 1 zone (5 %) (p = 0. 02). Preoperative coronary revascularisation tended to reduce the risk of adverse coronary events from 15 % to 4 % (p = NS). Myocardial ischaemia (p < 0. 0001) and left bundle branch block (p = 0. 002) were the two predictive factors of an adverse <b>operative</b> coronary <b>event.</b> Thallium-dipyridamole myocardial scintigraphy with a high negative predictive value (97 %) is a useful tool for the identification of high risk patients for whom an aggressive preoperative therapeutic strategy may be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and purposeOverviews of {{randomized}} patch trials by the Cochrane Collaboration {{suggest that}} a policy of routine patching is preferable to routine primary closure. However, there is no systematic evidence that patch type, whether prosthetic or vein, influences outcome after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). MethodsTwo hundred seventy-three patients were randomized to vein or thin-walled Dacron patch (Hemashield Finesse) closure of the arteriotomy after 276 CEA procedures. Patients were reviewed clinically and with duplex ultrasound scanning at 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months or until death. No patients were lost to follow-up. Cumulative statistical analyses are presented for the 264 patients (269 CEAs) who actually received a randomized treatment allocation. ResultsCumulative freedom from death or ipsilateral stroke at 3 years (including <b>operative</b> <b>events)</b> was 93. 0 % in the Dacron patch group and 95. 5 % in the vein group P =. 42). Cumulative freedom from death or any stroke was 91. 5 % after Dacron patch closure and 93. 9 % after vein closure (P =. 46). Cumulative freedom from recurrent stenosis greater than 70 % or occlusion at 3 years was 92. 9 % for patients randomized to the Dacron patch group and 98. 4 % for patients randomized to the vein group (P =. 03). At 3 years the incidence of stroke in the carotid territory not operated on was 1. 0 % in 93 patients with no contralateral internal carotid artery disease at randomization, and increased to 1. 3 % in 78 patients with 1 % to 69 % stenosis, and 2. 0 % in 51 patients with contralateral 70 % to 99 % stenosis. No late strokes occurred distal to 42 occluded contralateral internal carotid arteries. ConclusionsPatch type has no influence on early operative risk, no association with enhanced patterns of thrombogenicity in the early postoperative period, and no influence on risk for ipsilateral or any stroke at 3 years. Dacron patches were, however, associated with a significantly higher incidence of recurrent stenosis at 3 years, with most occurring within 6 to 12 months of surgery. However, the higher incidence of recurrent stenosis {{was not associated with}} a parallel increase in late stroke, and in this study a program of serial ultrasound surveillance could not have prevented one ipsilateral stroke...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundExplosive blasts {{are common}} in the modern {{military}} environment. These blasts incorporate a concussive component (primary blast injury) and a penetrating component (secondary blast injury). Penetrating injuries are {{the leading cause of}} death and injury in these attacks. This review characterizes the vascular injuries associated with penetrating blast injuries to the neck and provides recommendations on the early management of these casualties for the surgeon unfamiliar with these injuries. MethodsThe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry was queried for admissions from January 1, 2006, to June 30, 2010, coded for a penetrating injury to the neck caused by a blast mechanism. Medical records were abstracted from the patient's initial presentation and care through the deployed military medical system. We recorded the vascular injuries, diagnostic studies, <b>operative</b> <b>events,</b> and early postinjury course for all identified patients. ResultsQuery of the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center Trauma Registry initially identified 252 patients, of which 53 were excluded because their injuries arose from other mechanisms or were only superficial. Among the remaining 199 patients, 38 (19. 1 %) sustained 44 vascular injuries requiring treatment. Compelling physical examination findings (“hard signs”) were present in 15 (7. 5 %), who underwent immediate neck exploration. Another 12 patients also underwent neck exploration without any prior imaging studies. Computed tomography (CT) or CT angiography (CTA) examinations were done in 172 patients without hard-sign physical examination findings. Of these, the result of the imaging study was negative in 106 patients, and no further investigation or treatment for cervical vascular trauma was initiated. Of 66 patients who underwent CT/CTA before operative neck exploration, CT/CTA identified a vascular injury in 26 that was later confirmed on neck exploration. The combination of physical examination and CT/CTA resulted in a sensitivity of 96. 3 % and a specificity of 97. 2 % in diagnosing cervical vascular injury. ConclusionsPenetrating cervical wounds from war-related blast trauma are associated with potentially life-threatening vascular injuries. The presenting physical examination, availability of CT/CTA, local surgical expertise, and tactical combat situation all contribute to surgical decision making in these patients. In patients without hard signs of vascular trauma and a normal CT/CTA of the neck, there is no evidence to support mandatory surgical neck explorations or further immediate diagnostic studies to exclude cervical vascular injury...|$|R
40|$|Thallium imoying {{has been}} used to risk-stratify pts {{undergoing}} vascular surgery (VS), though the efficacy of this approach is debated. Positron emission tomography (PET) has the benefit of permitting a true resting scan, measurement of the extent of ischemia, and is highly specific for the diagnosis of coronary disease. We investigated the benefit of more accurate identification of ischemia and a lower frequency of false positives by using PET for risk stratification in 77 pts (68 ± 9 y, 52 males) undergoing VS (including 39 aortic operations — 51 %) without recent myocardial revascularization. One or more clinical risk factors (age> 70, diabetes, angina, prior infarction or heart failure) were present in 63 pts; 32 had > 2 factors. PET followed infusion of 60 mCi of Rb 82 at rest and after dipyridamole-handgrip stress. Using a quantitative color scale in a 24 segment model of the left ventricle, scans were reported as normal, fixed defects only (FD) or reversible (deterioration> 15 % with stress) defects (RD). Events included infarction (MI) and unstable angina (UA), perioperatively and at late follow-up (17 ± 6 months) in 74 pts. Fourteen pts (18 %) suffered peri-operative events (5 MI, 9 UA, no cardiac deaths) giving PET-RD a sensitivity of 71 %. Of 63 pts without events, RD was present in 16 (p= 0. 003) giving a specificity of 66 %. Seven pts suffered late events;Rb-PETPerioperative MIPerioperative UALate eventsRD (n= 26) 283 FD (n= 31) 104 Normal (n= 20) 210 Among 26 pts with RD (19 of whom were on anti-anginal therapy at the time of surgery), only 10 (38 %) had peri <b>operative</b> <b>events.</b> The extent of ischemia in pts with RD having events (9 ± 7 segments) exceeded that in pts with RD not having events (6 ± 4 segments, p=NS). In pts with RD, 7 / 10 pts with events had extensive ischemia (> 5 segments), compared with 9 / 16 without events (p=NS). ConclusionAbsence of RD by PET confers a low probability of events (especially UA), comparable to conventional imaging. FD by PET are not associated with events. However, RD at PET has a low specificity for peri-operative events (irrespective of extent of RDI; avoidance of events in the absence of myocardial revascularization may be attributable to medical and anesthetic measures...|$|R

E. & McKnight, S. L. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92, 11081 - 11085]. The temporal expression profile of this protein, designated FK 506 -binding protein (FKBP) 51, is concordant with the clonal-expansion period undertaken by 3 T 3 -L 1 cells after exposure to adipogenic hormones. Having observed FKBP 51 synthesis early during adipogenesis, we tested the effects of three immunosuppressive drugs [...] cyclosporin A, FK 506, and rapamycin [...] on the terminal-differentiation process. Adipocyte conversion was not affected by either cyclosporin A or FK 506 and yet was significantly reduced by rapamycin at drug concentrations as low as 10 nM. Clonal expansion was impeded in drug-treated cultures, as was the accumulation of cytoplasmic lipid droplets normally seen late during differentiation. Rapamycin treatment likewise inhibited the expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha, a transcription factor required for 3 T 3 -L 1 cell differentiation. All three of these effects were reversed by high FK 506 concentrations, indicating that the <b>operative</b> inhibitory <b>event</b> was mediated by an immunophilin-rapamycin complex...|$|R

Often these are older patients who have baseline abnormalities of lung function, decreased nutritional status, and other comorbid diseases. Postoperatively, factors that influence patient recovery include removal of all or {{a portion of a}} lung, painful incisions, retention of secretions, change in the shape and mechanics of the thoracic cage, and reconfiguration of gastrointestinal continuity, which result in suboptimal pulmonary function, decreased appetite, decreased mobility and strength, and increased risk of aspiration. Perioperative care of the thoracic surgical patient re-quires a team approach.

40|$|Osteoblast {{differentiation}} is a multistep {{series of}} events modulated by an integrated cascade of gene expression that initially supports proliferation and the sequential expression of genes associated with the biosynthesis, organization, and mineralization of the bone extracellular matrix. Transcriptional control defines regulatory <b>events</b> <b>operative</b> both developmentally and for support of bone tissue-specific properties. This review focuses on components of transcriptional regulation that function in growth control during osteoblast proliferation and those that postproliferatively contribute to maturation of the bone phenotype. Emphasis is on transcription of the cell cycle-regulated histone gene and the bone-specific osteocalcin gene as paradigms for genes with promoter elements exhibiting responsiveness to {{a broad spectrum of}} physiological regulatory signals. Additionally, the potential contributions provided by the three-dimensional organization of the histone and osteocalcin gene promoters to integration of regulatory activities at multiple, independent, and overlapping regulatory domains are explored...|$|R

Significant delay in infection of nematodes from conidia adhering to their cuticles occurred following exposure of conidia to freeze-drying,- 800 or- 1700 storage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{surgeons}} who use carotid patching favour using a patch {{made from}} an autologous vein, whilst others {{prefer to use}} synthetic materials. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review {{was to assess the}} safety and efficacy of different materials for carotid patch angioplasty. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group trials register (last searched November 2002). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 to December 2001), EMBASE (1980 to December 2001) and Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1980 to 2001). We also handsearched eight journals and five conference proceedings. Reference lists were checked and we contacted experts in the field to identify further published and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing one type of carotid patch with another for carotid endarterectomy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, trial quality, and extracted the data MAIN RESULTS: The previous version of this review included three trials involving 326 operations. Since then a further five trials have been reported, increasing the number of operations to 1480. Prior to 1995, all studies had compared vein closure with PTFE closure, but three of the later studies compared vein to Dacron grafts instead and one compared Dacron with PTFE. Allocation was not adequately concealed in two trials, and one only followed up patients to the time of hospital discharge. Intention to treat analysis was possible for six trials. In all but two trials a patient could be randomised twice and have each carotid artery randomised to different treatment groups. There were too few <b>operative</b> <b>events</b> to determine whether there was any difference between the vein and Dacron patches for perioperative stroke, death and arterial complications. The one study that compared Dacron and PTFE patches found a significant risk of combined stroke and transient ischaemic attack (p = 0. 03) and restenosis at 30 days (p = 0. 01), a borderline significant risk of perioperative stroke (p = 0. 06), and a non significant increased risk of perioperative carotid thrombosis (p = 0. 1) with dacron compared with PTFE. Five trials followed up patients for longer than 30 days. During follow-up for more than one year, no difference was shown between the two types of patch for the risk of stroke, death, or arterial restenosis. However, the number of events was small. Based on 15 events in 776 patients in four trials, there were significantly fewer pseudoaneurysms associated with synthetic patches than vein (odds ratio [OR] 0. 09, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 02 to 0. 49) but the numbers involved were small and the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the differences between different types of patch material are very small. Consequently, many more data than are currently available will be required to establish whether any differences do exist. Some evidence exists that PTFE patches may be superior to Colagen impregnated Dacron grafts in terms of perioperative stroke rates and restenosis. However the evidence is based upon data from a single, small trial and more studies that compare different types of synthetic graft are required to make firm conclusions. Psuedo aneurysm formation may be more common after use of a vein patch compared with a synthetic patch...|$|R

Eleven of the 20 CAH patients showed a significant T lymphocyte proliferative response to HBcAg, whereas no proliferation was detectable in response to envelope antigens (HBs and pre-S) in any patient. T cell subset fractionation revealed that HBcAg specific proliferation {{was limited to the}} CD 4 + (helper/inducer) population. CD 8 + (suppressor/cytotoxic) T cells were unresponsive to HBcAg and did not suppress the proliferative {{response of}} autologous CD 4 + cells. The HBcAg specific T cell proliferative response did not correlate with serum anti-core antibody titres or with biochemical evidence of liver disease.

40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) open {{reading frame}} (ORF) 63 is abundantly {{transcribed}} in latently infected human ganglia and encodes a 278 -amino-acid protein, IE 63, with immediate-early kinetics. IE 63 is expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons during VZV latency and in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus during productive infection; however, the mechanism(s) involved in IE 63 nuclear import and retention has remained unclear. We constructed and identified a recombinant monoclonal antibody to detect a posttranslationally modified form of IE 63. Analysis {{of a series of}} IE 63 truncation and substitution mutants showed that amino acids 186 to 195 are required for antibody binding. Synthetic peptides corresponding to this region identified IE 63 S 186 as a target for casein kinase II phosphorylation. In addition, acidic charges supplied by E 194 and E 195 were required for antibody binding.

This paper is a systematic review of the post-operative outcomes in patients with aortic valve and/or aortic root disease following FSB implantation. Methods: Electronic databases were searched for primary analysis, prospective randomised studies comparing the FSB with an alternative aortic prosthesis wereluded. Additionally, case series thatluded data for at least 100 individual operated patients were used for secondary analysis. Results: Among three identified randomised studies, 199 FSB cases were compared with homografts, and stented and an alternative stentless bioprosthesis. The FSB showed comparable hospital mortality (4. 5 % vs 5. 3 %) and eight-year actuarial survival (80 ± 5. 0 % versus 77 ± 6. 0 %) with the homograft (respectively) and comparable reduction in left ventricular mass index relative to other prosthesis types. Over 6000 individual patients wereluded in the selected 15 case series. Weighted mean <b>operative</b> mortality, neurological <b>event</b> rate and five-year actuarial survival was 5. 2 %, 5. 5 % and 77. 8 %, respectively.

40|$|BackgroundFor {{patients}} with aortic regurgitation (AR), aortic valve (AV) repair represents an attractive alternative to AV replacement (AVR), {{because it does}} not expose patients to the risk of prosthetic valve complications. Although the durability of AV repair has been documented, its prognosis has not yet been compared with prognosis of AVR. MethodsWe performed a propensity score analysis to match patients who underwent surgical correction of severe AR by either AVR or AV repair between 1995 and 2012. After matching, 44 pairs of patients were compared regarding baseline characteristics; overall survival; <b>operative</b> survival; cardiac <b>events,</b> including reoperations; recurrent AR; and New York Heart Association functional class at final follow-up. ResultsOperative mortality was similar in the AV repair and AVR groups (2 % vs 5 %; P = . 56). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated a significantly better overall 9 -year survival after AV repair than after AVR (87 % vs 60 %; P = . 007). Cox proportional survival analysis demonstrated that the choice of treatment was an independent predictor of postoperative survival. Finally, AV repair resulted in a slight increase, albeit not statistically significant, in reoperation rate (8 % vs 2 %; log rank P = . 35). ConclusionsAV repair significantly improves postoperative outcomes in {{patients with}} AR and whenever feasible should probably be the preferred mode of surgical correction...|$|R
40|$|Androgens {{are widely}} {{acknowledged}} to be {{central to the}} pathogenesis of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). However, BPH increases in prevalence as men age, at precisely the stage of life when plasma androgens are decreasing. The decrease in total plasma androgens is amplified by an age-related increase in plasma sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) that results in a relatively greater decrease in free androgens than in total androgens. In addition, estrogens have long been suspected {{to be important in}} BPH, but a direct effect on the human prostate has never been demonstrated. We present data that are consistent with a role for estradiol, and for a decrease in androgens and an increase in SHBG, in the pathogenesis of BPH. We show that estradiol, but not dihydrotestosterone, acts in concert with SHBG to produce an 8 -fold increase in intracellular cAMP in human BPH tissue. This increase is not blocked by an antiestrogen and is not provoked by an estrogen (diethylstilbestrol) that does not bind to SHBG, thus excluding the classic estrogen receptor as being <b>operative</b> in these <b>events.</b> Conversely, dihydrotestosterone, which blocks the binding of estradiol to SHBG, completely negates the effect of estradiol. Finally, we demonstrate that the SHBG-steroid-responsive second-messenger system is primarily localized to the prostatic stromal cells and not to the prostatic epithelial cells. Thus, we have shown a cell-specific, powerful, nontranscriptional effect of estradiol on the human prostate...|$|R
