25|$|Although {{the crash}} was {{originally}} blamed on pilot error, it was subsequently {{found to have}} been caused by slush {{towards the end of the}} runway, causing deceleration of the aircraft and preventing safe flying speed. During take-off, the aircraft had reached , but, on entering the slush, dropped to , too slow to leave the ground, with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with tail-wheel undercarriages had not been greatly affected by slush, due to the geometry of these undercarriages in relation to the aircraft's centre of gravity, but newer types, such as the Ambassador, with nose wheel landing-gear and the main wheels behind the centre of gravity, were found to be vulnerable. The accident resulted in the imposition of <b>operating</b> <b>limits</b> for the amount of slush build-up permitted on runways.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} <b>operating</b> <b>limit</b> {{measurements}} are presented for one self-fabricated and one commercial solar heat pipe at horizontal and small inclination angles. While for the self-fabricated test sample heat transfer {{is limited by}} entrainment, dry-out limit is observed for the commercial solar heat pipe. <b>Operating</b> <b>limit</b> measurements of the commercial solar heat pipe show good reproducibility, whereas the detected <b>operating</b> <b>limit</b> of the self-fabricated heat pipe varies drastically. When tested at slight inclination, high temperature oscillations indicating geyser boiling effects are observed for the commercial test sample. Finally, <b>operating</b> <b>limit</b> definitions given by the literature are discussed regarding their applicability for solar thermal applications...|$|R

500|$|The most {{powerful}} storm {{to affect the}} Gulf of Thailand in more than 35years, Gay produced [...] swells that caught many ships in the region off-guard. At least 16 vessels were reported missing by 5 November, including the [...] Unocal Corporation oil drilling ship Seacrest. According to survivors, the vessel received no warning of the developing typhoon. Just when all crew members were about to abandon ship, the eye of Typhoon Gay passed over. Winds fluctuated violently and changed direction, preventing the ship from remaining stabilized despite being within safe <b>operating</b> <b>limits.</b> The vessel abruptly capsized with all 97 crew members on board during the overnight hours of 3 November, before any life boats could be deployed. Initial rescue attempts on 4 November were hampered by rough seas. Two days after the sinking, four rescue ships and two helicopters in the region were searching for survivors; four people were rescued from the wreckage on 6 November. Divers from the Thai Navy were sent to search the capsized vessel for anyone trapped inside. Of the crew, only 6 survived; 25 bodies were recovered, and the remaining 66 members were presumed dead. Losses from {{the sinking of the}} Seacrest totaled $40million. Another 20 cargo and fishing ships sank during the storm, resulting in 140 fatalities.|$|E
