Nyiszli notes the daily intake did not exceed 700 calories, except for prisoners being subjected to live medical experimentation, who were better fed and clothed. Sanitary arrangements were poor, with inadequate latrines {{and a lack of}} fresh water. In Auschwitz II-Birkenau, latrines were not installed until 1943, two years after camp construction began. The camps were infested with vermin such as disease-carrying lice, and the inmates suffered and died in epidemics of typhus and other diseases. Noma, a bacterial infection occurring among the malnourished, was a common cause of death among children in the Gypsy camp.|$|E
25|$|Roman Catholic Eucharistic Doctrine {{draws upon}} a quasi-Aristotelian {{understanding}} of reality, {{in which the}} core substance or essential reality of a given thing is bound to, but not equivalent with, its sensible realities or accidents. In {{the celebration of the}} Eucharist, by means of the consecratory Eucharistic Prayer, the actual substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bread</b> and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ. This change in substance is not, however, a physical change; the physical aspects or outward appearances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bread</b> and wine—their accidents—remain as before. This substantial change is called transubstantiation, a term reserved to describe the change itself. Protestant views on the fact of Christ's presence in the Eucharist vary significantly from one denomination to another: while many, such as Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists and the Reformed agree with Roman Catholics that Christ is really present in the Eucharist, they do not accept the definition of transubstantiation to describe it.|$|E

40|$|Currently UK {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} intakes are below recommendations. Bread is a staple food consumed by ~ 95 % of adults in western countries. In addition, bread provides an ideal matrix by which functionality can be delivered to the consumer in an accepted food. Therefore, enriching bread with vegetables may be an effective strategy to increase vegetable consumption. This study evaluated consumer acceptance, purchase intent and intention of product replacement of bread enriched with red beetroot, carrot with coriander, red pepper with tomato or white beetroot (80 g vegetable per serving of 200 g) compared to white control bread (0 g vegetable). Consumers (n= 120) rated their liking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> overall, {{as well as their}} liking of appearance, flavour and texture using nine-point hedonic scales. Product replacement and purchase intent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> was rated using five-point scales. <b>The</b> effect <b>of</b> providing consumers with health information about <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> was also evaluated. There were significant differences in overall liking (P< 0. 0001), as well as liking of appearance (P< 0. 0001), flavour (P= 0. 0002) and texture (P= 0. 04), between <b>the</b> <b>breads.</b> However, <b>the</b> significant differences resulted from <b>the</b> red beetroot <b>bread</b> which was significantly (P< 0. 05) less liked compared to control bread. There {{were no significant differences in}} overall liking between any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other vegetable-enriched <b>breads</b> compared with <b>the</b> control <b>bread</b> (no vegetable inclusion), apart from <b>the</b> red beetroot <b>bread</b> which was significantly less liked. <b>The</b> provision <b>of</b> health information about <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> did not increase consumer liking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vegetable-enriched <b>breads.</b> In conclusion, this study demonstrated that vegetable-enriched bread appeared to be an acceptable strategy to increase vegetable intake, however, liking depended on vegetable type...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{positive}} accepted savoury {{taste of}} rye bread {{is dependent on}} acetate concentration in <b>the</b> dough <b>of</b> such <b>breads.</b> In order to study how calcium acetate influences rye <b>bread</b> properties, <b>the</b> pH <b>of</b> rye doughs fortified with calcium acetate and <b>the</b> resulting volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> were measured. Furthermore, CO 2 formation of yeast with added calcium acetate and yeast with different pH levels (4, 7, 9) were measured. Thereby, {{it was determined that}} <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> calcium acetate increased <b>the</b> pH <b>of</b> dough from 4. 42 to 5. 29 and significantly reduced <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> from 1235. 19 mL to 885. 52 mL. It could be proven that bread volume was affected by a 30. 9 % lower CO 2 amount production of yeast, although bread volume was not affected by changing pH levels. Due to reduced bread volume, high concentrations of calcium acetate additions are not recommended for improving rye bread taste...|$|R
40|$|White breads with Yudane dough (Yudane bread) {{were made}} from {{commercial}} hard flour by the no first fermentation method. Yudane dough was prepared by mixing boiling water and flour {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 1. The dough at 20 and 40 % (w/w, flour base) was added to <b>the</b> total <b>bread</b> dough. In <b>the</b> Yudane <b>bread</b> making method, an extended final proof, lower dough gas retention and gassing power, as well as specific loaf volume were observed compared to conventional bread making (control) without Yudane dough. Also, <b>the</b> moisture content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yudane <b>breads</b> increased with increasing water absorption for <b>bread</b> making. <b>The</b> total and reducing saccharide and maltose contents in <b>the</b> water-soluble fraction <b>of</b> Yudane bread also increased with <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> added Yudane dough. <b>The</b> Yudane <b>breads</b> were very soft just after baking, and the staling (temporal changes in hardness) and starch retrogradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> were somewhat reduced compared to the control. Further, <b>the</b> <b>breads</b> showed generally larger cohesiveness, i. e., <b>the</b> index <b>of</b> <b>bread</b> elasticity. Kinetic analysis indicated reduced bread staling and starch retrogradation rates compared to control. The data showed that the slow staling and unique texture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yudane <b>breads</b> were mainly due to the high moisture content, saccharide contents, and flour amylases-modification of swollen and gelatinized starch in <b>the</b> <b>breads,</b> which was related to the higher water absorption and starch swelling and gelatinization levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> added Yudane dough.

That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.|$|E
