5|$|Bartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa {{at the top}} of the mountain, and {{informs the}} pair that the vampires have already summoned a {{powerful}} demon that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon the army <b>of</b> <b>Rome,</b> led by the powerful First Paladin <b>of</b> <b>Rome,</b> to defeat the demon. Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army <b>of</b> <b>Rome.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ryse: Son <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version <b>of</b> <b>Rome.</b> The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading the defense <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story up to this point.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{opposition}} <b>of</b> <b>Rome's</b> patricians, he expanded the Roman franchise and improved {{the lot and}} fortune <b>of</b> <b>Rome's</b> lowest classes <b>of</b> citizens and non-citizens. According to Livy, he reigned for 44 years, until murdered by his daughter Tullia and son-in-law Lucius Tarquinius. In consequence of this [...] "tragic crime" [...] and his hubristic arrogance as king, Tarquinius was eventually removed. This {{cleared the way for}} the abolition <b>of</b> <b>Rome's</b> monarchy and the founding of the Roman Republic, whose groundwork had already been laid by Servius' reforms.|$|R

5|$|The Corinthian {{order of}} {{architectural}} style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural {{style in the}} age of Augustus and the imperial phase <b>of</b> <b>Rome.</b> Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> upon the classical Greek model.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the great}} {{majority}} of the cardinals are archbishops of the main metropolitan dioceses of the world and reside in their countries. Apart from the exclusive right of the election of the new pope, their dignity is purely honorific. However, originally the College of Cardinals was simply a college of the clergy of the City <b>of</b> <b>Rome,</b> constituted of the bishops of the seven dioceses (called suburbicarian sees) bordering the diocese <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> (cardinal-bishops), priests of the parochial churches <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> (cardinal-priests) and deacons heading the ecclesiastical regions of the city <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> (cardinal-deacons). Unlike today, the cardinals had real jurisdiction over the dioceses, parochial churches (called tituli) or deaconries to which they were attached. The phenomenon of the external cardinalate in the late Middle Ages constituted the first exception to the rule, that cardinals – members of the clergy of the diocese <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> – cannot serve simultaneously in another, external church, which is now common practice.|$|E

5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in question {{was in response to}} Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> by returning the favour to the people <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E

5|$|Born in Tivoli, near Rome, Segrè studied {{engineering}} at the University <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> La Sapienza before taking up physics in 1927. Segrè was appointed assistant {{professor of physics at}} the University <b>of</b> <b>Rome</b> in 1932 and worked there until 1936, becoming one of the Via Panisperna boys. From 1936 to 1938 he was director of the Physics Laboratory at the University of Palermo. After a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, he was sent a molybdenum strip from the laboratory's cyclotron deflector in 1937, which was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. After careful chemical and theoretical analysis, Segrè was able to prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element, named technetium, which was the first artificially synthesized chemical element that does not occur in nature.|$|E
