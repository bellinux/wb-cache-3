50|$|The engine <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underbone {{is usually}} {{fixed to the}} chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its swingarm. As a result, underbone engines are usually further {{forwards}} than those <b>of</b> scooters. <b>A</b> <b>typical</b> underbone therefore has a more central centre <b>of</b> gravity than <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> scooter more unsprung mass than <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> underbone.

5|$|Alexander Reid, {{writing in}} 1862, {{recorded}} some statistics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> voyage. The ship, {{with a crew}} of 143, put out from Liverpool on 21 October 1861, carrying 544 passengers (including the English cricket team {{that was the first}} to visit Australia), a cow, 36 sheep, 140 pigs, 96 goats and 1,114 chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys. The journey to Melbourne (her ninth) occupied 64 days, during which the best day's run was 354miles and the worst 108. With favourable winds the ship travelled under sail alone, the screw being withdrawn from the water. Three passengers died en route. The captain was John Gray, a Scot, who had held the post since before the Crimean War.|$|E
5|$|Anna has {{distinguishable}} {{facial features}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> Disney heroine, including big eyes, thin lips {{and a small}} nose. Her physical appearance has drawn much comparison between her and Rapunzel from Tangled, however there are considerable differences between them. Anna's eyes are slightly more upturned, her cheeks are a bit fuller, her face and chin are generally rounder, and her eyebrows and eyelashes are thicker than Rapunzel's. She also has more freckles than Rapunzel and even has them on her shoulders. Anna's eyebrows wrinkle when they move, and she has prevalent neck muscles that appear when she speaks. Anna's travel outfit generally consists of magenta, black, dark and light blue, with flowery designs {{on the bottom of}} her dress.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

5|$|Bears, crocodiles, golden jackals, leopards {{and snakes}} {{are the main}} predators of the jungle cat. The golden jackal, particularly, can be a major {{competitor}} to the cat.

The meow of the jungle cat is also somewhat lower than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> domestic cat. The jungle cat can host parasites such as Haemaphysalis and Heterophyes species.|$|E
5|$|Belton House is a Grade I listed {{country house}} in Belton near Grantham, Lincolnshire, England. The mansion is {{surrounded}} by formal gardens {{and a series of}} avenues leading to follies within a larger wooded park. Belton {{has been described as a}} compilation of all that is finest of Carolean architecture, the only truly vernacular style of architecture that England had produced since the Tudor period. The house has also been described as the most complete example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to stately homes. Only Brympton d'Evercy has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>typical</b> journeyman, owing {{mostly to the}} fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that whether he could play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by whether he could find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, {{before moving on to}} Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
