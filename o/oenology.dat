5|$|González-Gordon worked most of {{his life}} for the family company González Byass, which specializes in making sherry. He was the fifth {{generation}} of the family to chair the company. While working for the firm he was involved in the making, tasting and commercialisation of sherry and in later years he also helped the company expand into producing brandy and several sorts of wine. Immediately after he finished his studies in 1946 he joined the business and started at the bottom with the picking and crushing of grapes. During this time he also learned about the solera system, which is used to age different type of liquids. His interest in <b>oenology</b> had only developed after visiting California the year he graduated. He visited California after previously being sent to New York by boat with twelve containers of wine. In 1955 he founded the first research center for viticulture and winemaking in Spain by establishing one at González Byass. For twenty years he was occupied as head of wine selection at the company. González-Gordon also served on the board of González Byass beginning in 1961, and was president of the company between 1993 and 1999. During this period González-Gordon managed to expand the business by exporting all over the world, including to the United States, United Kingdom, China and East Asia. After his time as president he continued to serve as an advisor to his son, Mauricio Junior, who took over his position. Apart from his work at González Byass González-Gordon also diverted some of his time towards the regulatory council of the sherry making industry, serving for 24 years.|$|E

25|$|In 1991, the College {{merged with}} the University of Adelaide and became the University's Roseworthy Campus, part of the Faculty of Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences. The merger would see {{teaching}} and research in <b>oenology</b> and viticulture transferred to the University's Waite Campus, along with the bulk of its work in plant breeding. Before the degree in <b>oenology</b> was transferred to Waite Campus, Roseworthy produced a number of highly regarded and awarded winemakers and wine critics.|$|E

25|$|The University of Adelaide {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of Australia's leading Universities, and it has considerably impacted the public life of South Australia. Many of the state's leading businesspeople, lawyers, medical professionals and politicians have been educated at the University. The University has been directly and indirectly involved in many of the world's achievements and discoveries, such as the discovery and development of penicillin, the development of space exploration, sunscreen, the military tank, Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes, and X-ray crystallography, and the study of viticulture and <b>oenology.</b>|$|E
25|$|On a {{visit to}} Israel and the Golan Heights in 1972, Cornelius Ough, a {{professor}} of viticulture and <b>oenology</b> at the University of California, Davis, pronounced conditions in the Golan very suitable for the cultivation of wine grapes. A consortium of four kibbutzim and four moshavim took up the challenge, clearing 250 burnt-out tanks in the Golan's Valley of Tears to plant vineyards for what would eventually become the Golan Heights Winery. The first vines were planted in 1976, and the first wine was released by the winery in 1983. The heights are now home to about a dozen wineries.|$|E
500|$|In a {{breeding}} program conducted by Margaret Sedgley of the Department of Horticulture, Viticulture and <b>Oenology,</b> Waite Agricultural Research Institute [...] of the University of Adelaide in Adelaide, South Australia, {{two forms of}} Banksia coccinea [...] were bred, registered under plant breeders' rights (PBR), and commercially propagated, mainly for the cut flower industry. Banksia 'Waite Flame' is an early flowering somewhat orange-hued form, and B.'Waite Crimson' is a red-flowering form that peaks mid-season.|$|E
500|$|Cuttings of Carménère were {{imported}} by Chilean growers from Bordeaux {{during the}} 19th century, {{where they were}} frequently confused with Merlot vines. They modeled their wineries after those in France and in the 1850s cuttings from Bordeaux, which included Carménère grape, were planted in the valleys around Santiago. Thanks to central Chile's minimal rainfall {{during the growing season}} and the protection of the country's natural boundaries, growers produced healthier crops of Carménère and there was no spread of phylloxera. During most of the 20th century Carménère was inadvertently collected and processed together with Merlot grapes (probably reaching up to 50% of the total volume) giving Chilean Merlot markedly different properties from those of Merlot produced elsewhere. Chilean growers believed that this grape was a clone of Merlot and was known as Merlot selection or Merlot Peumal (after the Peumo Valley in Chile). In 1994, a researcher at Montpellier's school of <b>Oenology</b> found that [...] "an earlier-ripening vine was Bordeaux Carménère, not Merlot". The Chilean Department of Agriculture officially recognized Carménère as a distinct variety in 1998. Today, Carménère grows chiefly in the Colchagua Valley, Rapel Valley, and Maipo Province.|$|E

2500|$|Malvasia ( [...] , {{also known}} as Malvazia) {{is a group of}} wine grape {{varieties}} grown historically in the Mediterranean region, Balearic islands, Canary Islands and the island of Madeira, but now grown in many of the winemaking regions of the world. In the past, the names Malvasia, Malvazia, and Malmsey have been used interchangeably for Malvasia-based wines; however, in modern <b>oenology,</b> [...] "Malmsey" [...] is now used almost exclusively for a sweet variety of Madeira wine made from the Malvasia grape. Grape varieties in this family include Malvasia bianca, Malvasia di Schierano, Malvasia negra, , Malvasia nera di Brindisi {{and a number of other}} varieties.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] {{immediately}} following / preceding ones that bear primary or secondary stress, we pronounce an œ ~ oe ~ e as an (unrounded) unstressed vowel, that is, as the unstressed one {{that sounds like}} “short I” or instead of it for some dialects as shwa, the examples being: tragœdy, (arch)diœcese; œconomisation, œsophageal; œsophagus, œcologist, œcology, œconomise, œconomist, œconomy, œdema, œnologist, <b>œnology,</b> ..., pœnology, and Phœnicia(n). [...] As another option (except in the first subset, that is, save in tragœdy and (arch)diœcese), especially when we want to enunciate more clearly, we alternatively add an additional (secondary) stress on this vowel and then pronounce it as long E.|$|E

The chemical haem (named as a shortening of haemoglobin) is spelled heme in American English, to avoid confusion with hem.|$|E
