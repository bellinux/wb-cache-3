Early accurate diagnosis followed by the excision of the obstructing vaginal septum offers complete relief of symptoms, while preserving repro-ductive capacity.

High-aspect-ratio and high-resolution silicon microstructures formed by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) are used as <b>cutting</b> <b>electrodes.</b> These replace the previously-reported, LIGA-defined, electroplated copper electrodes, alleviating complexities associated with the LIGA process. A minimum feature size of ≈ 7 µm is demonstrated on stainless steel 304 in batch-mode µEDM by using DRIE Si electrodes with a width of 5 µm. Features with sizes ≥ 15 µm have shown excellent repeatability and uniformity across a die-scale machining area of 5 × 5 mm 2.

30|$|Tsai et al. {{were the}} first to report a less {{invasive}} approach describing the vaginoscopic use of a resectoscope [18]. Using a needle-cutting electrode, they punched the vaginal septum and excised it progressively with a resectoscopic <b>cutting</b> <b>electrode.</b> The resectoscope permits exploration of the vaginal pathology of young patients with an intact hymen ring. The small diameter, the magnification, and the continuous fluid irrigation give ideal conditions for endoscopic evaluation of vaginal disorders in virgins [18]. The pressure caused by the irrigating solution offers a distended fibrous tissue to the surgeon, who can then easily cut the vaginal septum in the middle along a safe line, away from posterior or anterior structures—rectum or urethra. A Foley catheter placed in the bladder and a finger placed in the rectum will aid in delineating the correct anatomic relationships [1]. Once resected, the tissue retracts. As in hysteroscopic procedures for intrauterine septa, {{there is no need for}} suture [17].|$|R

The mathematical model considers heat transfer, mass transfer, fluid flow, melting, solidification, evaporation, kinetic Knudsen layers, multiple reflections, free surface evolution, and composite materials. First, the developed model is applied to investigate effects of laser beam modes on the laser-material interaction. Cylindrical TEM 00, TEM 01 *, TEM 22, and Top-hat laser beam are selected. Overall characteristics such as, response time, depth, width, and absorptivity of the proposed cases are investigated. The criteria of keyhole collapse are quantitatively obtained. The result indicates that the TEM 00 and Top-hat laser beam cases are more efficient for the laser cutting process. Second, the model {{is applied to the}} laser cutting of current collectors. Laser parameter thresholds for cutting are obtained. Moreover, L/V interface geometry, melt pool flow, and temperature distribution are examined. The analysis shows interaction characteristics of current collectors with the laser. Furthermore, results present the formation of crests and two consecutive deep penetration holes as well as explain possibilities of forming a spatter, recast layer, and a neck. Third, the model is applied to the laser <b>cutting</b> of <b>electrodes.</b> Interesting results near the material interface between current collectors and active electrode materials are observed. For the anode, the L/V interface in the graphite region shows a smooth and clean surface, and a two-level surface is observed near the material interface. For the cathode, the deep penetration hole shows an uneven surface, crests, and a protrusion in the LiCoO 2 region. The narrower deep penetration hole forms near the material interface. Finally, experimental results are presented. The kerf widths are compared near thresholds of the laser cutting of current collectors. The kerf width of electrodes and composition change along the cut surface of electrodes are validated. The theoretical prediction shows a reasonable agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, the optimum range of laser parameters providing both high speed and high quality cutting are obtained.

Machinability of an engineering material may be evaluated {{in terms of}} the process output variables like material removal rate, processed surface finish, cutting forces, tool life, specific power consumption, etc. In this paper, graph theoretic approach (GTA) is proposed to evaluate the machinability of tungsten carbide composite. Material removal rate is considered as a machinability attribute of tungsten carbide to evaluate the effect of several factors and their subfactors. Factors affecting the machinability and their interactions are analyzed by developing a mathematical model using digraph and matrix method. Permanent function or machinability index is obtained from the matrix model developed from the digraphs. This index value helps in quantifying the influence of considered factors on machinability.

40|$|Thin sheet anode and cathode {{materials}} made in {{composite structures}} constitute {{some of the}} most important components of a Li-ion battery. These materials are currently cut by punching technology, which shows degrading behaviour as the tool wears out. A viable option for Li-ion battery electrode manufacturing is the use of remote laser cutting. However, the operation requires fulfilling both productivity and quality aspects to substitute the conventional production method. One of the most critical aspects in quality is the clearance width, which is defined as the extent of the exposed middle layer of the sandwich at the laser cut kerf. This work investigates the quality aspects of laser <b>cutting</b> of Li-ion <b>electrodes</b> when a green fibre laser source (λ= 532 nm, τ= 1 ns) is used rather than the more traditional infrared (IR) fibre laser source (λ= 1, 064 nm, τ= 250 ns). The processing conditions were investigated to reveal the technological feasibility zones. Clearance width was studied within the technological feasibility zones for all the material-laser combinations. Results showed that high productivity criterion is met by the IR system, since cutting speed could reach 30 m/min with 54 Waverage laser power on both anode and cathode. On the other hand, the green laser provided clearance width below 20 μm. In the best case, the clearance on anode could be eliminated with the green laser system.

The spacer gap between the top plate and the bottom plate of the EWOD device was 100  μm. The area of the generating electrode was 2 × 2 [...] mm^ 2 for the conventional reservoir. For the slender electrodes in L and Y-junction devices, area was [...]. 4  ×  2  mm 2. Properties of the liquid (DI water) {{in the current study}} are given in the Additional file 4 : Table A 1.

In the filling stage, reservoir liquid flows towards the <b>cutting</b> and generating <b>electrodes</b> (E 2 and E 1) until the two electrodes are filled with liquid. In the cutting stage, the two de-wetting menisci move towards each other in opposite directions until the liquid neck pinches off creating a small droplet on the generating electrode (E 1). In the relocating stage, the dispensed droplet on the generating electrode is relocated by EWOD for further actions. Note that the filling stage should be allowed sufficient filling time to reach the steady state. However, {{it is difficult to determine}} the completion of the filling stage by simply observing the motion of the liquid interface. Therefore, a sufficiently longer filling time is chosen (1000  ms).|$|R
