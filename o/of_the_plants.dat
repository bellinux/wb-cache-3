5|$|The Botanic Garden (1791) {{is a set}} of two poems, The Economy of Vegetation and The Loves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plants,</b> by the British {{poet and}} naturalist Erasmus Darwin. The Economy of Vegetation celebrates {{technological}} innovation, scientific discovery and offers theories concerning contemporary scientific questions, such as the history of the cosmos. The more popular Loves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plants</b> promotes, revises and illustrates Linnaeus's classification scheme for plants.|$|E
5|$|As such {{examples}} demonstrate, The Economy of Vegetation {{is part of}} an Enlightenment {{paradigm of}} progress while The Loves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plants,</b> with its focus on an integrated natural world, is more of an early Romantic work.|$|E
5|$|The daikon {{varieties}} of radish are {{important parts of}} East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisine. In Japan and Korea, radish dolls are sometimes made as children's toys. Daikon is also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> {{that make up the}} Japanese Festival of Seven Herbs (Nanakusa no sekku) on the seventh day after the new year.|$|E

5|$|In 1799, the Spanish {{botanist}} Antonio José Cavanilles described Protea acufera, later {{identified as}} a synonym by Salisbury and Robert Brown. I.anethifolius gained its current name in 1809 when it was redescribed as the dill-leaved isopogon (Isopogon anethifolius) by English plantsman Joseph Knight in his controversial work On the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> belonging to {{the natural order of}} Proteeae. Robert Brown had written of the genus Isopogon but Knight had hurried out his work before Brown's. Brown's description appeared in his paper On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae in the Transactions of the Linnean Society in 1810.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plants,</b> {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Needham noted a Chinese text {{dating from}} 304 AD, Records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plants</b> and Trees of the Southern Regions, by Hsi Han, which {{describes}} mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants which attack and kill insect pests {{of the orange}} trees. The citrus ant (Oecophylla smaragdina) was rediscovered in the 20th century, and since 1958 {{has been used in}} China to protect orange groves.|$|E
5|$|Suggesting {{the passing}} of a single day, The Loves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Plants</b> is divided into four cantos, all written in heroic couplets. A preface to the poem {{outlines}} the basics of the Linnaean classification system. Guiding the reader through the garden is a “Botanic Muse” who is described as Linnaeus's inspiration. Interspersed between the cantos are dialogues on poetic theory between the poet and his bookseller. The poem is not a narrative; instead, reminiscent of the picaresque tradition, it consists of discrete descriptions of eighty-three separate species which are accompanied by extensive explanatory footnotes.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b> Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are stunted by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E

5|$|V. thapsus is a {{dicotyledonous}} {{plant that}} produces a rosette of leaves {{in its first year}} of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1–2m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n=36.|$|E
5|$|With {{increasing}} {{trade in}} economic and medicinal plants {{the need for}} a more comprehensive classification system increased. Up to about 1650 CE plants had been grouped either alphabetically or according to utilitarian folk taxonomy – by their medicinal uses or whether they were trees, shrubs or herbs. Between 1650 and 1700 CE there was a move from the utilitarian back to a scientific natural classification based on the characters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> themselves.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} in New South Wales, the wallum banksia had gone by the {{scientific}} name of Banksia serratifolia. Richard Anthony Salisbury had published this binomial name in 1796, which was followed by Otto Kuntze, and then Karel Domin in 1921. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George conclusively established aemula as the correct name {{to be used in}} his 1981 revision of the genus. He pointed out that Salisbury's original described the leaves only, was insufficient to diagnose the species and is hence a nomen dubium—the description could have fit juvenile leaves of B.paludosa as well. In fact, Brown himself had been unsure whether serratifolia applied to what he called Banksia aemula. Salisbury's taxon appeared as Banksia serraefolia in Knight's 1809 work On the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, but that entry might also refer to serrata. Where Salisbury got his material is unclear, but John White had sent material to James Edward Smith now held in the Linnean Society marked as B.serratifolia Salisb. as well as B.aemula R.Br.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E
5|$|The NKAP (Narodnyy komissariat aviatsionnoy promyshlennosti—People's Ministry of the Aircraft Industry) {{announced}} its 1941 production plan on 9 December 1940. Zavod Nr. 1 {{would be required}} to build a total of 3,500 in 1941. Zavod Nr. 43 in Kiev would begin construction of the MiG-3 and complete one hundred aircraft {{by the end of the}} year and Zavod Nr. 21 in Gor'kiy would start to plan construction of an upgraded version of the MiG-3, although this last program was canceled shortly afterwards. 140 were delivered in January 1941 and Zavod Nr. 1 was on pace to exceed its quota with 496 delivered in July, 562 in August and 450 in September. In October the German advance on Moscow forced the factory, and its OKO, to evacuate to Kuybyshev where production resumed under unsuitable conditions. However, shortly afterwards, Stalin sent a telegram to the directors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> building the Ilyushin Il-2 and the MiG-3 demanding more Il-2 production, resulting in MiG-3 production being terminated in favor of the Il-2, with a final thirty aircraft built in 1942 from spares. An additional factor in cancellation of the MiG-3 was that its Mikulin AM-35A engine was closely related to the Il-2's AM-38 allowing production to be quickly switched from one to the other.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural gas plants dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such as Los Angeles, México City, Santiago, Chile, São Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where water stress is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b> A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
5|$|When he was18, Buxton {{returned}} to work with his old master, James Heap, as a journeyman. Heap often took Buxton on country walks in his spare time. The two collected herbs for diet drinks, either for Heap's use or to share with his neighbours. They often found plants of whose names they were ignorant, and so Buxton bought a copy of Culpeper's Complete Herbal. However, as he found the supposedly medicinal properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> fanciful and the descriptions inaccurate, he soon became dissatisfied with it. In 1808 he procured {{a copy of the}} superior Meyrick's Herbal, from which he learned the first principles of the Linnaean system. Buxton soon outgrew this book, and began to borrow or buy as many books on botany as he could. Botanical practice at the time was to collect and dry plants, but as he disliked dead plants and preferred not to remove specimens that could be enjoyed by others, his botanical studies were confined to making observations.|$|E
