5|$|Michael takes Holly on a {{walk through}} the office, {{pointing}} out the locations of various events throughout their courtship. He <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the kitchen, revealing {{all of the other}} employees holding candles. Various members of the office ask Holly if she will marry them (all of Michael's plan) and she politely says no. Michael then leads Holly out to her desk, which is surrounded by dozens of candles. Michael gets down on his knee and begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from the candles. The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts. Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly. The scene ends with his employees in shock.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to say one of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{runs for}} help and goes into the kitchen. Ma Soupswill, the cook, is delighted to help, but Cooper must {{retrieve}} three ingredients: Glowworms, a giant egg, and a sprig of dungweed. After retrieving the ingredients, Ma Soupswill creates a potion to reverse the effects on Amber. However, she unwittingly transforms Amber into an even more hideous monster, having added the wrong spice, and Amber attacks Cooper in anger. Cooper defeats the mutated Amber and Ma Soupswill arrives with the correct spice, finally transforming Amber back to herself. Afterward, Cooper and Amber attempt to escape the mansion but are stopped by Mr. Ribs (Ma Soupswill's assistant). He tells them to help free the other children who are imprisoned all over the mansion. Cooper seeks Crivens {{for help and}} tells him that only the Baron has the key to free them. To get to his room, Cooper must collect three pieces of a rhyme which <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the Baron's room. Once there, a battle ensues, and Cooper emerges victorious.|$|E

Bending over at Henrietta's door to tie his shoes, the ring falls out, and Henrietta <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> see Ted down on his knee, in a tuxedo, with a ring in his hand. She {{immediately}} assumes he is proposing, says yes, and introduces him to her parents (who had stopped by).

Upon finding a hidden key inside a tree that he had put there in his childhood, Wilson <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> a nearby cabin. Inside he discovers old drawings he and his friend Amelia had made when they were children. He remembers that she made him promise to fly her away from here when they grew up so she {{could go to the}} Big City. Wilson then explores a nearby barn, in which he and Amelia had kissed for the first time.|$|E
25|$|At home, Liza {{plays the}} spinet {{as she and}} her friend Pauline sing a duet about evening in the countryside. Their girlfriends ask to hear more, so Pauline {{launches}} into a sad ballad, followed by a dancelike song. As the merriment increases, Liza remains pensively apart. A Governess chides the girls for indulging in unbecoming folk dancing and asks the visitors to leave. Pauline, the last to go, urges Liza to cheer up; Liza replies that after a storm there is a beautiful night and asks the maid, Masha, not to close the French windows to the balcony. Alone, Liza voices her unhappiness with her engagement; she has been stirred by the romantic look {{of the young man}} in the park. To her shock, Herman appears on the balcony. Claiming he is about to shoot himself over her betrothal to another, he begs her to take pity on him. When the Countess is heard knocking, Liza hides Herman and <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the old woman, who tells her to shut the windows and go to bed. After the Countess retires, Liza asks Herman to leave but is betrayed by her feelings and falls into his embrace.|$|E

25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E
25|$|The third series {{staggered}} {{the entry}} of new characters and only Robin appeared in all thirteen episodes. As the series opens, Tuck (David Harewood), a spiritual preacher returning to England, and Kate (Joanne Froggatt), a Locksley villager, are introduced; both soon becoming part of Robin's gang. Isabella (Lara Pulver), Gisborne's younger sister who is running from an abusive husband, arrives soon after and starts a secret relationship with Robin. Her link to the castle through Gisborne {{is used by the}} gang while she plots revenge against her brother, but her thirst for independence, power and vengeance soon leads her to become a ruthless Sheriff and a sworn enemy. Toby Stephens appears as Prince John in three episodes mid-series, successfully exploiting the rift between Gisborne and Sheriff Vaisey, leading to the latter's supposed death at Gisborne's hand. Gisborne is briefly made Sheriff before Isabella uses her influence to replace him, leaving Gisborne a fugitive, and following the death of a young villager with whom he was briefly imprisoned, seeking revenge. This <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> a liaison with Robin and sets up the tenth episode of the series, told largely through flashbacks, which revisits Robin and Gisborne's history. It features Dean Lennox Kelly, Sophie Winkleman, Paul Hilton and Ian Reddington as Robin's father, Gisborne's parents and another past Locksley villager respectively, and reveals the existence of Archer (played by Clive Standen from episode 11), the illegitimate child of Robin's father and Gisborne's mother, who Robin's dying father begs them to find. Archer is Robin's equal with a bow and arrow. (This, coupled with his biological ties to Robin, Gisborne and Isabella, led to speculation that he was set to take over the programme's lead role following Jonas Armstrong's departure.) Having found Archer, who promptly abandons them after escaping, Gisborne and Robin return to Nottingham with a tentative alliance formed, setting up the two-part series finale, where Robin and Gisborne decide to take Nottingham Castle to prepare for King Richard's return. Although they are lured into a trap set by Archer and Isabella, they succeed when Archer turns against his half-sister. However, Allan is killed by a storm of arrows when Vaisey reappears at the head of an army wielding Byzantine fire. Gisborne is killed in a sword fight with the Sheriff and Isabella as he defends the castle, and Robin is poisoned by the blade of Isabella. However, before succumbing to his injury, Robin evacuates the villagers from Nottingham, and fires a flaming arrow into the Byzantine fire stored in the castle. Vaisey and Isabella realize too late and perish with their army in an explosion that destroys Nottingham Castle. As the castle burns, Robin returns to Sherwood Forest, says goodbye to the remainder of his Merry Men and encourages Archer to take up the defense of the people of England. Robin heads off on his own, and is greeted by Marian in a vision to welcome him into the afterlife. The remaining outlaws find Robin's body, and after a small ceremony, set out to continue their quest to end suffering in England.|$|E
500|$|Bear admired Hodgson's {{imagination}} which, in The Night Land, {{had created}} the Last Redoubt as a [...] "technological preserve" [...] in the far future to keep out monsters that humanity had previously created, and which had evolved {{over long periods of}} time. But Bear's interpretation of The Night Land is that this future landscape is a [...] "metaphysical place", and the monsters are [...] "not creatures of this Earth". For Bear, this explanation broadens the novel's scope, and <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> other interpretations.|$|E

500|$|When {{creating}} the gadgets for the series, the writers noted {{the need to}} combine the period setting with the influence of Howard Stark, who <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> [...] "things that are fantastic for the time period". They {{worked closely with the}} props department to develop technology that appears [...] "both retro and futuristic at the same time", with Fazekas explaining that the goal was to avoid a science fiction look, so the fantastical aspects were reserved solely for function while the aesthetic was kept within the realms of that time period.|$|E

Soon, Frederick sees the horse move and assume [...] "an energetic and human expression". Immediately, Frederick <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> leave, and the action strikingly causes his shadow to fall exactly on the spot of the murderer in the tapestry.|$|E

After waking up in the town with a gun and contemplating suicide, she resolves to find someone. She eventually encounters a local mansion, where she hears the voice of its owner, Ernest Baldwin. Ernest refuses to let Maria into the room he is in and will only talk to her through its closed door. After Maria completes tasks for him, Ernest warns her about James, whom he describes as a [...] "bad man". After Maria <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> Ernest's room and finds it empty, she leaves the mansion.

500|$|The trio finally {{decide that}} {{kidnapping}} Hardenberg {{was wrong and}} take {{him back to his}} house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (Spezialeinsatzkommando) gather outside their flat and knock on the door. Jule wakes up when she hears a knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: [...] "Manche Menschen Ã¤ndern sich nie" [...] ("many people never change"). In the original German version, the Edukators set off in Hardenberg's boat in the Mediterranean, presumably to disrupt the island signal towers supplying most television programming to Western Europe.|$|E
500|$|In his {{prepared}} statement, he said:The PMRC {{proposal is}} an ill-conceived piece of nonsense which fails to deliver any real benefits to children, infringes the civil liberties {{of people who}} are not children, and promises to keep the courts busy for years dealing with the interpretational and enforcemental problems inherent in the proposal's design. It is my understanding that, in law, First Amendment issues are decided with a preference for the least restrictive alternative.

500|$|Accepting Aradia as {{the source}} of this practice, Robert Chartowich points to the 1998 Pazzaglini {{translation}} of these lines, which read [...] "Men and Women / You will all be naked, until / Yet he shall be dead, the last / Of your oppressors is dead." [...] Chartowich argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland's mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause [...] "in your rites". There are, however, earlier mentions of ritual nudity among Italian witches. Historian Ruth Martin states that it was a common practice for witches of Italy to be [...] "naked with their hair loose around their shoulders" [...] while reciting conjurations. Jeffrey Burton Russell notes that [...] "A woman named Marta was tortured in Florence about 1375: she was alleged to have placed candles round a dish and to have taken off her clothes and stood above the dish in the nude, making magical signs". Historian Franco Mormando refers to an Italian witch: [...] "Lo and behold: in the first hours of sleep, this woman <b>opens</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> her vegetable garden and comes out completely naked and her hair all undone, and she begins to do and say her various signs and conjurations ...".|$|E
