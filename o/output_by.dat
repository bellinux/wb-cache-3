5|$|Falling {{electricity}} production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes, as at Poihipi and Ohaaki. The Wairakei power station {{has been running}} much longer, with its first unit commissioned in November 1958, and it attained its peak generation of 173MW in 1965, but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering, in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157MW. Around {{the start of the}} 21st century it was managing about 150MW, then in 2005 two 8MW isopentane systems were added, boosting the station's <b>output</b> <b>by</b> about 14MW. Detailed data are unavailable, being lost due to re-organisations. One such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for Poihipi (started 1996), and the gap in 1996/7 for Wairakei and Ohaaki; half-hourly data for Ohaaki's first few months of operation are also missing, as well as for most of Wairakei's history.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Mauritius {{government}} opened 130shelters, {{and also}} provided 5,000rupees to each homeless family. The crop damage from Hollanda, {{in addition to}} a drought, decreased the following year's <b>output</b> <b>by</b> 22%. In response, the government provided seeds to farmers so they could replant their crops. Most of the island had their power restored by ten days after the storm. The country's prime minister issued an appeal to the European Union for 67million rupees ($3.6million 1994USD) in assistance, although later dropped it to less than half that total. The requested aid was for the restoration of phone and power utilities. The storm's severe impact on Mauritius caused a sharp drop in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and the overall GDP decreased by 10%.|$|E
5|$|For his {{performance}} in the 2003 Insight Bowl, California quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the offensive player of the game. Rodgers completed 27 of his 35 passes for 394yards and two touchdowns in the winning effort. Rodgers' performance tied Cal's bowl records for most completions, most touchdowns, and most rushing touchdowns, and was the third-highest offensive <b>output</b> <b>by</b> a single player in California history. The victory was California's first bowl win since a victory over Iowa in the 1993 Alamo Bowl. California kicker Tyler Fredrickson's game-winning score was his only field goal kick during the game, {{but he also had}} seven extra-point kicks for seven points. In addition, he served as California's punter, kicking the ball 4 times for 159total punting yards. He set school records for most extra points in a season and most extra points attempted. Virginia Tech kicker Carter Warley missed three field goals: a 40-yarder, 45-yarder, and a 28-yarder. He successfully kicked four extra points for four points. Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall finished the game having completed 24 of his 34 pass attempts for 398yards and four touchdowns.|$|E

5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage <b>output</b> <b>by</b> super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can {{have a negative impact on}} the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of <b>output</b> <b>by</b> value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to fish farming and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E
5|$|Undeterred, Bruce {{was elected}} Chairman {{of the newly}} formed FAO Council in November 1947, working once more with John Boyd Orr, now Secretary-General of the FAO. Acute {{shortages}} of cereals and livestock were rampant following severe droughts in Europe, and the international food supply system was under serious strain after the devastation of the war. Bruce and the council worked in these years to distribute fertiliser and agricultural machinery, as well as improve nutrition, especially in less developed nations. More {{than two-thirds of the}} world was undernourished in 1949 and Bruce felt it imperative for the Council to bring these stark facts to the developed nations. A landmark agreement on technical aid between the FAO and the United Nations was reached in November 1949, and the FAO received the funding and logistical capacity to act on the food shortage crisis and the problems of poor nutrition in the developing world. Bruce and the FAO were successful in these years in supporting the recovery of world agricultural <b>output.</b> <b>By</b> 1951 this had exceeded pre-war levels, and general levels of nutrition were rising internationally, but by the time Bruce stepped down in that year neither had improved fast enough {{to keep pace with the}} post-war population boom. The Council faced major obstacles in supporting the improvement of conditions in the developing world as governments there began diverting resources to arms programs as independence, post-colonial and Cold War conflicts multiplied. Frustrated by continuing world conflict and the lack of commitment from the developed world to support the lofty but very difficult aims of the FAO, both Bruce and Orr resigned from the FAO disappointed by its modest gains and insufficient powers to alleviate world food problems.|$|E
