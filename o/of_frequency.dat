5|$|DAB radio {{stations}} in the United Kingdom are broadcast on a number <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> blocks on VHF Band III. The original plan devised in Wiesbaden for the framework of DAB in Europe was to allocate frequency blocks 11B to 12D for UK DAB broadcasting. However, {{as part of its}} Review of Radio, Ofcom has expanded the frequency allocations for DAB and has advertised local and a national ensemble licence on blocks outside the original Wiesbaden plan on 10B to 10D and 11A. Block 5A has also been reserved for the launch of local ensembles. In 2015, additional blocks were opened up for small scale DAB trials for an initial period of nine months. Ofcom reitreated the use of a number <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> blocks between 7D and 9C for any future roll-out of small scale DAB multiplexes in its final report regarding the small scale DAB multiplexes published in September 2016.|$|E
50|$|A bat’s {{hearing is}} {{especially}} sensitive to sounds that have similar frequencies {{to its own}} echolocation pulses. The resting call pulses of CF and CF-FM bats are largely characterized by notes <b>of</b> a single <b>frequency,</b> while the resting calls of FM bats span an extensive range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Stated differently, CF bats produce narrow bandwidth sounds, or sounds over a restricted range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Contrastingly, FM bats produce broad bandwidth pulses, which contain a wide range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies.</b> It follows that CF bats have auditory systems that are highly sensitive to a limited range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies,</b> while the auditory systems of FM bats are sensitive to a vast range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies.</b>|$|R

5000|$|FM bats do {{not possess}} an {{acoustic}} fovea, because the broad range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the RF does not lend itself {{to the formation of}} a sharply tuned auditory system. [...] Rather, the vast range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> in the resting call is reflected in the extensive range <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> to which an FM bat is responsive. Conversely, the narrow, well-defined span <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> within CF element of the CF pulses is reflected in the auditory system’s sharp range of optimal sensitivity (e.g. a fovea).|$|R

5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific pivot point, it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch.

40|$|We have {{systematically}} studied both {{classical and}} quantum chaotic behaviors of two colliding harmonic oscillators. The classical case falls in Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser class.

The largest Lyapunov character exponent depends linearly on the ratio <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the two oscillators away from the energy threshold in some chaotic regions, which shows that the chaotic behaviors of the system are mainly determined by the ratio. In the quantum case, for certain parameters, the distribution of the energy level spacings also varies with the ratio <b>of</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the two oscillators.

5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any real change in the climate in which they develop.|$|E

5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> are not needed.|$|E
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the arterial circulation producing arterial gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the arterial circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates <b>of</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|E

5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E

One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
