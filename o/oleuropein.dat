25|$|During the crushing, {{kneading}} and {{extraction of}} olive fruit to obtain olive oil, <b>oleuropein,</b> demethyloleuropein and ligstroside are hydrolyzed by endogenous beta-glucosidases to form aldehydic aglycones.

25|$|Raw {{or fresh}} olives are {{naturally}} very bitter; {{to make them}} palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing <b>oleuropein,</b> a bitter phenolic compound that can reach levels of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to <b>oleuropein,</b> other phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak in young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products which render some cultivars edible immediately. One example of an edible olive native to the island of Thasos is the throubes black olive, which when allowed to ripen in sun, shrivel, and fall from the tree, is edible.|$|E
25|$|Water-cured type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives, {{these are}} soaked in water or weak brine and this {{solution}} is changed {{on a daily}} basis for 10–14 days.

Fermentation takes place during the water treatment stage and involves a mixed yeast/bacteria ecosystem. Sometimes, the olives are lightly cracked with a hammer or a stone to trigger fermentation and speed up the fermentation process. Once debittered, the olives are brined to concentrations of 8–12% NaCl and acid corrected, and are then ready to eat.|$|E
25|$|The {{polyphenol}} {{composition of}} olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, {{as measured by}} the Folin method, are 117mg/100 g in black olives and 161mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from <b>oleuropein</b> and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59mg/100 g in green olives.|$|E
25|$|The {{curing process}} may take {{from a few}} days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the {{exception}} of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of <b>oleuropein</b> and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid {{is the most important}} metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.|$|E

Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–10 hours to hydrolyse the <b>oleuropein.</b> They are usually considered [...] "treated" [...] when the lye has penetrated {{two-thirds of the way}} into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl.

During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.|$|E

40|$|The {{secoiridoid}} <b>oleuropein</b> is a non-flavonoid polyphenol, {{found in}} the fruit, leaves and food derivatives from Olea europea.

In the present report we have usedoptical and ESR spectroscopy as well as molecular modelling todemonstrate thatoleuropein forms a complex with thetransition metal copper; the dysmetabolism of this metal is suspected {{to be involved in}} both cancer and neurodegeneration.

In this work, we study the effect of the microenvironment (vacuum, water, and triolein-water) on the conformational preferences of <b>oleuropein</b> using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 300 K for at least 30 ns. The seven torsions that describe the flexible skeleton of <b>oleuropein</b> were monitored together with the distance between the glucose (Glu) and hydroxytyrosol (Hyd) moieties (dglu-hyd) of the molecule. The obtained trajectories demonstrated that <b>oleuropein</b> adopts different conformations that depend on the environment. The preferential conformers in each system were analyzed for their molecular geometry and internal energy. In vacuum, the <b>oleuropein</b> preferential conformation is tight with the glucose moiety in close proximity with the hydroxytyrosol moiety. In water, <b>oleuropein</b> preferential conformers presented large differences in their structural properties, varying from a close like U form, and a semi-opened form, to an opened form characterized by high fluctuations in dglu-hyd values. In a triolein-water system, <b>oleuropein</b> tends to adopt a more open form where the glucose moiety could be approximately aligned with the hydroxytyrosol and elenolic acid moieties. Based on a calculation at the HF/ 6 - 31 G* level, these flexibilities of <b>oleuropein</b> required energy of 19. 14 kcal/mol in order to adopt the conformation between water and triolein-water system. A radial distribution function (RDF) analysis showed that specific hydroxyl groups of Hyd and Glu interact with water molecules, enabling us to understand the amphiphilic character of <b>oleuropein</b> at the triolein-water interface.
