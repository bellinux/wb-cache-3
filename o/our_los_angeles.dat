40|$|Background: <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> {{classification}} {{is widely}} adopted for reporting endoscopic gastroesophageal reflux disease. We assessed the inter- and intra-observer variability of the <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> classification. Methods: Still images (n = 254) {{of the lower}} esophagus were presented to 9 gastroenterologists (6 experts and 3 trainees) and {{they were asked to}} report the images according to the <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> classification. After 2 weeks the images were reordered and they were asked to report them again. Kappa statistic was calculated for intra- and inter-observer variability. Results: The kappa for intra-observer agreement was 0. 54 (attendings: 0. 54; trainees; 0. 55; P = not significant) and the inter-observer agreement was 0. 22 (attendings: 0. 20; trainees: 0. 31; P = 0. 027). The inter- and intra-observer kappa values in differentiating nonerosive from erosive cases were 0. 22 (attendings: 0. 21; trainees: 0. 31, P = not significant) and 0. 57 (attendings: 0. 58; trainees: 0. 55, P = not significant), respectively. Conclusion: According to <b>our</b> data, the <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> classification has acceptable intra-observer variability, both for detecting presence or absence of erosions and for differentiating between different degrees of esophagitis, while its inter-observer performance seems to be less acceptable.

40|$|Public {{infrastructure}} usually decays {{so slowly}} and so invisibly {{that we are}} shocked when a bridge collapses, a levee breaks, or a tunnel floods. But sidewalks decay right under our feet {{and in front of}} <b>our</b> eyes. In <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> 4, 600 miles of the city’s 10, 750 miles of sidewalks need repair, at an estimated cost of $ 1. 2 billion. Broken sidewalks have become an important legal issue since a court ruled in 2003 that the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to sidewalks. As a way to comply with the ADA, cities can require property owners to repair any broken sidewalk in front of their property before they sell the property. Before any real estate is sold, the city inspects the sidewalk fronting the property. If the sidewalk is in good condition, the owner is not required to do anything. But if the sidewalk is broken, the owner must fix it before selling the property. An analysis of sales data in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> shows that half of all properties in the city were sold at least once in the past 12 years. If <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> had established a point-of-sale program 12 years ago, about 2, 300 miles of broken sidewalks in the city would have been repaired by now. Walkable cities need walkable sidewalks, and requiring sidewalk repairs at the point of property sales will help put cities back on their feet...|$|R
