50|$|This brand {{started in}} Milan in 1939. In 1942 the first Breil {{wristwatch}} was introduced; {{the name is}} from a Swiss place. Initially, the company made a line <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks</b> {{and a few years}} later, wristwatches too. In 1956, the producer Innocente Binda made an unusual promotional action: he dropped some watches of its production from the Eiffel Tower in Paris to show that after a flight of 302 meters watches proved to have been fully functional.|$|E

5000|$|Alarm clocks, {{like almost}} all other {{consumer}} {{goods in the}} United States, ceased production {{in the spring of}} 1942, as the factories which made them were converted over to war work during World War II, but they were one of the first consumer items to resume manufacture for civilian use, in November 1944. By that time, a critical shortage <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks</b> had developed due to older clocks wearing out or breaking down. Workers were late for, or missed completely, their scheduled shifts in jobs critical to the war effort. In a pooling arrangement overseen by the Office of Price Administration, several clock companies were allowed to start producing new clocks, some of which were continuations of pre-war designs, and some of which were new designs, thus becoming among the first [...] "postwar" [...] consumer goods to be made, before the war had even ended. The price of these [...] "emergency" [...] clocks was, however, still strictly regulated by the Office of Price Administration.|$|E
5000|$|Telechron {{alarm clocks}} are {{particularly}} popular with collectors. Until about 1940, {{the overwhelming majority}} of Telechron alarm clocks had bell alarms. The entire mechanism was enclosed in a bell housing of steel. Atop the clock's coil was a metal strip that vibrated at 60 cycles per second when the alarm was tripped. This strip had a V-shaped arm attached to it, ending in a striker, which vibrated in turn against the bell housing. With the approach of war, restrictions on various metals required a reduction in their use, and the bell housing was eliminated, with only the metal strip above the coil remaining. This in itself, however, provided a loud buzz when the alarm was tripped (and was the basis of the alarm in all brands <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks</b> for many years after the war). Post-war, very few Telechrons had bell alarms, and the bell had disappeared completely by 1960. Telechron {{was one of the first}} companies to introduce what became known as the [...] "snooze" [...] alarm in the early 1950s.|$|E

50|$|The Treatment {{from the}} {{previous}} episode concluded with the remaining guests in the treatment being required to stand on one foot before finally being told it was over. A challenge {{was presented to the}} final 3 guests in a game of Jenga with massive blocks, with the winner receiving a large sandwich and the guests who knocked their tower over receiving an hour of sirens. The Test in this episode required the guests to construct a coffin within 20 minutes, after which they would have to lie in it for as close to 1 hour as possible, while Val distracted them by reciting numbers and math equations. After a certain amount of time, a relative would give each guest a eulogy, referring to them by their pod number instead of their name. After the test was completed, each guest was asked to write their own life story, filling up both sides of a paper that Val then shredded. The first guest to piece their life story together and read it aloud to Val won a reward of a milkshake, while the guests that did not finish piecing their lives together had a set <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks</b> placed around them to disturb their sleep. This episode's treatment made the two remaining guests lie on a web of twelve tightly wound ropes of varying sizes and knot patterns. After each round, the guests would have to detach one of their ropes, chosen by their opponent. In later rounds, they received the option of lying face-up or face-down, a choice previously made by Val. At any time if a guest falls off the ropes completely, they would have been forced to quit the treatment.|$|E
5000|$|When Calkins was tutored by Sanford, she {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to conduct a research project that involved studying the contents of Sanford and her dreams recorded during a seven-week period. She recorded 205 dreams and Sanford 170. They woke themselves by the use <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks</b> at different hours of the night and recorded their dreams at the instant of waking They slept with a note pad right by their bed so as {{to be able to take}} note of any dreams as quickly as possible. Each morning, they studied all the records regardless of whether they seemed slight and trivial or significant. They also took account of the different types of dreams and they discovered elements of all various emotions As part of the project, they also considered the relation of the dream to the conscious, waking life, distinguishing the individuals and places in their dream experiences. Calkins explains in her autobiography that the dream [...] "merely reproduces in general the persons and places of recent sense perception and that is it rarely associated with that which is of paramount significance in one's waking experience". Another conclusion of Calkins and Sanford address the loss of identity in dreams as [...] "not a loss but a change or a doubling of self-consciousness ... yet all the time one is conscious that it is oneself who has changed or whose identity is doubled". Calkins' research was cited by Sigmund Freud when he created his conception of the dream. She also claimed that Freudians at the time were “superficially concerned with the ‘manifest content’ of dreams. However, the results recent study done by Montangero and Cavallero (2015) suggest that the consecutive events of the dreams of their participants were rarely plausible, and often seemed to have no relation to one another. This suggests that dreams have little hidden meaning, and supports the findings of Calkin’s original dream study.|$|E

40|$|Noisiness is an {{important}} product experience that is not restricted to the auditory properties of products; bright colors and cluttered visual patterns can also be experienced as noisy. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine to what extent the overall product noisiness is attributed to the sounds that the products make and to what extent is it attributed to the visual appearance of the products. We manipulated the auditory and visual properties <b>of</b> <b>alarm</b> <b>clocks</b> and whistling kettles by combining noisy and quiet stimuli of the two sensory modalities according to a full factorial design. Participants in our experiment assessed the noisiness, pleasantness, and annoyance of the products. The results demonstrated that noisiness and annoyance of the products were generally dominated by the product sound, whereas contribution from visual patterns was insignificant. The noisiness of the sound had a negative influence on the overall pleasantness of the products. The results suggest that in order to create pleasurable product experience, designers need to pay more attention to the auditory properties of products.
