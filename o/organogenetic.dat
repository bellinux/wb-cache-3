40|$|Abstract. Because {{of rapid}} {{advances}} in functional genomics {{there is an}} increasing demand for models simulating complex traits, such as the physiological and environmental controls of plant morphology. This paper describes, validates and explores the behaviour of the structural–functional model EcoMeristem, developed for cereals {{in the context of}} the Generation Challenge Program (GCP; CGIAR). EcoMeristem constructs the plant on the basis of an <b>organogenetic</b> body plan, driven by intrinsic (genetic) behavioural norms of meristems. These norms consist of phenological–topological rules for organ initiation and pre-dimensioning (sink creation) and rules enabling feedbacks of the plant’s resource status on the <b>organogenetic</b> processes. Plant resource status is expressed by a state variable called Internal Competition Index (Ic) calculated daily as the ratio of assimilate source (supply) over the sum of active sinks (demand). Ic constitutes an internal signal analogous to sugar signalling. Ic affects potential phytomer size, tiller initiation, leaf senescence, and carbohydrate storage andmobilisation. Themodelwas calibrated and tested on IR 64 rice grown in controlled environments, and validated with field observations for the same cultivar (Philippines). Observed distributions and dynamics of soluble sugars and starch in plant organs supported the model concepts of internal competition and the role of reserves as a buffer for Ic fluctuations. Model sensitivity analyses suggested that plant growth and development depend not only on assimilate supply, but also on organogenesis-based demand. If true, this conclusion has important consequences for crop improvement strategies...|$|E

40|$|Enzymes {{involved}} in malate metabolism, viz., glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase, malate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, had severalfold higher specific activities in organ-forming callus cultures of tobacco compared to non-organ-forming cultures.

While malate accumulated until day 15 in non-organ-forming callus, it accumulated up to day 6 in shoot-and root-forming callus.

Calli grown on modified Murashige-Skoog medium responded to varied auxins and cytokinins with different morphogenetic patterns. Thus, naphthaleneacetic acid yielded root-producing calli, while the auxin precursor isatin (indole 2, 3 -dione) caused the production of calli with vegetative and floral shoots, rarely yielding roots. This {{may be related to}} isatin's slow, steady conversion to an active auxin (Plant Physiol 41 : 1485 - 1488, 1966) in contrast with naphthaleneacetic acid's immediate presentation of a high level of active auxin. The highest incidence of vegetative shoot (100 %) and flower (50 %) formation was obtained with 10 micromoles isatin and 3 micromoles zeatin. A few of the flowers developed into ripe fruits.

Results We studied three species of bats (Miniopterus schreibersii fuliginosus, Hipposideros armiger and H. pratti), representing the two suborders Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera. Using an established embryonic staging system, we identified the embryonic stages for M. schreibersii fuliginosus, H. armiger and H. pratti and described the morphological changes in each species, including {{the development of the}} complex and distinctive nose-leaves in H. armiger and H. pratti.

40|$|To {{understand}} how the identity of an organ can be switched, we studied the transformation of lateral root primordia (LRP) into shoot meristems in Arabidopsis root segments. In this system, the cytokinininduced conversion does not involve the formation of callus-like structures. Detailed analysis showed that the conversion sequence starts with a mitotic pause and is concomitant with the differential expression of regulators of root and shoot development. The conversion requires the presence of apical stem cells, and only LRP at stages VI or VII can be switched. It is engaged as soon as cell divisions resume because their position and orientation differ in the converting organ compared with the undisturbed emerging LRP.

In this context, a model of interactions is proposed between plant organogenesis and plant functional mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fine-tuning}} of BMP signals {{is critical}} for many aspects of complex organogenesis. In this report, we show that the augmentation of BMP signaling by a BMP-binding secreted factor, Crossveinless 2 (Cv 2), {{is essential for the}} early embryonic development of mammalian nephrons. In the Cv 2 -null mouse, the number of cap condensates (clusters of nephron progenitors, which normally express Cv 2) was decreased, and the condensate cells exhibited a reduced level of aggregation. In these Cv 2 –/– condensates, the level of phosphorylated Smad 1 (pSmad 1) was substantially lowered. The loss of a Bmp 7 allele in the Cv 2 –/– mouse enhanced the cap condensate defects and further decreased the level of pSmad 1 in this tissue. These observations indicated that Cv 2 has a pro-BMP function in early nephrogenesis. Interestingly, the renal defects of the Cv 2 –/– mutant were totally suppressed by a null mutation of Twisted gastrulation (Tsg), which encodes another BMP-binding factor, showing that Cv 2 exerts its pro-BMP nephrogenic function Tsg-dependently. By using an embryonic kidney cell line, we presented experimental evidence showing that Cv 2 enhances pro-BMP activity of Tsg.

METHODS: The GreenLab model derived from AMAP models was used. <b>Organogenetic</b> rules give the plant architecture, which defines an interconnected network of organs. The plant is considered as a collection of interacting 'sinks' that compete for the allocation of photosynthates coming from 'sources'. A single variable characteristic of the balance between sources and sinks during plant growth controls different events in plant development, such as the number of branches or the fruit load. KEY RESULTS: Variations in the environmental parameters related to light and density induce changes in plant morphogenesis. Architecture appears as the dynamic result of this balance, and plant plasticity expresses itself very simply at different levels: appearance of branches and reiteration, number of organs, fructification and adaptation of ecophysiological characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The modelling framework serves as a tool for theoretical botany to explore the emergence of specific morphological and architectural patterns and can help to understand plant phenotypic plasticity and its strategy in response to environmental changes...|$|E
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{adventitious}} shoots have been induced {{to form in}} vitro on floral stem sections of Tulipa gesneriana L. cultivar Merry Widow. In comparison with explants of scale and axillary bud, floral stem tissues showed the greatest potential for shoot production. A modified Murashige & Skoog medium contained inorganic salts and vitamins at full strength and supplemented with benzylamino-purine and napthalene-acetic acid at 1 mg‾ 1 induced shoots on 70 %- 90 % of floral stem explants. The stage of development of the bulb {{was found to be}} an important factor in determining the ability of explants to regenerate shoots. The shoot producing potential of floral stem tissues was greatest during the 'dormant' phase of the bulbs, but the ability to produce shoots was lost once rapid extension growth and greening of the floral stem had commenced. Morphogenesis in vitro was found to be influenced by the origin of explants from within the floral stem. A study of endogenous plant growth regulators was made within the floral stem in order to elucidate their role in the <b>organogenetic</b> processes occurring in vitro. A study of histological and morphological development in vitro showed that the shoot-like structures arise from the epidermal cell layer and have the potential to form whole plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms of}} de novo meristem formation, cell differentiation and {{the integration of}} the cell cycle machinery into appropriate stages of the developmental programmes are still largely unknown in plants. Legume root nodules, which house nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, are unique plant organs and their development may {{serve as a model for}} <b>organogenetic</b> processes in plants. Nodules form and are essential for the plant only under limitation of combined nitrogen in the soil. Moreover, their development is triggered by external mitogenic signals produced by their symbiotic partners, the rhizobia. These signals, the lipochitooligosaccharide Nod factors, act as host-specific morphogens and induce the re-entry of root cortical cells into mitotic cycles. Maintenance of cell division activity leads to the formation of a persistent nodule meristem from which cells exit continuously and enter the nodule differentiation programme, involving multiple cycles of endoreduplication and enlargement of nuclear and cell volumes. While the small diploid 2 C cells remain uninfected, the large polyploid cells can be invaded and, after completing the differentiation programme, host the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. This review summarizes the present knowledge on cell cycle reactivation and meristem formation in response to Nod factors and reports on a novel plant cell cycle regulator that can switch mitotic cycles to differentiation programmes...|$|E
