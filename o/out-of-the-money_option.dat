In particular, Markov processes with jumps can provide appealing model for many financial application. This dissertation focuses on the small-time asymptotic behavior of Markov processes that are solutions to stochastic differential equations driven by both diffusion processes and pure jump processes. We first consider a local jump-diffusion process {Xt}t≥ 0 whose paths exhibit infinitely jump activity (i. e., with probability 1, the paths of the process exhibit infinitely many jumps in every finite integral). We obtain a second order power series expansion in a small t of the tail probability of the process {X t}t≥ 0. As an application, we derived the leading term for <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option</b> prices in short maturity under an exponential local jump-diffusion model. Our proofs in this work are based on a regularizing technique, Malliavin calculus, flow of diffeomorphism for SDEs, and time reversibility. Then, we generalize our Markov model one step forward, to allow the intensity of jumps of the process to depend locally {{on the state of the}} process. In this case, we again obtain a small-time second-order polynomial expansion for the tail distribution of the process and apply this result to further obtain a second-order expansion for <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option</b> prices. In this work, we also generalize existing works on the regularity of diffeomorphism associated to stochastic differential equations. Besides the just described analytical estimates, we also an innovative diffusion approximation for the infinite jump activity of jump-diffusion processes, which is not seen in the literatures, to the best of our knowledge...|$|E

We also derive closed-form expressions for writer-extendible options and discuss the writer's economic incentives for extending an <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option.</b> We apply these results to show that corporate debtholders have a strong incentive to extend the maturity of defaulting debt if there are liquidation costs.

To maximize the sensitivity to volatility, a simple formulation of Merton’s model is proposed that employs deep <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option</b> implied volatilities. The methodology also eliminates the use of historic data to specify the default barrier, thereby leading to a full risk-neutral calibration. Subsequently, a new technique for identifying and hedging capital structure arbitrage opportunities is illustrated.

In analyses of data com-piled from the public companies listed in Compustat’s Executive Compensation Data-base and a U. S.

The Heston model is calibrated by a two-step estimation procedure to incorporate both the information from time-series asset return and the information from cross-sectional option data. We find that both the Black-Scholes model and the Heston model overprice the <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option</b> and under price the in-the-money options, but the degree of the bias is different. The Heston model significantly outperforms the Black-Scholes model in almost all moneyness-maturity group. On average, the Heston model can reduce pricing errors by about 25 %. However, pricing bias still exists in the Heston model. In particular, the Heston model always overprices short-term options, indicating that some other factors, such as the random jump, may also be needed to explain the option price...|$|E

A cabinet trade {{is an option}} trade {{executed}} in a deep <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option</b> at a premium value less than the standard minimum tick. Each option product chapter defines the standard minimum tick increment and the allowable cabinet increments applicable to that product.

On the electronic trading system, cabinet transactions may occur only at Cab 1 ($ 1. 00). The amended product chapter rules permit the execution of cabinet transactions to initiate or to liquidate a position. Previously, CBOT rules allowed cabinet transactions for liquidating purposes only.

The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

40|$|Stochastic {{volatility}} {{models on}} option pricing have received much study {{following the discovery}} of the non-at implied surface following the crash of the stock markets in 1987. The most widely used stochastic volatility model is introduced by Heston (1993) because of its ability to generate volatility satisfying the market observations, being non-negative and mean-reverting, and also providing a closed-form solution for the European options. However, little research has been done on Heston model used to price early-exercise options. This presumably is largely due to the absence of a closed-form solution and the increase in computational requirement that complicates the required calibration exercise. This thesis examines the performance of the Heston model versus the Black-Scholes model for the American Style equity option of Microsoft and the index option of S&P 100 index. We employ a finite difference method combined with a Projected Successive Over-relaxation method for pricing an American put option under the Black-Scholes model, while an Alternating Direction Implicit method is utilized to decompose a multi-dimensional partial differential equation into several one dimensional steps under the Heston model. For the calibration of the Heston model, we apply a two step procedure where in the first step we apply an indirect inference method to historical stock prices to estimate diffusion parameters under a probability measure and then use a least squares method to estimate the instantaneous volatility and the market risk premium which are used to switch from working under the probability measure to working under the risk-neutral measure. We find that option price is positively related with the value of the mean reverting speed and the long-term variance. It is not sensitive to the market price of risk and it is negatively related with the risk free rate and the volatility of volatility. By comparing the European put option and the American put option under the Heston model, we observe that their implied volatility generally follow similar patterns. However, there are still some interesting observations that can be made from the comparison of the two put options. First, for the out-of-the-money category, the American and European options have rather comparable implied volatilities with the American options' implied volatility being slightly bigger than the European options. While for the in-the-money category, the implied volatility of the European options is notably higher than the American options and its value exceeds the implied volatility of the American options. We also assess the performance of the Heston model by comparing its result with the result from the Black-Scholes model. We observe that overall the Heston model performs better than the Black-Scholes model. In particular, the Heston model has tendency of underpricing the in-the-money option and overpricing the <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option.</b> Whereas, the Black-Scholes model is inclined to underprice both the in-the-money option and the <b>out-of-the-money</b> <b>option.</b> b 1 yea...|$|E

Examining the sensitivity in the value of the manager’s stock option to changes in the firm’s stock price (one metric for incentive-alignment power), we find that in general the ability of options to align incentives remained remarkably intact. This resilience in incentive-alignment power stems from the long maturity of executive stock options, the relatively high stock price volatility of firms that experience...|$|R
