Design and optimization of this storage will be supported by numerical simulations of heat and mass transfer with KARDOS. This paper focuses on the unsteady heat transfer during the major <b>operating</b> <b>step</b> of energetic discharge of the storage, which is characterized by conductive heat transfer in the fixed bed and a strong heat source caused by the adsorption enthalpy. Results are interpreted concerning the influence of variations in the parameter set.

As the energy consumption of air-conditioning (AC) accounts for about 40 % of total residential energy, therefore, applying smart control system to the use of AC to achieve the effects of comfy and energy savings should be able to generate positive effect for the energy consumption of overall residential. This study used the smart control system in the intelligent building lab to transmit message to AC for its implementation of next <b>operating</b> <b>step</b> through the indoor temperature sensor in order to achieve energy saving effect...|$|E

To detect potentially life threatening errors, we design an assistance system based on observation by multiple cameras and robust spatio-temporal algorithm. Firstly, we record the video by multiple cameras when people use the infusion pump. Secondly, we use a robust MoSIFT algorithm, which detects interest points and encodes not only their local appearance but also explicitly models local motion, to describe the action. Thirdly, we recognize each individual human <b>operating</b> <b>step</b> in the use of an infusion pump to see if the patient has correctly performed the required actions in a safe sequence.

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{developed}} to effectively manipulating nano-entities to predefined positions and orientations autonomously. In this method, the nanomanipulation process is programmed by planning and executing the AFM tip&# 39;s movement, and the amplitude of probe-tip&# 39;s vibration {{is measured in}} real-time to detect the boundary of the nano-entities under manipulation - which will change {{as a function of}} the distance between the probe-tip and a nano-entity due to their inter-molecular force interactions. After the start-position and destination are defined by the user interface software, the nanomanipulation process is operated automatically. The result from each manipulation step is detected and used as the information for feedback control on the subsequent <b>operating</b> <b>step.</b> Using this method, CNTs can be manipulated to any position and orientation. Experimental results show that this manipulation method is effective and more efficient (reduce operation time by > 50 %) than nanomanipulation processes with a human operator in the feedback loop.

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{phenomena}} of edges as a differentiation that both divides and conjoins space and process. Edge conditions {{as a species}} of edges {{are responsible for the}} founding and development of our cities and they continue to influence the metropolis through a membranous separation - communication.. These edge conditions in process and spatial things can be explained through the analogy of a step. Step covers both meanings, the action of taking a step and the interval which is a step, consequently it describes the process and the spatiality or the time and space of step as an edge condition. A step links ‘instants’ of process and spatiality. A step is both end and bridge as an edge is both an end and an intersection. Its perhaps not incidental that mechanical time relies on serial steps {{in the form of a}} set of interlinked rotating cogs <b>operating</b> <b>step</b> by step to generate motion. This clockwork action becomes increasingly complex three dimensionally using the edges of serial cams and the stepping action of ‘cam followers’ between cams to develop complex programmed motion. This programmed motion through a series of edges and steps was used to create breathtaking imitations of nature such as ‘The Writer’ by Pierre Jaquet Droz and ‘The Swan’ by John Joseph Merlin. Today’s cities can be conceived of emerging as a reflective pattern of the programmatic activities and expectancies of their milieus where edge conditions form the basis of this reflective control. The edge is where happenings intensify it’s the meeting of phenomena and consequently both barrier and bridge to other spaces containing the ‘novel’ as in Simmel’s strangers. “All human action takes and makes place.
