5|$|The {{final two}} matches <b>of</b> <b>round</b> two {{took place on}} the July10 episode of Impact!. The first was between Team International and Team Japan. In this contest, Doug Williams of Team International {{defeated}} Masato Yoshino by pinfall after slamming Yoshino neck-first onto the mat with his signature Chaos Theory maneuver at the 5 minute mark. In the final match <b>of</b> <b>round</b> two, Team TNA faced Team Mexico. Team TNA's Kaz defeated Team Mexico's Ultimo Guerrero in 5 minutes. Kaz won the bout by pinfall after slamming Guerrero face-first onto the mat with his signature Wave of the Future maneuver.

5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, and in the case <b>of</b> <b>round</b> bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number <b>of</b> <b>round</b> trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, the Advanced Encryption System – AES is used {{in almost}} all network-based {{applications}} to ensure security. The core computation of AES, which is performed on data blocks of 128 bits, is iterated for several rounds, de-pending on the key size. The strength of AES {{is proportional to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> applied. So far, the number <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> is fixed to 10, 12 and 14 for a key size of 128, 192 and 256 bits respectively. Most cryptographers feel that the margin between the number <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> specified in the cipher and the best known attacks is too small. On the other hand, {{it is clear that the}} overall efficiency of a given AES implementation is inversely proportional to the number <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> imposed. In this paper, we propose a very efficient pipelined hardware implementation of AES- 128. Besides, we show that if the re-quired number <b>of</b> <b>rounds</b> must increase to defeat attackers, the proposed implementation stays efficient...|$|R
