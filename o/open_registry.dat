5|$|The Liberian <b>open</b> <b>registry,</b> {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E

The application of three techniques, the Chi-Square Statistic, and Index of Seafarer Displacement, and an Index of Revenue Deduction, revealed that Liberian ship owner’s representatives responses to hypothetical flag state manning percentage requirements varied. Three potential ship-owner options, to go out of business, automate, or re-flag, due to higher labor costs were examined to estimate their relative importance. Finally, nations supplying labor to <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> and revenues earned were assessed to determine possible impacts on Liberian bulk shipping...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} transport costs for intra-Latin American trade {{over a period of}} six years (1999 - 2004). The data refer to yearly disaggregated (SITC 5 digit level) maritime trade flows on 277 trade routes. With this data set, a transport costs equation is estimated using linear regression analysis in a panel data framework. The first contribution to the literature is to exploit the greater variability present in our data and to control for unobservable heterogeneous effects. The second is to investigate the influence of <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> on the variability of maritime transport costs. Three groups of explanatory variables are considered. Firstly, timevarying variables: use of <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> and trade imbalance. Secondly, variables related to liner shipping network structures: number of liner services, shipping opportunities, deployed ships and deployed TEUs. Finally, product related variables such as volume of shipment, value of product and special characteristics of the cargo (i. e. refrigerated cargo). The results will allow us to quantify the effect of the explanatory variables on international maritime transport costs and to compare the obtained elasticities with previous cross-section analysis. In particular, estimating the impact of the use of <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> on transport cost is a new contribution in this field that could provide policy makers with valuable information {{to be used in the}} implementation of economic policies.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} our {{preliminary evaluation}} of the automatic semantic annotation of <b>open</b> <b>registries.</b> Conversely to traditional application of semantic annotation to scientific abstracts (e. g., PubMed), <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> contain descriptions that mix terminologies of Computer Science, Biomedicine and Bioinformatics, which makes their automatic annotation more prone to errors. Moreover, the extensive use of acronyms and abbreviations in these registries may also produce wrong annotations. To evaluate {{the impact of these}} errors in the quality of the automatically generated annotations we have built a Gold Standard (GS) with single-word annotations. Additionally, we have adapted a knowledge-based disambiguation method to measure the hardness in distinguishing right from wrong annotations. Results show that for some semantic groups the disambiguation can be performed with good precision, but for others the effectiveness is far from being acceptable. Future work will be focused on developing techniques for improving the semantic annotation of these poorly represented semantic groups. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{critical}} role shipping taxation {{has played in}} the structure and evolution of the shipping business {{over the last century}} can easily be recognised. Whether connected with the actual initiation of the <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> scheme or as a means to improve competitiveness of traditional flags, shipping taxation attracts the attention of shipping practitioners and policy makers and constitutes an always topical focus of study. Recent years have particularly seen the rise and growth of tonnage tax system as no longer merely an inventive tax format but as a global standard of shipping taxation, which is in operation for 70 % of the global ocean-going fleet. An examination of the European Union (EU) shipping taxation policy exhibits particular interest not only {{due to the fact that}} a number of significant traditional ship-owning nations are part of the EU – for example, Greece and the UK – but also due to the presence of fairly recently joined countries with a substantial role in international shipping as popular <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> – for example, Cyprus and Malta. The aim of this paper is to investigate the shipping taxation policy of the EU by concentrating on the forms this takes in selected European countries and to examine critically the comparative position of Greek shipping in this context...|$|R

50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>registries</b> {{have been}} branded as flags of {{convenience}} by ITF (International Transport Workers' Federation) {{to have lower}} standards for vessel, equipment, and crew than the traditional maritime countries and often have classification societies certify and inspect the vessels in their registry, instead of by their own shipping authority. This made it attractive for ship owners to change flag, whereby the ship lost the economic link and the country of registry. With this, also the link between classification society and traditional maritime country became less obvious - for instance Lloyd's with the United Kingdom and ABS with the United States. This {{made it easier to}} change class and introduced a new phenomena; class hopping. A ship owner that is dissatisfied with class can change to a different class relatively easily. This has led to more competition between classes and a relaxation of the rules. This has led to the shipping industry losing confidence in the classification societies, but also by the European Commission.Today <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> are amongst the leading performers on the white lists, are first to ratify and implement International Conventions, including Labor Standards, and are often offering the level of service and attention which the traditional national registries are missing.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Whilst the issue of <b>open</b> <b>registry</b> shipping has constituted {{one of the greatest}} controversies in the shipping industry over the last thirty years, no detailed quantitative work has been carried out on the issue. In this thesis transcendental logarithmic cost functions are estimated for the production functions of <b>open</b> <b>registry</b> bulk ships and those operating under traditional maritime nations. In this way an appropriately unrestricted cost function for the flag dichotomy is estimated and the parameters of the cost functions provide the basis for determining the structure of the production technology of tankers and bulk carriers under the two· flag groupings. Evidence of scale economies {{and the extent to which}} they have been exploited by each flag group is provided along with factor substitution patterns, own-price and crossprice factor demand elasticities. It is found that the costs of bulk carriers operating under open registries are lower for all vessel sizes than for those operating under traditional registries. For tankers/open tegistry costs are found to be higher for product tanker services and lower otherwise. The translog estimates reveal that the manning cost element is the greatest contributor to the cost differential between the two groups. <b>Open</b> <b>registry</b> operations are also found to be subject to greater factor substitution flexibility. Statistical analysis of tanker and bulk carrier time charter freight rates over a ten-year period provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis that lower <b>open</b> <b>registry</b> costs are passed on to consumers of shipping services by way of lower freight rates. For this reason, a methodology for measuring this benefit is suggested. It is concluded that whilst this study provides evidence of the possible cost to international trade of phasing out open registries, such cost of itself does not provide an argument for retaining the system. The social and economic rationality of retaining the system will be determined by a wider cose-benefit analysis to which this study has contributed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to trace the {{development}} of the Singapore Ship Registry, from the introduction of <b>open</b> <b>registry</b> in 1969 until the tightening of registration requirements from the late 1970 s. The extraordinary growth of the Singapore merchant marine is analysed {{in the light of the}} policies of the Singapore government. In many respects, the opening of the registry mirrors the Singapore economic policies in general, as it facilitated the growth of domestic employment and production, without necessitating large domestic investments. The shift in the shipping policy in the late 1960 s was motivated by the wish to save foreign exchange, create employment opportunities and exert greater control over the country’s foreign trade. However, the opening of the registry for shipowners of all nations should also been seen in relation to the desire to promote Singapore as a maritime centre. Certain characteristics of the Singapore fleet and the pragmatism of the authorities in establishing and disbanding the <b>open</b> <b>registry</b> distinguish the Singapore registry from some of the other important Flags of Convenience. The opening of the registry in the late 1960 s, motivated by the stigma associated with being a Flag of Convenience, represents one important shift in the Singapore shipping policy. When the <b>open</b> <b>registry</b> had reached its sell-by date, and the initial problems had been alleviated, the authorities’ strategies were reversed. The shift towards tighter requirements illustrates the pragmatism with which the Singapore authorities have changed their shipping policy...|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, <b>open</b> <b>registries</b> frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|R
