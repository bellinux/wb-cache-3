5|$|From 1643 to 1659, {{he served}} as master mason for the {{construction}} of Heriot's Hospital (now a school), succeeding William Aytoun. The building had been started in 1628 by William Wallace, and would not be finally completed until 1700; Mylne rebuilt one or two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> in 1648. Also in 1648, Mylne was engaged to repair the crown steeple of St. Giles'.|$|E
5|$|The west front has {{two large}} {{flanking}} three-stage towers. On the rear outer corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> are octagonal stair turrets with panels on the belfry stage. Between the towers {{is a deep}} entrance arch of six orders with decorative Purbeck Marble colonnettes and enriched mouldings to the arch. The tympanum of the arch contains an empty niche.|$|E
5|$|Beeston {{was built}} by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, as an impregnable stronghold and a symbol of power. The siting of the castle's outer bailey walls was chosen to take {{advantage}} of the fortifications remaining from the earlier Iron Age rampart. In medieval documents the castle is described as Castellum de Rupe, the Castle on the Rock. It is one of three major castles built by Ranulph in the 1220s, shortly after his return from the Fifth Crusade. The others are Bolingbroke in Lincolnshire, and Chartley, Staffordshire, both of which share similar architectural features with Beeston; in particular the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tower</b> {{comprises}} three ironbark {{poles in}} a triangular plan, which taper inwards from <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Each pole {{consists of two}} logs spliced together approximately halfway up <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> and is set into a concrete footing at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> Poles are braced and cross-braced.|$|R
50|$|In August 1962, <b>the</b> remains <b>of</b> a 20-year-old man missing {{since the}} {{previous}} November {{were discovered in}} <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> To retrieve <b>the</b> body, a hole was created near <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> location <b>of</b> that hole is still visible on <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> is currently protected from vandals and climbers by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire.|$|R
5000|$|To {{support the}} longer term {{maintenance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> <b>the</b> Luitpold <b>Tower</b> Club (Luitpoldturmverein) {{was set up in}} 2007. Its aim is to [...] "conserve, and where possible improve, <b>the</b> structural state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> ... to ensure free access to <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> at any time as well an unobstructed panoramic view for all ... and to keep <b>the</b> public aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> and <b>the</b> extensive views that can be experienced." ...|$|R
5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand ordered 400 men {{to enter}} the saps; these men would storm the castle once the mine had been detonated. The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were {{to wait in the}} fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{reaching}} the Emerald City (an analogue of the real-life World Trade Center plaza), the quintet gains passage {{into the city}} because of Dorothy's ownership of the silver slippers; they marvel at the spectacle {{of the city and}} its sophisticated, fashion forward dancers. They are granted an audience with the Wiz (Richard Pryor), who lives at the very top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Towers.</b> He appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E
5000|$|There are two stairs {{for walking}} up to <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> walls. It is {{possible}} to walk up by spiral stairs from inner side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> to a corridor, which was built about 3 m outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> other stone stair walks up to <b>the</b> upper side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> from <b>the</b> garden. By means of these stairs {{it is possible to}} walk up to <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> walls and look at the village.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 a {{post box}} was opened at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> {{hydraulic}} lifts to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> were replaced in 1956-57 and the winding-gear replaced by electric.|$|R
50|$|The poles {{support a}} {{hexagonal}} cabin at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> accessed by a timber staircase which wraps around <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> staircase includes {{a series of}} small platforms.|$|R
5|$|In 1892 Gaudí was {{commissioned}} by Claudio López Bru, second Marquis of Comillas, with the Franciscana Catholic Missions {{for the city of}} Tangier, in Morocco (at the time a Spanish colony). The project included a church, hospital and school, and Gaudí conceived a quadrilobulate ground-plan floor structure, with catenary arches, parabolic towers, and hyperboloid windows. Gaudí deeply regretted the project's eventual demise, always keeping his design with him. In spite of this, the project influenced the works of the Sagrada Família, in particular the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> with their paraboloid shape like those of the Missions.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping {{on the south lawn}} was carried out by Bishop George Henry Law in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers.</b> Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a black walnut, Lebanon cedar, catalpa and ginkgo. In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to the springs. This acts as a mirror on a still day providing reflections of the east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{memorials}} was the Tribute in Light, an installation of 88 searchlights at the footprints of the World Trade Center towers. In New York City, the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was held to design an appropriate memorial on the site. The winning design, Reflecting Absence, was selected in August 2006, and consists {{of a pair of}} reflecting pools in the footprints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers,</b> surrounded by a list of the victims' names in an underground memorial space. The memorial was completed on September 11, 2011; a museum also opened on site on May 21, 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Cap - <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{that holds}} <b>the</b> sail and stock, this piece {{is able to}} rotate on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{cross section}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{features}} two geometric shapes, a square and a rectangle. The rectangle {{shape in the}} building starts at the ground floor up to the 40th floor. The triangle shape extends to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> At <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower,</b> a crown completes the design. It is expected the crown will hold <b>the</b> <b>tower's</b> company logo.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Resident Governor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London and Keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewel House is {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> day-to-day running <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London.|$|R
5|$|Several of the gatehouses {{played an}} {{important}} part in the administration of the town in the 15th century. South Gate formed the main administrative centre for the port during the period, housing the Clerk of the King's Ships and collecting customs revenue. It was expanded in the 1430s and 1440s, but was in poor condition again by the 1480s, resulting in fresh construction work around the site. Bargate was partially used as a prison from the 15th century, in a similar fashion to many other towns. The first floor of the building had been used as the town's guildhall from at least 1441 onwards, and the treasury was kept in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers.</b> Elaborate feasts were served there on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the Bastille {{at the time was}} Bernard-René de Launay, a conscientious but minor military officer. Tensions surrounding the Bastille had been rising for several weeks. Only eight prisoners remained in the fortress, but one of these, the Marquis de Sade, had stoked the link between the revolution and the Bastille, addressing the public from his walks on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> and, once this was forbidden, shouting from the window of his cell. Sade began to claim that the authorities planned to massacre the prisoners in the castle, which resulted in the governor removing him to an alternative site in early July.|$|E
5|$|The main protagonist is Aeron, {{a former}} soldier from {{the kingdom of}} Athos. Three {{years prior to the}} start of the game, a wounded Aeron was given shelter by Elena, an Elyrian. Despite their {{countries}} being at war, Elena nurses him and the two eventually became lovers. They are accompanied on their journey to the Thirteen Towers by Mavda, a woman of the Vestra tribe who is the current guardian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Towers.</b> Her tribe have the ability to manipulate the chains of fate, and gives Aeron the Oraclos Chain weapon to both aid him in his quest and maintain a connection with Elena.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> bottom [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower's</b> {{structure}} consists <b>of</b> brickwork with sand-coloured Anston limestone cladding. <b>The</b> remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower's</b> {{height is}} a framed spire <b>of</b> cast iron. <b>The</b> <b>tower</b> {{is founded on}} a [...] square raft, made of [...] thick concrete, {{at a depth of}} [...] below ground level. The four clock dials are [...] above ground. <b>The</b> interior volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> is 164,200 cubic feet (4,650 cubic metres).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> and <b>the</b> dome {{above the}} altar are painted white, {{as are the}} window frames on <b>the</b> upper section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|R
5000|$|April 2016 - {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> core at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 22-26 floors. Installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal farm in <b>the</b> 18-22d floors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|R
5|$|The tower's {{electrical}} service was supplied by Consolidated Edison (ConEd) at 13,800volts. The electricity {{passed through the}} World Trade Center Primary Distribution Center (PDC), and was then sent up the building's core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors. The substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277volts, and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120volts for general power and lighting services. The complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> and {{on the roof of}} Five World Trade Center.|$|E
5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
5|$|The two {{defensive}} towers appearing {{along the}} near shoreline of the islet are still present, their structures remain intact although their exteriors are considerably altered. The leftmost is Birger Jarls torn {{located in the}} north-western corner of the islet and erroneously named after Birger Jarl, by tradition attributed to be the founder of Stockholm. The other is the so-called Vasatornet ("Tower of Vasa"), today forming the southern tower of the Wrangel Palace. For the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> and other defensive structures, the king used bricks from the monastery Klara kloster located {{just north of the}} city but absent in the painting. Since the monastery is known to have been demolished immediately following the introduction of Protestantism in 1527, the painting is, again, a credible source rendering the city as it appeared in 1535.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Major <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London, later also styled Resident Governor, was {{an officer}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tower</b> <b>of</b> London, {{subordinate}} to the Constable and the Lieutenant.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> main {{entrance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> {{would have been}} at <b>the</b> 6th level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> along <b>the</b> elevated esplanade/promenade, which rises 18 metres above ground level.|$|R
5000|$|December 2016 - {{installation}} <b>of</b> facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 16-18 floors; construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> core at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 57-61 floors.|$|R
5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using {{the water from the}} moat, but the system {{does not appear to have}} worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E
5|$|The {{west side}} of the walls include nine towers, rising upwards towards the {{south-west}} corner. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>towers</b> were significantly affected by 19th-century developments; one was converted into an entrance way for the Bangor Road in 1827, whilst another suffered a deep fissure caused by subsidence from the excavation of the Chester to Holyhead railway tunnel in 1845, and had to be underpinned in 1963. One of the remaining merlons on this stretch of the walls' battlements has a stone finial on top, a design originally used along all of the town walls. The western wall originally extended out to the river Conwy itself, ending in a round tower, but this has since been lost; a similar spur arrangement was seen at Chester and Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|A {{husband and}} wife who had lost their son {{as a result of}} the war offered {{themselves}} as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed the Masters into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster consumed with a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed the Masters in the Towers and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to the Towers in the hopes that the Masters would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda was the latest guardian <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Towers.</b> Four hundred and fifty years later, the Elyrian Army recreated the Masters as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tower</b> is {{elliptical}} {{in shape}} and is built using the usual steel and glaze. Balconies are built at <b>the</b> peak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower.</b> <b>The</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tower</b> is covered in a blue tinted glaze but clear glazing {{will be used to}} cover the roof.|$|R
