5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} varies {{during the}} lifespan of an individual. Researchers have more specifically described cognitive flexibility as {{the capacity to}} shift or switch one’s thinking and attention between different tasks or operations typically {{in response to a}} change in rules or demands. For example, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they are able to successfully switch from sorting cards based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the object to sorting based on the type of object on the card.|$|E
5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} {{has been}} more broadly described {{as the ability to}} adjust one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to new situations. As such, if one is able to overcome previously held beliefs or habits (when it is required for new situations) then they would be considered cognitively flexible. Lastly, the ability to simultaneously consider two aspects of an object, idea, or situation at one point in time refers to cognitive flexibility. According to this definition, when sorting cards based on specific rules, children are considered cognitively flexible if they can sort cards based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the objects and type of objects on the card simultaneously. Similarly, cognitive flexibility has been defined as having the understanding and awareness of all possible options and alternatives simultaneously within any given situation.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{described}} in 1822 as Agaricus indigo by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz, the species was later {{transferred to the}} genus Lactarius in 1838 by the Swede Elias Magnus Fries. German botanist Otto Kuntze called it Lactifluus indigo in his 1891 treatise Revisio Generum Plantarum, but the suggested name change was not adopted by others. Hesler and Smith in their 1960 study of North American species of Lactarius defined L.indigo as the type species of subsection Caerulei, a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky, blue cap. In 1979, they revised their opinions on the organization of subdivisions in the genus Lactarius, and instead placed L.indigo in subgenus Lactarius based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of latex, and the subsequent color changes observed after exposure to air. As they explained:The gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further study. The climax is reached in L.indigo which is blue throughout. L.chelidonium and its variety chelidonioides, L.paradoxus, and L. hemicyaneus may be considered as mileposts {{along the road to}} L.indigo.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} he worked on Yu Yu Hakusho, Togashi would {{calculate}} the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own dōjinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on Yu Yu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at {{the climax of the}} Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. Togashi was relieved {{at the conclusion of the}} manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} the statistic number of i-pseudoinversions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>colored</b> permutation groups.

By means of this statistic, we construct our number system, and a bijection between the set of positive integers and <b>the</b> <b>colored</b> permutation groups. We also deduce the generating function of the statistic number of pseudoinversions which is a generalization of the Poincaré polynomials of the symmetric group and of the hyperoctahedral group.

25|$|Perception {{of color}} depends {{heavily on the}} context in which the {{perceived}} object is presented. For example, a white page under blue, pink, or purple light will reflect mostly blue, pink, or purple light to the eye, respectively; the brain, however, compensates for the effect of lighting (based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> shift of surrounding objects) and is more likely to interpret the page as white under all three conditions, a phenomenon known as color constancy.|$|E

25|$|The finest ruby is {{described}} as being a vivid medium-dark toned red. Secondary hues add an additional complication. Pink, orange, and purple are the normal secondary hues in ruby. Of the three, purple is preferred because it reinforces the red, making it appear richer. Purple also occupies a position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> wheel halfway between red and blue. When a purplish-red ruby is set in yellow, the yellow neutralizes its complement blue, leaving the stone appearing to be pure red in the setting.|$|E

A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses {{a process known as}} spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.|$|E

25|$|The {{study and}} {{observation}} of plants {{has been of}} high importance to the Maya for centuries. However, the study of medicinal plants {{was limited to the}} priestly class.
