5|$|The convention, held on October 1, 1930, {{proved to}} be a turning point both for the party and for Macdonald. In a {{departure}} from tradition, the party's new leader would be chosen by convention delegates instead <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> caucus members at the legislature. Two veterans <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> politics, both wealthy businessmen, were contesting the leadership. There was little enthusiasm, however, for either. Just as nominations were about to close, a delegate from Truro rose unexpectedly to nominate Macdonald. Surprised, Macdonald at first declined the nomination, then agreed to accept it when he sensed strong support on the convention floor. A few hours later, the 40-year-old Macdonald had won a resounding first-ballot victory to become the new Liberal leader.|$|E

5|$|A {{leadership}} spill of {{the federal}} parliamentary leader of the Liberal Party of Australia was held on 1 December 2009. The incumbent, Malcolm Turnbull, was defeated by Tony Abbott in a three-way vote <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party Members of Parliament (MPs). Joe Hockey also stood as a candidate. Abbott thus became the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of Australia.|$|E

5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} affirmation of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative {{interpretations of the}} Confession. By the 1940s, the dominance <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> theology {{had given way to}} a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Ohio Wesleyan {{had added}} a School of Music (1877), School of Fine Arts (1877), School of Oratory (1894), and Business School (1895) to the {{original}} College <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> Arts (founded in 1844). To address the need for new departments and specialized instruction, the administration improved the facilities and courses to make them on par with OWU's new academic position. University Hall, Slocum Library, extensions to the Monnett campus, and athletic facilities were all constructed during that period.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brezhnev's {{failures}} in domestic reforms, his {{foreign affairs and}} defense policies turned the Soviet Union into a superpower.

5|$|Georgia Tech's {{undergraduate}} and graduate programs are divided into six colleges.

Georgia Tech has sought to strengthen its {{undergraduate and}} graduate offerings in less technical fields, primarily those under the Ivan Allen College <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> Arts. That particular College has seen a 20% increase in admissions. Also, even in the Ivan Allen College, the Institute does not offer a Bachelor of Arts degree, only a Bachelor of Science.|$|E

Deputy mayor Yury Luzhkov took over, and ran the city from 1992 to 2010.|$|E

5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> Republicans. When the Democrats met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in the state had been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central to the election.|$|E
5|$|Like other Spanish liberals, Goya {{was left}} in a {{difficult}} position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{policies}} that Diefenbaker held dear did not survive the 16 years <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> rule which followed his fall. By the end of 1963, {{the first of the}} Bomarc warheads entered Canada, where they remained until the last were finally phased out during John Turner's brief government in 1984. Diefenbaker's decision to have Canada remain outside the OAS was not reversed by Pearson, and it was not until 1989, under the Tory government of Brian Mulroney, that Canada joined.|$|E

5|$|On September 1, 1994, Clough {{became the}} first Georgia Tech alumnus {{to serve as the}} President of the Institute, {{succeeding}} John Patrick Crecine, and was in office during the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1998, he separated the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs into the Ivan Allen College <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> Arts and the College of Management, which he returned to independent status. This separation was a major organizational change that built upon the large (and controversial) reorganization of the institute by Clough's predecessor.|$|E
5|$|That same year, a group <b>of</b> <b>liberal</b> ministers {{composed}} a statement defending their theological views {{known as the}} Auburn Affirmation {{due to the fact}} that it was based on the work of Robert Hastings Nichols of Auburn Seminary. Citing the Adopting Act of 1729, the Affirmation claimed for the PCUSA a heritage of doctrinal liberty. It also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of the General Assembly and a majority of presbyteries; therefore, according to the Affirmation, the General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required adherence to the five fundamentals.|$|E
5|$|The Demands <b>of</b> <b>Liberal</b> Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E
