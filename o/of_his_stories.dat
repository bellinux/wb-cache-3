5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b> Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in The New York Times initial reluctance to fire him.|$|E
5|$|Director Rajnesh Domalpalli {{graduated}} with bachelor's and master's degrees {{in electrical engineering}} in 1984 and 1986. While working on his bachelor's degree at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, he wrote short stories. One <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories,</b> The Dowry, was twice selected for broadcast by BBC World Service {{while he was in}} graduate school. During schooling, he was introduced to south Indian classical music, especially on the veena, and followed this up with years of training on the vocals.|$|E
5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E
50|$|Jorge Luis Borges {{introduces}} many philosophical themes, and {{a number}} of fictional philosophers, in <b>his</b> short <b>stories.</b> A fictional philosophical movement {{is a part of the}} premise <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, and the unnamed narrator <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> The Library <b>of</b> Babel could also be called a fictional philosopher. A fictional theologian is the subject <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>story</b> Three Versions <b>of</b> Judas.|$|R

5|$|Several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> have {{inspired}} other writers and directors. In 1987, the Italian director Francesco Rosi directed the movie Cronaca di una morte annunciata based on Chronicle of a Death Foretold. Several film adaptations {{have been made}} in Mexico, including Miguel Littin's La Viuda de Montiel (1979), Jaime Humberto Hermosillo's Maria de mi corazón (1979), and Arturo Ripstein's El coronel no tiene quien le escriba (1998).|$|E
5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b> At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), This Gun for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E
5|$|Following his release, Dostoyevsky read {{a myriad}} of {{literature}} and gradually became interested in nationalistic and conservative philosophies and increasingly sceptical towards contemporary movementsespecially the Nihilists. Dostoyevsky wrote his most important works after his time in Siberia, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Gambler and The Brothers Karamazov. With {{the help of his}} brother Mikhail, Dostoyevsky opened two magazinesVremya and Epochin which some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories</b> appeared. Following their closures, most of his works were issued in the conservative The Russian Messenger until the introduction of A Writer's Diary, which comprised most of his worksincluding essays and articles. Several drafts and plans, especially those begun during his honeymoon, remain unfinished.|$|E

5|$|It was in Brockville {{that the}} 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired {{him as a}} member of its news department; many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories,</b> {{including}} his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.|$|E
5|$|The initial six-part {{series was}} {{published}} between February and July 1993. The story follows former reporter Eddie Brock, first introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988), as a villain and {{enemy of the}} superhero Spider-Man. In his appearances in The Amazing Spider-Man, Brock blames Spider-Man for ending his career by debunking one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b> He bonds with the Venom symbiote, a sentient alien that had previously bonded with (and been rejected by) Spider-Man. Together, Brock and the symbiote become Venom. In The Amazing Spider-Man #375, Brock makes peace with Spider-Man after he saves Brock's wife (Ann Weying) from death. Brock then moves {{back to his home}} city of San Francisco for a fresh start, starting the events of Venom: Lethal Protector.|$|E

Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement {{they seem to be}} destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her.

5|$|During the Second World War Dahl was a {{pilot in}} the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he crashed in the Libyan desert; the {{subsequent}} injuries left him unfit to fly. He was posted to Washington as an assistant air attaché, ostensibly a diplomatic post, but which also included espionage and propaganda work. In 1942 the writer C.S. Forester asked him to provide details of his experiences in North Africa which Forester hoped to use {{in an article in}} The Saturday Evening Post. Instead of the notes which Forester expected, Dahl sent a finished story for which he was paid $900. The work led to The Gremlins, a serialised story in Cosmopolitan about a mischievous and fictional RAF creature, the gremlin; the work was published as Dahl's first novel in 1943. Dahl continued to write short stories, although these were all aimed at the adult market. They were sold to magazines and newspapers, and were later compiled into collections, the first of which was published in 1946. Dahl began to make up bedtime stories for the children, and these formed the basis of several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>stories.</b> His first children's novel, James and the Giant Peach, was published in 1961, which was followed, along with others, by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964), Fantastic Mr Fox (1970), Danny, the Champion of the World (1975), The BFG (1982) and Matilda in 1988.|$|E
