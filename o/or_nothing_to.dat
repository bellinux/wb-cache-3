Of 38top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred {{to other parts of}} the USSR. Of the 146Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> save his friends and colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes emit on the {{electromagnetic}} spectrum, with sferics and E-field effects detected. There are observed correlations between tornadoes {{and patterns of}} lightning. Tornadic storms do not contain more lightning than other storms and some tornadic cells never produce lightning at all. More often than not, overall cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity decreases as a tornado touches the surface {{and returns to the}} baseline level when the tornado dissipates. In many cases, intense tornadoes and thunderstorms exhibit an increased and anomalous dominance of positive polarity CG discharges. Electromagnetics and lightning have little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do directly with what drives tornadoes (tornadoes are basically a thermodynamic phenomenon), although there are likely connections with the storm and environment affecting both phenomena.|$|E

5|$|Without fully {{endorsing}} the de Montesquiou explanation, Michael Coleman carefully examined the story and, in particular, the two published {{versions of the}} ladies' accounts (the earlier-written of which, from November 1901, had only previously {{been published in the}} second, small print-run, edition of An Adventure in 1913). Coleman concluded that the more widely available texts, as published in the 1911 and later editions, had been considerably embroidered well after the events described and after the ladies had begun their investigations, while the original accounts had little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> suggest a supernatural experience. He also questioned the rigour and reliability of the ladies' subsequent researches, pointing out that few, if any, of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources.|$|E

The company's mission {{is to be the}} #1 wheat beer producer in Canada. The company started as a contract brewery, brewing their beer out of a third party facility in Toronto, Ontario. In July 2016 All <b>or</b> <b>Nothing</b> acquired a group of companies being Trafalgar Ales & Meads, Trafalgar Artisanal Distillery and Pioneer Black Creek Brewery to gain access to bricks and mortar production. Trafalgar Ales & Meads prior to acquisition was one of the oldest breweries still operating in the Province of Ontario having been founded in 1993. All <b>or</b> <b>Nothings</b> first beer <b>to</b> market is their [...] "All <b>or</b> <b>Nothing</b> Hopfenweisse", which is a lightly hopped German Weisse beer.

25|$|Many more {{elements}} {{have been}} given names that have little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with their properties. Elements have been named for celestial bodies (helium, selenium, tellurium, for the sun, moon, and earth; cerium and palladium for Ceres and Pallas, two asteroids). They have been named for mythological figures, including Titans in general (titanium) and Prometheus in particular (promethium); Roman and Greek gods (uranium, neptunium, and plutonium) and their descendents (tantalum for Tantalus, a son of Zeus, and niobium for Niobe, a daughter of Tantalus); and Norse deities (vanadium for the goddess Vanadis and thorium for the god Thor).|$|E

A large majority of chasers are male and white but a minority are female or of Asian or other descents. The average age is probably around 35 but chasers could theoretically be of any age. A relatively high proportion possess college degrees and a large number live in the central and southern U.S. Many are lovers of nature with interests that also include flora, fauna, volcanoes, aurora, meteors, eclipses, and astronomy.|$|E

25|$|The Ci as {{a poetic}} form perhaps reached {{a high point}} during the Song Dynasty. The ci {{is a kind of}} lyric Classical Chinese poetry using a poetic meter based upon some 800 prototypical fixed-rhythm forms, {{originally}} tunes of songs, each having a traditional title. Each song title therefore came to specify particular fixed pattern of tone, rhythm, number of syllables (or characters) per line and the number of lines. Therefore, it is common for several ci to share the same title, which often has little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the topics of those poems, but rather the patterns that the lyrics follow. Many of its prime proponents were female poets, such as Li Qingzhao. Su Shi was another prominent Song poet famous for writing in the ci form.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the start}} of World War I, Moon soon enlisted in the Royal Naval Air Service with the rank of Flight Sub-Lieutenant. His {{military}} service took him to East Africa, based on HMS Hyacinth, from where on 6 January 1917 {{he was on a}} reconnaissance flight with Cdr. Richard Bridgeman as observer. They were forced to land with engine trouble and came down in a creek of the Rufiji River delta where they destroyed the seaplane to avoid the possibility of its being captured by the enemy. They then spent three days wandering in the delta trying to avoid capture and to rejoin their ship. During this time they had little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> eat, and were continually obliged to swim across the creeks, the bush on the banks being impenetrable.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that on more than one occasion, the federal {{government}} has threatened to withhold highway funds from states which did not pass certain articles of legislation. Any state which lost highway funding for any extended period would face financial impoverishment, infrastructure collapse or both. Although the first such action (the enactment of a national speed limit) was directly related to highways and done {{in the face of a}} fuel shortage, most subsequent actions have had little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with highways and have not been done in the face of any compelling national crisis. An example of this would be the federally mandated drinking age of 21, upheld in South Dakota v. Dole. Critics of such actions feel that when the federal government does this they upset the traditional balance between the states and the federal government.|$|E

[...] The Boston Globe was less enthusiastic about the album; reviewer Steve Morse wrote, [...] "Most of Nevermind is packed with generic punk-pop that had been done by countless acts from Iggy Pop to the Red Hot Chili Peppers," [...] and added [...] "the band has little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say, settling for moronic ramblings by singer-lyricist Cobain." ...|$|E
500|$|The same disorganization, loss of control, and anarchy that befell I and II Corps now {{took place}} in Saigon, where martial law was imposed to control the chaos and lawlessness.

[...] On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little <b>or</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with political change. [...] One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the realitiy {{of economic and political}} power. [...] Another academic, Dana L.

[...] Peters saw a cover of National Geographic, containing a picture of a skull, going to art department workers, telling them he wanted the design for Brainiac's space ship to have the same image. Burton gave Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was [...] "a cone with a round ball on top, and something that looked like an emaciated skull inside. Imagine you take Merlin's hat, and you stick a fish bowl on top, with a skull in it."
