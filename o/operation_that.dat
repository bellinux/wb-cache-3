5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary <b>operation,</b> <b>that</b> is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, Augsburg {{spent her}} peacetime career {{first as a}} torpedo test ship {{and then as a}} gunnery {{training}} ship. After the outbreak of World War I, she was assigned to the Baltic Sea, where she spent the entire war. On 2 August 1914, she participated in an <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> saw the first shots of the war with Russia fired, and she later took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 and Operation Albion in October 1917, as well as numerous smaller engagements throughout the war. She struck a mine, once, in January 1915, though the ship was again operational in a few months. After the end of the war, Augsburg was ceded to Japan as a war prize, and was subsequently broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|After their commissioning, Kolberg, Mainz, and Cöln were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, part of the reconnaissance forces of the High Seas Fleet. Augsburg was instead used as a training ship for torpedo crews and gunnery. Cöln was assigned as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the II Scouting Group was deployed to a patrol line based on the island of Heligoland. Augsburg meanwhile was mobilized for active service and sent into the Baltic. There, she participated in an <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> saw the first shots of the war fired against the Russians, on 2 August.|$|E

5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from the airfield at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling the airfield several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
5|$|Between May 29 and June 2, the Israel Defense Forces {{constantly}} bombarded the Egyptians in Isdud with Napoleonchik cannons and Givati patrols harassed the Egyptian lines. The 51st Battalion was {{tasked with}} laying mines {{along the main}} road near Isdud, Yavne and Hill 69. The 3rd Company of the 53rd Battalion, commanded by Yosef Geva, was tasked with harassing the enemy lines, while the 1st Company of the 54th Battalion, commanded by Aryeh Kotzer, was ordered to assault several targets. In his book In the Fields of Philistia, Uri Avnery, {{who participated in the}} battles, wrote of the harassment <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> during those days the Egyptians were fearing an Israeli attack and were firing in all directions and launching flares in hopes of discovering their enemy.|$|E
5|$|Covert operations, however, {{were another}} matter. One {{result of the}} {{increasing}} PAVN road building effort in Cambodia was that the U.S. also upped the ante against the trail system in Laos by launching the first B-52 Stratofortress strike against the logistical system on 12 December 1965. In April 1967 the U.S. headquarters in Saigon finally received authorization to launch Daniel Boone, an intelligence gathering <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> conducted by the highly secret Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group or SOG.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{attempts}} {{to take the}} crippled Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff, the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned. A few minutes after 6:00am Szent István sank. Admiral Horthy, commander of the proposed attack, soon canceled the attack because {{he thought that the}} Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola. On the contrary, the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. This was the last military <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> the Viribus Unitis was to take part in and she spent the rest of her career at port in Pola.|$|E
5|$|Formed in July 1940, No. 6 Commando's first {{involvement}} in operations came in late 1941 when it contributed small forces to raids in Norway. In April 1942 the whole unit {{was scheduled to}} take part in Operation Myrmidon, in France, but this raid was eventually cancelled. As a result, the first full-scale <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> No. 6 Commando took part in was Operation Torch, the Allied landings in Algeria in November 1942. Later, it joined the advance into Tunisia in 1943. On 6 June 1944, it participated in the D-Day landings in France as part of Operation Overlord, coming ashore with the 1st Special Service Brigade which was tasked with linking up with the troops from the 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword.|$|E
5|$|French troops entered Korçë on November 29, 1916 {{during a}} {{military}} <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> aimed {{to connect the}} Allied front in Thessaloníki in the Macedonian front to the region in south Albania, which was held by the Italian troops. French troops in Korçë were under General Maurice Sarrail, and under direct command of Colonel Descoins. There were two groups of rebels active {{in the region of}} Korçë, one was led by Themistokli Gërmenji and another by Sali Butka. In the meantime, Albanian irregular bands, headed by Butka and cooperating with the Austrian forces, completely ravaged Moscopole, and threatened that if Korçë would suffer the same fate if it did not raise the Albanian flag and surrender to Albanian authorities.|$|E

While working for Lifemark, Scrushy moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he worked as the regional director of the respiratory therapy division. He then moved to Houston where he became the company's chief operating officer.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's old injury {{continued}} to trouble {{him and he}} found flying high performance aircraft like the Spitfire extremely painful. RAF medics gave him two options; he could have an <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> would correct the problem, but this meant he would miss the Battle of Britain, or becoming a training instructor flying the light Tiger Moth. Johnson opted for the operation. He had hoped for discreet treatment, but word soon reached the CO, and Johnson was taken off flying duties {{and sent to the}} RAF Hospital at Rauceby. He did not return to the squadron until 28 December 1940. CO Burton took Johnson up for a test flight on 31 December 1940 in Miles Magister L8151. After the 45-minute flight, Johnson's fitness to fly was approved.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5 {{is named}} so {{because it was}} the fifth planet-bearing star {{discovered}} {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA <b>operation</b> <b>that</b> seeks to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in front of, their host stars with respect to Earth. The star's planet, Kepler-5b, was the second of the first five planets to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets found by Kepler were used as tests, and had already been discovered. Kepler-5b was presented to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8.|$|E
