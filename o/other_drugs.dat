Summary This state of knowledge paper explores: 	{{the prevalence}} of sexual violence and alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use (AOD) in Australia; 	the association between alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use and severity of, or vulnerability to, sexual violence and re-victimisation; 	correlations between child sexual abuse and subsequent alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use, and adult sexual abuse and subsequent alcohol and <b>other</b> <b>drug</b> use; and 	current practice around identification, assessment, response and referral pathways between AOD and sexual assault services. The paper finds that despite methodological limitations in the literature, there is growing consensus that the sexual assault services sector and the AOD sector share {{a significant number of}} clients and that integrated or coordinated service provision is key. This work is part of the ANROWS Landscapes series. ANROWS Landscapes (State of knowledge papers) are medium length papers that scope current knowledge on an issue related to violence against women and their children. Papers will draw on empirical research, including research produced under ANROWS’s research program, and/or practice knowledge.  ...|$|R

Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for <b>other</b> <b>drugs.</b> Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E

Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act {{in the liver}} as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also a variety of <b>other</b> <b>drugs</b> and biologically active substances.
