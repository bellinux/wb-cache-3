5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to <b>office</b> <b>space</b> {{the building has}} seen other major work in the past. The southwest {{corner of the building}} was built in 1956, of cream colored brick, to house additional classrooms and <b>office</b> <b>space.</b> The addition of 1956 took special care to replicate nearly every aspect of the original building except for color.
