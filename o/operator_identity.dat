40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{origin of}} curvature and torsion {{is discussed in}} terms of commutators of covariant derivatives in the general manifold. Detailed proofs are given of the origin of the curvature and torsion tensors. A proof of the Jacobi <b>operator</b> <b>identity</b> is given and this identity is used to prove that the conventional second Bianchi identity is true if and only if torsion is zero, and if and only if accompanied by a novel <b>operator</b> <b>identity</b> neglected in the literature. Finally group theoretical considerations are used to prove {{that in the case of}} rotation, the Riemann and torsion tensors can be interpreted as group structure constants.
