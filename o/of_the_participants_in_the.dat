5|$|After {{being drafted}} to Raw {{as part of}} the 2016 WWE draft which took place on July 19, Fox made her first {{appearance}} for the brand on August 15, where she was defeated by Charlotte Flair. On the September 5 episode of Raw, Fox was involved in a backstage confrontation with Nia Jax, resulting in a match between the two on the September 12 episode of Raw, which would end in a no contest after Jax speared Fox through the ringside barricade. On September 25, a rematch took place at Clash of Champions, where Fox was defeated. After suffering a streak of losses, Fox scored a victory over Dana Brooke on the November 4 episode of Superstars. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Fox was announced as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 5-on-5 Traditional Survivor Series Women's Elimination match at Survivor Series from her brand's team, before winning a six-woman tag team match along with her fellow team partners. At the event on November 20, Fox's team emerged victorious after Bayley pinned Becky Lynch.|$|E
5|$|On April 19 on Raw, General Manager Eric Bischoff {{scheduled}} a World Heavyweight Championship match between Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels for the May 3 episode of Raw. On the same night, an impromptu team of Benoit and Edge defeated Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista) for the World Tag Team Championship, making Benoit a double champion. Two weeks later on Raw, Benoit retained the World Heavyweight title in a scheduled match against Shawn Michaels, after interference by Triple H. On May 10, a match between Shelton Benjamin and Triple H, resulted in Michaels attacking Triple H. Michaels' actions {{resulted in a}} suspension from Eric Bischoff. Prior to Raw that night, Bischoff informed Triple H that he would face Benoit for the World title the following week on Raw. The following week, Benoit defeated Triple H to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Also that night, a Battle Royal took place, in which the winner {{would go on to}} face Benoit at Bad Blood for the World title. During the match, Triple H, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match, was eliminated by Michaels, who was not a participant in the match.|$|E
5|$|Seeking information, Ken points Tommy towards Juan Garcia Cortez (Robert Davi), {{who helped}} set the {{exchange}} up. Expressing regret for the matter, Cortez promises to help Tommy {{find out who}} masterminded the ambush plot. In the process of finding leads, Tommy meets Kent Paul (Danny Dyer), who leads Tommy to one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ambush. Tommy then works for Ricardo Diaz (Luis Guzmán), who hires him as protection. Cortez soon voices his suspicion that Diaz might have organised the ambush. With the help of Lance Vance (Philip Michael Thomas), whose brother died in the ambush, Tommy kills Diaz; as a result, Tommy and Lance become Vice City's drug kingpins, allowing Tommy to create his own organisation and {{distance himself from the}} Forelli family. Tommy also works with the Cuban gang's leader Umberto Robina (Danny Trejo) in their fight against the Haitians. After destroying the Haitians' drug factory, Umberto becomes Tommy's partner in the drug trade. Tommy also earns the respect and friendship of Mitch Baker (Lee Majors), leader of a biker gang, whose bikers work alongside the Cubans to become protectors of Vercetti family business. Tommy also expands his empire by purchasing assets in nearly bankrupt companies and turning them back into competitive businesses.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{unprecedented}} security, {{more than a}} hundred anti-gay protesters tried to break up the pride parade. The protesters failed to penetrate through the police cordon and, after throwing stones and firecrackers at police, they were dispersed with teargas and around 100 of them were arrested.

25|$|Bicycles {{are popular}} targets for theft, {{due to their}} value and ease of resale. The number of {{bicycles}} stolen annually is difficult to quantify as {{a large number of}} crimes are not reported. Around 50% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Montreal International Journal of Sustainable Transportation survey were subjected to a bicycle theft in their lifetime as active cyclists. Most bicycles have serial numbers that can be recorded to verify identity in case of theft.|$|E
25|$|On 9 February 2014, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2013 Bulgarian {{protests against}} the Borisov cabinet rallied {{on the streets of}} Sofia and Plovdiv in {{commemoration}} of the events that took place in February 2013. While they did not call for a resignation of the Oresharski cabinet, the protesters expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of action taken by Oresharski (and Sofia mayor Yordanka Fandakova) against the monopoly companies, lamenting the lack of significant transformations in the economic realm in the 12 months {{since the end of the}} Borisov cabinet's tenure. The newly formed party Bulgaria without Censorship was among the main organizers of the citizen gatherings.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} {{put to the}} Court {{concerned the}} legality of a declaration of independence made by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, institutions whose powers were limited to those conferred under {{the framework of a}} United Nations Security Council Resolution. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proceedings had argued that those institutions had not made the declaration. Nonetheless, the Court determined that the declaration of independence was not issued by the Assembly of Kosovo or otherwise by Provisional Institutions of Self-Government or any other official body. Once this crucial determination was made, the question the Court had to answer no longer concerned any action of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, as the Court had determined that those institutions had not made the declaration of independence.|$|E

25|$|While the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) {{was a major}} {{beneficiary}} of the Arusha accords {{and was able to}} redress many of its grievances, many of the gains that it made could have been achieved through military action. Arusha, according to Clapham, affected the relative power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two following ways: a ceasfire which froze the distribution of territorial control at a particular point and secondly the importance it ascribed to the participants of the negotiations. Meaning that it froze the conflict and prevented continued territorial gains being made by the RPF, in addition to designating the degree of importance with regard to the factions within the negotiations. A faction's importance was weighted not on their relative popularity or military strength, but on artificial weight assigned by the mediators. Thus, the entire process served to undermine the RPF's position while stalling their hitherto successful military campaign, while allowing Hutu extremists to prepare for a genocide.|$|E
25|$|Cachorro, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening match came to {{the ring}} wearing a special wrestling mask, with half the mask being {{inspired}} by the blue/white design that his father Blue Panther originally wore {{and the other half}} a more ornate, black and white mask of his other partner Dragon Lee. Cachorro removed the mask before the actual match and wrestled wearing his regular designed mask. The tecnico team of Panther, Cachorro and Dragon Lee won the first fall when Blue Panther forced the rudo team captain El Felino to submit after applying a Standing figure four leglock, one of Blue Panther's signature moves known as El Nudo Lagunero ("The Lagoon Knot"). In the second fall of the match Puma pinned Cachorro, then Tiger pinned Blue Panther to even the match to one fall each, going to the third and deciding factor. In the third fall Cachorro forced Tiger to submit to an armbar followed by Dragon Lee pinning Puma to win the third and deciding fall for his side.|$|E
25|$|Lehi was {{forcibly}} disarmed {{and many}} members were arrested, but nobody {{was charged with}} the killings. The Israel Police, along with the military police and security services, investigated the assassination, but failed to identify any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assassination, and the case was eventually closed {{without any of the}} participants having been identified. It has been suggested that the reasons for the failure of the investigation were poor coordination between these bodies, which resulted in information that may have assisted the police not being turned over to them, and the lack of proficiency among police officers and investigators {{in the early days of}} the Israel Police. Yellin-Mor and another Lehi member, Mattityahu Shmulevitz, were charged with belonging to a terrorist organization. They were found guilty but immediately released and pardoned. Yellin-Mor had meanwhile been elected to the first Knesset. Years later, Cohen's role was uncovered by David Ben-Gurion's biographer Michael Bar Zohar, while Cohen was working as Ben-Gurion's personal bodyguard. The first public admission of Lehi's role in the killing was made on the anniversary of the assassination in 1977. The statute of limitations for the murder had expired in 1971.|$|E
