5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920. For the {{remainder}} of the inter-war years though, Villa were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 {{for the first time in}} their history. They returned to the top-tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War. As with many clubs, the war brought much change to Villa Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team. By 1957, Villa were a Cup winning side once again with the clubs seventh FA Cup win. Even though Villa won the inaugural League Cup in 1960, the club were to enter into a very unsuccessful period. The 1960s saw much change at Villa Park. By the end of the 1960s, Villa were languishing in the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>and</b> the introduction of Doug Ellis as Villa Chairman.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the total}} income from these {{projects}} the company continued {{to lose money}} and Jobs, as chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as Hallmark Cards, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, and Oracle CEO and co-founder Larry Ellison. Only after learning from New York critics that Toy Story {{would probably be a}} hit—and confirming that Disney would distribute it for the 1995 Christmas season—did he decide to give Pixar another chance. For the first time, he also took an active leadership role in the company and made himself CEO. Toy Story went on to gross more than $362million worldwide and, when Pixar held its initial public offering on November 29, 1995, it exceeded Netscape's as the biggest IPO of the year. In only its first half-hour of trading Pixar stock shot from $22 to $45, delaying trading because of un-matched buy orders. Shares climbed to $49 before closing the day at $39.|$|E

5|$|England toured Australia in the 1954–55 season. Johnson was {{selected}} to lead an Australian XI in a tour match against the Englishmen before the Tests, {{an indication of the}} selectors' inclination. He took 6/66 in England's only innings. The build-up featured a media war, with Melbourne newspapers stumping for Johnson while the Sydney journalists trumpeted Miller. Miller warmed up for the Tests with 86 for New South Wales against England. On 18 November, the Australian Board of Control selected Johnson as captain, with Morris as his deputy. Miller's irreverent nature was cited as a possible reason for the board's selection. Johnson was regarded as a superior diplomat, while Miller had a reputation for turning up late and being undisciplined. Miller had frequently been in dispute with Bradman, who was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> the chairman of selectors. Miller had also questioned where revenue that the board collected from ticket sales was being used. Others claimed that Johnson was appointed because {{he was part of the}} establishment; his father Bill was a former Australian selector. The decision was bitterly criticised by the Sydney press.|$|E
5|$|Håkan Jeppsson, CEO of Inwido, a Swedish {{company that}} sells windows and doors, was elected as the club's new {{chairman}} in February 2010. Jeppsson {{had previously been}} a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> vice-chairman during {{the last years of}} Madsen's time in charge. Jeppsson's first year as chairman proved to be markedly different from those directly preceding it, as the club won its 19th league title in November 2010. The championship was much celebrated by the club's fans because it coincided with the club's centenary, and also because Malmö FF clinched the title two points ahead of their local rivals Helsingborgs IF in the final standings. The second Swedish championship of Jeppssons chairmanship was won in the 2013 season where the title was secured in the penultimate round of the league. The club also won Svenska Supercupen {{for the first time in}} 2013 with a 3–2 win against rivals IFK Göteborg. In the following season Malmö FF won yet another league title and entered the group stage of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in the club's history.|$|E
5|$|In April 1888, the Church Board of Education {{was created}} {{as part of}} the LDS Church, {{inspired}} by a proposal made by Maeser in 1887. Maeser was made a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> was later appointed the superintendent of the Church Educational System. The Board of Education was created to maintain and supervise church schools. This position later became the Commissioner of Church Education. As Superintendent, Maeser helped establish initial policies for new academies established by the church. He also helped train teachers, and gave suggestions on the architecture of new school designs. By 1889, Maeser oversaw 19 schools that operated under the academy system. In 1889, Church Board of Education established a board of examiners to certify teachers. The board awarded Maeser a Doctor of Letters and Didactics degree that same year. Maeser also continued writing in the Juvenile Instructor in the 1890s to clarify church educational policies.|$|E

5|$|The Principal acts as {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of the university under the authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Board</b> <b>and</b> the Senate, and supervises and directs the academic and administrative work of the university and of its teaching and non-teaching staff. Since 1974, principals have been appointed for five-year terms, renewable subject to review.

Daniel Woolf has served as the twentieth principal, serving since 1 September 2009. The office of the vice-chancellor has typically been held by the incumbent principal. In 1961, an amendment was secured by the Board to separate the office of principal from vice-chancellor if it wished.
