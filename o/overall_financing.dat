50|$|The Islamic {{finance sector}} enjoyed {{increased}} activity in 2008 {{and is expected}} to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take the lion’s share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters of 2008, during which <b>overall</b> <b>financing</b> activity increased by 70.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. The global financial crisis slowed this growth though. Poor market conditions have contributed to a marked slowdown of Islamic bond, or sukuk, activity in 2008 throughout the Persian Gulf. But other segments, such as Islamic insurance, or takaful, have not seen a similar downturn. Overall, challenges to further growth remain, including a lack of qualified staff to meet the growing demand for sharia-compliant banking services.|$|E

Using data of Chilean exporting firms, this paper studies the effect of financial constraints on export growth {{in the aftermath of}} the crisis.

Two alternative measures are proposed that identify credit crises in the tails of bond yield distributions, which are derived from Extreme Value Theory and Value-at-Risk analysis. The findings show that the large-scale fluctuations in long term sovereign bond yields observed during episodes of financial distress signal a structural shift in cross-market linkages with respect to tranquil periods. All analyzed countries are vulnerable to shift-contagion and the estimated contagion effects are robust across the different measures of credit crises. The empirical results convey the policy implication that a new sovereign debt management mechanism ought to incorporate the risk of financial contagion, as it carries adverse effects on the <b>overall</b> <b>financing</b> constraints in the economy...|$|E

40|$|This article {{integrates}} {{the problem}} of designing corporate bankruptcy rules into a theory of optimal debt structure. We show that, in an optimal contracting framework with imperfect renegotiation, having multiple creditors increases a firm's debt capacity while increasing its incentives to default strategically. The optimal debt contract gives creditors claims that are jointly inconsistent in case of default. Bankruptcy rules are therefore {{a necessary part of}} the <b>overall</b> <b>financing</b> contract, to make claims consistent and to prevent a value-reducing run for the assets of the firm. We characterize these rules, with predictions about the allocation of security rights, the right to trigger bankruptcy, and the symmetry of treatment of creditors in default. The Author 2010.

We show that this cost saving use of internal capital markets {{is not limited to}} multinationals, but that domestic business groups actively optimize the internal/external debt mix across their subsidiaries as well. We use both subsidiary and group level financial statement data to model the bank and internal debt concentration of Belgian private business group affiliates and show that a pecking order of internal debt over bank debt at subsidiary level leads to a substantially lower bank debt concentration for group affiliates as compared to stand-alone companies. However, as the group’s overall debt level mounts, groups increasingly locate bank borrowing in subsidiaries with low costs of external financing (i. e. large subsidiaries with important collateralable assets) to limit moral hazard and dissipative costs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Which {{commercial}} bank supervisory policies ease – or complicate – the external financing obstacles faced by firms? Based on new data from almost 5, 000 corporations across 48 countries, this paper provides the first empirical {{assessment of the}} impact of bank supervision on firm financing obstacles. We find that countries with supervisory strategies focused on inducing banks to disclose accurate information to the private sector and strategies that do not reduce the incentives of private agent to monitor banks tend to lower the financing obstacles faced by firms and reduce the importance of corruption and special connections in raising external finance. Furthermore, countries with powerful supervisory agencies that have the authority to monitor, influence, and discipline banks directly tend to have firms that rely more on special connections and corruption to obtain bank finance and frequently face greater <b>overall</b> <b>financing</b> obstacles. Finally, we find that creating a supervisory agency that is independent of the government and banks mitigates these adverse consequences of powerful supervisory agencies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of the capital structure of parent subsidiary organizations based on legal-system arbitrage: The capital structure of parent subsidiary organizations is chosen to minimize the agency costs generated by selective renegotiation of claims written on the component legal entities. We show that optimal mixes of parent subsidiary level financing minimize the default premia associated with the organization's <b>overall</b> <b>financing</b> package by equating the marginal enforceability of debt contracts written at the parent and subsidiary level. The enforceability of creditor claims depends {{not only on the}} legal regime but also {{on the size of the}} debt claims and the liquidation value of the firm's assets. Small claims written under a weak creditor rights regime may be more enforceable than large claims written under a regime with strong creditor protection. Thus, all optimal mixes involve some borrowing at the subsidiary level even if the subsidiary legal regime features weaker creditor protection than the parent regime. However, the mix between parent and subsidiary financing tilts toward the regime that features stronger creditor protection...|$|E

40|$|This paper models {{the impact}} of {{information}} spillovers from publicly observable stock prices on the capital structure of a firm. In a dynamic setting, I show that firms would optimally issue more information-sensitive tradeable securities and bear the associated lemons cost, if the spillover from prices of these securities to other issuances minimizes <b>overall</b> <b>financing</b> costs. The current and future adverse selection costs of issuing an information-sensitive security would be offset by the increased endogenous information production in the securities market. This paper also provides evidence of information spillovers between equity and debt by examining borrowing costs of firm with and without public equity. Further, I find that {{the impact of}} trading in public securities on the capital structure of a firm, has implications for an optimal sequence of securities that a firm issues. Firms choose bank borrowing initially to minimize the lemons cost. Subsequently, when they meet the feasibility conditions for sustaining a market for their securities, they issue public equity (IPO) and then use either bank borrowing or bonds for subsequent financing rounds.
