25|$|Although {{nalbuphine}} possesses {{opioid antagonist}} activity, {{there is evidence}} that in nondependent patients it will not antagonize an <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesic</b> administered just before, concurrently, or just after an injection. Therefore, patients receiving an <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesic,</b> general anesthetics, phenothiazines, or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Nalbuphine may exhibit an additive effect. When such combined therapy is contemplated, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced.|$|E

From 1999 through 2006, {{the number of}} fatal poisonings {{involving}} <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> more than tripled from 4, 000 to 13, 800 deaths. <b>Opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> were involved in almost 40 % of all poisoning deaths in 2006.

In about one-half of the deaths involving <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics,</b> more than one type of drug was specified as contributing to the death, with benzodiazepines specified with <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> most frequently.

25|$|In chronic opioid users, such {{as those}} on Chronic <b>Opioid</b> <b>Analgesic</b> Therapy (COAT) for {{managing}} severe, chronic pain, behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study analysed COAT patients {{to determine whether they}} were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., Rey Complex Figure Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the WAIS-R Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It {{is important to note that}} this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on psychomotor, cognitive, or neuropsychological functioning.|$|E
25|$|Side effects such as {{hyperalgesia}} and allodynia, sometimes {{accompanied by}} a worsening of neuropathic pain, may be consequences of long-term treatment with opioid analgesics, especially when increasing tolerance has resulted in loss of efficacy and consequent progressive dose escalation over time. This appears to largely {{be a result of}} actions of opioid drugs at targets other than the three classic opioid receptors, including the nociceptin receptor, sigma receptor and Toll-like receptor 4, and can be counteracted in animal models by antagonists at these targets such as J-113,397, BD-1047 or (+)-naloxone respectively. No drugs are currently approved specifically for counteracting opioid-induced hyperalgesia in humans and in severe cases the only solution may be to discontinue use of opioid analgesics and replace them with non-opioid analgesic drugs. However, since individual sensitivity to the development of this side effect is highly dose dependent and may vary depending which <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesic</b> is used, many patients can avoid this side effect simply through dose reduction of the opioid drug (usually accompanied by the addition of a supplemental non-opioid analgesic), rotating between different opioid drugs, or by switching to a milder opioid with a mixed mode of action that also counteracts neuropathic pain, particularly tramadol or tapentadol.|$|E

40|$|Objective.

We asked PCPs to complete a questionnaire about all of their patients in their practice on the prevalence of chronic pain and illicit substance use, use of <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics,</b> confidence and satisfaction levels in treating chronic pain, and likelihood of prescribing <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> in response to clinical vignettes. Results. All PCPs cared {{for at least some}} patients with chronic pain, and the majority prescribed <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> for its treatment. All PCPs cared for at least some patients who used illicit substances. PCPs reported low confidence and satisfaction levels in treating chronic pain. The majority (73. 8 %) of PCPs were highly likely to prescribe <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> to a patient without a history of substance use who had chronic pain.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{association}} between benzodiazepine prescribing patterns including dose, type and dosing schedule {{and the risk of}} drug overdose death among US veterans receiving <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics.</b> DESIGN: Case-cohort study SETTING: Veterans Health Administration (VHA), 2004 through 2009. PARTICIPANTS: US veterans, primarily male, who received <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> between 2004 and 2009. All veterans who died of a drug overdose (n = 2, 400) while receiving <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> and a random sample of veterans (n = 420, 386) who received VHA medical services and <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> were included in the study. Main outcome measure: Drug overdose death, defined as any intentional, unintentional or indeterminate poisoning death caused by any medication or drug, determined by cause of death information from the National Death Index. RESULTS: Twenty seven percent of veterans who received <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics</b> also received benzodiazepines during the study period. Approximately half of the drug overdose deaths (n= 1, 185) occurred when veterans were concurrently prescribed benzodiazepines and opioids. Risk of drug overdose death increased based on benzodiazepine prescription history: formerly prescribed vs. not prescribed (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]= 2. 33, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 05 - 2. 64); currently prescribed vs. not prescribed (HR= 3. 86, CI: 3. 49 - 4. 26). Risk of drug overdose death increased as daily benzodiazepine dose increased. When compared to clonazepam, temazepam was associated with a decreased drug overdose death risk (HR= 0. 63, CI: 0. 48 - 0. 82). Benzodiazepine dosing schedule was not associated with drug overdose death risk. CONCLUSIONS: Among veterans receiving <b>opioid</b> <b>analgesics,</b> receipt of benzodiazepines was associated with an increased risk of drug overdose death in a dose-response fashion...|$|R
