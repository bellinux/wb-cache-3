Induced elastical deformation due to flatness error of the chuck causes strains and elongations in the wafer surface and therefore wafer distortions. The results obtained by exposure experiments and calculations show that even a point size defect has a 30 mm spreading.

This paper proposes the combination of a patterned expose beam and a patterned fluorescent marker on a wafer to generate a fluorescent signal that carries real-time information of the focus and/or position error of the expose pattern with the pattern on the wafer. A practical realization requires some changes to the exposure process, stepper design and reticle lay-out. Firstly, a matched pair of markers on the wafer and reticle is required. Secondly, the generated fluorescent signal must be measured, for example with a (spectrally filtered) photon counter close to the expose area of the wafer.

This requires lithography tools {{that are able to}} align a wafer to both its back side as front side. Overlay describes how well front and back side layers are positioned with respect to each other. Currently there is no simple and fast method to qualify the overlay. This paper covers a method of measuring the overlay between front- and back side patterns using a glass substrate. We describe the methods used, special process requirements and measurement data. The main advantages of the presented method are the simplicity of the concept and the need for only basic fab processing equipment. The substrate employed is re-usable and low cost. The results are as follows: 1. Glass wafers can be used to measure front to back side <b>overlay.</b> The <b>accuracy</b> of the proposed method is better than 100 nm (3 ?) on ASML PAS 5000 / 5200 machines. On ASML PAS 5500 steppers, the expected accuracy is better than 80 nm (3 ?). 2. The proposed method of measuring the absolute glass shift, from a glass-on-silicon stack, yields unreliable information. This is due to deformation of the glass. An alternative method is described which builds on result 1 (above). 3. Processing of glass wafers has been established, and a glass overlay measurement wafer has been defined. 4.

This technology was originally invented by Philips Research. With {{the implementation of the}} SCIL process on mask aligners, the standard alignment options of a mask aligner were also available for SCIL. This work presents studies on <b>overlay</b> alignment <b>accuracy</b> of the SCIL process on mask aligners. The utilized alignment markers were common box-in-box fiducials. With these structures, the alignment accuracy was determined. The experiments showed that the SCIL process induces a shift of the stamp with respect to the stage in imprint direction during the initial movement of the stamp from the SCIL actuator to the substrate. This shift is reproducible and depends on the distance between the actuator and the substrate. With an offset correction of the stage, this shift could be compensated. The achieved alignment accuracy was then below one micrometer, limited just by the mechanical capabilities of the mask aligner. Besides, global and local distortions of the imprinted structures with respect to the original master structures were identified and analyzed within this work. It was found that there is no systematic distortion of structures in the stamp due to the imprint process itself despite using the flexible composite SCIL stamps with polydimethylsiloxane pattern layer. Only nonsystematic local distortions could be found. Finally, the accuracy of the stamp manufacturing process for the SCIL stamps was investigated, and it was found that large distances in the centimeter range between single features are reproduced with a variation of 0. 06 ‰. All together, the results of this work show that an accurate and reproducible overlay alignment of imprinted lithography layers is possible using SCIL as a wafer scale imprint technology...|$|R

While considerable {{progress has been made in}} the "bottom-up" approach, the lithographic "top-down" approach remains the only way to encode human engineering effort, and to meet the optimal theoretical designs. Probably the most prominent example of lithographic fabrication is semiconductor manufacturing. However such manufacturing, aside from being extremely expensive, is highly inflexible, virtually excluding any work other than silicon microelectronic devices. Meanwhile, the miniaturization and integration of optical devices can potentially revolutionize the field of optics, with an impact that may prove comparable to the transition of electronics from vacuum tubes to transistors. To achieve high-level functionalities and to meet the stringent tolerance in optical information processing, multilayered structures with both minimum feature sizes and layer-to-layer <b>overlay</b> <b>accuracy</b> down to a few of nanometers are required, thus posing significant challenges in fabrication. Some requirements, such as nanometer-level spatial coherence, are beyond the capability of current semiconductor manufacturing. (cont.) As part of an effort to develop a low-cost, highly-flexible "nano-machine-shop", this thesis addresses the fabrication of 3 D photonic nanostructures. Low-cost planarization and high overlay-accuracy electron-beam lithography were developed to achieve seven functional layers in a new type of 3 D Photonic Crystal (PhC). For the first time, designed point defects were introduced in such a 3 D crystal, and optical measurement showed excellent agreement with numerical simulations. For a subset of 3 D structures, a new fabrication strategy was proposed and implemented, leading to the first demonstration of an on-chip, high-efficiency, and wide-bandwidth polarization splitter/rotator. A new type of lithography, Coherent Diffraction Lithography (CDL) was proposed and demonstrated to be effective in fabricating 3 D PhCs with high throughput, high resolution, large area coverage and potentially high <b>overlay</b> <b>accuracy.</b> When combined with tilted x- ray lithography, such fabrication can be extended to general 3 D periodic nanostructures.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of micro-optics fabrication most of the used technologies have been adapted from or are related to semiconductor fabrication techniques. These are widely known and the special microelectronics fabrication tools, especially lithography machines, are available at numerous places. Besides the fact that therefore micro-optics was able to {{took advantage of the}} steady development of semiconductor technology this tight linkage has also a lot of drawbacks. The adaptation of element properties to the fabrication limits given by the available technologies is very often connected with compromises in optical performance. In nowadays micro-optics fabrication has reached a level which justifies the development of fabrication tools specialized to its own demands. In the article the special demands of optical microstructures on the fabrication technologies are discussed and newly developed mico-optics fabrication tools are introduced. The first one is an electron-beam lithography machine for use with up substrates up to 300 mm large and 15 mm thick achieving a very high <b>overlay</b> <b>accuracy</b> and writing speed. The second one is a laser-lithography system capable to expose micro-optical structures onto non-planar substrates...|$|E
