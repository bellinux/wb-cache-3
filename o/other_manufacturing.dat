Additionally, the Fleet Air Arm has a station RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), the primary base of the Royal Navy's Westland Wildcat and Westland EH101 helicopters, several miles north of the town and the Ministry of Defence is a major local employer.

5|$|From {{the early}} 16th century, the {{establishment}} of a harbour at the East Burn confirmed the town's early role as an important trading port. The town also began to develop around the salt, coal mining and nail making industries. The production of linen which followed in 1672 was later instrumental in the introduction of floorcloth in 1847 by linen manufacturer, Michael Nairn. In 1877 this in turn contributed to linoleum, which became the town's most successful industry: Kirkcaldy was a world producer until well into the mid-1960s. The town expanded considerably in the 1950s and 1960s, though the decline of the linoleum industry and <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing</b> restricted its growth thereafter.|$|E

5|$|The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was {{a product}} of the Craigavon {{development}} when large tracts of land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and light engineering firms.

25|$|The {{difference}} in production costs between the Philippines and <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{countries such as}} China are a huge factor in {{the decline of the}} textile industry in the Philippines. A Manila based company selling materials and clothing to the Gap brand costs up to fifty cents more in production costs compared to if the garment was manufactured in China. Many of the former Filipino workers in the textile industry left to work in <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing</b> or service industries. Some workers decided to focus on making clothes, garments, and textiles for domestic markets, although the instability of these markets has weakened their potential income. As for supervisors and factory managers, some have found employment in other countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka where {{there is a need for}} supervisors and factory managers. Government initiatives such as the Save Our Industries Act offer potential solutions to the failing industry, such as sending American textiles to the Philippines and repurposing them as garments made from the Philippines, but also has many uncertainties as the bill lacks bipartisan support within the U.S. Congress.|$|E

25|$|Extrusion is {{a process}} used to create objects of a fixed {{cross-sectional}} profile. A material is pushed through a die of the desired cross-section. The two main advantages of this process over <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes are its ability to create very complex cross-sections, and to work materials that are brittle, because the material only encounters compressive and shear stresses. It also forms parts with an excellent surface finish.|$|E
