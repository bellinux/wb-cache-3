5|$|The {{publication}} of works on archaeology and art {{followed the same}} pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts describes Navarino (pp.1–7) with six pages <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of Nestor at Pylos); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road is detailed with four pages <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not so far from Arcadia); and finally three pages on Methoni and four pages <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that Hubert Robert had proposed for depictions of Greece.|$|E
5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement). It was revived, in somewhat modified form, in the 1980s, by Stephen Czerkas, based on the arrangement of iguana dorsal spines.|$|E
5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
30|$|Our study {{concludes that}} the final outcome is {{determined}} by using proper principles <b>of</b> <b>plating</b> {{and it is the}} proper application of the principles <b>of</b> <b>plating</b> and not the type <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> which decides outcomes and complications.|$|R
30|$|Here, we adopt a {{different}} approach: Based on the observations <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> motion, {{we attempt to}} find {{the relationship between the}} motions and the mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries. We begin with a toroidal–poloidal decomposition <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> motion, based on the latest plate configurations (Argus et al. 2011; Bird 2003), to capture the global features of the velocity field. Then, we examine the motions <b>of</b> individual <b>plates,</b> particularly their spin motions, which may determine the constraints on the strength <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries, using a force balance approach.|$|R

5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting {{in an increase in}} the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge.|$|E
5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips, at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E

5|$|In a 2010 {{review of}} Stegosaurus species, Peter Galton {{suggested}} that {{the arrangement of the}} plates on the back may have varied between species, and that the pattern <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> as viewed in profile may have been important for species recognition. Galton noted that the plates in S. stenops have been found articulated in two staggered rows, rather than paired. Fewer S. ungulatus plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine. However, the type specimen of S. ungulatus preserves two flattened spine-like plates from the tail that are nearly identical in shape and size, but are mirror images of each other, suggesting that at least these were arranged in pairs. Many of the plates are manifestly chiral and no two plates of the same size and shape have been found for an individual; however plates have been correlated between individuals. Well preserved integumentary impressions of the plates of Hesperosaurus show a smooth surface with long and parallel, shallow grooves. This indicates that the plates were covered in keratinous sheaths.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to taxonomic research, collections can provide information {{relevant to the}} study of variety of other ornithological questions, including comparative anatomy, ecology, behavior, disease, and conservation. Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes, imported materials containing bird parts, and birds killed through various human activities, legal and illegal. In addition, collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or species of origin for feathers used in human cultural artifacts. Collections also have been heavily used by artists, particularly for the production <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> for ornithological field guides. The close-up observation and opportunity for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them, together with field observations and photography, to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds. Most bird species have several unique plumages that distinguish immature from adults, males from females, and breeders from non-breeders. Thus, many different specimens may be required to produce a thorough plate for identification of a given species. Accurate colour measurements using spectrometry are possible from specimens.|$|E
5|$|Kentrosaurus {{was a small}} stegosaur. It had {{the typical}} dinosaurian body bauplan, characterised by a small head, a long neck, short forelimbs and long hindlimbs, and a long, {{horizontal}} and muscular tail. Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head, the powerful build of the forelimbs, erect and pillar-like hindlimbs and an array <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> and spikes running along {{both sides of the}} top mid-line of the animal. Only a single complete tooth was known when Hennig published his monography in 1925. Later, a part of a dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the front lower jaw, was found, which bears a just emerging tooth, and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones. The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus, albeit much smaller. Similarly, the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth, small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if trends were present in the longitudinal treatment <b>of</b> concepts <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics in introductory college-level physical geology textbooks. In addition, a method was designed to convey the structure of these concepts <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics by determining the location in the textbook where they occur. Eighteen textbooks were selected from the time period of 1975 through 2004. The total narrative area was determined by measuring the height and width of each column of text in each textbook. Individual concepts <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics were determined using the constant comparative method. Nine concepts were identified. The treatment of each concept was expressed as a concept's percentage of the textbook's total narrative area. The structure <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics in each textbook was determined by creating scatterplots and pie graphs of the location within the text and the area devoted to each concept. Furthermore, a measure of the structure of the textbook over the study period was determined by comparing the proportion of chapters containing concepts <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics with the publication date. A strong positive correlation (r=. 638) was found between the treatment of the theory <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics and the publication date of the textbook. This correlation was significant to the 0. 01 level. Two of the nine identified concepts <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics were also found to have significant correlations. Similarly, a strong positive correlation was found between the proportion of chapters containing concepts <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics and the publication date. Thus, concepts <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics are found in more chapters in textbooks published during the latter parts of the study period. A concern arising from this study is the treatment of the concept identified as "The evidence for and the development <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics. " This is the only identified concept <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics that showed a marked decrease during the study period. Furthermore, this concept corresponds with other studies that found many of America's textbooks reporting the end results of science while omitting the nature of science.

5|$|These were large, heavily built, herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, {{and tails}} held {{high in the}} air. Due to their {{distinctive}} combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with spikes, Stegosaurus {{is one of the}} most recognizable kinds of dinosaur. The function of this array <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spikes were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for thermoregulatory functions. Stegosaurus had a relatively low brain-to-body mass ratio. It had a short neck and a small head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, Stegosaurus ungulatus, is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as Kentrosaurus and Huayangosaurus).|$|E
5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> extending from head to tail, and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a ball and socket type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs. One temnospondyl, Peltobatrachus, has armour-like plating that covers both its back and underside. The temnospondyl Laidleria also has {{extensive}} plating on its back. Most {{members of the}} family Dissorophidae also have armor, although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows <b>of</b> <b>plates.</b> Other temnospondyls, such as Eryops, have been found with small, disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin. All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus. The scutes may have provided stability for the spine, as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments. Temnospondyls, such as Sclerothorax and Eryops, that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine. Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs, but unlike Peltobatrachus, Laidleria, Eryops, and dissorophids, these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic. Plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor, as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group.|$|E

40|$|Summary. An {{alternative}} vector derivation of {{the expression}} for the rates <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> creation and consumption is given, {{from which it}} can be seen that the rates are proportional to the scalar product of the edges of the geohedron and plate polyhedron corresponding to the same boundary. The plate polyhedron is defined by the set of triple junction vectors. This is used, together with a recent determination of the angular velocity vectors and a number <b>of</b> auxiliary <b>plate</b> boundary vectors, to revise the rates <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> creation and consumption along sections <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries. All plates which have a sub-stantial proportion of their boundary connected to a downgoing slab are found to be decreasing in area. The total rate <b>of</b> <b>plate</b> generation is used in estimates of the area of the ocean floor and the total heat loss from the oceans. The rate of consumption within a relatively small area around New Guinea implies a large mass flux away from this region.
