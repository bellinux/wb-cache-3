40|$|Research PaperOregon <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp</b> annual harvest {{relies on}} the {{successful}} recruitment and growth of age one shrimp. Changes in oceanic conditions appear to have major impacts on recruitment, spatial abundance and growth rates. Successful recruitment has been identified with the timing and strength of the spring transition generating oceanic conditions favorable for advection of shrimp to settling grounds. Similarly, changes in individual shrimp growth rates {{can be traced to}} decadal variability in Pacific environmental indicators. In turn, this environmental variability affects shrimp value as processors and markets seek larger and uniform shrimp. This paper examines how variable recruitment subject to environmental forcing influences the <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Pandalus jordani, fishery. Given the historical importance of this fishery to Oregon, opportunities to improve harvest value despite abundance variability are explored through alternative management strategies focusing on efficiency and stability. An optimization model analyses harvest strategies to achieve alternative sets of fishery objectives using a 22 -year environmentally driven recruitment index, a 22 -year commercial growth series, an ex-vessel size-price relationship, and fishery survey information. Environmentally driven and fishery driven stock recruitment are incorporated into the model to determine optimal dynamic seasonal and annual harvest patterns.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the endogenous, or internal, rhythms of activity in the <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Pandalus jordani, Groups of shrimp were kept in constant light and temperature conditions in the laboratory, and activity was monitored visually and with infrared photography. Other groups of animals were exposed to 24 -hour light-. dark cycles of blue-green light; the activity of these animals was recorded with infrared photography after the light cycle was terminated. It was found that shrimp not exposed to a light-dark cycle did not display any rhythms of activity in constant conditions in the laboratory. After exposure to the light cycle, some shrimp swam significantly more during the 'night" hours in constant conditions. These shrimp 'entrained" to the light cycle; they synchronized their activity with the periodicity of the light cycle, and retained the periodicity {{in the absence of the}} rhythmical light cues. The relationship of these results to the nocturnal vertical migration of <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp</b> in the field is discussed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Questions {{relating}} to economic performance, biological conservation and variation in resource abundance and harvest of <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{have led to}} increasing pressure for management action. Developing effective management policies for this highly variable resource requires a comprehensive understanding of the fishery and marine processes. Important factors in understanding the fishery include oceanographic influences on shrimp distribution, abundance, and fishery and market dynamics. Fishery regulations for Oregon <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Pandalus jordani, are designed to protect age one shrimp from overharvest and sustain long-term fishery benefits. The research presented in this dissertation describes the development and analysis of analytical models ranging from classical, biological based yield-per-recruit management approaches to optimization models that incorporate economic variables and environmental recruitment relationships. This research is composed of three separate but complimentary papers regarding management of the <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp</b> fishery. In the first paper, a yield-per-recruit analysis found that high natural mortality rates lead to yield maximization by selecting relatively young shrimp. The revenue-per-recruit analysis found that by delaying the season opening date, shrimp revenue would generate higher total revenues, while decreasing total fishing mortality and harvest. The second paper utilized a nonlinear optimization model with cost and market information to compare harvest strategies on fishery yield, gross revenue and discounted net present value (NPV). A key extension modeled a vertically integrated fishery from harvest through processing and compared harvest strategies based on wholesale prices, shrimp quality and processing yields. The optimization model that generated high yields exhibited high levels of effort and landings but low profits and NPV. The revenue policy maximization resulted in allocation of seasonal effort that produced high value older shrimp. NPV maximization generated high value shrimp landings with lower seasonal effort. Variability in shrimp recruitment and the impact on fishery utilization, income and efficiency was analyzed in the third paper. The optimization model that incorporated a stock recruit relationship and effects of environmental variables indicated an optimal harvest strategy that protects the spawning stock within a season and closes the fishery in years of poor recruitment. The results of this research highlight the complexity of management decisions when environmental forces and economic factors are jointly considered...|$|E

40|$|The Early Paleozoic geodynamic {{evolution}} in SW Iberia {{is believed to}} have been dominated by the opening of the Rheic Ocean. The Rheic Ocean is generally accepted to have resulted from the drift of peri-Gondwanan terranes such as Avalonia from the northern margin of Gondwana during Late Cambrian-Early Ordovician times. The closure of the Rheic Ocean was the final result of a continent-continent collision between Gondwana and Laurussia that produced the Variscan orogen. The Ossa-Morena Zone is a peri-Gondwana terrane, which preserves spread fragments of ophiolites - the Internal Ossa-Morena Zones Ophiolite Sequences (IOMZOS). The final patchwork of the IOMZOS shows a complete oceanic lithospheric sequence with geochemical characteristics similar to the ocean-floor basalts, without any orogenic fingerprint and/or crustal contamination. The IOMZOS were obducted and imbricated with high pressure lithologies.

For the two most common species, N. antarcticus and N. lanceopes, we used maximum entropy modelling, based on records of 60 specimens and over 1130 observations across 23 sites in depths from 269 m to 3433 m, to predict distributions in relation to environmental variables. Two independent sets of environmental data layers at 0. 05 ° and 0. 5 ° resolution respectively, showed how spatial resolution affected the model. Chorismus antarcticus and N. antarcticus were found only on the continental shelf and upper slopes, while N. lanceopes, Lebbeus n. sp., Dendrobranchiata, Petalidium sp., Pasiphaea cf. ledoyeri, and Pasiphaea scotiae were found on the slopes, seamounts and abyssal plain. The environmental variables that contributed most to models for N. antarcticus were depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, temperature, and salinity, and for N. lanceopes were depth, ice concentration, seabed slope/rugosity, and temperature. The relative ranking, but not the composition of these variables changed in models using different spatial resolutions, and the predicted extent of suitable habitat was smaller in models using the finer-scale environmental layers. Our modelling indicated that shrimps were widespread throughout the Ross Sea region and were thus likely to play important functional role in the ecosystem, and that the spatial resolution of data needs to be considered both in the use of species distribution models...|$|R
40|$|The {{ocean is}} one of Earth's most {{valuable}} natural resources. From regulating the climate to providing a source of food, the ocean has an interrelated economic, ecological and social importance. The economic, environmental and cultural history of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) are all intrinsically linked to the Atlantic Ocean and its resources. Protection of the coastal and ocean environments was not only important to the province’s past but is also widely recognized as vitally important {{for the future of}} the province. In June of 2011 the provincial Government of Newfoundland and Labrador introduced a Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework (Government of NL, 2011 a). The framework is designed to recognize the diversity of various stakeholders who rely on healthy coastal and ocean areas and to work together to provide long-term sustainable use of resources. One of the goals of the policy framework is to guide the coordination of provincial coastal and ocean policy in relation to priority issues identified for the province, with increased collaboration between governments, stakeholders, and communities (Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2010). This research paper asks the question: how might the province’s new coastal and oceans management strategy and policy framework be used to address major coastal and oceans problems? To answer this question, the paper applies the policy framework to an emerging crisis in one of the province’s most important fisheries – the northern shrimp fisheries. Despite fundamental social-ecological transformations in recent decades, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador continues to rely heavily on the ocean for the fishery resources it provides. Following the collapse of the cod fishery in 1992, and the subsequent moratoria on cod and other groundfish fisheries that put tens of thousands of people in the province out of work, many harvesters and processors in coastal communities in the province turned to increasingly lucrative and abundant crab and shrimp as a new means of income and industry (Foley et al. 2013). However, due to a number of reasons, including an increase in cod numbers and rising <b>ocean</b> temperatures, northern <b>shrimp</b> stocks are in decline (Lilly et al, 2000). This decline led the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), the federal agency responsible for fish allocations, to make cut backs on the shrimp quota in recent years. These quota reductions are impacting the inshore fishery, which supports the shore based and community-based processing plants where workers produce cooked and peeled shrimp, much more negatively than the offshore fishery, which produces frozen shell on shrimp onboard offshore vessels for sale into global markets (Keenan and Carruthers, 2015). The allocation of higher quota reductions in the inshore sector than the offshore sector in ocean areas close to the province has led to intense and highly 4 politicized disagreements and distraught feelings from local rural communities that depend on the fishery for their livelihoods. The purpose of this research paper is to apply the province’s Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework to the province’s northern shrimp fishery. The paper uses the framework as an analytical approach to explore potential ways to practically address and overcome the multi-faceted social, environmental, and political issues the province’s northern shrimp fishery, particularly the inshore sector, is currently facing. The policy framework is designed to address specific coastal and ocean issues, some of which can be related to the shrimp fishery. The issues are divided into six objectives: Healthy Marine Environments, Social, Cultural, and Economic Sustainability, Coastal Land Use, Competing Needs and Interests, Coastal and Marine Infrastructure, and Climate Change. This paper begins by examining the Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy that the province has developed to protect the ocean and coastline. This includes analyzing the goals, principles, tools, and departments involved in the strategy. Following this, the paper introduces the history and current issues facing the shrimp fishery in the province, specifically focusing on the decline in the resource and recent allocation changes and controversies. The policy framework is then applied to key issues in the fishery using some of the strategy objectives outlined above. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of how the NL Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework can be potentially applied to coastal management challenges, such as at the shrimp fishery, to promote solutions...|$|R

Sea cucumbers (unidentified Holothuroidea) and unidentified corals (Hydrocoralia) were observed at lightly trawled (LT) sites but not at HT sites. Hagfish (Eptatretus spp.) burrows were the dominant structural feature of the sediment surface at all sites and were more abundant at the HT sites (P< 0. 05), a result potentially related to effects from fishery discards. Substantial heterogeneity {{was found between the}} northern and southern site pairs, indicating high site-to-site variability in macroinvertebrate densities in these deep (146 – 156 m) mud habitats. Two of the study sites were closed to trawling in June 2006. The data from this study can be used in combination with future surveys to measure recovery rates of deep, mud, seaf loor habitats from the effects of trawling, thus providing a critical piece of information for ecosystem-based management...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{bottom trawl}} fishery for Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Pandalus jordani, or pink shrimp, operates mostly off {{the west coast}} of the contiguous United States. The California portion of the fishery has not been thoroughly documented or reviewed since the 1991 fishing season, despite its fluctuating more during the last 16 years (1992 – 2007) than at any other period in its 56 -year history. We used fishery-dependent data, California Department of Fish and Game commercial landing receipts and logbook data, to analyze trends and review the California pink shrimp trawl fishery from 1992 to 2007. In particular, we focus on the most recent years of the fishery (2001 – 07) to highlight the gear developments and key management measures implemented in the fishery. The fishery is primarily driven by market conditions and is highly regulated by both state and Federal management agencies. Several key regulatory measures implemented during this decade have had significant effects on the fishery. For example, the requirement of a Bycatch Reduction Device on trawl nets targeting pink shrimp was approved in 2001 and has greatly reduced levels of finfish bycatch. Fishery production has declined, particularly in recent years, and may be attributed to decreased market prices, followed by reduced fishermen participation; both of which are related to changes in the processing sector and demand for the product...|$|E

40|$|The Jinshajiang ophiolitic mélange zone in {{southwest}} China represents {{a remnant of}} the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean. Field, geochronological and geochemical studies have identified two distinct suites of plagiogranites within the mélange, the Dongzhulin trondhjemite and Jiyidu tonalite, which represent rift and subduction settings, respectively, related to opening and closing of the <b>ocean.</b> <b>SHRIMP</b> U-Pb analysis on zircons extracted from the Dongzhulin trondhjemite yields a mean 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 347 ± 7 Ma. REE and isotopic characteristics suggest an origin from low pressure partial melting of an amphibolitic protolith. Highly variable Hf isotopic compositions for zircons from this body may indicate a heterogenous source involving both depleted mantle and enriched continental components. This, together with geologic relations, suggests formation near an embryonic spreading center in a continent-ocean transition setting. The Jiyidu tonalite has a U-Pb zircon age of 283 ± 3 Ma, and geochemical data indicates high Sr/Y, (La/Yb) N, Nb/Ta and low Y, and marked heavy REE depletion. These signatures suggest derivation from low degree partial melting of subducted slab at pressure high enough to stabilize garnet and rutile. A slab-melt origin is also supported by in situ Hf and O data for zircon that show isotopic compositions comparable with typical altered oceanic crust. Thus, the crystallization age of the Jiyidu high Sr/Y tonalite provides a constraint for the subduction of the Jinshajiang ocean floor. The rift-related Dongzhulin trondhjemite and subduction-related Jiyidu high-Sr/Y tonalite constrain the timing and setting of opening and closing of this segment of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean...|$|E

40|$|The California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) has the {{authority}} to require one or any combination of Bycatch Reduction Device (BRD) types in the trawl fishery within California waters for Pacific <b>ocean</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Pandalus jordani), most commonly referred to as pink shrimp. The purpose of this report is to provide the Commission with the best available information about the BRDs used in the pink shrimp trawl fishery. The mandatory requirement for BRDs occurred in California in 2002, and in Oregon and Washington in 2003, resulting from an effort to minimize bycatch of overfished and quota managed groundfish species. Three types of BRDs currently satisfy the requirement for this device in the California fishery: 1) the Nordmøre grate (rigid-grate excluder); 2) soft-panel excluder; and 3) fisheye excluder; however, the design, specifications, and efficacy differ by BRD type. Although no data has been collected on BRDs directly from the California pink shrimp fishery, extensive research on the efficacy and differences among BRD types has been conducted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) since the mid- 1990 s. Rigid-grate excluders are widely considered to be the most effective of the three BRD types at reducing groundfish bycatch. Over 90 percent of the Oregon pink shrimp fleet use rigid-grate excluders. The majority of the current California pink shrimp fleet also uses rigid-grate excluders, according to a telephone survey conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game (Department) in 2007 - 2008 of pink shrimp fishermen who have been active in the California fishery in recent years. Hinged rigid-grate excluders have been developed in recent years to reduce the bending of the BRD on vessels that employ net reels to stow and deploy their trawl nets, and they have been used successfully on both single- and double-rig vessels in Oregon. Soft-panel excluders have been demonstrated to be effective at reducing groundfish bycatch, although excessive shrimp loss and other problems have also been associated with this design. Fisheye excluders have been used in the California fishery in the past, but they were disapproved in Oregon and Washington in 2003 because they were found to be less effective at reducing groundfish bycatch than other designs. The reputation of the United States west coast pink shrimp fishery as one of the cleanest shrimp fisheries in the world is largely attributed to the effectiveness of BRDs at reducing groundfish bycatch. Nevertheless, BRD research and development is still a relatively new field and additional modifications and methods may further reduce bycatch rates in the pink shrimp fishery.
