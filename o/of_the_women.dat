5|$|During the battle, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and {{children}} had {{gathered in the}} sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, {{thought to be the}} son of defender Anthony Wolf, stood up to rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, at least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> {{and children}} were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
