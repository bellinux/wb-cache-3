2500|$|In her {{scholarly}} monograph, Laurie Halse Anderson: Speaking in Tongues, Wendy J. Glenn {{claims that}} Speak [...] "has generated more academic response {{than any other}} novel Anderson has written." [...] Despite hesitancy to teach a novel with [...] "mature subject matter," [...] English teachers are implementing Speak in the classroom as a study of literary analysis, as well as tool to teach students about sexual harassment. The novel gives students the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> several teen issues, including: school cliques, sex, and parental relationships. Of teaching Speak in the classroom Jackett says, [...] "We have the opportunity as English teachers to have an enormously positive impact on students' lives. Having the courage to discuss the issues found in Speak {{is one way to}} do just that." [...] By sharing in Melinda's struggles, students may find their own voices and learn to cope with trauma and hardships. According to Janet Alsup, teaching Speak in the classroom, can help students become more critically literate. Students may not feel comfortable talking about their own experiences, but they are willing to talk about what happens to Melinda. Elaine O'Quinn claims that books like Speak allow students to explore inner dialogue. Speak provides an outlet for students to think critically about their world.|$|E

In early youth, Dame Debbitch had accidentally met with the son of her first patroness, and who had himself been her earliest charge, fishing in the little brook already noticed, which watered the valley in which she resided with Alice Bridgenorth. The dame's curiosity easily discovered who he was; and besides the interest which persons in her condition usually take in the young people who have been under their charge, she was delighted with the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> former times--about Martindale Castle, and friends there--about Sir Geoffrey and his good lady--and, now and then, about Lance Outram the park-keeper.|$|E

A racial literacy perspective framed our analysis of three small group conversations.

Four themes that relate to counselling processes were identified: <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the birth, develop an understanding of events, explore alternative courses of action, and discuss future childbearing.

There is considerable overlap between the views of these midwives regarding postpartum counselling processes and those identified in the literature, but also key areas of difference.

One source of my appreciation relates to the fact that this topic is rarely discussed explicitly in symposia organized by psychiatrists for non-psychiatrist physicians. A major reason for underemphasis of this subject is that psychiatrists are quite divided in their perspectives and opinions regarding normal behavior. Not surprisingly, we psychiatrists are much more comfortable when <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> non-psychiatrists <b>about</b> the nuances of maladaptation or of emotional illness...|$|R

40|$|Residential care {{facilities}} {{for the elderly}} have around half a million beds in the UK, {{are a source of}} a growing number of hospital admissions, often act as sentinels for wider disease outbreaks, and house a population with complex co-morbidities. Despite this the sector is relatively under-researched. Using case studies from care home work at BSMS, this interactive workshop will outline barriers to research and explore how they can be overcome to deliver publishable work with real-world impact. The workshop will include: what to expect when researching in care homes, how to successfully recruit in a sector with high levels of corporate reputational fear, the legal framework for researching in populations with impaired capacity, and the ethical tensions around studies in places that are both sites of care and peoples homes, often their last.

40|$|Background and purpose: Ten {{to fifteen}} per cent of new mothers suffer from {{postnatal}} depression. The {{purpose of this}} study is to increase our understanding about how to use conversation to alleviate these women’s suffering and help them to regain their health. Method: The article is based on a literature study of articles and publications gathered from the databases Medline and Cinahl. The results are interpreted in a caring science perspective, more specifically Katie Erikssons theories on health and suffering. The methodology is based on Gadamer’s hermeneutic philosophy. Results and conclusion: 1) The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as starting point and tool for conversation; 2) Using active listening and confirming skills; 3) Offer the woman <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> feelings and experiences. Being conscious of one’s own ethos yields the public health nurse courage and strength to relate to and confirm the women’s suffering giving them time and space to suffer to gain reconciliation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhenever we feel those ‘higher’ {{and hard}} to define sensations like synchronicity, love, wholeness, and {{appreciation}} is this a pattern or a metaphorical illuminative system {{that is part of}} a larger ecological network or evolutionary design meant to establish homeostasis within the planet? Meeting as groups in person, or posting online to an interactive website, adults track, record, and describe in layman's terms their everyday encounters with illumination. Illumination in this sense could encompass both spiritual and/or secular significance. Participants build data files of illuminative sensation recorded in video, text, sound bite, drawing, and/or journaling. This spatial and sensory awareness activity, initiating from an appreciative foundation, eventually leads to participantsconducting informal skillshares where adults teach to one another the strengths they possess when illuminated. Next adults collectively design new courses, programs, and products for their immediate community. A pilot study reveals that adults yearn for <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> illuminative moments with one another...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{whether the}} two recent Supreme Court affirmative action cases, the Michigan {{law school and}} undergraduate cases, Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v.

I shall argue that these recent affirmative action cases can provide some support for ensuring better representation {{of people of color}} in the jury selection process, challenging the pre-textual use of peremptories and opening <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> race during trials. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning in Grutter that diversity is a value that a law school can appropriately promote when it considers the admissions qualifications of candidates could lead the Court similarly to sustain limited race-conscious efforts to assure a process of inclusion in jury selection and in steps leading up to and including deliberation. Grutter opens the possibility for persons concerned about improving the justice system to be able to persuade courts to develop more effective ways to inlcude our richly diverse citizenry in the jury system...|$|R
