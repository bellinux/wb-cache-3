5|$|After {{signing the}} truce, Muhammad {{assembled}} an expedition against the Jewish <b>oasis</b> <b>of</b> Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (with letters) to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu'tah.|$|E

5|$|On April 13, 2017, NASA {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} possible hydrothermal activity on Enceladus' sub-surface ocean floor. In 2015, the Cassini probe made a close fly-by of Enceladus' south pole, flying within 48.3km (30mi) of the surface, {{as well as through}} a plume in the process. A mass spectrometer on the craft detected molecular hydrogen (H2) from the plume, and after months of analysis, the conclusion was made that the hydrogen was most likely the result of hydrothermal activity beneath the surface. It has been speculated that such activity could be a potential <b>oasis</b> <b>of</b> habitability.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{potential}} for tropical cyclone development, Météo-France declared yellow cyclone alerts for Guadeloupe and Martinique, warning of imminent squally weather. Due {{to the presence of}} Emily, a state of emergency was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until Emily had passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the expected increase in cargo traffic, the Port of Miami recently stated that October 2010 was its busiest October ever for cruise vacations. The port had a record 346,513 cruise passengers that October, up 29% from October 2009. This follows a record year in cruise traffic, with 4.15 million cruise passengers in the 12 months that ended in September. This is partially due {{to the arrival of}} new cruise ships such as the Norwegian Epic, as well as the cruise line Costa Cruises. Despite this, the Port of Miami has recently been losing cruise and cargo traffic to nearby Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale. In 2010, Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which is headquartered in Miami, chose Port Everglades as home for its new cruise ships, <b>Oasis</b> <b>of</b> the Seas and Allure of the Seas, currently the largest cruise ships in the world.|$|E
5|$|The deification of Macedonian monarchs perhaps {{began with}} the death of PhilipII, but it was his son Alexander the Great who {{unambiguously}} claimed to be a living god. Following his visit to the oracle of Didyma in 334BC that suggested his divinity, Alexander traveled to the Oracle of Zeus Ammon — the Greek equivalent of the Egyptian Amun-Ra — at the Siwa <b>Oasis</b> <b>of</b> the Libyan Desert in 332BC to confirm his divine status. Although the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires maintained ancestral cults and deified their rulers, kings were not worshiped in the Kingdom of Macedonia. While Zeus Ammon was known to the Greeks prior to Alexander's reign, particularly at the Greek colony of Cyrene, Libya, Alexander was the first Macedonian monarch to patronize Egyptian, Persian, and Babylonian priesthoods and deities, strengthening the fusion of Near Eastern and Greek religious beliefs. After his reign, the cult of Isis gradually spread throughout the Hellenistic and Roman world, while beliefs in the Egyptian god Sarapis were thoroughly Hellenized by the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt before the spread of his cult to Macedonia and the Aegean region. The German historian Johann Gustav Droysen argued that the conquests of Alexander the Great and creation of the Hellenistic world allowed for the growth and establishment of Christianity in the Roman era.|$|E

40|$|Background: Obstetric anal {{sphincter}} injuries (OASIS) {{can cause}} an adverse impact on women′s {{physical and mental}} health. There was lack of published data in Chinese population particularly on studying the risk <b>of</b> <b>OASIS</b> for nonrotational outlet forceps. This {{study was to determine}} the incidence and risk factors <b>of</b> <b>OASIS.</b> Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study carried out in a tertiary referral hospital in Hong Kong. The control group was selected randomly. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of potential risk factors on OASIS. This study reviewed the obstetric records <b>of</b> <b>OASIS</b> women and random control from January 2011 to June 2014. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of potential risk factors on <b>OASIS.</b> Results: <b>Of</b> 15, 446 women delivered, 49 had <b>OASIS.</b> The percentage <b>of</b> <b>OASIS</b> increased from 0. 3 % (2011) to 0. 38 % (2014). There was an increasing trend <b>of</b> <b>OASIS</b> in attempted spontaneous vaginal delivery without episiotomy (P < 0. 01), but it did not increase the OASIS risk (P = 0. 46). Univariate analysis of 49 cases and 438 control subjects showed that forceps delivery (odds ratio [OR] = 8. 73, P < 0. 01), prolong second stage of labor (OR = 1. 43, P < 0. 01) increased the risk for OASIS. In multivariate regression models, only forceps delivery (OR = 6. 28, P < 0. 01) proved to be independent risk factor. Conclusions: The incidence <b>of</b> <b>OASIS</b> in Chinese women was increased after 2012, but still lower than the reported figures in the literature. Outlet forceps delivery could be a possible associated risk factor...|$|R
