Convinced that someone impersonated him, Phoenix secures a retrial and conducts his own investigation. He discovers that Elg was developing a computer virus on behalf <b>of</b> <b>loan</b> shark Furio Tigre, and that Tigre, needing money to repay a large debt, killed him to steal it, then arranged for Maggey to take the fall. With no conclusive evidence, Phoenix manages to get Tigre arrested by making him say something only the real killer would know.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilizes empirical {{methods to}} shed light on the current debate over whether to adopt fair value accounting for loans held for long term. Proponents <b>of</b> fair valuing <b>loans</b> argue that reporting loans at their fair values enhances the overall transparency of financial reporting. In contrast, opponents are against applying fair value accounting to loans because fair values cannot be measured reliably in the case <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> held for long term. Therefore, the key question here is whether loan fair values are sufficiently reliable to provide more relevant and transparent information compared to traditional measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> To explore this, I compare fair value disclosures <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> under Statement <b>of</b> Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107), Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, with traditional measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> reported on balance sheets. More specifically, this study asks two research questions; (i) whether loan fair values provide more relevant information about future loan losses compared to traditional measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> and (ii) whether banks intentionally manage their fair value estimates <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> when they are financially distressed. SFAS 107 mandates the disclosure of fair values for financial instruments with the objective of providing investors with more relevant information about firms' future cash flows. However, the results show that fair value measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> explained variation in future loan losses, which capture cash flows from loans, less than traditional cost-based measurements <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> In addition, I find evidence suggesting that financially distressed banks overstated the fair values <b>of</b> their <b>loan</b> portfolios and that fair values <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> in the aggregate lagged considerably behind the market values <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> during the recent credit crisis. Overall, my results suggest that fair value disclosures in bank loan portfolios contain relatively less information about future cash flows because they are measured unreliably and they suffer from a similar lack of timeliness as reported carrying values...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary: Not for {{circulation}} This paper {{examines the}} informational efficiency <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> relative to bonds surrounding loan default dates and bond default dates. We examine this issue using a unique dataset of daily secondary market prices <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> over the 11 / 1999 - 06 / 2002 period. We find evidence {{consistent with a}} monitoring role <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> First, consistent with a view that the monitoring role <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> should be reflected in more precise expectations embedded in loan prices, {{we find that the}} price reaction <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> is less adverse than that <b>of</b> bonds around <b>loan</b> and bond default dates. Second, we find evidence that the difference in price reaction <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> versus bonds is amplified around loan default dates that are not preceded by a bond default date of the same company. Finally, we find a higher recovery rate for loans as compared to bonds, suggesting that the monitoring role <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> does not diminish significantly in the post default period. Our results are robust to controlling for security-specific characteristics, such as seniority, and collateral, and for multiple measures of cumulative abnormal returns around default dates. Overall, we find that the loan market is informationally more efficient than the bond market around default dates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: At {{the macro}} level, the time-series of the amounts <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> granted (a flow) and repaid (a flow) to {{the banking system}} in each period are not available. The {{information}} on these flows is important in many analyses, such as {{the impact of the}} bank lending on investment outlays. However, one can get the information concerning the structure <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> (a stock variable) regarding their duration. In each period, the loans are granted for different periods: from overnight ones to those lasting several years. The effective preferences of the credit takers are reflected in the term distribution <b>of</b> the outstanding <b>loans.</b> In order to estimate these flows, a model aimed at linking the above-mentioned preferences, the levels <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> and flows has been developed. In the approach proposed, the amount <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> outstanding is a resultant of the rate <b>of</b> the new <b>loans</b> and their duration, which in turn {{is the result of the}} term preferences.
