5|$|Roman {{literature}} focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> {{habits of}} the upper classes, for whom the evening meal (cena) had important social functions. Guests were entertained in a finely decorated dining room (triclinium), often {{with a view of}} the peristyle garden. Diners lounged on couches, leaning on the left elbow. By the late Republic, if not earlier, women dined, reclined, and drank wine along with men.|$|E
5|$|FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Terry Lake (Sabrina Lloyd) and David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) {{investigate}} a serial rapist who has begun killing his victims. With the twelfth victim, Karen Silber (Kate Norby), changing her story {{again and the}} thirteenth victim's car missing, Don runs out of viable leads. Taking a map and a case file with him, Don goes to his childhood home, owned by his father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), to take a shower. Don's younger brother, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) of CalSci's mathematics department, finds and studies the map which Don lays <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room table. As Don prepares {{to return to the}} office, Charlie tries to talk Don into letting him help with the investigation and is inspired by the pattern of drops emanating from the family's sprinkler. He tells Don that he can use a mathematical model to find the neighborhood where the rapist resides. Skeptical, Don agrees to let Charlie assist him in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th {{floor with}} oak paneling, {{and an old}} English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was {{connected}} to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliques in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the roof, and a mural of Manhattan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was a reference for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private dining rooms. The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.|$|E

She has ladylike pastimes: needlepoint, cake decorating, and arranging tea roses. She reads glossy but high-toned, tasteful women's magazines.

25|$|During the Cuban {{missile crisis}} in 1962, the {{families}} of military personnel were evacuated from the base. Notified of the evacuation on 22 October, evacuees were told to pack one suitcase per family member, to bring evacuation and immunization cards, to tie pets in the yard, to leave {{the keys to the}} house <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table, and to wait {{in front of the house}} for buses. Dependents traveled to the airfield for flights to the United States, or to ports for passage aboard evacuation ships. After the crisis was resolved, family members were allowed to return to the base in December 1962.|$|E
25|$|Above all, Emily {{loved to}} wander about the wild {{landscape}} of the moors around Haworth. In September 1848 her health began to decline rapidly. Consumptive, but refusing all treatment, {{with the exception of}} a visit from a London doctor – because although it was already too late, her relatives insisted. Despite popular belief, Emily did not die <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room sofa. There is no contemporary evidence for the story and Charlotte, in her letter to William Smith Williams, mentions Emily's dog Keeper lying at the side of her dying-bed. It is possible that she left an unfinished manuscript which Charlotte burned to avoid such controversy as followed the publication of Wuthering Heights. Several documents exist that allude to the possibility, although no proof corroborating this suggestion has ever been found.|$|E

25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar on his chin (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E
500|$|Schwa has {{received}} positive reviews from the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, Frommer's, and GQ, among others. [...] In 2006, Phil Vettel of the Chicago Tribune described the food as four-star quality, while giving the restaurant an overall rating of three stars (out of four) because of below-average service. Vettel added that nearly every {{item on the}} menu is [...] "wonderful". Vettel returned to Schwa after the 2008 relaunch and concluded [...] "Schwa {{is at least as}} good as it was in its early days, and probably better". [...] He credited Carlson's increased focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room for the improvement, and maintained Schwa's three-star rating.|$|E

500|$|After Schwa closed, {{about ten}} {{different}} Chicago restaurant owners {{offered to help}} Carlson get back on his feet. Carlson declined their help, but reopened Schwa four months later in mid-February 2008, {{thanks in part to}} a cash infusion from his father. [...] He hired an additional chef, allowing him to focus more of his attention <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room. The menu was redone, with only the three most popular dishes – the quail egg ravioli, the jellyfish pad Thai, and the [...] "pine cone" [...] dessert – returning. [...] The decor was also tweaked. [...] Customers with old, unfulfilled reservations were given the opportunity to try the new Schwa before new reservations were accepted.|$|E

2500|$|Dining {{etiquette}} in Korea can {{be traced}} back to the Confucian philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks, such as Sasojeol (士小節, Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (이덕무; 李德懋), comment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as [...] "when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it", [...] "when you are having a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or diarrhea," [...] "when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone else's food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound", amongst many other recommendations which emphasized proper table etiquette.|$|E

In the house, investigators found a trail of blood with scattered teeth. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room table was Mrs. Starks' work for making a dress. Gonzaullas, after seeing the [...] "virtual river of blood", stated that [...] "It is beyond me why she did not bleed to death." [...] There were only two bullet holes in the window, leading Sheriff Davis to believe an automatic rifle was used. Investigators declared that after the killer shot Virgil, he waited patiently outside the window to shoot the wife.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Greeks {{as a whole}} {{stressed}} the austerity of their own diet.
