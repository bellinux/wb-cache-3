40|$|High levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> {{present a}} {{formidable}} challenge among homeless ex-offenders. This cross-sectional study assessed correlates of high levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> using baseline data collected on recently-released male parolees (n = 472; age 18 - 60) {{participating in a}} randomized trial focused on prevention of illicit drug use and recidivism. Predictors of high levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> included greater depressive symptomatology, lower self-esteem, having a mother who was treated for alcohol/drugs, belonging to a gang, more tangible support, having used methamphetamine and having a history of cognitive difficulties. These findings highlight the need to understand predictors <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> among recently released homeless men and how these predictors may relate to recidivism. Research im plications are discussed, as these findings will shape future nurse-led harm reduction and community-based interventions. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

The results were seen to support Freud's and Bibring's theories concerning amount and direction <b>of</b> <b>hostility.</b> Rotter's internal-external control hypothesis could not be demonstrated. Nor did family feelings in childhood contribute to Bibring's theory of helplessness. The Family Relations Test was not able to distinguish between family relations of depressives and non- depressives...|$|R

40|$|The current seminar paper {{describes}} {{the psychometric properties}} of a new measure <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> and reports on the measurement <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> <b>of</b> people in different age groups. The sample consisted of 467 participants (mean age = 17. 4, SD = 5. 46) most of whom were schoolchildren. The self-report measure which consists of 18 items was therefore carried out in various schools in Estonia. Factor analysis extracted two factors, distrust and active negativne attidude towards others, which are the two subclasses <b>of</b> <b>hostility.</b> The results indicate that the scale has relatively high internal consistency reliability (α =. 88) and acceptable test-retest reliability (r =. 71). No gender differences were found in the sample, but the results revealed that with the increase in age there is a decrease in the level <b>of</b> <b>hostility.</b> Although the scale is reliable and it is easy to administer, it may still need some work to improve its construct validity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether hostility is differen-tially related to measures of glucose metabolism in African-Americans and Caucasians. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — The relationship <b>of</b> <b>hostility,</b> as measured by a subset <b>of</b> the Cook-Medley <b>hostility</b> scale (CMHOST) inventory items, to various parameters of glucose metabolism were examined in a young, healthy sample of male and female African-American and Caucasian volunteers. Fasting blood samples were collected during an inpatient admission, at which time the CMHOST was also administered. RESULTS — In the entire sample, the CMHOST was found to be significantly correlated with fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity, as measured by the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). However, the relationship <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> to these parameters of glucose metabolism was different in African-American and Caucasian subjects. Hostility was significantly related to fasting glucose in African-Americans and to insulin sensitivity and fasting insulin in Caucasian subjects. The relationship <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> to insulin sensitivity and fasting insulin was partially dependent on BMI in Caucasians, but the relationship <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> to fasting glucose was unre-lated to BMI in African-Americans...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether {{initially}} low levels of support behaviors observed among cohabitating and married African American couples significantly predicted higher levels of negative behaviors (specifically hostility) in their interactions two years later. In addition, the analyses examined whether these later levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> predicted relationship satisfaction over time. That is, did supportive behaviors serve a protective function in terms of their impact on the longitudinal course of marriage and cohabitation? The results of the structural equation modeling analyses provided some support for these hypotheses, as the level of initial support behaviors displayed by the female partner was a marginally significant predictor of her level <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> at Wave 2 but not his later level of hostility; as her level of initial support increased, her level <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> at a later time point decreased. In addition, level <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> displayed by the male partner at Wave 2 was a marginally significant predictor of his relationship satisfaction, with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>hostility</b> at Wave 2 significantly predicting lower relationship satisfaction at Wave 2. The results of the current study indicate significant contributions of support to relationship functioning and demonstrate potential gender differences in the role of support on later communication behaviors and relationship satisfaction...|$|R
