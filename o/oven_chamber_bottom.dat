In this study the deposits originating from different parts of chambers have been characterised by chemical analysis, optical microscopy, XRD, Raman spectroscopy and mercury porosimetry. This investigation has shown that deposits contain two carbonaceous phases: the char from pyrolysed carry over coal particles and the pyrolytic carbon from raw gas cracking. Furthermore, the monitoring method for carbon deposits growth in coke <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> is presented. The statistical analysis of the visual inspection data has been a useful tool in the evaluation of the rate of deposit growth in individual coke <b>oven</b> <b>chambers.</b> The combustion kinetics of carbon deposits were studied by thermogravimetry under non-isothermal conditions with natural air draft and under isothermal conditions at controlled air flow rate. It was found that the reactivity of carbon deposits is in-between metallurgical coke and electrographite reactivity. At the temperatures below 700 degrees C, under laboratory conditions, the combustion rate (on the basis of external surface) is controlled by surface reaction at higher temperature and activation energy is around is 170 kJ/mol. At temperature higher than 700 degrees C combustion is controlled by gas film diffusion. Modelling of combustion in thermobalance experiments and in industrial coke <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> was carried out on the basis of measurement of kinetics using commercial CFD software...|$|R
40|$|Unlike regular TLD, an {{accurate}} and consistent annealing of the high-sensitivity TLD at 240 ˚C for 15 minutes is challenging using conventional annealing ovens because {{the temperature in}} the <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> varies drastically over the 15 -minute period after the opening (to put the TLD tray in) and closing of oven door. The temperature in the oven drops dramatically after the door is opened and ramps up gradually after the door is closed, often accompanied with significant temperature overshoot. Because an overshoot by more than 5 ˚C can significantly reduce the sensitivity of the TLD and the ramp-up profile varies with the duration of door opening, the goal of this project was to build a heat reservoir in the <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> to provide more stable annealing temperature to the TLDs. A heat reservoir was designed and manufactured. A LabView interface was written for accurate and efficient monitoring of {{the temperature in the}} <b>oven</b> <b>chamber,</b> the heat reservoir, and the TLD annealing tray. The temperature profile in the <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> was fully characterized for various conditions. Complete temperature profiles of the TLD annealing tray over the entire annealing process were measured and used to optimize the oven temperature settings. A successful and consistent annealing of high-sensitivity TLDs was carried out, which enabled the experimental tests of high-sensitivity TLDs for dosimetric characterization of low-energy brachytherapy sources. This thesis will review the theory of TLD dosimetry and summarize the experimental characterizations of thermal annealing of the high-sensitivity TLDs using a novel custom-built thermal reservoir...|$|R

This study is aimed at evaluating the features of the finished product leaving the <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> using the Design of Experiments technique. Four features of the product like “water activity”, “humidity”, “pH” and “sensorial judge” have been explained as functions of independent variables: recipe of the dough, affecting the dough strength and cooking process parameters, such as time, temperature and <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> configuration. A two-level, complete four-factor design has been used to carry out the experiments; consequently the analysis of variance has pointed out the effects of main factors and some of their interaction effects; multiple regression analysis was also carried out to explain the variability and to predict the process. The model can be profitably adopted in order to adjust the cooking process parameters in accordance to the dough recipe or the boundary cooking conditions.

40|$|Within stamp-charged coke {{making a}} {{large volume of}} coal is {{compacted}} to one single coal cake before entering the coke <b>oven</b> <b>chamber.</b> This is done by means of several falling stampers in a stamping machine having a mould nearly of the oven’s dimensions. Producing a high quality coke also from inferior coals requires a cake density of approximately 80 % of the coal density. Besides that the industrial stamp-charging process demands a minimum mechanical strength of the coal cake to move it from the stamping mould into the <b>oven</b> <b>chamber</b> without failure. Densification and the build up of cake strength were investigated earlier in stamping tests using a micro-stamping device [1 - 2]. The quantities derived from these tests (as e. g. cake density or porosity) represent average values for the entire cake. Statements describing the local compaction state at different heights are difficult to achieve without destructing the cake. In order to gain better insight into the densification process and the inner structure of the coal cake a computational model based on the discrete element method, DEM, {{has been set up}} using 2 and 3 -dimensional simulation software. The stamper’s position and velocity as well as the force acting on the stamper were monitored and the model’s response was compared against measurement data from laboratory stamping tests. It was possible to reproduce the force and displacement pattern of the stamper in response to the visco-elastic properties of the cake using standard DEM bonding and contact models. Furthermore, the rearrangement of particles in response to the compaction by the stamper was tracked by calculating their displacement at the point the stamper hit the coal surface. The latter can also be used as indicators of particle deformation or breakage. By defining control points at different heights the particle displacement, stress and strain rates, porosity could be studied at different heights. Godkänd; 2012; 20121214 (andbra...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{compared}} capacitance and amperometric measurements in bovine chromaffin cells when secretion was elicited by flash photolysis of caged-calcium or step depolarizations. Total amperometric charge depended linearly {{on the amount}} of capacitance increase in both types of experiments. Furthermore, the properties of resolvable amperometric spikes after flashes were comparable to those observed after depolarizations, and their timing was compatible with the rate of capacitance increase. For a more detailed comparison, we used Monte Carlo simulations of multiple amperometric events occurring randomly over the surface of a sphere and summing together, to generate a reference amperometric signal for a given measured capacitance increase. Even after correction for endocytotic processes, the time courses of the integrated experimental records lagged behind the integrated Monte Carlo records by ∼ 50 ms in flash and depolarization experiments. This delay was larger by ∼ 40 ms than what can be expected from the “pre-foot delay” or the foot duration. Possible sources for the remaining delay could be diffusional barriers like the patch-pipette and the <b>chamber</b> <b>bottom,</b> which are not taken into account in the model. We also applied a novel type of fluctuation analysis to estimate the relative quantum size of an amperometric event. On average the estimates from experimental amperometric traces, in both flash and depolarization experiments, were 3 – 5 times smaller than estimates from simulated ones. This discrepancy can be due to contributions to the amperometric current from small vesicles, preferred release from cellular regions orientated toward the <b>chamber</b> <b>bottom,</b> or abundance of “foot-only” events. In conclusion, amperometric signals in flash and depolarization experiments displayed similar delayed average time courses and a lower estimate for the relative quantum size compared to the modeled amperometric signals. However, individual amperometric spikes were in agreement with expectations derived from capacitance signals...|$|R
