40|$|In {{the first}} part of the paper we <b>give</b> some <b>bounds</b> for domains where the unitarizabile subquotients can show up in the parabolically induced {{representations}} of classical p-adic groups. Roughly, it can show up only if the central character of the inducing irreducible cuspidal representation is dominated in an appropriate way by the square root of the modular character of minimal parabolic subgroup. For representations supported by fixed parabolic subgroup, a more precise <b>bound</b> is <b>given.</b> <b>There</b> are also <b>bounds</b> for specific Bernstein components. A number of these upper bounds are best possible. The second part of the paper addresses a question how far is the trivial representation from the rest of the unramified automorphic dual. By a result of L. Clozel, trivial representation is isolated in the automorphic dual of a split rank one semisimple group over a completion of a global field, but it is very seldom isolated in the unitary dual (it can happen only in the archimedes cases). Further, the level of isolation in the case of SL(2) is important for the number theory. For the higher rank groups, the trivial representation is always isolated in the unitary dual by an old result of D. Kazhdan. Still, we may ask if the level of isolation is higher in the case of the automorphic duals. We show that the answer is negative to this question for symplectic p-adic groups. Comment: 28 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{important}} task of belief updating in Bayesian Networks is hard. Therefore, exact algorithms are not practical for very large networks. Many approximate {{methods have been}} proposed e. g. {{based on the idea}} of sampling or Pearl's belief propagation [WMJ 99]. In particular, the recently proposed Iterative Join-Graph Propagation (IJGP) [DKM 03] algorithm has shown to be competitive. Is it an anytime algorithm that applies Iterative Belief Propagation (IBP) to bounded Join-Graphs, increasing the bound in each iteration. For any Bayesian Network and a <b>given</b> <b>bound</b> <b>there</b> are many possible bounded Join-Graphs and many ways to compute one of them. We investigate one possible method for creating a bounded Join-Graph. In this method the Dual Graph serves as a starting point and is gradually refined by clustering nodes together and removing superfluous arcs and labels. The goal is to create an arc-minimal, minimally labeled join graph which has clusters of maximum size (constrained by the bound). We show that using the two refinement steps (clustering and removal of superfluous arcs/labels) many different such graphs can be constructed that vary in accuracy by orders of magnitude and in their cost.
