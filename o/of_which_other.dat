5|$|Third class {{funerals}} were {{reserved for}} pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense {{in the section}} of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site. (The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>other</b> than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor.|$|E

500|$|The London Necropolis Company offered {{three classes}} of funerals. A first class funeral allowed the person buying the funeral {{to select the}} grave site of their choice {{anywhere}} in the cemetery; {{at the time of}} opening, first class prices began at £210s (about £ in [...] terms) for a basic [...] plot with no special coffin specifications. It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral. Second class funerals cost £1 (about £ in [...] terms) and allowed some control over the burial location. The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings (about £ in [...] terms); if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re-use the grave in future. Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish. Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves (other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased, third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site.

Brookwood {{was one of the few}} cemeteries to permit burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rail}} {{preservation}} movement {{well under way}} by the late 1960s, many ex-VR locomotives were sold to local councils for display in municipal parks or near railway stations. [...] The K had a further advantage over other classes in this respect: because VR offered the locomotives {{for the price of}} their scrap value (plus the cost of freight to their eventual destination), the relatively lightweight K represented a comparatively cheap locomotive purchase. [...] The large number of preserved K class locomotives is {{in stark contrast to the}} fate of VR's remaining fleet of 73 larger, heavier N class locomotives, all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> (<b>other</b> than the one example retained for display at the ARHS Railway Museum) were scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|After the European {{discovery}} of North America in the 15th century, European nations competed to establish colonies on the continent. In the late 16th century, the area claimed by England was well defined along the coast, but was very roughly marked in the west, extending from 34 to 48 degrees north latitude, {{or from the}} vicinity of Cape Fear in present-day North Carolina well into Acadia. [...] The English called this huge claim, parts <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>other</b> powers contested, [...] "Virginia." [...] In 1609, the northern border was reduced to 45 degrees north latitude on the Atlantic coast, {{very close to the}} current coastal border between the U.S. and Canada. [...] In 1584, Sir Walter Raleigh sent Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the coast of present-day North Carolina, and they returned with word of a regional native chief named [...] "Wingina." [...] This name was given to the territory, and was shortly renamed [...] "Virginia" [...] by Queen Elizabeth I, perhaps in part due to her status as the [...] "Virgin Queen." [...] Raleigh's Roanoke Colony in the 1580s and the Virginia Company of Plymouth's Popham Colony in the 1600s (present-day Maine) both took place in what the English then called Virginia, and were both unsuccessful in establishing permanent footholds.|$|E

60|$|She {{intended}} to make herself an audience of one, and to listen {{in a way she}} knew would please him to the recital of his travels and experiences. Of these he had often essayed to talk to her, but she had not encouraged him. She never liked to talk upon subjects <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>other</b> people knew more than she did, and she always endeavored to bring the conversation into a channel where she could take an equal part. If she could lead, so much the better. But now she was going to let Mr. Tippengray talk to her just as much as he pleased, and tell her all he wanted to tell her. She now knew him better than she had done before, and she had strong hopes that by this new string {{she would be able to}} lead him from the Squirrel Inn to Lethbury whenever she chose.|$|E
60|$|She was, in fact, {{no better}} than a {{vagabond}} upon this earth. When she got her money she gambled; when she had gambled it she was put to shifts to live; who knows how or by what means she succeeded? It is {{said that she was}} once seen at St. Petersburg, but was summarily dismissed from that capital by the police, so that there cannot be any possibility of truth in the report that she was a Russian spy at Toplitz and Vienna afterwards. I have even been informed that at Paris she discovered a relation of her own, no less a person than her maternal grandmother, who was not by any means a Montmorenci, but a hideous old box-opener at a theatre on the Boulevards. The meeting between them, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>other</b> persons, as it is hinted elsewhere, seem to have been acquainted, must have been a very affecting interview. The present historian can give no certain details regarding the event.|$|E
60|$|Grasses contain {{far less}} {{nitrogenous}} matter than do peas or cabbages. The {{leaves and stalks}} of three common kinds were chopped and boiled for some time in distilled water.

After 2 hrs. 30 m. four of the leaves had their blades greatly inflected, but not their exterior tentacles; {{and so it was}} with all six leaves after 24 hrs. Two days afterwards the blades, as well as the few submarginal tentacles which had been inflected, all re-expanded; and much of the fluid on their discs was by this time absorbed. It appears that the decoction strongly excites the glands on the disc, causing the blade to be quickly and greatly inflected; but that the stimulus, differently from what occurs in ordinary cases, does not spread, or only in a feeble degree, to the exterior tentacles.|$|E

60|$|The lions {{that had}} entered the {{building}} with the party had, during their examination by {{the man at the}} table, been driven from the apartment through a doorway behind him. Toward this same doorway two of the men now led Smith-Oldwick. He found himself in a long corridor from the sides <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>other</b> doorways opened, presumably into other apartments of the building. At {{the far end of the}} corridor he saw a heavy grating beyond which appeared an open courtyard. Into this courtyard the prisoner was conducted, and as he entered it with the two guards he found himself in an opening which was bounded by the inner walls of the building. It was in the nature of a garden in which a number of trees and flowering shrubs grew. Beneath several of the trees were benches and there was a bench along the south wall, but what aroused his most immediate attention was the fact that the lions who had assisted in their capture and who had accompanied them upon the return to the city, lay sprawled about upon the ground or wandered restlessly to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|More {{remarkable}} {{than either}} of these two is his piece on Leopardi (1850), the Italian poet, whose philosophy and (M194) frame of mind, said Mr. Gladstone, “present {{more than any other}} that we know, more even than that of Shelley, the character of unrelieved, unredeemed desolation—the very qualities in it which attract pitying sympathy, depriving it of all seductive power.” It is curious that he should have selected one whose life lay along a course like Leopardi’s for commemoration, as a man who in almost every branch of mental exertion seems to have had the capacity for attaining, and generally at a single bound, the very highest excellence. “There are many things,” he adds, “in which Christians would do well to follow him: in the warmth of his attachments; in the moderation of his wants; in his noble freedom from the love of money; in his all-conquering assiduity.”(324) Perhaps the most remarkable sentence of all is this: “... what is not needful, and is commonly wrong, namely, is to pass a judgment on our fellow-creatures. Never let it be forgotten that there is scarcely a single moral action of a single man <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>other</b> men can have such a knowledge, in its ultimate grounds, its surrounding incidents, and the real determining causes of its merits, as to warrant their pronouncing a conclusive judgment upon it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|At 2 P.M. it blew a whole top-sail breeze, {{as it is}} called; but the sea being still high, and {{the ships}} close-hauled, the vice-admiral did not see fit to order any more sail. Perhaps he was also {{influenced}} by a desire not to increase his distance from the enemy, it {{being a part of}} his plan to keep M. de Vervillin in plain sight so long as the day continued, in order that he might have a tolerable idea of the position of his fleet, during the hours of darkness. His present intention was to cause his vessels to pass before him in review, as a general orders his battalions to march past a station occupied by himself and staff, with a view to judge by his own eye of their steadiness and appearance. Vice-Admiral Oakes was the only officer in the British navy who ever resorted to this practice; but he did many things <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>other</b> men never dreamed, and, among the rest, he did not hesitate to attack double his force, when an occasion offered, as has just been seen. The officers of the fleet called these characteristic reviews [...] "Sir Jarvy's field-days," [...] finding a malicious pleasure in comparing any thing out of the common nautical track, to some usage of the soldiers.|$|E
