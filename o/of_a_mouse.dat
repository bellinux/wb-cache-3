5|$|By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had {{discontinued}} Miss Moppet in its panorama format, and republished {{the story}} in a book format that year. Potter illustrated a frontispiece of the kitten and mouse seated in profile, and a title page vignette <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse</b> on all fours facing the reader for the book format. At , the book's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books. In 1917, she suggested to her publisher that Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes {{be published in the}} smaller Miss Moppet format.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rafflesiana {{is one of}} the {{few other}} Nepenthes species {{reliably}} documented as having caught mammalian prey in its natural habitat. In Brunei, frogs, geckos and skinks have been found in the pitchers of this species. The remains of mice have also been reported. On September 29, 2006, at the Jardin botanique de Lyon in France, a cultivated N. truncata was photographed containing the decomposing corpse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse.</b>|$|E

5|$|Géricault, who {{had just}} been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic {{existence}} in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse</b> was sufficient to break his concentration.|$|E

50|$|Female mice housed {{together}} {{tend to go}} into anestrus and do not cycle. If {{exposed to}} <b>a</b> male <b>mouse</b> or the pheromones <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male <b>mouse,</b> most <b>of</b> the females will go into estrus in about 72 hours. This synchronization of the estrous cycle {{is known as the}} Whitten effect. The exposure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recently bred <b>mouse</b> to the pheromones <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strange male <b>mouse</b> may prevent implantation (or pseudopregnancy), a phenomenon known as the Bruce effect.|$|R

25|$|Due {{to their}} {{similarity}} to the WIMP desktop metaphor interface for which mice were originally designed, {{and to their}} own tabletop game origins, computer strategy games are most commonly played with mice. In particular, real-time strategy and MOBA games usually require the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Diablo is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} hack and slash video game. The player moves and {{interacts with the}} environment primarily by way <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse.</b> Other actions, such as casting a spell, are performed in response to keyboard inputs. The player can acquire items, learn spells, defeat enemies, and interact with non-player characters (NPC)s throughout the game.|$|E

25|$|While touchpads, like touchscreens, {{are able}} to sense {{absolute}} position, resolution is limited by their size. For common use as a pointer device, the dragging motion of a finger is translated into a finer, relative motion of the cursor on the output to the display on the operating system, analogous to the handling <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse</b> that is lifted and put back on a surface. Hardware buttons equivalent to a standard mouse's left and right buttons are positioned below, above, or beside the touchpad.|$|E
25|$|The Living Latin {{movement}} {{attempts to}} teach Latin {{in the same}} way that living languages are taught, as a means of both spoken and written communication. It is available at the Vatican and at some institutions in the US, such as the University of Kentucky and Iowa State University. The British Cambridge University Press is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels, such as the Cambridge Latin Course series. It has also published a subseries of children's texts in Latin by Bell & Forte, which recounts the adventures <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse</b> called Minimus.|$|E
25|$|In a {{graphical}} user interface, {{the appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse</b> cursor may change into a hand motif {{to indicate a}} link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when {{they have not been}} visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the user activates the link (e.g. by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser will display the target of the link. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another program may be activated to open the file.|$|E

25|$|No {{naturally}} occurring cases of parthenogenesis exist in mammals because of imprinted genes. However, in 2004, experimental manipulation by Japanese researchers of a paternal methylation imprint controlling the Igf2 gene {{led to the}} birth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse</b> (named Kaguya) with two maternal sets of chromosomes, {{though it is not}} a true parthenogenone since cells from two different female mice were used. The researchers were able to succeed by using one egg from an immature parent, thus reducing maternal imprinting, and modifying it to express the gene Igf2, which is normally only expressed by the paternal copy of the gene.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse,</b> touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} punctuated {{equilibrium}} developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge is often mistakenly {{drawn into the}} discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature the size <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse,</b> to one {{the size of an}} elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime. 60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record.|$|E

To achieve this aim, this study introduces Handpad, an indirect touch input designed for living room and mobile environments. We conduct a user test to evaluate Handpad’s performance and efficiency.|$|R

25|$|Though {{the film}} was quite {{faithful}} to the novel, even in script, {{there were a few}} changes. The Death of Rats is reduced to a one-scene cameo in the film where it reaps the soul <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mouse</b> caught in a trap on Hogswatchnight, and then watches Death deliver presents, whereas in the novel it appears much more often with Quoth the Raven. The invasion of the tooth castle is covered in more detail in the movie, as is the gathering and controlling of the teeth. The annihilation of two of Teatime's associates were removed; thus, instead of Sideney being caught in the playground of his old elementary school (with curls), he was killed by the Scissor Man. The Cheerful Fairy and the Towel Wasp are both removed, along with any mention of the Money Bag Goblin by the Dean. Mention of Bibulous, the opposite brother of Bilious, is removed, and so is the Hangover Imp that is pounding Bilious' head in the scene where Susan meets him. Medium Dave and Banjo's surname in the novel is 'Lilywhite', not 'Cropper'.|$|E

They feed on a range of invertebrates, including earthworms, amphipods, isopods, mites and a range of insects such as beetles, flies, moths and caterpillars. Centipedes are taken as well, and an introduced species of centipede forms an important part of their diet. Along with animal prey they will take the berries of Empetrum and Nertera [...] as well as the seeds of the dock Rumex. Unlike the Tristan thrush they do not feed on carrion or dead fish.|$|E
