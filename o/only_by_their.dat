Agbala was the perfect agent of Chukwu or Chineke (the Creator God) and chose its human and nonhuman agents <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> merit; it knew no politics. It transcended religion, culture and gender, and worked with the humble and the truthful. They believed Anyanwu, The Light, to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead man there.|$|E

5|$|The listroscelidine katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis of inland Australia {{is capable}} of {{attracting}} male cicadas of the Tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas.

5|$|The novel {{opens with}} the {{civilian}} Dr. Catherine Halsey and Lieutenant Jacob Keyes traveling to meet John, a six-year-old boy. Dr. Halsey reveals to Keyes that John {{is one of}} 150 children who possess rare genetic markers making them suitable for conscription into the SPARTAN-II program, a secret experiment {{with the aim of}} creating super soldiers for the UNSC to quell rebellions. Seventy-five of the children are kidnapped by operatives of the Office of Naval Intelligence and replaced by clones engineered to die of natural causes shortly thereafter. From this point on, the recruits are known <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>their</b> first name and a three digit number. John-117 {{and the rest of the}} children are drilled and trained by Franklin Mendez; John demonstrates leadership of his fellow Spartans leading to his promotion to squad leader. In 2525, the Spartans undergo a series of surgical enhancements which turn them into highly efficient super soldiers at the cost of crippling or killing more than half of the original seventy-five. The Spartans are also equipped with powerful MJOLNIR battle armor, designed to respond as quickly as the soldier's thoughts. John-117 is given the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer. The Spartans are highly successful, but they experience a priority shift after a collective of alien races known as the Covenant begin obliterating human colonies, declaring humanity's destruction as the will of the gods. Mendez leaves the group to train the next generation of Spartans as John and his comrades first face the Covenant.|$|E

Among gravitationally bound binary star systems, there exists a so-called log normal distribution of periods, {{with the majority of}} these systems orbiting with a period of about 100 years.

40|$|This paper studies gender {{differences}} in the extent to which social preferences affect workers' shirking decisions. Using exogenous variation in work absence induced by a randomized field experiment that increased treated workers' absence, we find that also non-treated workers increased their absence as a response. Furthermore, we find that male workers react more strongly to decreased monitoring, but no significant gender difference in the extent to which workers are influenced by peers. However, our results suggest significant heterogeneity in the degree of influence that male and female workers exert on each other: conditional on the potential exposure to same-sex co-workers, men are <b>only</b> affected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> male peers, and women are <b>only</b> affected <b>by</b> <b>their</b> female peers...|$|R
