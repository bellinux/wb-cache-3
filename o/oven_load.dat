40|$|Tests were {{performed}} in simulated flue gas streams using two fly ash {{samples from the}} electrostatic precipitators of two full-scale utility boilers. One fly ash was derived from a Powder River Basin (PRB) coal, while the other was derived from Blacksville coal (Pittsburgh No. 8 seam). The tests {{were performed}} at temperatures of 120 and 180 C under different gas compositions. Elemental mercury (Hg) streams were injected into the simulated flue gas and passed over filters (housed in a convection <b>oven)</b> <b>loaded</b> with fly ash. The Ontario Hydro method {{was used to determine}} the total amount of Hg passing through the filter as well as the percentages of elemental and oxidized Hg collected. Results indicated that substantial amounts of Hg oxidation did not occur with either fly ash, regardless of the temperature used for testing. When oxidation was observed, the magnitude of the oxidation was comparable between the two fly ashes. These results suggest that the gas matrix may be more important than the ash components with respect to the distribution of Hg species observed in gaseous effluents at coal-fired power plants...|$|R

40|$|Tests were {{performed}} in simulated flue gas streams using two fly ash {{samples from the}} electrostatic precipitators of two full-scale utility boilers. One fly ash was derived from a Powder River Basin (PRB) coal, while the other was derived from Blacksville coal (Pittsburgh No. 8 seam). The tests {{were performed}} at temperatures of 120 and 180 C under different gas compositions using whole fly ash samples as well as magnetic and nonmagnetic concentrates from sized fly ash. Only the Blacksville ash contained magnetic phases. The whole and fractionated fly ash samples were analyzed for morphology, chemical composition, mineralogical composition, total organic carbon, porosity, and surface area. Mineralogically, the Blacksville ash was composed predominantly of magnetite, hematite, quartz, and mullite, while the PRB ash contained mostly quartz with lesser amounts of lime, periclase, and calcium aluminum oxide. The iron oxides in the Blacksville ash were concentrated almost entirely in the largest size fraction. As anticipated, {{there was not a}} clean separation of magnetic (Fe-rich) and nonmagnetic (aluminosilicate-rich) phases for the Blacksville ash. The Blacksville ash had a significantly higher surface area and a much higher unburned carbon content than the PRB ash. Elemental mercury (Hg) streams were injected into the simulated flue gas and passed over filters (housed in a convection <b>oven)</b> <b>loaded</b> with fly ash. Concentrations of total, oxidized, and elemental Hg downstream from the ash samples were determined by the Ontario Hydro Method. The gas stream composition and whether or not ash was present in the gas stream were the two most important variables. Based on the statistical analyses, the presence of HCl, NO, NO{sub 2 }, and SO{sub 2 } and all two-way gas interactions were significant. In addition, it appears that even four-factor interactions between those gases are significant. The HCl, NO{sub 2 }, and SO{sub 2 } were critical gases resulting in Hg oxidation, while the presence of NO appeared to suppress oxidation. The Blacksville fly ash tended to show slightly more catalytic activity than the PRB fly ash, but this could be largely due to the higher surface area of the Blacksville ash. Temperature was not a statistically important factor. The magnetic (Fe-rich) phases {{did not appear to be}} more catalytically active than the nonmagnetic phases, and unburned carbon did not appear to play a critical role in oxidation chemistry...|$|R
30|$|Electrochemical {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on three-electrode cells using a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface combined with a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer (Hampshire, United Kingdom). To prepare the working electrode, 80 wt.% of the active material (CNTs, pure MnO 2 powder, or MnO 2 /CNT nanocomposite), 15 wt.% carbon black, and 5 wt.% polyvinylidene difluoride dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone were mixed to form a slurry. The slurry was pasted onto a Ti foil and dried for 12 h in a vacuum <b>oven.</b> The <b>loading</b> of the working electrode is typically {{in the range of}} 2 to 3 mg/cm 2. A carbon rod was used as the counter electrode, an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) electrode was used as the reference electrode, and a 1 -M Na 2 SO 4 solution was used as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry [CV] and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy [EIS] were utilized to evaluate the electrochemical behaviors of the different composite electrodes. CV {{measurements were}} carried out between 0 and 0.9 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) at different scan rates ranging from 10 to 100 mV/s. EIS measurements were carried out in a frequency range from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz with an ac amplitude of 10 mV.|$|R
30|$|For all experiments, {{we used a}} PSC {{manufactured}} oven system, {{which is}} a 15  kW dielectric heating capacity research designed unit (Model No: PP 15 L, Serial No: 894 built by PSC for USDA, APHIS, Worchester, MA). It is an oscillator-based oven that delivers continuous RF power output with an operational frequency of 19.0  MHz. Electrode spacing can be independently adjusted from 10.2 to 25.6  cm from the load being treated. Plate height was adjusted to achieve optimum operating conditions as recommended by the manufacturer. Plate voltage (KV) was 10.5  KVDC and grid current was 0.35  amp. Plate current reaches 2.5  amp when the <b>oven</b> is fully <b>loaded.</b> Prior to experimentation the RF oven was calibrated for optimum heating consistency.|$|R
40|$|For {{the study}} of ZnO thin film {{deposition}} using a low cost microwave plasma deposition unit, a detailed analysis is required to ensure that sufficient power is delivered to plasma chamber. Hence a power analysis was carried out to observe the power absorbed by different loads when it is heated using a microwave <b>oven.</b> Here the <b>load</b> used is coconut oil, {{which is one of}} the most common edible oils. The power absorption characteristics of this load is observed and plotted by varying different parameters like time, volume and magnetron voltage. The same analysis is done with water, so that it can be taken as a reference. The power absorbed by water was higher when it is compared to coconut oil in all cases with different parameters. The results show the comparison of thermal properties and heating characteristics of coconut oil and water when they have undergone microwave radiation...|$|R

30|$|The Li–O 2 {{batteries}} (CR 2032) were {{assembled in}} an Ar-filled glove box (<  0.1  ppm of H 2 O and 0.1  ppm of O 2). The slurry was prepared by mixing the active materials, Ketjen carbon, and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 80 : 10 : 10. The slurry was pasted on a carbon paper and dried at 80  °C for 12  h {{in a vacuum}} <b>oven.</b> The mass <b>loading</b> of active materials/KB/PVDF was about 1.0 – 1.3  mg cm− 2. Lithium metal {{was chosen as the}} counter electrode, and a Whitman glass microfiber separator filled with electrolyte was used as a separator. The electrolyte was 1  M LITFSI (lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide) in TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether). The quantity of electrolytes for each cell was 150  μL. The assembled Li–O 2 battery was stored in a box filled with pure O 2 (99.999 %) when tested. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigations were conducted on an Autolab 1.9 electrochemistry workstation. The NEWARE battery test system was used to test the galvanostatic discharge/charge capacities at different current densities in the potential range of 2.0 – 4.5  V.|$|R
30|$|Inconsistency in heating {{could have}} {{resulted}} from the relatively small load relative {{to the size of}} the RF oven. RF ovens are less efficient in heating small units of material (such as our test material) since the dielectric field can become distorted over a small material or due to a geometry effect where there is a limited amount of treating surface in relation {{to the size of the}} oven electrode plates. Heat distribution using RF will also be influenced by the amount of energy used, design and type of <b>oven,</b> type of <b>load</b> (batch, single, continuous), and characteristics of the wood being heated (anatomy, moisture content, etc.). In this study, a straightforward approach was taken to improve heating consistency using aluminum plates that concentrate energy, creating virtual electrodes that are closer to the treated wood (Lazaresku Ciprian, personal communication), which increases speed of heating. The polyethylene sandwich also concentrated energy by deflecting the field into the sample. In an industrial setting, a full load would occupy the space between electrodes and, therefore, represent a similar situation. Because a range of parameters exist that can affect the temperature distribution in the wood material, it is currently difficult to determine a set of optimal operating parameters that would maximize heating consistency in all situations.|$|R
30|$|All the {{electrochemical}} tests were {{done on a}} CHI 760 E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China) with a three-electrode system by employing aqueous solution of 2  M KOH as the electrolyte. Hg/HgO electrode, platinum foil, and nickel foam substrate coated with active material were used as the reference electrode, counter electrode, and working electrode, respectively. To fabricate the working electrode, the active material was mixed with acetylene black and PVDF at the weight ratio of 80 : 10 : 10. Then, NMP was added into the mixture, followed by gentle grinding to generate a homogeneous slurry. After that, the resulting slurry was pasted onto a nickel foam current collector with the area of 1  cm[*]×[*] 1  cm, followed by drying at 60  °C overnight in a vacuum <b>oven,</b> and the <b>loading</b> amount of active material on the working electrode was ~ 2.5  mg. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were recorded in the potential window between 0.15 and 0.65  V at various scanning rates. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were done in the potential range from 0.2 to 0.6  V at a series of current densities. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) {{was carried out in}} the frequency range from 0.01 to 100, 000  Hz at open-circuit potential with an ac perturbation of 5  mV.|$|R
