5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E

5|$|The dipole {{component}} of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune {{may be the result}} of <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} verified {{the existence}} of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> the centre and tilted {{in a manner similar to}} the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.|$|E
5|$|The {{third class}} of cruisers {{named after the}} capital of East Prussia marked a radical {{divergence}} from earlier cruiser designs. A new triple gun turret was adopted for the main battery, with one forward and two aft in a superfiring pair, <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> the centerline. And new, longer C/25 model guns were used. Major use of welding was also a feature of this class of cruisers, and diesel engines were used {{in combination with the}} turbines to increase their cruising radius, though only one set of engines could be run at one time.|$|E

5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
5|$|The IFC prepares {{consolidated}} {{financial statements}} in accordance with United States GAAP which are audited by KPMG. It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009. The IFC reported a net income of $1.58 billion in fiscal year 2011. In previous years, the IFC had reported {{a net loss of}} $151 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.75 billion in fiscal 2010. The IFC's total capital amounted to $20.3 billion in 2011, of which $2.4 billion was paid-in capital from member countries, $16.4 billion was retained earnings, and $1.5 billion was accumulated other comprehensive income. The IFC held $68.49 billion in total assets in 2011.|$|E

25|$|For example, the {{freezing}} point {{of water is}} 0°C and 32°F, and a 5°C change {{is the same as}} a 9°F change. Thus, to convert from units of Fahrenheit to units of Celsius, one subtracts 32°F (the <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> the point of reference), divides by 9°F and multiplies by 5°C (scales by the ratio of units), and adds 0°C (the <b>offset</b> <b>from</b> the point of reference). Reversing this yields the formula for obtaining a quantity in units of Celsius from units of Fahrenheit; one could have started with the equivalence between 100°C and 212°F, though this would yield the same formula at the end.|$|E
