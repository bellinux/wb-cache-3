By late August, the Lions were facing the return of several key import players, including Stewart Hill and Lee Johnson. To meet CFL import ratio requirements, which require each team to field {{a certain number of}} Canadian players, the Lions replaced Allen again with Hocking. Allen's season was hampered both by his early injury and import ratio troubles, limiting him to three games in which he recorded 13 tackles.

5|$|After {{his release}} from the Jaguars, the Chicago Bears worked out Kafka on October 25, 2013, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers worked him out on November 5, the Atlanta Falcons worked him out on November 19, and the Dallas Cowboys worked him out on February 6, 2014. He signed with the Buccaneers on February 10. During {{training}} camp, Kafka competed against Alex Tanney for the third-string quarterback spot behind Josh McCown and Mike Glennon. Kafka went 2-of-7 for 14yards in the first preseason game, 4-of-11 for 55yards and a touchdown in the second preseason game, and 7-of-14 for 86yards and a touchdown in the fourth preseason game. He was released during final roster cuts with Tanney on August 30, 2014, but was subsequently re-signed to the team's practice squad on August 31. After spending {{the first three weeks}} of the season <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> squad, Kafka was promoted to the active roster on September 25 due to an injury suffered by starter McCown. He was active but did not play in the first three weeks he was on the active roster. He was declared inactive in week 8 with McCown healthy again, and he was waived on October 28. He was re-signed to the practice squad on October 30. At the conclusion of the 2014 NFL season, Kafka's practice squad contract expired and he was not re-signed by the team.|$|E

5|$|Alford {{was signed}} by the BC Lions and participated at {{training}} camp in 1996, but he was cut from the roster in late June. Despite not being offered a spot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> squad, Alford remained in Surrey and practiced with the Lions for free. He was signed onto the active roster in late July after the Lions cut receivers Darryl Frazier and Clarence Verdin. Alford made his CFL debut against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on July 27, 1996. After recording over 200 receiving yards across two games in August, Alford began starting at wide receiver. He finished the season as the second most-productive Lions receiver with 721 receiving yards, leading the team to nominate Alford for the league-wide Most Outstanding Rookie award.|$|E
5|$|Allen was {{eligible}} for the 2001 NFL Draft but went undrafted. He was later {{signed as a free}} agent to the Kansas City Chiefs, who released him prior to the start of the 2001 regular season. After being waived by the Chiefs, Allen intended to leave football behind, but he accepted a spot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> squad of the Atlanta Falcons in January 2002. Later that month, the Chiefs signed Allen to a three-year contract. During the offseason, Allen was sent to play for the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe to gain experience. After his father had a stroke, Allen was forced to leave the Claymores and return to the United States. He participated in training camp and the preseason with the Chiefs but was waived shortly before the start of the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned {{in the general population}} since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year later}} amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice,</b> as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E

5|$|Due to Nelsen's injury, Gault {{was given}} the start in next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, facing off against fellow rookie and first overall draft pick, Terry Bradshaw. In his only career start, he {{completed}} one pass for 44 yards in 16 attempts, threw two interceptions, and finished {{the game with a}} 0.0 passer rating. He also led the Browns to only three first downs during the first half, and as a result Phipps took over at quarterback; the Browns {{went on to win the}} game, 15-7. Nelsen recovered from the injury the following week and turn back over for the Browns at quarterback; Gault did not play another snap that season. Entering the 1971 season, Gault modified his throwing style after discussion with new head coach Nick Skorich, and was throwing better in training camp as a result. After training camp ended, however, he was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> squad, where he remained throughout the season.|$|E
5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the marine food chain, an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, this could have serious adverse environmental consequences for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail finning in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice.</b> In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act (SFPA) into law in 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit finning in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating and implementing regulations to enforce the act.|$|E
