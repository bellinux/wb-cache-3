40|$|Abstract — We {{make three}} main {{contributions}} to autocalibration under pure rotation and zooming, with particular focus <b>on</b> PTZ <b>cameras.</b> <b>First,</b> {{for the general}} camera rotation, we provide a novel solution that yields five intrinsic parameters from only two images, by directly decomposing the infinite homography using a series of Givens rotations. Second, we present thorough analysis of degenerate cases of pure pan and pure tilt that occur very frequently in practical applications of PTZ cameras, and hence reveal the limits and the stability of auto-calibration under these degenerate rotations. Third, we derive a new optimal geometric error function for pure rotation, which plays a similar role as the epipolar constraint in a freely moving camera, in terms of characterizing the reprojection error of point correspondences. Our solutions and analyses are thoroughly validated and tested on both synthetic and real data, whereby the new geometric error function is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy and noise resilience.

5000|$|Cheney and Ellis were {{inspired}} {{to create the}} film out of embarrassment—they were college graduates with no knowledge of where their food came from or how it was made. For Woolf, the film presented a new opportunity, one where he could [...] "get his hands dirty." [...] One {{of the biggest challenges}} the trio faced was raising money for the independent film. They found that people were largely bored with the concept of the film and did not understand their intent. Another obstacle was the stop-animations, which were very time-consuming. A particular issue for Woolf during filming was the shyness of his co-stars, both of whom {{did not want to be}} <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> for the <b>first</b> six months of filming.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} begun when Rajesh Fernandes along with Raymond Quadros, {{during one of}} their visits to Goa, watched the play Padri by Prince Jacob. Soon, the idea of turning the play into a movie was born. The movie is unique in that all the actors and actresses acted <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> for the <b>first</b> time, but they are all {{professional}} stage artists. The whole movie was filmed in 2005 without a single indoor shot in 26 days. In all, [...] "it is a package to be viewed by the entire family with model clippings and modern anecdotes", according to director Fernandes. The censor board has given ‘U’ certificate without even a single cut, he added. He said the language used in the movie {{is a mixture of}} Mangalorean Konkani and Goan Konkani.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHaptics, the {{technology}} which brings tactile or force-feedback to users, {{has a great}} potential for enhancing movies and could lead to new immersive experiences. In this paper we introduce Haptic Cinematography which presents haptics as a new component of the filmmaker's toolkit. We propose a taxonomy of haptic effects and we introduce novel effects coupled with classical cinematographic motions to enhance video viewing experience. More precisely we propose two models to render haptic effects based <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> motions: the <b>first</b> model makes the audience feel {{the motion of the}} camera and the second provides haptic metaphors related to the semantics of the camera effect. Results from a user study suggest that these new effects improve the quality of experience. Filmmakers may use this new way of creating haptic effects to propose new immersive audiovisual experiences...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{starts with}} a framing device of {{psychologist}} Dr. Arnold (Patrick Bauchau) in a session with Karla Homolka (Laura Prepon) on May 11, 2000, at Canada's Regional Psychiatric Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Dr. Arnold's evaluation will determine Karla's eligibility for parole. During the session, Dr. Arnold shows Karla a photo album of herself and her husband Paul Bernardo (Misha Collins) in happier times, and Karla has a memory of how they first met. However, when Dr. Arnold introduces the subject of Karla's sister Tammy, Karla becomes uncooperative. Over the following weeks, Dr. Arnold probes Karla about her knowledge of Paul's secret life as a serial rapist, and it is revealed that shortly before their marriage Paul began to rape women. Paul convinced Karla to help him rape her sister <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> At <b>first</b> Karla disagrees, but eventually steals Halcion from the veterinary clinic where she works. Tammy gets drunk at a Christmas party and becomes unresponsive after the two drug her. Tammy is raped, and ends up getting sick while drugged, choking on her own vomit. Karla calls 911 and the two hide the assault evidence so her death would appear accidental. Afterwards, Paul beats Karla for [...] "ruining his movie". Karla learns never to ruin Paul's [...] "movies".|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{suitability}} of two possible detectors, silicon and germanium as the Compton <b>camera’s</b> <b>first</b> plane detector {{has been investigated}} using a robust Monte Carlo approach. Methods: The GEANT 4 simulation software was used to simulate the radiation transport and interactions with matter. Investigations were first done by relating the impact of Doppler broadening <b>on</b> the Compton <b>camera</b> angular uncertainty, energy spectra and reconstructed source image. Then, the impact of geometry and interaction type <b>on</b> the Compton <b>camera</b> performance was evaluated as well. Results: Analyses suggest that silicon of about 1 cm thickness would be suitable as the Compton <b>camera</b> <b>first</b> plane detector. The choice of silicon is however not completely flawless, Doppler broadening for this detector material contributes as much as 7. 3 mm and 2. 4 mm to full-width-half-maximum image resolution at 140. 5 keV and 511 keV respectively. Conclusions: It is envisioned that with improved reconstruction technique, silicon {{would be the best}} first plane detector for the Compton camera...|$|R

50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} asphalt/bitumen, {{a type of}} pitch, is a viscoelastic polymer. This {{means that}} even though {{it seems to be}} solid at room temperature and can be shattered with a hard impact, it is actually fluid and will flow over time, but extremely slowly. The pitch drop experiment taking place at University of Queensland is a long-term experiment which demonstrates the flow of a piece of pitch over many years. For the experiment, pitch was put in a glass funnel and allowed to slowly drip out. Since the pitch was allowed to start dripping in 1930, only nine drops have fallen. It was calculated in the 1980s that the pitch in the experiment has a viscosity approximately 230 billion (2.3×1011) times that of water. The eighth drop fell on 28 November 2000, and the ninth drop fell on 17 April 2014. Another experiment was begun by a colleague of Nobel Prize winner Ernest Walton in the physics department of Trinity College in Ireland in 1944. Over the years, the pitch had produced several drops, but none had been recorded. On Thursday, July 11, 2013 scientists at Trinity College caught pitch dripping from a funnel <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> for the <b>first</b> time.|$|R
40|$|This {{short film}} based on {{time-lapse}} photography shows {{a day in}} the life of Billingsgate Fish Market. On Tuesday 11 December 2012, we set up <b>cameras</b> <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> floor gallery looking down the length of the market hall above the beginning of the central isle. We took a photograph every 10 seconds from one o’clock in the morning until midday. Every hour or so, I walked around the market floor making short sound recordings of whatever was happening at the time. The film we made is a combination of the sequence of images speeded up (so one hour is presented in 30 seconds) with snip-pets of sound corresponding to the same time period in which the photographs were taken. It shows physical activity, movement, interactions, patterns, rhythms and flows which cannot be perceived in real time. And it shows how the market comes to life through work...|$|R

In order to defeat the boss, the player will need to take photos of it several times, stunning them <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>camera</b> flash and then delivering a blow with another flash. During the boss battles, the bosses will fling mechanical bolts which cause as much damage as the ones in the regular levels. Before each boss battle, the player's character and the boss will engage in a conversation that is different depending on which character the player is using (for example, Timmy will remark to the Helga robot, [...] "Something tells me you'd make an even worse babysitter than Vicky!"); the conversation becomes a bit lengthier if the player uses a character from the same show as {{the character}} whom the robot's appearance is based on.|$|R
40|$|Auctions {{are widely}} used online to conduct {{commercial}} transactions. An important feature of online auctions is that even bidders who intend to buy a single object frequently {{have the opportunity to}} bid in sequential auctions selling identical objects. This paper studies key features of the optimal bidding strategy, assuming rational, risk-neutral agents with independent private valuations and sealed-bid second-price sequential auctions. In contrast to previous work on this topic, we develop our theory using the concept of the “option value ” of an upcoming auction – a measure of the expected payoff from being able to participate in a future auction. This option value depends, among other things, upon the mean and variance of the future number of bidders. We derive an optimal bidding strategy in sequential auctions that incorporates option value assessment. Furthermore, we establish that our optimal bidding strategy is tractable since it is independent of the bidding strategies of other bidders in the current auction and is only dependent on the option value assessment. We test and find support for our theory using data collected on 327 eBay auctions <b>on</b> digital <b>cameras</b> in <b>first</b> two months of 2001. 1 Please address all correspondence t...|$|R
