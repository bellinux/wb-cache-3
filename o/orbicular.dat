He described the corpora striata and optic thalami; the four <b>orbicular</b> eminences, with the bridge, which he first named annular protuberance; and the white mammillary eminences, behind the infundibulum. In the cerebellum he remarks the arborescent arrangement of the white and grey matter and gives a good account of the internal carotids and the communications which they make with the branches of the basilar artery.|$|E
25|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} {{has a long}} slender body with black {{outlines}} such as the feet, ears, parts of the face and its tail. The forehead is arched and broad, and the muzzle is short. It has few whiskers, and its ears are triangular, short, erect and broad at the base. The neck is long and the legs short and stout. The toes are armed with sharp, very slightly arched claws. The feet on both surfaces are covered in hair, even to the soles, thus concealing the claws. It combines several physical features common in both members of the subgenus Gale (least, short-tailed and long-tailed weasels) and Putorius (European and steppe polecats). Its skull resembles that of polecats in its size, massiveness {{and the development of}} its ridges and depressions, though it is distinguished by the extreme degree of constriction behind the orbits where the width of the cranium is much less than that of the muzzle. Though similar in size to polecats, its attenuate body, long neck, very short legs, slim tail, large <b>orbicular</b> ears and close-set pelage is much closer in conformation to weasels and stoats. The dentition of the black-footed ferret closely resembles that of the European and steppe polecat, though the back lower molar is vestigial, with a hemispherical crown which is too small and weak to develop the little cusps which are more apparent in polecats.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica {{was first}} {{described}} by Henry Charles Andrews {{in the seventh}} volume of his Botanist's Repository published in 1807. A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P.wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P.wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P.corallina and P.corallina var. triternata, and P.wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P.triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P.corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P.wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow {{was the first to}} think that a difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P.wittmanniana to P.corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new form, f. macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P.corallina, P.mlokosewitschii, P.macrophylla, P.wittmanniana, and introduced P.wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P.triternata and P.corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P.corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P.wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P.mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P.corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P.mlokosewitschii, P.wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P.tomentosa and the new P.abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P.mlokosewitschii - as part of the series Obovatae having <b>orbicular,</b> ovate or rarely pointed leaflets - and P.triternata, P.caucasica, P.wittmanniana, P.macrophylla, P.tomentosa and P.abchasica - all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P.daurica, P.mlokosewitschii and P.wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P.kavachensis (= P.caucasica), P.mlokosewitschii (including P.tomentosa) and P.wittmanniana (including P.abchasica). P.wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P.steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P.abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P.ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.|$|E

60|$|In violent {{coughing}} {{especially when}} a person is half-choked, the face becomes purple, the veins distended, the <b>orbicular</b> muscles strongly contracted, and tears run down the cheeks. Even after a fit of ordinary coughing, almost every one has to wipe his eyes. In violent vomiting or retching, as I have myself experienced and seen in others, the <b>orbicular</b> muscles are strongly contracted, and tears sometimes flow freely down the cheeks. It has been suggested to me that {{this may be due to}} irritating matter being injected into the nostrils, and causing by reflex action the secretion of tears. Accordingly I asked one of my informants, a surgeon, to attend to the effects of retching when nothing was thrown up from the stomach; and, by an odd coincidence, he himself suffered the next morning from an attack of retching, and three days subsequently observed a lady under a similar attack; and he is certain that in neither case an atom of matter was ejected from the stomach; yet the <b>orbicular</b> muscles were strongly contracted, and tears freely secreted. I can also speak positively to the energetic contraction of these same muscles round the eyes, and to the coincident free secretion of tears, when the abdominal muscles act with unusual force in a downward direction on the intestinal canal.|$|E

60|$|I {{was anxious}} to {{ascertain}} whether there existed {{in any of the}} lower animals a similar relation between the contraction of the <b>orbicular</b> muscles during violent expiration and the secretion of tears; but there are very few animals which contract these muscles in a prolonged manner, or which shed tears. The Macacus maurus, which formerly wept so copiously in the Zoological Gardens, would have been a fine case for observation; but the two monkeys now there, and which are believed to belong to the same species, do not weep. Nevertheless they were carefully observed by Mr. Bartlett and myself, whilst screaming loudly, and they seemed to contract these muscles; but they moved about their cages so rapidly, that it was difficult to observe with certainty. No other monkey, as far as I have been able to ascertain, contracts its <b>orbicular</b> muscles whilst screaming.|$|E

6000|$|Excessive laughter, {{as before}} remarked, {{graduates}} into moderate laughter. In this latter case the muscles round {{the eyes are}} much less contracted, {{and there is little}} or no frowning. Between a gentle laugh and a broad smile there is hardly any difference, excepting that in smiling no reiterated sound is uttered, though a single rather strong expiration, or slight noise-- a rudiment of a laugh--may often be heard at the commencement of a smile. On a moderately smiling countenance the contraction of the upper <b>orbicular</b> muscles can still just be traced by a slight lowering of the eyebrows. The contraction of the lower <b>orbicular</b> and palpebral muscles is much plainer, and is shown by the wrinkling of the lower eyelids and of the skin beneath them, together with a slight drawing up of the upper lip. From the broadest smile we pass by the finest steps into the gentlest one. In this latter case the features are moved in a much less degree, and much more slowly, and the mouth is kept closed. The curvature of the naso-labial furrow is also slightly different in the two cases. We thus see that no abrupt line of demarcation can be drawn between the movement of the features during the most violent laughter and a very faint smile.[16] ...|$|E
60|$|A smile, therefore, {{may be said}} to be {{the first}} stage in the {{development}} of a laugh. But a different and more probable view may be suggested; namely, that the habit of uttering load reiterated sounds from a sense of pleasure, first led to the retraction of the corners of the mouth and of the upper lip, and to the contraction of the <b>orbicular</b> muscles; and that now, through association and long-continued habit, the same muscles are brought into slight play whenever any cause excites in us a feeling which, if stronger, would have led to laughter; and the result is a smile.|$|E
60|$|In {{considering}} how far {{this view is}} probable, we should {{bear in mind that}} the eyes of infants have been acted on in this double manner during numberless generations, whenever they have screamed; and on the principle of nerve-force readily passing along accustomed channels, even a moderate compression of the eyeballs and a moderate distension of the ocular vessels would ultimately come, through habit, to act on the glands. We have an analogous case in the <b>orbicular</b> muscles being almost always contracted in some slight degree, even during a gentle crying-fit, when there can be no distension of the vessels and no uncomfortable sensation excited within the eyes.|$|E
60|$|So that {{upon the}} whole, we shall {{find that the}} reason of the Phænomena seems to depend upon the {{obliquity}} of the <b>orbicular</b> pulse, to the Lines of Radiation, and in particular, that the Ray cd which constitutes the Scarlet has its inner parts, namely those which are next {{to the middle of}} the luminous body, precedent to the outermost which are contiguous to the dark and unradiating skie. And that the Ray ef which gives a Blue, has its outward part, namely, that which is contiguous to the dark side precedent to the pulse from the innermost, which borders on the bright area of the luminous body.|$|E
60|$|Not {{only are}} the muscles round the eyes {{strongly}} contracted, as Sir C. Bell states and as I have often observed, during screaming, loud laughter, coughing, and sneezing, but during several other analogous actions. A man contracts these muscles when he violently blows his nose. I asked one of my boys to shout as loudly as he possibly could, {{and as soon as}} he began, he firmly contracted his <b>orbicular</b> muscles; I observed this repeatedly, and on asking him why he had every time so firmly closed his eyes, I found that he was quite unaware of the fact: he had acted instinctively or unconsciously.|$|E
60|$|We {{have already}} seen that the {{contraction}} of the <b>orbicular</b> muscles leads to the drawing up of the upper lip, and consequently, if the mouth is kept widely open, to the drawing down of the corners by the contraction of the depressor muscles. The formation of the naso-labial fold on the cheeks likewise follows from the drawing up of the upper lip. Thus all the chief expressive movements of the face during crying apparently result from the contraction of the muscles round the eyes. We shall also find that the shedding of tears depends on, or at least stands in some connection with, the contraction of these same muscles.|$|E
60|$|Laughter is {{suppressed}} {{by the firm}} contraction of the <b>orbicular</b> muscles of the mouth, which prevents the great zygomatic and other muscles from drawing the lips backwards and upwards. The lower lip is also sometimes held by the teeth, and this gives a roguish expression to the face, as was observed with the blind and deaf Laura Bridgman.[20] The great zygomatic muscle is sometimes variable in its course, and I have seen {{a young woman in}} whom the depressores anguli oris were brought into strong action in suppressing a smile; but this by no means gave to her countenance a melancholy expression, owing to the brightness of her eyes.|$|E
60|$|We will suppose {{therefore}} {{in the first}} Figure ACFD to be a physical Ray, or ABC and DEF to be two Mathematical Rays, trajected from a very remote point of a luminous body through an Homogeneous transparent medium LLL, and DA, EB, FC, to be small portions of the <b>orbicular</b> impulses which must therefore cut the Rays at right angles; these Rays meeting with the plain surface NO of a medium that yields an easier transitus to the propagation of light, and falling obliquely on it, they will in the medium MMM be refracted towards the perpendicular of the surface. And because this medium is more easily trajected then the former by a third, therefore the point C of the <b>orbicular</b> pulse FC will be mov'd to H four spaces {{in the same time}} that F the other end of it is mov'd to G three spaces, therefore the whole refracted pulse GH shall be oblique to the refracted Rays CHK and GI; and the angle GHC shall be an acute, and so much the more acute by how much the greater the refraction be, then which nothing is more evident, for the sign of the inclination is to the sign of refraction as GF to TC the distance between the point C and the perpendicular from G on CK, which being as four to three, HC being longer then GF is longer also then TC, therefore the angle GHC is less than GTC. So that henceforth the parts of the pulses GH and IK are mov'd ascew, or cut the Rays at oblique angles.|$|E
60|$|In {{some of the}} {{foregoing}} cases, especially in those of sneezing and coughing, {{it is possible that}} the contraction of the <b>orbicular</b> muscles may serve in addition to protect the eyes from too severe a jar or vibration. I think so, because dogs and cats, in crunching hard bones, always close their eyelids, and at least sometimes in sneezing; though dogs do not do so whilst barking loudly. Mr. Sutton carefully observed for me a young orang and chimpanzee, and he found that both always closed their eyes in sneezing and coughing, but not whilst screaming violently. I gave a small pinch of snuff to a monkey of the American division, namely, a Cebus, and it closed its eyelids whilst sneezing; but not on a subsequent occasion whilst uttering loud cries.|$|E
60|$|The old {{soldier and}} the Puritan {{instantly}} {{plunged into a}} deep and learned disquisition upon the merits of wall-pieces, drakes, demi-culverins, sakers, minions, mortar-pieces, falcons, and pattereroes, concerning all which pieces of ordnance Saxon had strong opinions to offer, fortified by many personal hazards and experiences. He then dwelt upon the merits of fire-arrows and fire-pikes in the attack or defence of places of strength, and had finally begun to descant upon sconces, 'directis lateribus,' and upon works, semilunar, rectilineal, horizontal, or <b>orbicular,</b> with so many references to his Imperial Majesty's lines at Gran, that it seemed that his discourse would never find an end. We slipped away at last, leaving him still discussing the effects produced by the Austrian grenadoes upon a Bavarian brigade of pikes {{at the battle of}} Ober-Graustock.|$|E
60|$|Under the {{opposite}} emotion of great joy or amusement, {{as long as}} laughter is moderate there is hardly any contraction of the muscles round the eyes, {{so that there is}} no frowning; but when peals of loud laughter are uttered, with rapid and violent spasmodic expirations, tears stream down the face. I have more than once noticed the face of a person, after a paroxysm of violent laughter, and I could see that the <b>orbicular</b> muscles and those running to the upper lip were still partially contracted, which together with the tear-stained cheeks gave to the upper half of the face an expression not to be distinguished from that of a child still blubbering from grief. The fact of tears streaming down the face during violent laughter is common to all the races of mankind, as we shall see in a future chapter.|$|E
60|$|During {{laughter}} {{the mouth}} is opened {{more or less}} widely, with the corners drawn much backwards, {{as well as a}} little upwards; and the upper lip is somewhat raised. The drawing back of the corners is best seen in moderate laughter, and especially in a broad smile-- the latter epithet showing how the mouth is widened. In the accompanying figs. 1-3, Plate III., different degrees of moderate laughter and smiling have been photographed. The figure of the little girl, with the hat is by Dr. Wallich, and the expression was a genuine one; the other two are by Mr. Rejlander. Dr. Duchenne repeatedly insists[9] that, under the emotion of joy, the mouth is acted on exclusively by the great zygomatic muscles, which serve to draw the corners backwards and upwards; but judging from {{the manner in which the}} upper teeth are always exposed during laughter and broad smiling, as well as from my own sensations, I cannot doubt that some of the muscles running to the upper lip are likewise brought into moderate action. The upper and lower <b>orbicular</b> muscles of the eyes are at the same time more or less contracted; and there is an intimate connection, as explained in the chapter on weeping, between the orbiculars, especially the lower ones and some of the muscles running to the upper lip. Henle remarks[10] on this head, that when a man closely shuts one eye he cannot avoid retracting the upper lip on the same side; conversely, if any one will place his finger on his lower eyelid, and then uncover his upper incisors as much as possible, he will feel, as his upper lip is drawn strongly upwards, that the muscles of the lower eyelid contract. In Henle's drawing, given in woodcut, fig. 2, the musculus malaris (H) which runs to the upper lip may be seen to form an almost integral part of the lower <b>orbicular</b> muscle.|$|E
60|$|Ill-temper.--We {{have seen}} that {{frowning}} is the natural expression of some difficulty encountered, or of something disagreeable experienced either in thought or action, and he whose mind is often and readily affected in this way, will be apt to be ill-tempered, or slightly angry, or peevish, and will commonly show it by frowning. But a cross expression, due to a frown, may be counteracted, if the mouth appears sweet, from being habitually drawn into a smile, and the eyes are bright and cheerful. So it will be if the eye is clear and steady, {{and there is the}} appearance of earnest reflection. Frowning, with some depression of the corners of the mouth, which is a sign of grief, gives an air of peevishness. If a child (see Plate IV., fig. 2)[8] frowns much whilst crying, but does not strongly contract in the usual manner the <b>orbicular</b> muscles, a well-marked expression of anger or even of rage, together with misery, is displayed.|$|E
60|$|But to proceed, {{the same}} kind of {{obliquity}} of the Pulses and Rays will happen also when the refraction is made out of a more easie into a more difficult mediu; as by the calculations of GQ & CSR which are refracted from the perpendicular. In both which calculations 'tis obvious to observe, that always that part of the Ray towards which the refraction is made has the end of the <b>orbicular</b> pulse precedent to that of the other side. And always, the oftner the refraction is made the same way, Or the greater the single refraction is, the more is this unequal progress. So that having found this odd propriety to be an inseparable concomitant of a refracted Ray, not streightned by a contrary refraction, we will next examine the refractions of the Sun-beams, as they are suffer'd onely to pass through a small passage, obliquely out of a more difficult, into a more easie medium.|$|E
6000|$|The great {{preponderance}} of the two orders Compositæ and Lobeliaceæ are what first strike us in this list. In the former case the facilities for wind-dispersal afforded by the structure {{of so many of}} the seeds render it comparatively easy to account for their having reached the islands at an early period. The Lobelias, judging from Hildebrand's descriptions, may have been transported in several {328} different ways. Most of the endemic genera are berry-bearers and thus offer the means of dispersal by fruit-eating birds. The endemic species of the genus Lobelia have sometimes very minute seeds, which might be carried long distances by wind, while other species, especially Lobelia gaudichaudii, have a [...] "hard, almost woody capsule which opens late," [...] apparently well adapted for floating long distances. Afterwards [...] "the calycine covering withers away, leaving a fenestrate woody network" [...] enclosing the capsule, and the seeds themselves are [...] "compressed, reniform, or <b>orbicular,</b> and margined," [...] and thus of a form well adapted to be carried to great heights and distances by gales or hurricanes.|$|E
6000|$|... 286. Every leaf, besides forming this masonry {{all down}} the tree, {{protected}} a bud {{at the base}} of its own stalk. From this bud, unless rendered abortive, a new shoot would spring next year. Now, supposing that out of the leaf-buds on each shoot of a pentagonal tree, only five at its extremity or on its side were permitted to develop themselves, even under this limitation the number of shoots developed from a single one in the seventh year would be 78,125. The external form of a healthily grown tree at any period of its development was therefore composed of a mass of sprays, whose vitality was approximately distributed over the surface of the tree to an equal depth. The branches beneath at once supported, and were fed by, this <b>orbicular</b> field, or animated external garment of vegetation, from every several leaf of which, as from an innumerable multitude of small green fountains, the streams of woody fiber descended, met, and united as rivers do, and gathered their full flood into the strength of the stem.|$|E
60|$|A {{graduated}} series can be followed from violent to moderate laughter, {{to a broad}} smile, to a gentle smile, and to the expression of mere cheerfulness. During excessive laughter the whole body is often thrown backward and shakes, or is almost convulsed; the respiration is much disturbed; the head and face become gorged with blood, with the veins distended; and the <b>orbicular</b> muscles are spasmodically contracted {{in order to protect}} the eyes. Tears are freely shed. Hence, as formerly remarked, it is scarcely possible to point out any difference between the tear-stained face of a person after a paroxysm of excessive laughter and after a bitter crying-fit.[15] It is probably due to the close similarity of the spasmodic movements caused by these widely different emotions that hysteric patients alternately cry and laugh with violence, and that young children sometimes pass suddenly from the one to the other state. Mr. Swinhoe informs me that he has often seen the Chinese, when suffering from deep grief, burst out into hysterical fits of laughter.|$|E
60|$|The above named three genera, namely Drosophyllum, Roridula, and Byblis, {{which appear}} to have {{retained}} a primordial condition, still bear glandular hairs on both surfaces of their leaves; but those on the lower surface have since disappeared in the more highly developed genera, with the partial exception of one species, Drosera binata. The small sessile glands have also disappeared {{in some of the}} genera, being replaced in Roridula by hairs, and in most species of Drosera by absorbent papillae. Drosera binata, with its linear and bifurcating leaves, is in an intermediate condition. It still bears some sessile glands on both surfaces of the leaves, and on the lower surface a few irregularly placed tentacles, which are incapable of movement. A further slight change would convert the linear leaves of this latter species into the oblong leaves of Drosera anglica, and these might easily pass into <b>orbicular</b> ones with footstalks, like those of Drosera rotundifolia. The footstalks of this latter species bear multicellular hairs, which we have good reason to believe represent aborted tentacles.|$|E
60|$|And first, for the Cartesian, we {{have this}} to object against it, That whereas he says (Meteorum Cap. 8. Sect. 5.)

For if we examine the passage of any Globule or Ray of the primary Iris, we shall find it to pass out of the Ball or Cylinder again, with the same inclination and refraction that it enter'd in withall, and that that last refraction {{by means of the}} intermediate reflection shall be the same as if without any reflection at all the Ray had been twice refracted by two Parallel surfaces.|$|E
60|$|Duchenne {{states that}} the {{pyramidal}} muscle of the nose is less {{under the control of}} the will than are the other muscles round the eyes. He remarks that the young man who could so well act on his grief-muscles, as well as on most of his other facial muscles, could not contract the pyramidals.[5] This power, however, no doubt differs in different persons. The pyramidal muscle serves to draw down the skin of the forehead between the eyebrows, together with their inner extremities. The central fasciae of the frontal are the antagonists of the pyramidal; and if the action of the latter is to be specially checked, these central fasciae must be contracted. So that with persons having powerful pyramidal muscles, if there is under the influence of a bright light an unconscious desire to prevent the lowering of the eyebrows, the central fasciae of the frontal muscle must be brought into play; and their contraction, if sufficiently strong to overmaster the pyramidals, together with the contraction of the corrugator and <b>orbicular</b> muscles, will act in the manner just described on the eyebrows and forehead.|$|E

60|$|As soon as {{the mouth}} of this lady began, involuntarily and unconsciously on her part, to assume the proper form for a crying-fit, we may feel almost sure that some nerve-influence would have been {{transmitted}} through the long accustomed channels to the various respiratory muscles, {{as well as to}} those round the eyes, and to the vaso-motor centre which governs the supply of blood sent to the lacrymal glands. Of this latter fact we have indeed clear evidence in her eyes becoming slightly suffused with tears; and we can understand this, as the lacrymal glands are less {{under the control of the}} will than the facial muscles. No doubt there existed at the same time some tendency in the muscles round the eyes at contract, as if for the sake of protecting them from being gorged with blood, but this contraction was completely overmastered, and her brow remained unruffled. Had the pyramidal, corrugator, and <b>orbicular</b> muscles been as little obedient to the will, as they are in many persons, they would have been slightly acted on; and then the central fasciae of the frontal muscle would have contracted in antagonism, and her eyebrows would have become oblique, with rectangular furrows on her forehead. Her countenance would then have expressed still more plainly than it did a state of dejection, or rather one of grief.|$|E
