40|$|While {{there are}} <b>a</b> growing number <b>of</b> {{religious}} people in Western civilization, {{there are fewer}} people going to church. In particular, this trend has been observed most significantly among emerging adults in their 20 s as was found by Ken Ham in his book Already Gone with Britt Beemer (Ham, Beemer, and Hillard 2009). The results of their study suggested a significant change among the worldview of Western civilization. The worldview of Western civilization is often described by commentators using the term postmodernism. However, the term postmodernism is inadequate to describe the worldview of Western civilization today for several reasons. Even though these terms are used regularly by many and introducing <b>a</b> new set <b>of</b> terms for novelty’s sake {{is not always the}} best approach, it is important to abandon using the term postmodernism because we have experienced a significant shift in Western civilization reflected in many different areas <b>of</b> life. <b>A</b> <b>better</b> <b>term</b> to describe the worldview of Western civilization today is neomodernism.

40|$|Abstract: Coal is an {{important}} fossil fuel and as <b>a</b> source <b>of</b> energy for South Africa and globally. Fine coal has been since an unattractive product because of problems associated {{but not limited to}} handling and transportation. With the depreciation of coal quality, better coal products are reserved for the export market leaving the poor quality coal products for domestic electricity generation. Based on the latter, this has resulted in interest and advancement in the coal processing techniques and progressive technologies. With these recent developments, fines can be processed, prepared and sold for profit. The current work focused of flotation of discards with the aim to upgrade the quality of coal. Flotation with Montenol 800 and 505 produced a clean coal product with high ash reduction with a very good combustibles recovery after 30 and 35 minutes milling of the fine coal sample, but this has proven to be over milling as coal is soft. This is supported by the sampled milled for only one minute where there was consistency over 40 % separation efficiency over all different times employed. The ash rejections were over 40 % and 45 % for Montenol 505 and 800 respectively with the very high combustible recovery higher than 95 % for Montenol 505. The results showed that fine coal cleaning using Montenol is possible to increase the quality of coal. The sample was further agglomerated using different binders; all binders considered yielded bigger pellets with only <b>a</b> small fraction <b>of</b> particles that were less than 5 mm. In addition, {{it was found that the}} final product was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> quality in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> reduced moisture, CV and ash content...|$|R

Unfortunately, in the years since 1961, no systematic treatment of this artifact has been proposed or published, and they are seldom mentioned in regional reports. Reasons for this lack of mention and/or reporting are uncertain but several possibilities come to mind: 1. It may be the case that they are not being recognized. This is especially likely (possible) when they are made of local rock with minimal evidence of cultural modification; 2. In other cases it may be that specimens fitting this category have been recognized as artifacts and collected, but were placed in a hammerstone category without further comment; 3.

But though the qualitative results are clear, the quantitative are as yet not well defined, and that part of the inquiry must lie over until a future time, when I shall have more data and when certain foreseen improvements in the method of work may perhaps be carried out.

[...] Difference in political institutions; 3. Difference in language, [...] religion, and social customs—in a word, in forms of civilization.” [...] These differences exist between Maine and Montana; or even between [...] two adjoining States, Ohio and Kentucky, one a free and the other [...] an old slave State. Labor and capital have not in the past moved [...] freely even across Mason and Dixon’s line. There is, therefore, no [...] treatment of international trade and values separate from the laws [...] of value already laid down concerning non-competing groups, since [...] there is also no free competition between all the industrial [...] groups within a country.|$|E
