A total of 64 patients were recruited from three Swedish oral and maxillofacial specialist clinics. Calculations were made prospectively on utilization of labor time, specific medical services and materials, and standardized utilization of <b>other</b> direct <b>costs.</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>costs</b> were identified from patient surveys. Results. The base case average direct cost of surgery was 217 Euro. Adding the patient's average cost due to absence from work and transportation of 333 Euro increased overall costs to 550 Euro per patient. About 86 % of the patients reported some absence following surgery. Conclusions. The <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> were on average higher than the direct costs, i. e. the patient's loss of time caused higher costs than the intervention per se.

Both Hanson 1 and Zwerling 2 have presented excellent overviews of the history of drug and alcohol testing for industry in this country. At present approximately 35 million drug tests are performed each year at a direct cost exceeding one billion dollars. 3 This money is distributed among numerous parties within an enormous drug testing industry, and recipients include laboratories, third party administrators, medical review officers (MROs), substance abuse professionals (SAPs), specimen collectors, and <b>others.</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>costs</b> of this effort are rarely contemplated and involve decreased productivity as a result of time lost for testing. Tests are typically performed before employment, after accidents, for suspicious behaviors, in a random fashion, or for follow-up of individuals with a history of drug use.

Most also believe that drug tests reduce accidents and product defects. 4 There has always been a close relationship between safety concerns and workplace drug screening programs.
