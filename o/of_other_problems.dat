Collins facility were reassigned to Wyoming after {{they refused to}} comply with instructions to falsify information about patient wait times. The VA Office of Medical Inspector has substantiated a report that punitive action was taken against employees who scheduled appointments {{in a way that}} honestly showed that appointments would take place outside of the 14-day window, and the OMI also substantiated reports <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problems</b> at the facility such as a shortage of medical providers and attempts to hide evidence of cancelled appointments.|$|E

A diagnosis of migraine which notes the absence <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problems,</b> such as papilledema, would not indicate a need for neuroimaging. In the course of conducting a careful diagnosis, the physician should consider whether the headache has a cause other than the migraine and might require neuroimaging.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{law that}} decreed the {{creation}} of HealthCare.gov has been divisive and political speculation has taken place, polling done by the Gallup organization {{around the time of}} the difficult roll-out still have found that a majority of Americans support keeping at least some aspects of Obamacare.

25|$|Perry {{left after}} the New Symphonia and was {{replaced}} by Mike Wedgwood for the album Cunning Stunts (1975), which reached the top 50 in the UK and was a minor hit in the US, reaching number 124. It was the last album released on Decca, which preceded a number <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problems</b> in the band. David Sinclair left after the album was recorded {{and was replaced}} by Jan Schelhaas, with the band's sound becoming more mainstream. The group signed to Miles Copeland's BTM Records and recorded Blind Dog at St. Dunstans (1976) which was another minor album hit, but by this point the group were {{out of step with the}} prevailing musical trends, and after a final album, Better by Far (1977) on Arista Records, the group split.|$|E
500|$|The {{symptoms}} of rhabdomyolysis depend on its severity and whether kidney failure develops. Milder forms may not cause any muscle symptoms, and {{the diagnosis is}} based on abnormal blood tests in the context <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problems.</b> More severe rhabdomyolysis is characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, weakness and swelling of the affected muscles. If the swelling is very rapid, as may happen after someone is released from under a collapsed building, the movement of fluid from the bloodstream into damaged muscle may cause low blood pressure and shock. Other symptoms are nonspecific and result either {{from the consequences of}} muscle tissue breakdown or from the condition that originally led to the muscle breakdown. Release of the components of muscle tissue into the bloodstream causes electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to nausea, vomiting, confusion, coma or abnormal heart rate and rhythm. The urine may be dark, often described as [...] "tea-colored", due to the presence of myoglobin. Damage to the kidneys may give rise to decreased or absent urine production, usually 12 to 24hours after the initial muscle damage.|$|E

2500|$|Consider Sudoku, {{an example}} of a problem that is easy to verify, but whose answer may be {{difficult}} to compute. Given a partially filled-in Sudoku grid, of any size, is there at least one legal solution? [...] A proposed solution is easily verified, and the time to check a solution grows slowly (polynomially) as the grid gets bigger. [...] However, all known algorithms for finding solutions take, for difficult examples, time that grows exponentially as the grid gets bigger. [...] So Sudoku is in NP (quickly checkable) but {{does not seem to be}} in P (quickly solvable). [...] Thousands <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problems</b> seem similar, fast to check but slow to solve. [...] Researchers have shown that a fast solution to any one of these problems could be used to build a quick solution to all the others, a property called NP-completeness. [...] Decades of searching have not yielded a fast solution to any of these problems, so most scientists suspect that none of these problems can be solved quickly. [...] However, this has never been proved.|$|E

Initially she [...] did well achieving 1.7 salvoes per minute while employing radar control but {{she began to}} suffer severe problems from 0920 onward [...] KGV recorded 14 straddles out of 34 salvoes fired from 0853 to 0913, when using her type 284 radar for ranging and spotting. 'A' turret was completely out of action for 30 minutes , after firing about 23 rounds per gun, due to a jam between the fixed and revolving structure in the shell room and Y turret was out of action for 7 minutes due to drill errors... Both guns in B turret, guns 2 and 4 in A turret and gun 2 in Y turret were put out of action by jams and remained so until after the action – 5 guns out of 10! There were a multitude <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problems</b> with mechanical failures and drill errors that caused delays and missed salvos. There were also some misfires – one gun (3 of A turret) misfired twice and was out of action for 30 minutes before it was considered safe to open the breech.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1985, {{most of the}} {{calories}} in soft drinks came from sugar or corn syrup. As of 2010, in the United States high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is used nearly exclusively as a sweetener because of its lower cost, while in Europe, sucrose dominates, because EU agricultural policies favor production of sugar beets in Europe proper and sugarcane in the former colonies over the production of corn. HFCS has been criticized as having a number of detrimental effects on human health, such as promoting diabetes, hyperactivity, hypertension, and a host <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problems.</b> Although anecdotal evidence has been presented to support such claims, {{it is well known}} that the human body breaks sucrose down into glucose and fructose before it is absorbed by the intestines. Simple sugars such as fructose are converted into the same intermediates as in glucose metabolism. However, metabolism of fructose is extremely rapid and is initiated by fructokinase. Fructokinase activity is not regulated by metabolism or hormones and proceeds rapidly after intake of fructose. While the intermediates of fructose metabolism are similar to those of glucose, the rates of formation are excessive. This fact promotes fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis in the liver, leading to accumulation of fat throughout the body and possibly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Increased blood lipid levels also seem to follow fructose ingestion over time. A sugar drink or high-sugar drink may refer to any beverage consisting primarily of water and sugar (often [...] cane sugar or high-fructose corn syrup), including some soft drinks, some fruit juices, and energy drinks.|$|E

40|$|When {{dealing with}} nearly decomposable {{problems}} such as those described by Simon (1973), the problem components may be worked on by different problem solvers that are spatially and temporally separated, with each problem solver constrained by assumptions it makes about the activities and choices <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> solvers, that is by partial knowledge of the global problem. There are advantages to maintaining multiple solutions locally {{for as long as}} possible, even though a single final solution is desired. When it becomes less desirable to retract certain assumptions, these become constraints for <b>other</b> <b>problem</b> solvers and can be communicated to them via a truth maintenance system.
