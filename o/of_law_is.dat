5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general rule that courts will generally only judicially review errors <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact.

5|$|In {{the early}} period {{the kings of}} the Scots {{depended}} on the great lords of the mormaers (later earls) and Toísechs (later thanes), but from the reign of David I sheriffdoms were introduced, which allowed more direct control and gradually limited {{the power of the}} major lordships. While knowledge of early systems <b>of</b> <b>law</b> <b>is</b> limited, justice can be seen as developing from the twelfth century onwards with local sheriff, burgh, manorial and ecclesiastical courts and offices of the justicar to oversee administration. The Scots common law began to develop in this period and there were attempts to systematise and codify the law and the beginnings of an educated professional body of lawyers. In the Late Middle Ages major institutions of government, including the privy council and parliament developed. The council emerged as a full-time body in the fifteenth century, increasingly dominated by laymen and critical to the administration of justice. Parliament also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy. By the end of the era it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy.|$|E

40|$|By allocating {{governance}} authority among nations, {{conflict of}} laws— {{also known as}} private international law—helps bring order to transnational activity in a globalized world that lacks centralized legal institutions. In this way, conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> <b>is</b> a distinct form of global governance. Yet conflictof- <b>laws</b> rules <b>are</b> predominantly national rules; these rules remain crossnationally diverse; {{and there is little}} international agreement on the rules to apply to solve conflict-of-laws problems. Thus, conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> contributes to transnational legal order, but conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> <b>is</b> itself transnationally disordered. Nevertheless, in at least two regions (Europe and Latin America) and two specialized areas <b>of</b> <b>law</b> (family law and commercial <b>law),</b> conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> <b>is</b> increasingly ordered at the transnational level. These developments raise interesting questions about how conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> contributes to transnational legal ordering and about how conflict <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> itself becomes transnationally ordered...|$|R
