40|$|Abstract. We study Nash equilibria in {{the context}} of <b>flows</b> <b>over</b> time. Many results on static routing games have been {{obtained}} over the last ten years. In <b>flows</b> <b>over</b> time (also called dynamic flows), flow travels through a network over time and, as a consequence, flow values on edges are time-dependent. This more realistic setting has not been tackled from the viewpoint of algorithmic game theory yet; but there is a rich literature on game theoretic aspects of <b>flows</b> <b>over</b> time in the traffic community. We present a novel characterization of Nash equilibria for <b>flows</b> <b>over</b> time. It turns out that Nash <b>flows</b> <b>over</b> time {{can be seen as a}} concatena-tion of special static flows. The underlying <b>flow</b> <b>over</b> time model is the so-called deterministic queuing model that is very popular in road traffic simulation and related fields. Based upon this, we prove the first known results on the price of anarchy for <b>flows</b> <b>over</b> time. ...|$|R
