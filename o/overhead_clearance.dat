25|$|These systems {{offer the}} {{advantage}} of superior stability and almost complete absence of deformation. Ballastless track systems incur significantly lower maintenance costs compared to ballasted track. Due {{to the absence of}} any ballast, damage by flying ballast is eliminated, something that occurs at speeds in excess of 250km/h (150mph). It is also useful in renovating existing railroad tunnels. Because slab track allows shallower construction than ballasted track, it may provide the extra <b>overhead</b> <b>clearance</b> necessary for converting a line to overhead electrification, or allow the passage of trains with a greater loading gauge.|$|E

A day after the conference, they ratified a memorandum of understanding about the plan: [...] "The five tracks on the levee would be replaced by three tracks, one owned by the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MPR) and two by the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis (TRRA) proceeding through a tunnel not longer than 3,000 feet.

2500|$|Conventional {{ballasted}} tunnel-track {{was ruled}} out {{owing to the}} difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. [...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra <b>overhead</b> <b>clearance</b> necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|E

5000|$|Work {{to improve}} <b>overhead</b> <b>clearances</b> for the catenary, and track {{amplification}} was also carried out.

40|$|AbstractProjects {{to deliver}} Overhead Line Equipment (OLE) {{electrification}} on the UK rail infrastructure system presents technical challenges which the rail industry in Britain have not traditionally had to consider. Whole Life Cycle assessment provides decision makers with cost {{estimates for the}} installation phase and over the entire service life of the system, including disposal. The OLE projects face a particular problem when analysing the best option for overbridges. Much of the rail infrastructure has not traditionally had to consider <b>overhead</b> <b>clearances</b> and therefore many of the bridges are only a little taller than the rolling stock. In addition to the difficulties in assessing the Life-Cycle costs of assets that have historically been used in very limited scales, the Whole Life Cycle assessment must consider the various engineering options that are available for projects. The three competing options (bridge rebuild, track lowering, reduced clearance) {{are all going to}} have very different capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) costs. This work presents a model created to predict these costs over the anticipated assessment period. The developed model predicts capital expenditures, maintenance and service disruption costs and links them to the three major assets options involved in OLE underbridges...|$|R

30|$|A freight vehicle driver faces {{three main}} choices: at what time to {{arrive to the}} system, how long {{to stay in the}} system and where to park the vehicle. While the first two choices are to some degree exogenous, i.e. chosen by the carrier company, the store manager or the supplier, we assume that the parking {{location}} choice is fully determined by the driver himself. According to the type of vehicle used, a driver faces a different set of parking location choices. We classify freight vehicles into trucks and vans: a freight vehicle with height above 2.5  m is defined as a truck, while below 2.5  m is defined as a van (right of Fig. 1). We introduce this definition to distinguish between those vehicles that are able to enter a passenger’ carpark from those that are not able to. Off-site passengers’ carparks in Singapore often have an <b>overhead</b> height <b>clearance</b> bar at 2.5  m. From this definition, a truck driver can only park in the LB or on-street; a van driver can additionally park inside the passengers’ carpark.|$|R
50|$|The FJ1200 uses a four {{cylinder}} in-line {{layout and}} is air-cooled. Sixteen valves are {{operated by a}} chain-driven double <b>overhead</b> camshaft; valve <b>clearances</b> are adjusted using shims. The four constant-velocity carburettors are mounted in a bank behind the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four exhaust downpipes join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers (mufflers). The crankshaft is geared directly to the clutch, no counter balancer shaft is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump; an oil radiator assists with cooling. Both the FJ1100 and FJ1200 were fitted with an additional fuel vapour recovery system to comply with California emission regulations.|$|R

40|$|Regular {{condition}} monitoring {{is an essential}} precondition for selectively planning maintenance operations, and eventually ensuring {{safe and reliable operation}} of railway lines. A running inspection train, or stationary check points equipped with different types of measurement systems for monitoring passing trains, is the most cost-effective way to do this. Such systems have to measure quickly and precisely under challenging conditions: they operate from moving platforms and have to cope with a high range of ambient temperature and light conditions, varying object reflectivity and harsh environmental conditions. Despite these adversities, railway operators demand precise measurement data, high data densities even at high travelling speeds and a user-friendly presentation of the measurement results. Laser scanning is the method of choice for fast and high precision measurement of track, <b>overhead</b> lines, <b>clearance</b> profile and rolling stock. Using laser scanners to monitor the infrastructure offers several advantages over conventional measurement systems. High point densities of up to some million points per second and accuracies of down to millimeters are possible. A considerable number of laserbased sensor systems for measuring railway infrastructure have been brought to market during the past years. The paper will give an overview about modern laser scanning methods, highlight assets and drawbacks, and describe selected railway measurement systems developed within the last years by the authors of this paper...|$|R
50|$|When {{the tunnel}} was finally {{completed}} in September 1862, locomotives and {{freight and passenger}} cars were much smaller {{than they would be}} some forty years later. In engineering the tunnel, it was not anticipated that the tunnel bore, which would initially allow two tracks to pass through it, would restrict the size of the trains in later years. Indeed, to address this issue by 1900 gauntlet track was required, which is an arrangement that permits two tracks that closely overlap to pass through the tunnel together. The advantage of such an arrangement is that it maximized the <b>overhead</b> and side <b>clearances</b> in the roundish tunnel bore. Its chief disadvantage, however, was that this created what was in effect a single-track railroad through the tunnel—a bottleneck—which with numerous trains in both directions inevitably would lead to delays.|$|R
