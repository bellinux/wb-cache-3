40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{an original}} numerical coupling between surface mechanics of a gradually oxidizing liquid metal surface, and a supporting annular MHD flow, {{in the general}} layout of the classical annular viscometer, originally developed by Mannheimer et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 32 (1970) 195 - 211]. A purely hydrodynamic interplay between a main azimuthal flow (induced by a rotating floor) and a secondary overturning flow generated by centrifugation {{is found to be}} strongly affected by both surface viscous shear and surface viscous dilatation. When centrifugation competes with electromagnetic effects, advection of the main flow by the secondary flow is proved to affect significantly the core MHD flow, leading to original MHD flow patterns. The latter phenomenology reveals to be relevant to characterise the surface viscosities of a gradually <b>oxidising</b> <b>liquid</b> metal surface...|$|E

The second stage used the same hypergolic propellants, whilst the third stage was the new Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS), burning <b>liquid</b> hydrogen <b>oxidised</b> by <b>liquid</b> oxygen.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{versions}} of the Blok DM-03 are powered by a single RD-58M engine, fueled by RG-1 and <b>oxidised</b> by <b>liquid</b> oxygen. The last evolution is powered by the improved RD-58MF a less powerful but more efficient evolution of the venerable engine. It can carry 25% more propellant than the Blok DM-2, which it replaced as a Proton upper stage for some government launches. However most government launches and all commercial missions use the Briz-M instead. The payloads {{for the first two}} Blok DM-03 launches were groups of three Uragan-M satellites for the GLONASS programme, with further missions slated to carry three more Uragan-M satellites, and two Ekspress satellites on separate launches. The Blok DM can inject payloads into orbit more accurately than the Briz-M, [...] making it better suited for launching satellites such as the Uragan-M which lack apogee motors.|$|R
40|$|Liquid Al and Mg-base alloys are so {{reactive}} that it {{is reasonable}} to assume that the surface layer is always <b>oxidised.</b> If <b>liquid</b> aluminium entered a mould cavity with a velocity greater than a critical value, the surface skin of the liquid metal would fold over onto itself and be submerged into the bulk liquid with a volume of air entrapped within it, creating what is called a bifilm defect. This defect not only acts as a crack but also it is recognized to initiate hydrogen porosity in the solidified casting, which has been found to have detrimental effects on the tensile and fatigue properties of the castings produced. Previous research suggested that during solidification the hydrogen, in excess of the solubility limit, comes out of solution and diffuses into the bifilm gap, expanding it into a pore. Also, placing liquid metal in a vacuum may cause its entrained bifilms to expand, enhancing their buoyancy and therefore their floatation to the surface of the melt. In this work, a casting from an A 356 Al alloy was allowed to solidify under vacuum. The solidified casting was sectioned into two halves, and the internal surfaces of the pores were investigated using an SEM to determine their relationship with double oxide film defects...|$|R
40|$|Experiments in long {{distance}} {{quantum key distribution}} have motivated the development of ruggedised single photon sources, capable of producing useful correlations even when removed from the warm, nurturing environment found in most optics laboratories. As {{part of an ongoing}} pro- gramme to place such devices into low earth orbit (LEO), we have developed and built a number of rugged single photon sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion. In order to evalu- ate device reliability, we have subjected our design to various thermal, mechanical and atmospheric stresses. Our results show that while such a device may tolerate launch into orbit, operation in orbit and casual mishandling by graduate students, it is probably unable to survive the forcible disassembly of a launch vehicle {{at the top of a}} ball of rapidly expanding and <b>oxidising</b> kerosene and <b>liquid</b> oxygen.

40|$|Objectives; Antimicrobials such as {{chlorine}} dioxide, {{peracetic acid}} and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) share a basic {{mechanism of action}} (chemical oxidation of cellular components), but profound differences arise in their efficacy against microorganisms. Optimization of activity requires an understanding of their interaction with microbial targets and a clear differentiation between the chemical efficacies of each oxidative biocide. This study aimed to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of action of oxidizing biocides at a macromolecular level, using amino acids, protein and an enzyme as model substrates for the action of each biocide. Methods: The interactions {{of a number of}} <b>oxidising</b> agents (<b>liquid</b> and gaseous H 2 O 2, ClO 2, peracetic acid formulations) with amino acids, proteins (bovine serum albumin and aldolase) and enzymes were investigated by spectrophotometry, SDS-PAGE and alkaline phosphatase activity measurements. Results: Biocide reactions yielded different types of oxidative structural change and different degrees of oxidation to amino acids and proteins, and differences in activity against a microbial enzyme. In particular there was a marked difference in the interactions of liquid H 2 O 2 and gaseous H 2 O 2 with the macromolecules, the latter causing greater oxidation; these results explain the dramatic differences in antimicrobial efficacy between liquid and gas peroxide. Conclusions: These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in interactions between a number of oxidizing agents and macromolecules commonly found in microbial cells. Biochemical mechanistic differences between these oxidative biocides do exist and lead to differential effects on macromolecules. This in turn could provide an explanation as to their differences in biocidal activity, particularly between liquid and gas peroxide...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a classical two- and three-body interaction potential to simulate the hydroxylated, natively oxidised Si surface in contact with water solutions, based on the combination and extension of the Stillinger-Weber potential and of a potential originally developed to simulate SiO 2 polymorphs. The potential parameters are chosen to reproduce the structure, charge distribution, tensile surface stress and interactions with single water molecules of a natively oxidised Si surface model previously obtained by means of accurate density functional theory simulations. We have applied the potential {{to the case of}} hydrophilic silicon wafer bonding at room temperature, revealing maximum room temperature work of adhesion values for natively oxidised and amorphous silica surfaces of 97 mJ/m 2 and 90 mJ/m 2, respectively, at a water adsorption coverage of approximately 1 monolayer. The difference arises from the stronger interaction of the natively <b>oxidised</b> surface with <b>liquid</b> water, resulting in a higher heat of immersion (203 mJ/m 2 vs. 166 mJ/m 2), and may be explained in terms of the more pronounced water structuring close to the surface in alternating layers of larger and smaller density with respect to the liquid bulk. The computed force-displacement bonding curves may be a useful input for cohesive zone models where both the topographic details of the surfaces and the dependence of the attractive force on the initial surface separation and wetting can be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} pre column derivatisation reactions for the selective determination of organic functional groups in <b>oxidised</b> oils by <b>liquid</b> chromatography (LC) with luminescence detection. The testing of oils for oxidative stability and the current methods of oil analysis are reviewed in chapter one. An overview of LC and luminescence spectrometry, with particular regard to chemiluminescence (CL) is also presented. Chapter two is a flow injection investigation of the experimental variables of the peroxyoxalate CL reaction. Two aryl oxalates; bis(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) oxalate and bis(2, 4, 6 -tricblorophenyl) oxalate were compared for their suitability to LC detection. A charge coupled device (CCD) was used to obtain the CL spectra of fluorophores and to investigate the CL emission background. Chapter three and four describes procedures for the determination of carboxylic acids in oils by pre column esterification with 9 -anthracenemethanol, reversed phase LC and either peroxyoxalate CL or fluorescence detection. The oils were dialysed prior to derivatisation to remove high molecular weight species which were found {{to interfere with the}} reaction. Carboxylic acids were present in the oxidised oils and their concentrations reflected the degree of degradation of the oils. The determination of aldehydes in oxidised oils is described in chapter five. The aldehydes in oil dialysates are labelled by reductive amination with 3 - aminofluoranthene and the derivatives separated by isocratic reversed-phase LC with peroxyoxalate CL detection using TCPO-hydrogen peroxide. Aldehydes were also found to be produced by the oxidation of oils in car engines. Thornton Research Centre, Shell Research Limite...|$|R
40|$|Les {{effluents}} aqueux pollués par des matières organiques provenant d'industries chimiques présentent souvent une faible biodégradabilité. Dans certains domaines de concentration (DCO = 0, 5 - 15 g/l), le procédé WPO® développé au laboratoire se substitue avantageusement à l'incinération pour traiter ce type d'effluents. La réaction, qui met en œuvre le réactif de Fenton à température élevée, conduit parfois à {{la formation}} de quantités importantes d'acides carboxyliques légers. Nous avons donc développé des systèmes catalytiques originaux remplaçant les sels de fer et conduisant à une oxydation totale des acides carboxyliques. Le système le plus efficace constitué de sels de fer, de cuivre et de manganèse permet d'obtenir, en 1 h à 100 °C, l'oxydation totale d'un mélange synthétique de ces acides (COT = 5 g/l) avec 1, 5 fois la quantité de peroxyde théoriquement nécessaire à l'oxydation. Le catalyseur précipité et séparé en fin de traitement peut être recyclé et conserve la môme activité. Les unités industrielles permettant d'effectuer le traitement WPO® avec les nouveaux catalyseurs, recyclés ou non, seront similaires à celle déjà réalisée pour le traitement de « points noirs » industriels. There {{is an important}} concern about the problems occuring with wastes elimination, specially the industrial liquid wastes. Te face the problem of organic aqueous wastes coming front various branches of industry, the WPO® (wet peroxide oxidation) process was developed at the laboratory. In the WAO process (wet air oxidation), which uses gaseous oxygen, the limiting step is usually oxygen transfer. In this new process, this problem is suppressed by using a <b>liquid</b> <b>oxidising</b> agent (hydrogen peroxide). This process is adapted from the classical Fenton's reaction and iron salts are used as the catalyst {{in order to promote}} the formation of •OH radicles which are the main active species. But the reaction is carried out at about 120 °C; so, a very significant TOC (total organic carton) removal efficiency is obtained (60 to 90 %) in comparison with the low efficiency of the classical Fenton's reagent (typically 25 % at room temperature). Significant amounts of free fatty acids are formed during the reaction. They are namely oxalic, malonic, succinic and acetic acids, which are common by products obtained during audition of most industrial organic pollutants. In order to comply with the regulations requirements, it was necessary to improve the efficiency of the original process. It was also very important to obtain an efficient elimination at a temperature not greater than 100 °C in order to avoid to pressurize the treatment reactor. This could be obtained by using new catalysts which are described in this paper. Because of the related field, precious metals like Pt and potentially toxic ones like Cr were not considered. One needs a treatment process as cheap and as reliable as possible. So, only Fe, Cu, Co, Ni and Mn were used as salts in order to test their calalytic activity in the treatment by hydrogen peroxide of a synthetical mixture of oxalic, malonic, succinic and acetic acids (O, M, S, A). The experimental device is a stirred tank reactor where the organics and the catalyst are batch loaded. It is continuously fed, for 1 hour, with hydrogen peroxide. The total amount injected is 1. 5 the stoechiometric amount. In table 1, {{it can be seen that}} any metal has a satisfactory activity when used alone (TOC removal efficiency cannot exceed 22 %). In table 2, it is clear that, in soma cases, the association of two or three metals with each other can lead to very important synergetic effects. When using a mixture of Fe, Cu and Mn, the removal efficiency can increase to 91 %. This Fe/Cu/Mn catalyst is studied with further details in table 4. It appears to have its best efficiency at about 100 °C because of a parasitic decomposition of the peroxide at higher temperatures. For an organic mixture coutaining 5 g TOC/l, 100 ppm of each metal is a convenient concentration. This new catalyst still needs an acidic pH, from 3 to about 5, but the dependency is not so strict than with Fe alone (original process) which needs a value from 3 to 3. 5. In addition, it was observed that the treatment time could be easily reduced (down to 45 minutes) as well as the amount of peroxide injected. Very similar results have been obtained with synthetic solutions of pollutants and with real industrial ones, thus establishing the ability of the Fe/Cu/Mn mixture to catalyse the oxidation of a large variety of species and not only carboxilic acids. The difference between the efficiency of this new catalyst and the conventional one is shown in table 5. Figures 1 and 2 are related to an Industrial WPO® unit which is commonly used with the conventional catalyst (Fe). It has been possible to improve its efficiency by using the new one without any significant modification. The Fe/Cu/Mn catalyst can be easily separated alter reaction (coprecipitation effect). Thus, the treated water meets the regulation requirements and the recovered catalyst can be easily resolubilized and recycled...|$|R
