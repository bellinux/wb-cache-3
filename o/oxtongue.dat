50|$|Like all plant viruses, LMV {{is totally}} {{harmless}} {{to the consumer}} but causes defects in heading, leaf distortions and leaf colour anomalies, which altogether result in the infected lettuce plants to be unmarketable. Disease rates can reach 100% locally, and therefore cause complete loss of the harvest. LMV can also infect other crops such as spinach and peas, as well as ornamentals (especially the Cape Daisy Osteospermum spp) and wild plants (especially the prickly lettuce Lactuca serriola and the <b>oxtongue</b> Helminthia echioides). All these plants, and probably others, can serve as local sources from which LMV can spread to crops.The virus typically targets the plant's nerve cells.|$|E

50|$|Scadoxus multiflorus (formerly Haemanthus multiflorus) is a {{bulbous plant}} native {{to most of}} sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Somalia to South Africa. It is also native to Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman) and to the Seychelles. It is {{naturalized}} in Mexico and in the Chagos Archipelago. It is grown as an ornamental plant for its brilliantly coloured flowers, either in containers or in the ground in where the climate is suitable. There are three recognized subspecies. Strongly toxic like other Scadoxus species, {{it has been used}} as a component of arrow poisons and fishing poisons, as well as in traditional medicine. Common names, some of which are used for other species, include blood lily, ball lily, blood flower, Katherine-wheel, <b>oxtongue</b> lily, poison root and powderpuff lily.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{hydroalcoholic}} extracts of edible {{plants from}} the Calabria region (Italy) were evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant and antiradical properties and in vivo topical anti-inflammatory activity. All the extracts had radical-scavenging and/or antioxidant properties, {{the most active}} plants being hawkweed <b>oxtongue</b> and viper’s bugloss. The best free radical (DPPH°) -scavenging activity was found in hawkweed <b>oxtongue</b> and chicory leaves extracts (IC 50 = 25 and 26 µg/ml, respectively). Hawkweed <b>oxtongue,</b> poppy and viper’s bugloss extracts showed the greatest inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation (IC 50 = 3 µg/ml). Viper’s bugloss and hawkweed <b>oxtongue</b> extracts had the greatest antioxidant effect on bovine brain peroxidation (IC 50 = 11 and 22 µg/ml). All the extracts also showed an anti-inflammatory effect: 300 µg/cm 2 provoked oedema reductions ranging from 18 % to 43 %. Cress was the most active plant.

40|$|The thesis explores how {{elemental}} {{architecture in}} collaboration with the Shield can manifest a threshold condition in which a modern day hero myth can be enacted in the Canadian wilderness. Through the lens of Joseph Campbell, Tom Thomson and the archetypal structures of the Finns and Algonkians, a design proposal is derived for a Waterway Park in the Algonquin region that expands the mandate of the Ontario Parks System. In the realm of psychology, Carl Gustav Jung defines individuation as a universal quest that encourages facing and overcoming ones internal demons in order to live a more integrated existence. Located in <b>Oxtongue</b> River Ragged Falls Provincial Park, this proposed experimental pilgrimage retreat connects a series of primary and secondary paths to cabins, a sweat lodge and a chapel.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding past {{reactions}} of ecosystems under natural and anthropic constraints is of crucial importance {{to anticipate the}} consequences of the current global changes. Unraveling natural and anthropic impacts on environments requires the reconstruction of ancient land-uses. As a part of a larger project aiming at developing new molecular biomarkers in soils that could be specific of their overlying vegetation, we have analyzed the neutral lipid content of soils developed under distinct types of plants. Soils were sampled around Lake Aydat, in Central France, of which the catchment is covered with pastures/meadows, forests and moors. The ketone/ester lipid fraction from soils under pastures or meadows contains a series of 14 pentacyclic triterpenyl acetates with a large structural diversity (Fig. 1). This discovery motivated an extensive phytochemical literature survey (240 references) that showed restricted potential sources of triterpenyl acetates. -amyrin, taraxeryl, glutinyl, -amyrin, and multiflorenyl, acetates are found in very distinct taxa and are thus poorly informative. Conversely, lupeyl, bauerenyl, isobauerenyl, taraxasteryl and -taraxasteryl acetates appear more specific since they are majoritary reported in Asteraceae. Pichierenyl, isopichierenyl and gammacerenyl acetates seem to be the more specific ones since they are produced by a single known species, Picris hieracioides L. (hawkweed <b>oxtongue,</b> Asteraceae) ...|$|E
