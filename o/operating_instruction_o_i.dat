In the present report, a 28 -year-old male patient was treated for localized chronic periodontitis with pocket formation, mobility, pathologic migration and malalignment of maxillary left lateral incisor tooth # 22. The periodontal therapy included motivation, education and oral-hygiene <b>instructions</b> (<b>O.</b> H. <b>I.),</b> scaling and root planing and periodontal flap surgery. Subsequently on resolution of periodontal inflammation, orthodontic therapy was carried out using the orthodontic aligner for a period of 6 months. Post-treatment (3 years) results showed complete resolution of infrabony pocket with significant bone fill, reduced tooth mobility and complete alignment of the affected maxillary left lateral incisor, thus restoring the esthetics and function...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} a {{software}} product is determined by its usability; the quality of technical documentation is determined by its comprehensibility. Usability conceptualizes the person using a software product to perform a task; comprehensibility deals with the reader of operating instructions—although they are generally {{one and the same}} person. However, only rarely are the software and technical documentation part of an integrated design. This is all the more surprising in that, on the technical level, the boundary between software and user information is becoming increasingly blurred; one need only think of the hypertext links between software and help systems, or of electronic versions of <b>operating</b> <b>instructions.</b> We make the case for considering user, software, and <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> as a single system oriented toward performing a task; the <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> therefore are regarded as a subsidiary subsystem of a structure to be described. This is done from a linguistic perspective, with reference to the central category of knowledge available to the user or contained in the software and in the <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> and that we approach via an empirical analysis of authentic material (<b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> as primary data, statements of end users concerning <b>operating</b> <b>instructions).</b> Taking the example of creating software and <b>operating</b> <b>instructions</b> for a computer tomograph, we show how the relevant knowledge elements contribute to the accomplishment of an operating task and discuss the resultant requirements concerning the contents of software and <b>operating</b> <b>instructions,</b> particularly for handling fault and problem situations.

40|$|Production and {{annealing}} of oxygen-vacancy (VO) and oxygen-carbon (C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i,</b> C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> I) {{defects in}} germanium-doped Czochralski-grown silicon (Cz-Si) containing carbon are investigated. All {{the samples were}} irradiated with 2 MeV fast electrons. Radiation-produced defects are studied using infrared spectroscopy by monitoring the relevant bands in optical spectra. For the VO defects, it is established that the doping with Ge affects the thermal stability of VO (830 cm - 1) defects {{as well as their}} fraction converted to VO 2 (888 cm - 1) defects. In Ge-free samples containing carbon, it was found that carbon impurity atoms do not affect the thermal stability of VO defects, although they affect the fraction of VO defects that is converted to VO 2 complexes. Considering the oxygen-carbon complexes, it is established that the annealing of the 862 cm - 1 band associated with the C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> defects is accompanied with the emergence of the 1048 cm - 1 band, which has earlier been assigned to the C s <b>O</b> 2 <b>i</b> center. The evolution of the C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> I bands is also traced. Ge doping does not seem to affect the thermal stability of the C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> and C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> I defects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insights into the stability of the defect clusters (VO, C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i,</b> C <b>i</b> <b>O</b> <b>i</b> I) at an atomic level. Both experimental and theoretical results are consistent with the viewpoint that Ge affects the stability of the VO but does not influence the stability of the oxygen-carbon clusters. DFT calculations demonstrate that C attracts both <b>O</b> <b>i</b> and VO pairs predominately forming next nearest neighbor clusters in contrast to Ge where the interactions with <b>O</b> <b>i</b> and VO are more energetically favorable at nearest neighbor configurations...|$|R
40|$|Recent laboratory, geophysical, and {{theoretical}} determinations of the <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (7990 A) and <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (11, 287 A) branching ratios {{indicate that the}} generally used values based on the NBS transition parameters need revision. The <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (7990 A) branching ratio is about 300 times smaller than the NBS value, and the <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (11, 287 A) is about one-quarter as large. The transitions are important in the generation of permitted atomic oxygen spectra in several types of astronomical source, including the Orion Nebula (M 42), the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151, Arcturus, and comets. The absence of the <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (7990 A) emission in M 42 and NGC 4151 is consistent with its very small branching ratio, and previous conclusions based on its absence, such as the rejection of starlight excitation in the Seyfert galaxy, require reinvestigation. The reduction of the <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (11, 287 A) branching ratio is pertinent to hydrogen L-beta fluorescence excitation of <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (1304 A) and <b>O</b> <b>I</b> (8446 A) emission and requires an upward revision of oxygen production rates in comets...|$|R
