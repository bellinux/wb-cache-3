5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} {{directly}} controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Unlike previous games in the series, the player can also control the camera with the right analog stick, allowing for a 360° view of the surroundings. While in towns and cities, the player may only see {{from the perspective of}} Vaan, but any character may be controlled in the field. The world of Final Fantasy XII is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier Final Fantasy games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the overworld on foot, Chocobo, or by airship. Players may save their game to a memory card using save crystals <b>or</b> <b>gate</b> crystals, and may use the latter to teleport between gate crystals. An in-game bestiary provides incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XII.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius <b>or</b> <b>Gate</b> of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m.

25|$|Karnaugh {{maps are}} used to simplify {{real-world}} logic requirements {{so that they can}} be implemented using a minimum number of physical logic gates. A sum-of-products expression can always be implemented using AND gates feeding into an <b>OR</b> <b>gate,</b> and a product-of-sums expression leads to OR gates feeding an AND gate. Karnaugh maps can also be used to simplify logic expressions in software design. Boolean conditions, as used for example in conditional statements, can get very complicated, which makes the code difficult to read and to maintain. Once minimised, canonical sum-of-products and product-of-sums expressions can be implemented directly using AND and OR logic operators.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{additional}} signaling {{and observation}} towers were frequently built outside the city, and were sometimes fortified in a castle-like fashion. The {{border of the}} area of influence {{of the city was}} often partially or fully defended by elaborate ditches, walls and hedges. The crossing points were usually guarded by gates <b>or</b> <b>gate</b> houses. These defenses were regularly checked by riders, who often also served as the gate keepers. Long stretches of these defenses can still be seen to this day, and even some gates are still intact. To further protect their territory, rich cities also established castles in their area of influence. An example of this practice is the Romanian Bran Castle, which was intended to protect nearby Kronstadt (today's Braşov).|$|E
25|$|Radio {{remote control}} (RF remote control) {{is used to}} control distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric garage door <b>or</b> <b>gate</b> openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control duplicator because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.|$|E

Twice it served as the entry-point for an emperor's triumphal return: in 1126, when John II Komnenos returned from the recapture of his ancestral Kastamonu, and in 1168, when Manuel I Komnenos returned from his victorious campaign against Hungary.|$|E
500|$|The mould {{consists}} of two primary components, the injection mould (A plate) and the ejector mould (B plate). These components are {{also referred to as}} moulder and mouldmaker.

500|$|With no working prototypes, Green {{set about}} {{building}} seven lifts. The principle was simple. Two caissons were suspended from three carrying wheels of [...] diameter, by wrought iron chains.

The caisson at the top was jacked {{against the back wall}} in a similar manner. When both boats were in, the doors on the caissons and lift were closed, and the jacks released. Because a boat displaces its own weight in water, the system should be balanced, and a small amount of energy is required to start the boats moving. When the top caisson reaches the bottom, the jacks are applied, the doors are opened, and the boats can continue.|$|E
