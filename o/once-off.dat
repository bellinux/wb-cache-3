5|$|In response, unions {{across the}} United States {{prepared}} {{a general strike}} {{in support of the}} event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed {{as a result of the}} Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a <b>once-off</b> event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.|$|E

25|$|There was no grand final in 1924; a <b>once-off</b> finals {{system was}} trialled, {{in which the}} top four contested a round robin, with the top team from the round robin to face the minor premiers in a grand final if required; but, when minor premiers Essendon also won the round robin, no grand final was staged.|$|E

In that season's Busta Cup (the renamed Red Stripe Cup), he played for West Indies B, a development team drawn from across the Caribbean. Against Bangladesh A (competing as a guest team), he scored 61 runs, his second first-class half-century. For the 2002–03 Red Stripe Bowl, the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national team competed separately, with Martin featuring in all four of their matches. He took ten wickets, including 4/52 against the University of the West Indies, which made him his team's leading wicket-taker (and equal seventh overall).|$|E
25|$|Ahmed {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut in November 1932, playing a <b>once-off</b> {{game for the}} Rawalpindi Sports Club in the semi-final of the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament. A right-arm medium pacer, he took 3/145 on debut in the only innings of his opponent, the Freelooters, with his victims including future Indian Test players Amar Singh and Vijay Merchant. Ahmed's performance there led to a guest appearance for Patiala later in the season, playing under the captaincy of Maharajah of Patiala's son, Yadavindra Singh. The team's opponent was the touring Ceylonese national team, and Ahmed took the wickets of two top-order batsmen in Ceylon's first innings, finishing with 2/15. While batting in Patiala's second innings, he put on 35 runs for the last wicket with Mohammad Nissar, though this {{was not enough to}} prevent Ceylon winning by 63 runs.|$|E
500|$|Del Rey first previewed a verse of [...] "West Coast" [...] {{in a live}} {{performance}} at a show in Las Vegas on April 11, 2014. She then premiered the song live in a performance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 13, 2014. She performed the song afront a natural backdrop of palm trees while donning a sundress, and during the rendition descended from the stage to kiss audience members. The performance resulted in Del Rey becoming the most-mentioned artist at Coachella on Twitter during the festival's first weekend. According to Keith Caulfield of Billboard, the song's reception at Coachella largely contributed to its debut of number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100. VH1's Meghan O'Keeffe said the rendition was met with rave reviews and that [...] "the crowd ate it up". Lipshutz commented, [...] "Del Rey's Coachella performance {{was so strong that}} [...] would have been forgiven if 'West Coast' proved to be a dud, but thankfully, the new single sounded like a winner when played live for the first time". On April 15, 2014, she performed the track as part of a <b>once-off</b> show at the Comerica Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona. According to Jim Louvau of the Phoenix New Times, Del Rey's rendition received a [...] "great reception," [...] while Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic called it [...] "a sultry majesty".|$|E
500|$|On 7 October, RCA Music Group {{announced}} it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material (including their next studio album) on the RCA Records brand. Also in October, frontman Matt Tuck announced {{that he will be}} working on a new side project which he has described as [...] "metal as fuck", influenced by bands such as Pantera and Slipknot. On 1 May 2012, it was revealed that the project will be called AxeWound, and will feature Liam Cormier, Mike Kingswood, Joe Copcutt and Jason Bowld. In May 2012, it was announced that Bullet for My Valentine would be playing at the South African music festival Oppikoppi, as well as a <b>once-off</b> gig in Cape Town alongside Seether and Enter Shikari. They were slated to play in the country for the Coke Zero Fest of 2009, but pulled out at the last minute to record Fever. It was confirmed on 6 August that the final recording session of the band's fourth studio record was complete, and that the album would be out sometime in late 2012. Later that month on the 17th, the second line-up for the Australian music festival Soundwave was announced, containing Bullet for My Valentine.|$|E

2500|$|Between {{then and}} the First World War, the {{competition}} expanded. Kimberley (who {{became known as}} Griqualand West for the 1892-93 season) and Transvaal were joined by Western Province (1892–93), Natal, Eastern Province (both 1893-94), Border (1897–98) and Orange Free State (1903–04) [...] although {{not all of these}} teams competed in every season after they were established. Rhodesia and South Western Districts also competed on a <b>once-off</b> basis in the 1904-05 season.|$|E
2500|$|In 1951-52, the {{competition}} adopted a two-tiered structure, which was retained in some format until 1999-2000 (except for a <b>once-off</b> recombination {{into a single}} division in 1960-61). From its inception until South Africa's international isolation in 1971, a promotion/relegation structure linked the two tiers, with {{the winner of the}} lower division generally replacing the last placed team from the top division [...] although this was not adhered to every season. The top division generally consisted of four or five teams.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the one-dayers, Tests are almost never held in neutral venues. A <b>once-off</b> triangular Test tournament was held in England in 1912, which saw South Africa play Australia in three tests at neutral venues, but otherwise it has only been security risks which have seen Tests played on neutral soil. Most notably, Pakistan has [...] "hosted" [...] Test series in England, the UAE and Sri Lanka in the 21st century.

2500|$|The 1987 {{championship}} {{threw up}} some interesting surprises. [...] Galway put down an early signal of intent by claiming the National League title at Clare's expense. [...] In Munster Tipperary defeated Cork after a thrilling draw and a replay to deny 'the Rebels' a record-breaking six-in-a-row. [...] In Leinster Kilkenny broke {{back to take}} the title and book an All-Ireland final spot against Galway. The prospect of becoming {{the first team to}} lose three consecutive championship deciders weighed heavily on the Galway team and probably gave them an extra impetus to win. [...] The game was not a classic by any standard and Noel Lane got a key goal for Galway nine minutes before the end. [...] A 1-12 to 0-9 victory gave Galway a second All-Ireland title of the decade and proved that their win in 1980 was not a <b>once-off.</b>|$|E
