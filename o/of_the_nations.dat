5|$|Hitler {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of the fortifications in 1942. Almost a million French workers were drafted to build it. The wall was frequently mentioned in Nazi propaganda, where its size and strength were usually exaggerated. The fortifications included colossal coastal guns, batteries, mortars, and artillery, and thousands of German troops were stationed in its defences. When the Allies eventually invaded the Normandy beaches in 1944, most of the defences were stormed within hours. Today, ruins of the wall exist in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> where it was built, although many structures have fallen into the ocean or have been demolished over the years.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{destroying}} confiscated ivory, a government {{could choose to}} sell it, and put the funds to use in one of several ways. Several of the countries involved in the ivory trade, especially those {{on the supply side}} in Africa, are also some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> which struggle the most with poverty. Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used {{to improve the quality of}} life for human citizens.|$|E

5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> in which the trails were located.|$|E

5|$|This {{painting}} is considered among Matejko's most famous works {{and is also}} one of his largest canvases. It portrays an event of significant political triumph for Poland, the Prussian Homage, in which Poland was able to enforce its will over Prussia. Prussia latter gained independence and turned against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, becoming one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> that divided Poland among them. Matejko's painting was created during the partition period, when independent Poland had ceased to exist, and like many of Matejko's other works, it aimed to remind the Polish people of their most famous historical triumphs.|$|E
5|$|Various {{different}} {{mechanisms for}} commissioning {{the construction of}} war memorials emerged during the inter-war period. In most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> involved in the conflict, the memorials erected in towns and cities were usually commissioned by local community leaders and other civic groups, with relatively little or no central state involvement. Some national organisations emerged, including the British War Memorials Committee and the Canadian War Memorials Fund, but these focused on narrow, limited projects, {{rather than trying to}} coordinate a national response. The local processes and committees could result in multiple memorials being created for the same community or event: the site of Verdun was commemorated by three different memorials, for example, while some British towns saw rival memorials created by competing groups in the community.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{in one of}} Eorzea's {{three main}} states, the player {{character}} awakes to the Echo, a power granting them {{the ability to see}} the past. The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean pretense, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies. Eventually, a greater threat is brought to the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals. With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with a significant percentage of the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nations</b> involved.|$|E
