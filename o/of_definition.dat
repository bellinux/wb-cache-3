5|$|Breadth <b>of</b> <b>{{definition}}</b> of a good: The broader {{the definition}} of a good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} <b>of</b> <b>definition</b> are considerable in some cases. For example, Haswell-Smith (2004) treats Lunga as {{a single}} island, although during high tides it becomes one inhabited island and numerous uninhabited tidal islets. Another example is the smaller island of Eilean Mòr in Loch Dunvegan, which joins with nearby Eilean Dubh and Garay Island at low tides.|$|E

25|$|Pascal {{also used}} De l'Esprit géométrique {{to develop a}} theory <b>of</b> <b>definition.</b> He {{distinguished}} between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.|$|E

25|$|The {{transfer}} of energy between an open {{system and a}} single contiguous subsystem of its surroundings is considered also in non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The problem <b>of</b> <b>definition</b> arises also in this case. It may be allowed that the wall between the system and the subsystem is not only permeable to matter and to internal energy, but also may be movable so as to allow {{work to be done}} when the two systems have different pressures. In this case, the {{transfer of}} energy as heat is not defined.|$|E
25|$|In Hellenistic Egypt, the {{mathematician}} Euclid {{laid down}} the foundations of mathematical rigor and introduced the concepts <b>of</b> <b>definition,</b> axiom, theorem and proof still in use today in his Elements, considered the most influential textbook ever written. Archimedes, {{considered one of the}} greatest mathematicians of all time, is credited with using the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of Pi. He is also known in physics for laying the foundations of hydrostatics, statics, and the explanation of the principle of the lever.|$|E

25|$|The {{city centre}} of Bergen {{lies in the}} west of the municipality, facing the fjord of Byfjorden. It is among a group of {{mountains}} known as the Seven Mountains, although the number is a matter <b>of</b> <b>definition.</b> From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. Årstad, inner Laksevåg and Sandviken), {{the majority of the population}} lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by apartment buildings and modern terraced houses (e.g. Fyllingsdalen), others are dominated by single-family homes.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{concepts in}} point-set topology are continuity, compactness, and connectedness. Intuitively, continuous functions take nearby points to nearby points. Compact sets {{are those that}} can be covered by finitely many sets of arbitrarily small size. Connected sets are sets that cannot {{be divided into two}} pieces that are far apart. The words nearby, arbitrarily small, and far apart can all be made precise by using open sets. If we change the definition of open set, we change what continuous functions, compact sets, and connected sets are. Each choice <b>of</b> <b>definition</b> for open set is called a topology. A set with a topology is called a topological space.|$|E

The book’s original {{approach to the}} problems <b>of</b> <b>definition</b> of art, organic wholes, interpretation, popular art, and the ethics of taste brought him international fame as the book was translated into 14 languages and several editions were published. Shusterman’s position was further strengthened by three subsequent publications: Practicing Philosophy in 1997, Performing Live in 2000, and Surface and Depth in 2002; in which he continued the pragmatist tradition, raising significant interest, provoking numerous critiques and stimulating debates not only among professional philosophers, but {{in the areas of}} literary and cultural studies as well.|$|E
