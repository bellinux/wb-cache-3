500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Many reviews found the game avoided some of Aerosmith's [...] "more popular sugar-coated hits...like 'Amazing', 'Crazy', or 'I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing'", but felt that other major Aerosmith songs could {{have also been}} included. Game Informer noted that [...] "creating a band specific game was smart", but that [...] "very little has changed from the base game". They also complimented the great job that Activision did with their motion captures of Aerosmith. The difficulty of the game {{was not to be}} found as hard as Guitar Hero III due to the [...] "very riff-friendly guitarist" [...] Joe Perry; while reviewers felt this was a good correction from the previous game, they also noted that the easiness of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith led to some bland tiers, repetitive musical sections, and lack of any significant difficulty curve. The length of the game was poorly received, with reviewers commenting {{that it is difficult to}} justify the title priced equivalently as other next-generation console full games. Eurogamer commented that one's appreciation for the game [...] "lives or dies based on [...] fondness for Aerosmith", and that ultimately, with other available music games that offer additional downloadable songs, a game that focuses on a single band would need [...] "to offer gameplay innovations, spectacular fan service, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more material" [...] than what Guitar Hero: Aerosmith provides. Reviews also noted the sparseness of downloadable content.|$|E
