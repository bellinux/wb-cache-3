5|$|During a December 4, 2005, game at Heinz Field, T. J. Houshmandzadeh of the Cincinnati Bengals {{wiped his}} feet on a Towel after he scored a touchdown. Although the Bengals managed a 7-point victory in that regular season game, the Steelers came back to defeat them 3117 in the playoffs, <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> victory in Super Bowl XL. The Bengals did not reach the playoffs again until the 2009-10 season, after Houshmandzadeh had left the team.|$|E
5|$|The 1974–75 NHL {{season was}} memorable for the Sabres' Stanley Cup Finals appearance. The Sabres {{finished}} {{first in the}} newly reformatted league's Adams Division, and the French Connection members each {{finished in the top}} ten in league scoring. The Sabres defeated original six teams Chicago Black Hawks and Montreal Canadiens <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Finals appearance against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Sabres lost the series four games to two. 1975 was the closest Perreault would come to winning the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's subterfuge succeeded, as {{he managed}} to bargain the inebriated Bolton {{directors}} down to £10,890. He was less successful {{in his attempt to}} sign Jimmy McGrory from Celtic. He had set up a meeting with Celtic manager Willie Maley and young McGrory in summer 1928 when Maley and McGrory were <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pilgrimage in Lourdes. A huge sum was offered (a blank cheque, some say) for the prolific McGrory, and Maley was more than ready to accept, for Celtic needed money to pay for their new stand. The deal fell through when McGrory, a homesick young Scotsman with an intense love for Celtic, refused to sign. He later (in 1935) broke the all-time goalscoring record.|$|E

5|$|After a mildly {{successful}} {{period in}} the 1960s, where they stood among the top contenders, Southern European teams started to lose influence in the European stage during the 1970s, as Dutch and German teams appeared stronger. In the 1971–72 European Cup, Benfica lost in the semi-finals to a Johan Cruyff-led Ajax <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> second consecutive win. Benfica reached the quarter-finals of the 1974–75 European Cup Winners' Cup, before being eliminated by another Dutch team, PSV Eindhoven. Over {{the course of the}} late 1970s, as historic players like Eusébio and Simões retired, Benfica could not maintain the same performance of the previous decade, and only secured two European Cup quarter-final presences. In 1975–76, they lost 5–1 to the holders Bayern Munich, and in 1977–78, they were knocked out by the defending champions Liverpool with a 6–2 aggregate score.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, Sinclair {{scored three}} goals for Canada <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{surprising}} fourth-place finish, their best in that competition to date. During the team's first group stage match against Germany, she scored the first {{goal of the}} match in the fourth minute. Germany scored four goals to defeat Canada 4–1. After defeating Argentina 3–0, the team faced Japan in their last group stage match of the tournament. With goals from Sinclair and teammates Christine Latham and Kara Lang, Canada won 3–1 and placed second in their group {{to advance to the}} knockout stage. Canada faced China in the quarterfinal match on October 2 in Portland, Oregon and won 1–0 with the lone goal scored by Charmaine Hooper in the seventh minute. Having remained winless in all previous World Cup tournaments, Canada's advancement to the semifinal was a historic change for the team. Canada was defeated by Sweden in the semifinal match 2–1 and faced the United States in the third-place match where they were defeated 3–1 and finished fourth at the tournament. Sinclair scored Canada's goal in the 38th minute.|$|E
5|$|Bill Frieder, who {{had been}} an {{assistant}} coach for seven years, took over from Orr in 1980. He coached the school's first post-season basketball champions during the 1983–84 season {{and the following two}} teams were back-to-back conference champions. The 1983–84 team compiled a 24–9 overall (11–7, Big Ten) record <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> NIT championship victory over Notre Dame. The 1984–85 team went 26–4 overall (16–2, Big Ten), which earned Frieder Big Ten and AP National Coach of the Year honors. The 1985–86 team, which finished 28–5 overall (14–4, Big Ten), started the season with sixteen victories to make a total of thirty-three consecutive regular season victories. Frieder earned five of Michigan's six consecutive NCAA births from 1985–90, currently the longest streak in program history. Roy Tarpley led the 1985 team as Big Ten MVP. Frieder resigned, upon request, immediately prior to the 1989 NCAA tournament to assume the coaching job for the Arizona State Sun Devils men's basketball team.|$|E

5|$|Hungarian {{international}} Zoltán Szélesi {{joined the}} squad in training {{ahead of their}} next match against Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni. They came from behind to record a 2–1 win in a feisty encounter, with Steve MacLean scoring the decisive goal. Argyle returned to England to play against Morecambe on 25 July 2009, and included a triallist called Réda Johnson in their defence, who appeared in the match under a pseudonym. Two second half goals ensured that they left Christie Park with a win. The club's only pre-season friendly to take place at Home Park was against Scottish club Heart of Midlothian on 29 July 2009. Neither side could break the deadlock in a dour 0–0 draw. Swindon Town were the opposition for Argyle's penultimate friendly. A goal from Marcel Seip after 57 minutes set the visitors <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 2–0 victory at manager Paul Sturrock's old club. Argyle's final pre-season match took place on 3 August 2009 against Tiverton Town. A young team containing only two senior professionals, Yoann Folly and Simon Walton, secured a 1–0 win at Ladysmead.|$|E
5|$|In 1069 the exiles {{returned}} to England, {{to join a}} spreading revolt in the north. Even though Gospatric and Siward's son Waltheof submitted {{by the end of}} the year, the arrival of a Danish army under Sweyn Estridsson seemed to ensure that William's position remained weak. Malcolm decided on war, and took his army south into Cumbria and across the Pennines, wasting Teesdale and Cleveland then marching north, loaded with loot, to Wearmouth. There Malcolm met Edgar and his family, who were invited to return with him, but did not. As Sweyn had by now been bought off with a large Danegeld, Malcolm took his army home. In reprisal, William sent Gospatric to raid Scotland through Cumbria. In return, the Scots fleet raided the Northumbrian coast where Gospatric's possessions were concentrated. Late in the year, perhaps shipwrecked <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> European exile, Edgar and his family again arrived in Scotland, this time to remain. By the end of 1070, Malcolm had married Edgar's sister Margaret of Wessex, the future Saint Margaret of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|McCall {{came through}} City's youth system {{after he was}} signed by George Mulhall in 1980 from Farsley Celtic {{at the age of}} 16, before {{becoming}} an apprentice in June 1981. Mulhall's successor, Roy McFarland gave McCall his first-team debut at Reading on 28 August 1982 – the opening day of the 1982–83 season – when he deputised for Ces Podd at right back. He had played just six league games by 29 January 1983 when he made the first of 134 consecutive league appearances, all in midfield under new manager Trevor Cherry. City finished 12th in Division Three that season. The following season City struggled {{to make up for the}} absence of Bobby Campbell, who had left to join Derby County, and won just one of their first fifteen games, until Cherry bought Campbell back from Derby, and City won a record ten consecutive games <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> seventh place finish.|$|E

5|$|Pirlo {{curled in}} a free-kick to seal a 2–0 defeat of Parma {{on the opening}} day of the new Serie A season. The goal caused much controversy, as the Parma players protested that it had not gone over the line, and replays proved inconclusive. In the {{following}} league match against Udinese on 2 September, Pirlo helped to win a penalty and assisted Sebastian Giovinco's second goal of the match, as Juventus went on to defeat the home side 4–1. On 29 September, Pirlo opened the scoring when he dispatched a trade mark free kick to send Juventus <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 4–1 defeat of Roma. Pirlo was nominated for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or, along with Juventus and Italy teammate Gianluigi Buffon, following their performances throughout the calendar year. Pirlo provided three assists for Juventus during the Group Stage, helping them to top their group undefeated and advance to the knockout stages for first time since the 2008–09 tournament. Pirlo was also elected the 2012 Serie A Footballer of the Year, as well as the best midfielder of the season, also winning the 2012 Guerin d'Oro. He was named as part of the 2012 Serie A team of the Year for his performances. Pirlo also won the Pallone Azzurro, given to the best player {{of the year in the}} Italian National Team, as well as placing fourth in the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker of the Year Award, and seventh in the FIFA Ballon d'Or. Pirlo and Juventus retained their Serie A title that season. Juventus were, however, eliminated by Bayern Munich in the quarter finals of the UEFA Champions League, and in the semi finals of the Coppa Italia by Lazio; both of these teams were the winners of these respective competitions.|$|E

It was the fastest fifty ever by a West Indies player, and more importantly, it had brought West Indies within reach of victory.|$|E
