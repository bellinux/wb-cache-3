40|$|Many {{different}} casing formulae {{have been}} proposed to determine the airblast-effective equivalent weight from the actual weight of HE in cased charges. Equivalent weight {{is needed to determine}} blastparameters as peak <b>overpressure</b> <b>or</b> specific blastimpulse from available standard curves for bare explosives. As different casing formulae result in very different equivalent weight, it was necessary to check them by new tests. It was found that semiempirical casing formulae are not more useful than simple linear approximation formulae. There is no theoretical approach that allows to determine the equivalent mass correctly. Casing formulae are proposed here that possibly enable a new theoretical approach...|$|R
50|$|The International Organization for Standardization {{issued a}} {{standard}} for water-resistant watches which also prohibits the term waterproof {{to be used with}} watches, which many countries have adopted. This standard was introduced in 1990 as the ISO 2281:1990 and only designed for watches intended for ordinary daily use and are resistant to water during exercises such as swimming for a short period. They may be used under conditions where water pressure and temperature vary; German Industrial Norm DIN 8310 is an equivalent standard. However, whether they bear an additional indication of <b>overpressure</b> <b>or</b> not, they are not intended for submarine diving.|$|R

50|$|Pneumatic {{artificial}} muscles (PAMs) operate {{by filling}} a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying gas {{pressure to the}} bladder, isotropic volume expansion occurs, but is confined by braided wires that encircle the bladder, translating the volume expansion to a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. PAMs can be classified by their operation and design; namely, PAMs feature pneumatic <b>or</b> hydraulic operation, <b>overpressure</b> <b>or</b> underpressure operation, braided/netted or embedded membranes and stretching membranes or rearranging membranes.

5000|$|Solid {{propellant}} boosters are not controllable {{and must}} generally burn until exhaustion after ignition, unlike liquid propellant or cold-gas propulsion systems. However, launch abort systems and range safety destruct systems can attempt {{to cut off}} propellant flow by using shaped charges. [...] estimates for SRB failure rates have ranged from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100,000. SRB assemblies have failed suddenly and catastrophically. Nozzle blocking or deformation can lead to <b>overpressure</b> <b>or</b> a reduction in thrust, while defects in the boosters casing or stage couplings can cause the assembly to break apart by increasing aerodynamic stresses. Additional failure modes include bore choking and combustion instability.
