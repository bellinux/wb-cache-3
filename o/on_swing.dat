25|$|The bogies for the {{new cars}} were a new design, {{specifically}} prepared by Vicers Ruwolt. The suspension was based on coil springs, with a secondary cast bolster with spring plank, supported <b>on</b> <b>swing</b> links and coil springs. Each bogie weighed 7000kg, with a wheelbase of 2,445mm and a maximum axle load of 14 tonnes, and were designed for operation at up to 130km/h. Tread brakes were fitted, operated by Westinghouse model 250WF brake cylinders. The axle boxes utilised spherical roller bearings, and {{all parts of the}} bogie, except the wheels and axles themselves, were designed for conversion to standard gauge. This latter function was finally used in 2009 when the Mangalore to Albury line was converted to standard gauge.|$|E
25|$|Cold Food Festival; this solar-based holiday on April 5 (concurrent {{with the}} Qingming Festival) was named so because no fires {{were allowed to}} be lit for three days, hence no warmed or hot food. It was a time to respect one's {{ancestors}} by maintaining their tombs and offering sacrifices, while a picnic would be held later in the day. It was also a time for fun in outdoor activities, with amusement <b>on</b> <b>swing</b> sets, playing cuju football, horse polo, and tug of war. In the year 710, Emperor Zhongzong of Tang had his chief ministers, sons-in-law, and military officers engage {{in a game of}} tug of war, and purportedly laughed when the oldest ministers fell over. The imperial throne also presented porridge to officials, and even dyed chicken and duck eggs, similar to the practice on Easter in the Western world.|$|E

25|$|Resonance {{is simple}} to {{understand}} if {{the spring and}} mass are viewed as energy storage elements – with the mass storing kinetic energy and the spring storing potential energy. As discussed earlier, when the mass and spring have no external force acting on them they transfer energy back and forth at a rate equal to the natural frequency. In other words, to efficiently pump energy into both mass and spring requires that the energy source feed the energy in at a rate equal to the natural frequency. Applying a force to the mass and spring is similar to pushing a child <b>on</b> <b>swing,</b> a push is needed at the correct moment to make the swing get higher and higher. As {{in the case of}} the swing, the force applied need not be high to get large motions, but must just add energy to the system.|$|E
25|$|After one Thomson over on {{the third}} day the gloom made the umpires pull stumps with England 1/0. Dennis Amiss had made his name as a heavy scoring batsman with tallies of 663 runs (82.87) in the West Indies in 1973–74 and 370 runs (92.50) against India and 220 runs (55.00) against Pakistan in 1974 with five big centuries to his credit. He needed only 93 runs to make 1381 runs in 1974 and equal the record made by Bobby Simpson in 1964. Here, on a flat wicket at Melbourne he showed his talent in Australia by making 70 runs in an opening stand of 115 in the first session against Lillee, Thomson and Walker. David Lloyd looked less certain and gave several chances, {{including}} a catch by Ian Chappell which the Australian captain indicated had hit the ground before he took it, much to everyone's surprise. Ashley Mallett (4/60) slowed the run rate and just before lunch tricked LLoyd (44) and had him caught and bowled when the left-hander tried to drive a turning ball. With the pitch taking spin Dennis Lillee slowed his pace and concentrated <b>on</b> <b>swing</b> and after swearing at the gentlemanly Colin Cowdrey was hit through mid-wicket where Greg Chappell leapt across his brother at first slip to take a catch. Jeff Thomson (4/71) took a spell of 3/13 in six overs, having John Edrich caught behind, Denness caught by Ian Chappell and Knott was caught behind. He hit Fred Titmus painfully {{on the back of his}} knee, which held up the match before until he could struggle back to his feet. Ian Chappell caught Amiss off Mallett ten runs short of his century and 3 runs short of Simpson's record. Mallet also bowled Titmus for a 31-minute duck and had Underwood caught by the captain as England collapsed from 152/2 to 182/8. As at Brisbane Tony Greig restored the situation thrashing 5 fours and a six in his 60 and adding 66 runs with Bob Willis (15) for the ninth wicket before Greg Chappell snatched a catch off a ball heading to the third man boundary. The limping Hendrick came out to help add a few runs, but Willis was bowled trying to drive Thomson, who had now taken 24 wickets in three Tests, an average of four wickets in each England innings. The total of 244 left Australia 365 minutes to make 246 runs to win their third Test in succession.|$|E
500|$|Music {{supervisor}} Ivan Pavlovich {{stated that}} Rockstar's focus on authenticity and realism inspired the composers {{to reflect the}} focus in the music. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was a flexible process [...] "about setting a mood", {{as opposed to a}} [...] "mechanical" [...] process in which the music was specifically composed to fit with the time frames of the game; the composers decided to focus on the latter after the music was produced. They also attempted to compose something that felt accessible to players, avoiding exclusively focusing <b>on</b> <b>swing</b> or jazz. Andrew Hale felt that the orchestral score assisted in this.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} for a bowler to concentrate solely on speed, especially when young, but as fast bowlers mature they pick up new skills and tend to rely more <b>on</b> <b>swing</b> bowling or seam bowling techniques. Most fast bowlers will specialise {{in one of these}} two areas and will sometimes be categorised as swing or seam bowler. However, this classification is not satisfactory because the categories are not mutually exclusive and a skilled bowler will usually bowl a mixture of fast, swinging, seaming and also cutting balls, even if he prefers one style to the others. [...] For simplicity, it is common to subdivide fast bowlers according to the average speed of their deliveries, as follows.|$|E

Production started in December 1943 at Büssing-NAG. Early examples used a truck-like, unarmored cabin similar to the earlier half-tracks it replaced, while later examples featured an armored cabin and engine compartment that looked similar to the Sd.Kfz. 251 armored personnel carrier. Like the earlier Demag-designed Sd.Kfz. 10, the sWS's suspension system consisted of five double roadwheels per side, overlapping and interleaved in the [...] layout, mounted <b>on</b> <b>swing</b> arms sprung by torsion bars. One idler wheel, mounted at the rear end of each track unit, was used to control track tension.|$|E
