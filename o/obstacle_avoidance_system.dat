40|$|An {{autonomous}} {{underwater vehicle}} (AUV), Autosub 6000, {{has been shown to}} operate safely at altitudes as low as 3  m above rugged and complex sea floor environments. This capability is essential for future AUV missions in such environments, e. g. high-resolution surveys using colour photography or multi-beam sonar bathymetry. This was achieved through the development of an <b>obstacle</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> for the AUV, incorporating relatively low-cost off-the-shelf components and simple algorithms. This paper details the specification, design, and testing at sea of Autosub 6000 's <b>obstacle</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system.</b> It describes how the specification of the system was influenced by the need to retrofit it into the existing control architecture, together with the pragmatic need to minimize overall complexity. The sensor used in the <b>obstacle</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> is a mechanically scanned forward-looking sonar, and the control algorithm is based upon the detection of the range and elevation of the horizon relative to the AUV. The avoidance behaviour is by default to fly over obstacles but, if this is not possible, a turn-around and retry collision avoidance algorithm is invoked. Results are presented of the system's performance during recent deep-water trials of the AUV over the Casablanca Seamount region of the Atlantic Ocean...|$|E

Some of the reviewed work include an automatic braking system that safely stops an automobile while approaching an obstruction to avoid collision. Another separate but related system is to have a detection device, which alerts the driver in case the automobile veers off the road by crossing either the centre or side painted lines. The braking system senses an obstacle, calculates the relative distance and applies the variable brakes automatically to maintain a safe distance.

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} four {{experiments}} were performed during an iterative design {{evolution of the}} human-computer interface (HCI) to a small unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The baseline control system was compared to several alternate designs using a simulated naval mission. User tasks included the monitoring and control {{of one or two}} vessels simultaneously.

Alternate HCI designs varied across these factors: visual integration, synthetic audio feedback, sizing and placement of alerts, and use of a hand-held game controller as a primary input device. Results for N= 32 sailors across the four studies indicated that for single or dual USV control conditions, the interface features added to the baseline design significantly improved speed and accuracy across multiple mission tasks.
