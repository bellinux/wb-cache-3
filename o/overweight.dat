50|$|The main {{modification}} to Prospect Theory is that, as in rank-dependent expected utility theory, {{cumulative probabilities}} are transformed, {{rather than the}} probabilities itself. This leads to the aforementioned <b>overweighting</b> of extreme events which occur with small probability, rather than to an <b>overweighting</b> of all small probability events. The modification helps to avoid a violation of first order stochastic dominance and makes the generalization to arbitrary outcome distributions easier. CPT is therefore on theoretical grounds an improvement over Prospect Theory.|$|R

We show that a conservative long-term investor will avoid such <b>overweights</b> in order to hedge against two types of deterioration in investment opportunities: declining expected stock returns, and increasing volatility. Empirically, we present novel evidence that low-frequency movements in equity volatility, tied to the default spread, are priced in the cross-section of stock returns...|$|R

40|$|<b>Overweighting</b> private {{information}} {{is often used}} to explain various detrimental decisions. In behavioral economics and finance, it is usually modeled as a direct consequence of misperceiving signal reliability. This bias is typically dubbed overconfidence and linked to the judgment literature in psychology. Empirical tests of the models often fail to find evidence for the predicted effects of overconfidence. These studies assume, however, that a specific type of overconfidence, i. e., "miscalibration," captures the underlying trait. We challenge this assumption and borrow the psychological methodology of single-cue probability learning to obtain a direct measure for <b>overweighting</b> {{private information}}. We find that <b>overweighting</b> private information and measures of "miscalibration" are unrelated, indicating that different kinds of misperceptions are at work. Thus, in order to test the theoretical predictions of the overconfidence literature in economics and finance, one cannot rely on the well-established "miscalibration" bias. We find no gender differences in overconfidence for our measures except for one, where women are more overconfident than men. overconfidence, miscalibration, signal perception, cognitive bias...|$|R

Results indicate {{that the stock market}} development and familiarity variables have significant, but asymmetric, effects on the domestic bias (domestic investors <b>overweighting</b> the local markets) and foreign bias (foreign investors under or <b>overweighting</b> the overseas markets), and that economic development, capital controls, and withholding tax variables have significant effects only on the foreign bias.

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use the common setting of state lottery betting to investigate the fit of expected utility theory against an alternative model of non-linear probability weighting. Our results show that both expected utility with risklove and risk-neutrality with a nonlinear weighting scheme are consistent with observed data from state lottery gambling. Interestingly, the data prefer a specification that models the agent as having risk-averse preferences and <b>overweighting</b> the probability of winning the jackpot using a nonlinear weighting function...|$|R

40|$|In {{responding}} to wrongdoings, people simultaneously pursue {{the goals of}} social control and fairness to the wrongdoer. Social control necessitates stronger weighting of consequences than causes; fairness entails the opposite. The authors hypothesized that the developmental shift from <b>overweighting</b> consequence to <b>overweighting</b> intent when determining levels of punishment illustrates a shift from a default defender of the normative order to a motivated crusader of fairness to the wrongdoer. Thus, punishment should increase slightly for intentional wrongdoings but decrease substantially for accidental wrongdoings as people age. In an experiment on disciplinary action in Singapore, 9 -, 13 -, and 17 -year-olds learned {{about the consequences of}} and intentions behind wrongdoings by peers and predicted consistency of the same act in the future, assigned blame to the wrongdoers, and recommended punishment for them.

40|$|Relative {{to their}} weights in a value-weighted index, {{a number of}} stocks in Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index are overweighted {{by a factor of}} 10 or more.

The cross-sectional approach resolves endogeneity problems associated with event study demonstrations of excess comovement. A trading strategy that bets on the reversion of stock prices of overweighted stocks generates economic profits, confirming that the observed comovement patterns are excessive, and providing further evidence that comovement of stock returns can be a consequence of commonality in trading behavior.

Another double-blind RCT in <b>overweight</b> and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the "description-experience gap": While rare events are overweighted in description based decisions, people tend to behave as if they underweight rare events in decisions based on experience. Barron and Erev (2003) and Hertwig, Barron, Weber, and Erev (2004) argue that such findings are substantive and call for a theory of decision making under risk other than Prospect Theory for decisions form experience. Fox and Hadar (2006) suggest that the discrepancy is due to sampling error: people are likely to sample rare events less often than objective probability implies, especially if their samples are small. The current paper examines the necessity of sample error in the underweighting of rare events. The first experiment shows that the gap persists even when people sample the entire population of outcomes and make a decision under risk rather than under uncertainty. A reanalysis of Barron and Erev (2003) further reveals that the gap persists even when subjects observe the expected frequency of rare events. The second experiment shows that the gap exists in a repeated decision making paradigm that controls for sample biases and the "hot stove" effect. Moreover, while underweighting persists in actual choices, <b>overweighting</b> is observed in judged probabilities. The results of the two experiments strengthen the suggestion that descriptive theories of choice that assume <b>overweighting</b> of small probabilities are not useful in describing decisions from experience. This is true even when there is no sample error, for both decisions under risk and for repeated choices. experience-based decisions, Prospect Theory, rare event, <b>overweighting,</b> underweighting...|$|R
