25|$|Intentional {{weight loss}} {{is the loss}} of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health, or to change {{appearance}} through slimming. Weight loss in individuals who are <b>overweight</b> <b>or</b> <b>obese</b> can reduce health risks, increase fitness, and may delay the onset of diabetes.

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} even in {{the first}} few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of <b>overweight</b> <b>or</b> <b>obese</b> grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as <b>overweight</b> <b>or</b> <b>obese.</b> More interesting is the difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.|$|E

40|$|Obesity has {{implications}} for chemotherapy dosing and selection of patients for therapy. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AutoHCT) improves outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma, but optimal chemotherapy dosing for obese patients is poorly defined. We analyzed the outcomes of 1087 recipients of AutoHCT for myeloma reported to the CIBMTR between 1995 and 2003 who received high-dose melphalan conditioning, with or without total body irradiation (TBI). We categorized patients by body mass index (BMI) as normal, <b>overweight,</b> <b>obese,</b> <b>or</b> severely <b>obese.</b> There was no overall effect of BMI on progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), progression, or nonrelapse mortality (NRM).

S. healthcare expenditures (Wolf & Colditz, 1998). Overall, obese individuals incur much higher costs for prescription drugs, hospitalization, and total healthcare when compared with similar persons of normal weight (Andreyeva, Sturm, & Ringel, 2004). <b>Overweight</b> <b>or</b> moderately <b>obese</b> individuals (those with a Body Mass Index or BMI of 25 to 35) have estimated healthcare expenditures that are 25 to 50 percent greater than those for people of normal weight, and severely obese people (those with a BMI over 40) have healthcare costs double those of normal weight people.

40|$|IntroductionStudies have {{assessed}} {{rates of}} childhood obesity in diverse populations, but few {{have been able}} to compare the weight status of American Indian and white children living in the same community and attending the same schools. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure and compare the weight status of American Indian and white elementary school students (kindergarten through 5 th grade) from 2005 through 2009 in an Oklahoma school district. MethodsWe assessed height, weight, age, and sex to calculate body mass index, body mass percentile, and categorical weight status of students, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000 Growth Charts. We used binomial regression to generate risk ratios (RRs) to compare student weight status by race, sex, and age. ResultsAn average of 753 students was measured in each year; mean age was 8. 3 years. From 2005 through 2009, 45. 4 % of American Indian students and 65. 1 % of white students were healthy weight or underweight. Greater proportions of American Indian children were very obese (weighted average RR, 2. 0); obese (weighted average RR, 1. 6), <b>or</b> <b>overweight</b> (weighted average RR, 1. 8) compared with white children. The overall prevalence of excess weight changed little during the study period.

25|$|Children's {{food choices}} are also {{influenced}} by family meals. Researchers provided a household eating questionnaire to 18,177 children, ranging in ages 11–21, and discovered that {{four out of five}} parents let their children make their own food decisions. They also discovered that compared to adolescents who ate three or fewer meals per week, those who ate four to five family meals per week were 19% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 22% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 19% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods. Adolescents who ate six to seven family meals per week, compared to those who ate three or fewer family meals per week, were 38% less likely to report poor consumption of vegetables, 31% less likely to report poor consumption of fruits, and 27% less likely to report poor consumption of dairy foods.

In addition, the overall incidence of all rare cancers was not higher than expected.

500|$|Emergency {{contraceptive}} {{methods are}} medications (sometimes misleadingly {{referred to as}} [...] "morning-after pills") or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse {{with the hope of}} preventing pregnancy. They work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization. They are unlikely to affect implantation, but this has not been completely excluded. A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone, ulipristal and IUDs. Levonorgestrel pills, when used within 3days, decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70% (resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%). Ulipristal, when used within 5days, decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85% (pregnancy rate 1.4%) and might be a little more effective than levonorgestrel. Mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel while copper IUDs are the most effective method. IUDs can be inserted up to fivedays after intercourse and prevent about 99% of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex (pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%). This makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive. In those who are <b>overweight</b> <b>or</b> <b>obese</b> levonorgestrel is less effective and an IUD or ulipristal is recommended.|$|E
40|$|We used a {{prospective}} cohort {{to analyze the}} effect of change in BMI rather than change in weight, in mothers carrying dichorionic twins from a population that did not receive any dietary intervention. A total of 269 mothers (150 nulliparas and 119 multiparas) were evaluated. The average change (%) from the pre-gravid BMI was 7. 2 +/- 6. 1, 17. 4 +/- 8. 2, and 28. 7 +/- 10. 8, at 12 - 14, 22 - 25, and 30 - 34 weeks, respectively, without difference between nulliparas and multiparas. The comparison between maternities below or above the average change from the pregravid BMI failed to demonstrate an advantage (in terms of total twin birthweight and gestational age) of an above average change from the pregravid BMI, even when the lower versus upper quartiles were compared. Our observations reached different conclusions regarding the recommended universal dietary intervention in twin gestations. A cautious approach is advocated towards seemingly harmless excess weight gain, as normal weight women may turn <b>overweight,</b> <b>or</b> even <b>obese,</b> {{by the end of}} pregnancy, and be exposed to the untoward effects of obesity on future health and body image...|$|R
