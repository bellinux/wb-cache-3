This work represents Kaurna people as educators. Some of the artworks are hidden and need to be discovered, like the animals carved into boulders, and stepping stones with Kaurna numbers. Images of the carved animals are on the bridge. The bridge railing is styled on a fishing net that resembles a Kaurna fishing net woven from bulrush fibres.|$|E

[...] Analyzing Wrightson's skill in depth, Simonson explained that in addition to his ability to draw anything, Wrightson was a master of value, able to effect a precise command over the depth and tones of the colors and shades of grey in his work, stating, [...] "In drawing or in painting, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> control is the value, which is the light and dark. If you were to take your color TV set and somehow turn off the color and just have a black and white and gray picture, you're looking at the values of those color pictures. 'Frankenstein' is a complete masterpiece of value, using incredibly complex pictures, and yet you always see exactly what you are supposed to see. He drives the eye right where it needs." [...] Regarding the famously reproduced two-page spread from that work depicting Frankenstein's laboratory, Simonson said of that image, [...] "It's so complicated and yet he's able to show you what he wants you to see. In some ways lab scene is the core of the story. It's where Frankenstein breaks the laws of God. I think people were just drawn to it cause it's so completely over the top and yet it's so completely controlled at the same time." [...] Comics analyst and historian Scott McCloud called that image a [...] "riot of detail", saying, [...] "It might take a moment before you even notice the corpse laying {{at the bottom of the}} composition on the left. That makes it a bit more of a treasure map. Bit more of a 'Where Is Waldo?'" ...|$|E

Up to an estimated 24 million people of all ages and genders suffer from an eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder) in the United States, so perhaps this is true. Eating disorders can, however, isolate shame and otherwise cause a person to withdraw from family and friends.

40|$|Career {{planning}} {{should be}} done regularly so as to move forward in our jobs and careers and hence you should start as early as possible. It should {{be taken as a}}n enjoyable activity which is liberating and fulfilling and it helps you to achieve your goals in your career. It should be taken as a rewarding and positive experience. Career planning {{should be done}} annually. Block all distractions and focus on your career and think what you really {{want to get out of}} your career and life. When career planning is done annually, you feel more secure in career choice and you will be prepared for any uncertainties that lie ahead in your jobs and career. Once it is done, take time off to review and reflect on the path; whether it was the correct decision. Also think <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could have done differently. Your attitudes, likes, dislikes, needs and wants might have changed and hence move on with the new passion. Even after the review and self-assessment, if you find that you wish to continue with the same decision, and then your choice was correct. Sometime your hobbies could be made to transform into a career which will give you dedication and success. Keep a record of accomplishments in work so that a powerful resume is always ready in hand. Identify the transferable skills in you which would be valuable for many other jobs. Information about trends in career and job is also important and vital for long-term success. Once you gain knowledge about career trends, you can concentrate on developing a unique set of accomplishments, skills and education. Exploring new education and training opportunities also leads to power and success. We should never miss an opportunity to learn and grow more as a person and hence always find new training opportunities...|$|E
40|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{must know}} in bird control are your {{state and local}} regulations. The state law may read that a license is {{required}} for bird control. A state law may read that the techniques and manners of your control must conform with their law. A state law may require registration of the poison you 2 ̆ 7 re going to use. State law may also prohibit placement of baits {{at a certain time}} during the day or year. And most important, a state law may prohibit control of specific types of birds. In Nebraska and most of the other states, the English Sparrow, the Pigeon, and the Starling are our # 1 birds on the most-wanted list. The Rid-A-Bird perch that I 2 ̆ 7 m going to speak about today has been registered by EPA for the control of those types of birds. Assuming that we get a call at Presto-X in Omaha from a potential customer to look at a bird problem, the first thing I 2 ̆ 7 d do is a survey. The survey is so important that it just cannot be overlooked. You just can 2 ̆ 7 t pick up the phone, have the guy tell you the problem and say, 2 ̆ 2 Oh yeah, we can do that for 100. We 2 ̆ 7 ll be out tomorrow and take care of them. 2 ̆ 2 You just can 2 ̆ 7 t do that in bird control. In my survey, I look to see what pest species is the target and if non-target types are around. In other words, if we 2 ̆ 7 re dealing with sparrows, are there any Cardinals or any other types of birds in the same area. This determines {{the amount of money that}} we 2 ̆ 7 re going to spend for the bait and the pre-baiting and how long it 2 ̆ 7 s going to take to get them under control. I want to know the food sources and the type of food that they 2 ̆ 7 re eating and where the birds are feeding. It is very important to know the exact area where the birds are feeding. I want to know the water sources if possible, and I want to know the roosting, nesting, dusting, and molting sites. And most important are the travel patterns of the birds that are entering or leaving the area. Where are these birds actually staying? Are they loafing or nesting here? What are the birds doing? Why are they in this particular area...|$|E
