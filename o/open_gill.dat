50|$|The hellbender {{has a few}} {{characteristics}} that make it distinguishable from other native salamanders, including a gigantic, dorsoventrally flattened body with thick folds travelling down the sides, a single <b>open</b> <b>gill</b> slit on each side, and hind feet with five toes each. Easily distinguished from most other endemic salamander species simply by their size, hellbenders average up to 60 cm or about 2 ft in length; the only species requiring further distinction (due to an overlap in distribution and size range) is the common mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus). This demarcation {{can be made by}} noting the presence of external gills in the mudpuppy, which are lacking in the hellbender, as well as the presence of four toes on each hind foot of the mudpuppy (in contrast with the hellbender's five). Furthermore, the average size of C. a. alleganiensis has been reported to be 45-60 cm (with some reported as reaching up to 74 cm or 30 in), while N. m. maculosus has a reported average size of 28-40 cm in length, which means that hellbender adults will still generally be notably larger than even the biggest mudpuppies.|$|E
40|$|Two {{distinct}} developmental trajectories, metamorphosis and neoteny (the {{retention of}} larval somatic features in adult animals), {{have been reported}} for the small gill-bearing branchiosaurids of the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian of central Europe. Based on a very large specimen of the species Apateon caducus (Ammon, 1889), anatomical features characteristic for the neotenic phenotype of branchiosaurids are described. Large neotenes lack changes that occur during a short phase of transformation into terrestrial adults (metamorphosis), such as ossification of the braincase and palatoquadrate and intercentra, further ossification of the girdles and formation of muscle attachment scars and processes on the limb bones. They also lack a distinct sculpturing of the dermal skull roofing elements with deep polygonal ridges and grooves. Instead, larval somatic features are retained including ossified branchial denticles indicative of <b>open</b> <b>gill</b> slits and accentuated larval-type sculpturing of the dermal skull roof. Large size, high degree of ossification {{as compared to the}} larvae, and the presence of uncinate processes on the ribs clearly demonstrate an adult ontogenetic stage. Neotenes remained in the aquatic environment throughout their life and were most likely not capable of effective terrestrial locomotion. The frequency distribution of the two phenotypes in modern salamander populations and the environmental cues that influence the development of them provide a comparative framework for the discussion of the evolution of the two life history pathways in branchiosaurids. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 200800012 </a...|$|E

50|$|Bony fish use countercurrent flow to {{maximize}} the intake of oxygen that can diffuse through the gill. Countercurrent flow occurs when deoxygenated blood moves through the gill in one direction while oxygenated water moves through the gill in the opposite direction.

Cartilaginous fish do not have a countercurrent flow system as they lack bones which are needed to have the <b>opened</b> out <b>gill</b> that bony fish have.|$|R

50|$|Compared {{to other}} prehistoric agnathan groups, {{such as the}} Heterostraci and Osteostraci, anaspids did not possess a bony shield or armor, hence their name.

40|$|The invading Mediterranean {{blue mussel}} species Mytilus galloprovincialis {{requires}} higher salinity levels {{than the more}} hypo-saline tolerant and native M. trossulus,which it replaced from its southern range in California, possibly due to climate change. It is also the warm-adapted congener. Hypo-salinity,due {{to an increase in}} extreme precipitation events,has been hypothesized to limit the expansion of the invader. By comparing the proteomic responses of the congeners to acute hypo-saline stress we were trying to identify the interspecific differences that set limits to hypo-saline stress and assess their contribution to the range shifts. We exposed mussels to acute hypo-saline(100 %, 85 % and 70 % salinity) stress for 4 h followed by a 0 h and 24 h recovery period while the shells were forced to stay <b>open.</b> We used <b>gill</b> tissue to separate proteins with 2 D gel electrophoresis and identify protein expression patterns (two-way ANOVA, pM. galloprovincialis.

The results suggest that although there are broad similarities in the responses of the two congeners, M. trossulus may be responding faster to hypo-saline stress, which in turn may limit the invaders range expansion. Proteins identified with tandem mass spectrometry include proteins involved in cytoskeletal modifications, molecular chaperones, proteasome, oxidative stress proteins and proteins involved in energy metabolism...|$|R
