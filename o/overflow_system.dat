40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} the results of a simulation study on multi-rate three-stage Clos switching networks with additional inter-stage links. Switching networks in which a <b>system</b> of <b>overflow</b> links was provided for the first, second and the third stage are investigated. Additionally, different struc-tures of connections between inter-stage links are discussed. The investigation has proved that an application of <b>overflow</b> <b>systems</b> is followed by a substantial decrease in the internal blocking probability in the switching network. An appropriate capacity of overflow links can even result in a virtually complete elimination of internal blocking. This paper proves that the best results are obtained with the introduction of overflow links to the first stage of the network, both in the case of point-to-point and point-to-group selection.

40|$|Abstract. Many EHB {{stars have}} been found in short–period binaries, where the companions in these post–common {{envelope}} systems are either white dwarfs or dM stars; these systems are catalogued as hot subdwarfs because the subdwarf is the more luminous component. Hypothesized Roche–lobe <b>overflow</b> <b>systems</b> (with more massive companions) may largely be uncatalogued, since the G band or Ca II K–line from the companion may have caused them to be overlooked or discarded. In particular, many candidate objects were excluded from the PG catalog because of such spectroscopic indicators. Could these rejects include large numbers of “missing ” hot subdwarfs? We have examined 2 MASS, SDSS, and GALEX archival data for large subsets of these rejected stars, and conclude that only a handful (about 3 %) show indications of binarity; most are consistent with (single) metal–poor F stars, as was originally supposed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{longitudinal}} study of mosquito ecology in Tanyard Creek, an urban stream in Atlanta, GA, that receives combined storm and waste water effluent from the Atlanta combined sewage <b>overflow</b> <b>system,</b> was undertaken in 2006. Culex quinquefasciatus was the dominant species found, but Culex restuans was also abundant during the spring with limited numbers of Culex nigripalpis and Anopheles punctipennis also collected. Significant differences in mosquito densities were found with greater densities associated with side pools of water and stagnant water. Mosquito numbers are regulated largely by flooding of the stream by effluent discharges exceeding 15 kgal/min. These floods are associated with significant immediate reductions, but not complete elimination, of mosquitoes from Tanyard Creek. Mosquito numbers rebound within 5 – 10 days after such floods and rapidly reach high densities...|$|E
40|$|This note {{develops}} two-moment approximations for blocking probabilities in overflow {{systems with}} repacking.

40|$|Multihub airline {{networks}} {{are an important}} phenomenon in today's air transport market. An important question is to what extent different factors {{play a role in}} the specialization between hubs that are part of the same multihub network. This paper shows that total European market size to a certain long-haul destination and the ratio between the origin-destination market at the primary and the secondary hub are important variables for the role hubs play in the long-haul network of European multihub systems. Large long-haul markets are generally served from both the primary and secondary hub. Multihub carriers serve smaller long-haul markets uniquely from a single hub, depending on the relative advantage in the local origin-destination market. Looking at actual specialization patterns within European multihub networks, we distinguish between complementary multihub systems (such as Amsterdam-Paris CDG), <b>overflow</b> <b>systems</b> (such as Frankfurt-Munich) and regional systems (such as Paris CDG-Lyon) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Historically {{water has}} been and remains a key factor for our development.

However, due to the <b>overflowed</b> <b>system,</b> the absence of public policies and the time consuming nature of the judicial process, such actions are ineffective or insufficient {{in the face of}} daily needs. It is imperative that the Judiciary adopt alternative work methods, aiming its relief and greater effectiveness in terms of emergency, preventive and reparatory guardianship. We encounter in National Water Resources Policy in Article 38, II, an agreement for Basins Committees to use arbitration in administrative channels on water conflicts. Thus, the creation of a Water Arbitration Tribunal, with extrajudicial action parallel with indicated judicial measures, would effectively contribute to the prevention/minimization of environmental damage and the consequent indiscriminate viable access to the natural resource...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of alternative overflow systems for roof structures that are drained siphonically. Many buildings that have siphonic roof drainage systems currently incorporate a separate secondary <b>overflow</b> <b>system,</b> {{which is quite}} often also siphonic. An alternative low-cost technique that is explored {{in this study is}} to connect each overflow outlet to a single, vertical downpipe. Seven different overflow configurations, each with five different downpipe lengths, are investigated in terms of maximum flowrate and corresponding water depth in the gutter. The results of this study are significant in that they do not support the common theoretical assumption that there is a limiting length of a siphonic downpipe over which pipe-full flow may occur before gravity causes the water to accelerate enough for it to no longer occupy the full cross-sectional area. Instead, this study has found that once a downpipe is flowing full, it is possible for pipe-full flow conditions to be maintained over the entire pipe length...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{understanding of the}} performance of box gutters and downpipes is critical to ensure a successful building roof drainage system design. Poorly designed roof drainage systems can result in significant damage to a building's structure and contents. Current codes and standards used to regulate box gutter and downpipe designs in Australia have often been limited by a lack of empirical research studies and they often do not reflect the complex flow environments experienced in real roof drainage systems. Performance-based design solutions can improve understanding and enhance design options for box gutters and downpipes in large buildings, particularly due to the extreme weather events and changes in rainfall intensities expected through climate change. A new, full-scale roof drainage research facility has recently been constructed at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia to undertake research into how performance-based testing of box gutters, downpipes and <b>overflow</b> <b>systems</b> can be used to improve understanding of the hydraulic conditions that occur during common and extreme rainfall events.
