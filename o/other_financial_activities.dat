40|$|In recent years, the {{traditional}} business of banks [...] making long-term loans and funding them by issuing short [...] dated deposits-has declined. This development has raised concerns that more banks will fail or {{be forced to}} assume greater risk to remain profitable. This article first examines the economic forces responsible for banks' reduced role in financial intermediation. The authors then consider whether banks may be jeopardizing {{the stability of the}} financial system by extending riskier loans or engaging in derivatives dealing and <b>other</b> "nontraditional" <b>financial</b> <b>activities</b> that bring higher returns but could carry greater risk. The authors conclude that because most nontraditional activities expose banks to risks and moral hazard problems similar to those associated with banks' traditional activities, the new activities can be regulated as effectively as the old.

This paper suggests that the literature might have over emphasised the strength of the nexus that is much more nuanced than often suggested.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} contradictory imperatives of New Deal banking reforms to explore both their notable successes and subsequent erosion. From {{the perspective of}} overdeterminist Marxian class analysis, we explore the conflicting objectives of New Dealers as they reflect the logic of a nascent Keynesianism. We argue that the Keynesian project for economic growth and stability required the availability of cheap money capital to promote vigorous investment. However, the provision of money capital on attractive terms can exert downward pressure on the profitability of financial capitalist firms, and commercial banks in particular. The potentially detrimental implications of this agenda on commercial bank profitability was particularly dire given the crisis in commercial banking that prevailed during the great depression. This dilemma obliged New Deal banking reforms to institute a complex pastiche of policies, some of which enhanced and some of which constrained the profitability of commercial banks. ^ We examine certain aspects of New Deal banking legislation, such as the Glass-Steagall Act (which prohibited the blending of commercial banking with <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> capitalist <b>activity</b> such as investment banking), the creation of deposit insurance, and the imposition of interest rate controls, to discern their contradictory implications for commercial bank profitability. In conducting this analysis, the dissertation has applied and extended the class analysis of financial capital provided by overdeterminist Marxism in order to discern the various struggles both among financial capitalists and between productive and financial capital shape the profitability of financial capital. ^ Using this framework, we argue {{that the success of}} the New Deal banking reforms in the post-war period initially produced a “pax financus” in which the competitive struggles amongst financial capital were moderated. However, the success of these reforms also produced incentives to undermine the New Deal regulatory framework via a regeneration of competitive struggles among financial capitalists. As these struggles intensified, financial innovations designed to circumvent regulatory restrictions changed the conduct of commercial banking and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> capitalist <b>activity.</b> As these developments progressed, there has been a resurgence in the diversified financial conglomerates (financial holding companies) reminiscent of those that flourished just prior to the Great Depression. ...|$|R

40|$|A Review of the Pros and Cons of Integrating Pension Supervision {{with that}} of <b>Other</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Activities</b> and Services The {{pros and cons of}} the {{alternative}} structures for the agencies that supervise the financial system are of interest to policymakers. Whether to employ an integrated structure, with a single agency overseeing a range of financial intermediaries (including banks, insurance companies and securities firms) has been debated at length – mainly due to the rise of financial conglomerates providing a range of products. Another matter which has been less considered is whether the supervision of pension funds should also be included in such integrated authorities. This paper aims to add to that debate. After examining a range of arguments for and against such integration, the paper concludes that there is no simple reply, that the answer depends on the context and environment of the pension system, and that the benefits of both integrated and specialist pension supervision can probably be achieved within either structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{trend towards}} {{globalisation}} of financial markets {{has been given}} further impetus {{in recent years by}} the dismantling of exchange controls, a dramatic rise in cross-border investment flows and increased access to domesticbanking markets by foreign institutions. At the same time, banking can no longer be regarded as a distinct financial service, having become intermingled with <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>activities,</b> including securities business. Another important development has been banks' growing involvement in financial derivatives. Finally, banks all over the world face increasing competition {{as a result of a}} dismantling of domestic restrictive practices; the liberalisation of cross-border activities; and the displacement of conventional bank lending by securities financing. The above trends pose formidable problems for bank regulatory authorities who are having to cope not only with a riskier banking system, but a banking system whose boundaries have become unclear and which is increasingly prone to contagious disorders originating in other areas of the financial services industry. The conclusion of this paper is that regulators will have to confront these difficulties by enlarging the scope of current co-ordination initiative...|$|E

40|$|Three {{fundamental}} and interconnected issues should be carefully considered before making any decisions on altering the federal safety net or {{the structure of}} the U. S. banking system. The first is whether or not bank depositors and other creditors can exercise timely and meaningful restraint on excessive risk-taking by bank managements. The second is whether the government should handle the orderly resolution of large bank failures {{in such a way that}} uninsured depositors and other bank creditors are protected. The third fundamental issue is the degree to which banking should continue to be insulated from other financial and nonfinancial activities.; Drawing upon thirty-five years of experience in bank supervision and discount window administration, the author reviews these issues. He concludes that since market discipline cannot be effective in deterring excessive credit risks in banks, the authorities must continue to give all depositors of large banks at least the implicit assurance that their funds will be protected. He believes that bank involvement in investment banking and <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>activities</b> should continue to be limited, and that nonbank entry into banking should continue to be restricted, in order to avoid broadening the federal safety net.

40|$|Enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) in November 1999 {{effectively}} repealed {{the long-standing}} prohibitions on {{the mixing of}} banking with securities or insurance businesses and thus permits “broad banking. ” Since the barriers that separated banking from <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>activities</b> have been crumbling for some time, GLBA is better viewed as ratifying, rather than revolutionizing, the practice of banking. We attribute repeal of these prohibitions to the increasingly persuasive evidence from academic studies of the pre-Glass-Steagall era, the recent favorable experience in the United States following partial deregulation of banking activities, the experience of banking systems abroad with broader scopes for banking activities, and rapid technological change in telecommunications and data processing. GLBA generally adheres {{to the principle of}} “functional regulation, ” which holds that similar activities should be regulated by the same regulator. How regulators will in practice coordinate their efforts so that the safety and soundness of the banking system is maintained efficiently remains to be seen. Broad banking companies may produce financial services at greater convenience and lower cost. Increased product diversification may simultaneously make them less prone to failure. It is unclear, however, whether continuing technological advance or any future banking liberalization will favor “one-stop shopping ” via broad banking companies, or perhaps will favor delivery of the financial products and services of multiple companies through an internet portal...|$|E
40|$|Finance {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing areas in modern applied {{mathematics}} with real world applications. The interest of this branch of applied mathematics is best described by an example involving shares. Shareholders of a company receive dividends which come from the profit made by the company. The proceeds of the company, once it is taken over or wound up, will also be distributed to shareholders. Therefore shares have a value that reflects the views of investors about the likely dividend payments and capital growth of the company. Obviously such value will be quantified by the share price on stock exchanges. Therefore financial modelling serves to understand the correlations between asset and movements of buy/sell in order to reduce risk. Such activities depend on financial analysis tools being available to the trader with which he can make rapid and systematic evaluation of buy/sell contracts. There are <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>activities</b> and it is not an intention of this paper to discuss all of these activities. The main concern of this paper is to propose a parallel algorithm for the numerical solution of an European option. This paper is organised as follows. First, a brief introduction is given of a simple mathematical model for European options and possible numerical schemes of solving such mathematical model. Second, Laplace transform is applied to the mathematical model which leads to a set of parametric equations where solutions of different parametric equations may be found concurrently. Numerical inverse Laplace transform is done by means of an inversion algorithm developed by Stehfast. The scalability of the algorithm in a distributed environment is demonstrated. Third, a performance analysis of the present algorithm is compared with a spatial domain decomposition developed particularly for time-dependent heat equation.

40|$|In the 1970 s, {{commercial}} {{banks in the}} United States faced restrictions on interest rates, both on the deposit and lending sides of their business. They were restricted {{for the most part}} to classic financial intermediation—deposit-taking and lending—to the exclusion, for example, of underwriting many corporate securities and insurance products. And banks were limited in the geographical scope of their operations. No state permitted banks headquartered in other states either to open branches or to buy their banks, and many states prohibited or restricted intrastate branching. Today, almost all of these restrictions have been lifted: Interest rate ceilings on deposits were phased out in the early 1980 s; state usury laws have been weakened because banks may now lend anywhere; and limits to banks ’ ability to engage in <b>other</b> <b>financial</b> <b>activities</b> have been almost completely eliminated, as have restrictions on the geographical scope of banking. As a result, our banking system is now more competitive and more consolidated than ever— both vertically and horizontally. This paper focuses on how one dimension of this broad-based deregulation—the removal of limits on bank entry and expansion—affected economic performance. In a nutshell, the results suggest that this regulatory change was followed by better performance of the real economy. State economies grew faster and had higher rates of new business formation after this deregulation. At the same time, macroeconomic stability improved. By opening up markets and allowing the banking system to integrate across the nation, deregulation made local economies less sensitive to the fortunes of their local banks.
