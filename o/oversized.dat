5|$|A {{genre of}} films {{has been based}} on <b>oversized</b> insects, {{including}} the pioneering 1954 Them!, featuring giant ants mutated by radiation, and the 1957 The Deadly Mantis.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, <b>oversized</b> shirts, and long scarves. He also {{borrowed}} a corduroy suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
5|$|As the {{national}} dish of Cornwall, several <b>oversized</b> {{versions of the}} pasty have been created in the county. For example, a giant pasty is paraded from Polruan to Fowey through the streets during regatta week. Similarly, a giant pasty is paraded around the ground of the Cornish Pirates rugby team on St Piran's Day before it is passed over the goal posts.|$|E
5|$|In smaller litters, {{difficulties}} {{may occur}} during labour due to <b>oversized</b> pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, {{but because the}} pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, {{lack of access to}} the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns. Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.|$|E
5|$|The Mansion of Happiness was {{considered}} the first mass-produced board game in the United States for almost 100 years. In 1886, George S. Parker purchased some of Ives' inventory from Henry P. Ives, who {{had taken over the}} Ives' business. George had his own <b>oversized</b> green label printed and proceeded to glue it over the Ives label.|$|E
5|$|The Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be {{travelled}} year-round. Access for <b>oversized</b> vehicles {{requires a}} special permit, and {{is limited to}} daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The -long Kolob Canyons Road was built {{to provide access to}} the Kolob Canyons section of the park. This road often closes in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The first Sounds mascot was {{introduced}} during the team's inaugural 1978 season. Homer Horsehide, {{whose name was}} selected in a naming contest, resembled their major league affiliate's mascot — Mr. Red of the Cincinnati Reds. The character was human in appearance, {{with the exception of}} an <b>oversized</b> anthropomorphized baseball in place of a human head. The mustachioed mascot donned a uniform identical to that of Sounds players.|$|E
5|$|The print editions are {{produced}} in <b>oversized</b> format on 70lb. matte stock. The magazine {{is also available}} digitally in several formats such as on Zinio for iPad and as a mobile phone app as well as via the official website, a blog, and various social media websites.|$|E
5|$|While {{the long}} neck has {{traditionally}} been interpreted as a feeding adaptation, it was also suggested that the <b>oversized</b> neck of Diplodocus and its relatives may have been primarily a sexual display, with any other feeding benefits coming second. A 2011 study refuted this idea in detail.|$|E
5|$|Bats also {{possess a}} system of {{sphincter}} valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs {{along the edge of}} their wings. In the fully open state, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the capillary network across the wing membrane, but when contracted, they shunt flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control the amount of heat exchanged through the thin flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in <b>oversized</b> ears for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|It is certain, however, {{that during}} the Second World War pigeon {{photography}} was introduced into German nurseries in toy form. From around 1935 the toy figures produced under the brand Elastolin, some of which show motifs from before 1918 with updated uniforms, began to include a signal corps soldier with a pigeon transport dog. The figurine represents {{a soldier in the}} act of releasing a pigeon that carries an <b>oversized</b> pigeon camera.|$|E
5|$|Many {{obstacles}} were in {{the course}} rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an <b>oversized</b> hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream; and Gum Drop, a gigantic gumball machine replica filled with plastic balls into which contestants would leap.|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 1952, Evita {{rode with}} Juan Perón in a parade through Buenos Aires {{in celebration of}} his {{re-election}} as President of Argentina. Evita was by this point so ill that {{she was unable to}} stand without support. Underneath her <b>oversized</b> fur coat was a frame made of plaster and wire that allowed her to stand. She took a triple dose of pain medication before the parade, and took another two doses when she returned home.|$|E
5|$|On January 20, 1776, Congress {{authorized}} the 2nd Canadian Regiment with an allowed maximum strength of 1,000. It {{would consist of}} four battalions (5 companies each), the only <b>oversized</b> regiment in the Continental Army. It {{was assigned to the}} Army's Canadian Department, and was organized by Hazen on February 10, 1776, at Montreal, to be recruited from the Richelieu and St. Lawrence Valleys. Over the next two months, Hazen and Antill recruited in those areas, until early April, when the recruiting funds dried up, raising about 250 men.|$|E
5|$|The {{house today}} appears an {{assemblage}} of several architectural styles popular during the Victorian era. While the overall design and air {{could be described as}} Italianate, also present in the same entrance facade are examples of high Victorian Gothic, such as an Italianate seigneurial tower confused in design with a campanile tower. This tower complete with a glazed loggia is crowned by a French-style mansard roof with <b>oversized</b> chimneys masquerading as Renaissance ornament. The centrepiece of the same facade is a porte-cochère designed in a heavy neoclassical style.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the Tumbler was an immobile studio set and not actually the {{interior of}} a street-capable Tumbler. The cockpit was <b>oversized</b> to fit cameras for scenes filmed in the Tumbler interior. In addition, another version of the Tumbler was a miniature model that was 1:6 scale of the actual Tumbler. This miniature model had an electric motor and was used to show the Tumbler flying across ravines and between buildings. However, the actual Tumbler was used for the waterfall sequence.|$|E
5|$|There is no perspectival {{order in}} the foreground; instead it {{comprises}} {{a series of small}} motifs wherein proportion and terrestrial logic are abandoned. Bosch presents the viewer with gigantic ducks playing with tiny humans under the cover of <b>oversized</b> fruit; fish walking on land while birds dwell in the water; a passionate couple encased in an amniotic fluid bubble; and a man inside of a red fruit staring at a mouse in a transparent cylinder.|$|E
5|$|To {{help keep}} the {{building}} cool, Belluschi added bronze-colored translucent corrugated panel sunscreens to the facade. Supported by a bronze anodized aluminum lattice, the sunscreens are made of Rohm and Haas's principal product, Plexiglas. The use of sunscreens and dark colors gave the facade a textured pattern and overall effect of avoiding making the building appear <b>oversized.</b> Besides the sunscreens, Plexiglas {{was used in the}} board room, in a few of the artistic commissions and light fixtures by designer György Kepes.|$|E
5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally <b>oversized,</b> or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as {{there was not a}} single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an <b>oversized</b> baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E
5|$|In 2016, PCL Manager of the Year Steve Scarsone led the Sounds to a league-best 83–59 {{record and}} the American Conference Southern Division title, sending the team to the postseason {{for the first time}} since 2007. The Sounds lost the American Conference series versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers, three games to two, {{including}} a dramatic back-and-forth game seven. At First Tennessee Park, the Sounds added the Country Legends Race, similar to major league mascot races, such as the Sausage Race and Presidents Race, to its between-innings entertainment in 2016. In the middle of the fifth inning, people in <b>oversized</b> foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians Johnny Cash, George Jones, and Reba McEntire race around the warning track from center field, through the visiting bullpen, and to the home plate side of the first base dugout.|$|E
5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was <b>oversized</b> to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as <b>oversized</b> loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} include various schoolmates {{and staff}} members. Weenus (Michael Sinterniklaas) is a nerdy, psychopathic robot who is even {{lower on the}} social pyramid than the protagonists. Dreadnot (Dana Snyder) is a teacher at Harry S. Apocalypse who finds joy in torturing and invoking pain into his students. Their principal, Thunderbite (also voiced by Snyder), is an <b>oversized,</b> skull-shaped robot who, when not causing pain, acts sweet and motherly to the students. Megawatt (also voiced by Sinterniklaas) is a spoiled rich kid who is attractive to the female robots, most of whom he blows up; to Thrasher's disdain, he is dating Maimy. Tacklebot (Roger Craig Smith), Megawatt's friend and musclehead jock, acts violent and hostile toward the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant <b>oversized</b> penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E
5|$|The City of Pasadena has {{recognized}} Robinson in several ways. Brookside Park, situated {{next to the}} Rose Bowl, features a baseball diamond and stadium named Jackie Robinson Field. The city's Human Services Department operates the Jackie Robinson Center, a community outreach center that provides health services. In 1997, a $325,000 bronze sculpture (equal to $ today) by artists Ralph Helmick, Stu Schecter, and John Outterbridge depicting <b>oversized</b> nine-foot busts of Robinson and his brother Mack was erected at Garfield Avenue, across from the main entrance of Pasadena City Hall; a granite footprint lists multiple donors to the commission project, which was organized by the Robinson Memorial Foundation and supported {{by members of the}} Robinson family.|$|E
5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an <b>oversized</b> trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
5|$|The Wonder Mountain's Guardian {{version of}} the {{attraction}} features eight characters. Stansien is the riders' guide who leads them through the mountain. Crazy Crabs are characterized as attractive but dangerous. Beasty Bats are recognizable by their <b>oversized</b> fangs compared to those of regular bats. Sneaky Spiders {{have the ability to}} ambush riders and their bites contain venom. Archers fight with bows and arrows, and can move around quickly. Wet Ones are reptilian creatures similar to fish but they can walk on land. These reptiles are most dangerous when they are in the water. Draconians protect Draconian City and carry swords and shields. Ormaar is the dragon that lives inside the mountain and confronts riders {{at the end of the}} ride.|$|E
5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have {{recessed}} brick panels above the impost line, and below it are bricks coursed to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance {{with a pair of}} <b>oversized</b> double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only {{pair of shoes}} after taking them to be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a karung guni man had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings are frustrated and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing <b>oversized</b> shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.|$|E
5|$|The {{first issue}} was {{released}} August 11, 2004. Retailers ordered over 8,000 copies, making the issue the 171st most ordered comic for the month. These numbers happily surprised the Lunas {{because they were}} not known creators. When the final issue was released in March 2005, orders had fallen but were still close to the 8,000 mark, which is a significantly lower drop than the industry average. In May 2005, the miniseries was collected in one paperback volume. A limited hardcover edition with a print run of 300 was released at the same time, and those sold quickly. A second printing of the paperback was later released with an alternate cover design. In September 2011, a deluxe hardcover was released in an <b>oversized</b> format with a slipcase.|$|E
5|$|The roof is sharply angled {{toward its}} center, where a wooden cupola tops the building. It was {{completed}} after the building, in 1892. At {{each of the}} square shaped building's four corners are dormers, which serve {{to break up the}} monotony of the otherwise ridged roof. The dormers resemble the cupola, in that they are dormered as well as multi-gabled. The roof has had routine maintenance performed as required. The building's dominant feature, its cupola, sits on an <b>oversized</b> brick base with a terra cotta belt around its base top. It features blocked openings with multiple arches, double round arches, Corinthian pilasters, and organic corner detailing.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and <b>oversized</b> scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden {{may have}} drawn {{influence}} from Stefan Lochner's c.1435 Last Judgement, {{and a similar}} c.1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great Deësis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled with dread and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but self-controlled dignity of his best works. This is most evident {{in the manner in}} which the <b>oversized</b> and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene from Heaven.|$|E
5|$|A {{one-shot}} {{comic book}} {{adaptation of the}} show was announced in October 2014. Produced by KaBoom!, an imprint of Boom! Studios, the comic was released on November 5, 2014. The comic was supervised by McHale and was produced as an <b>oversized</b> special. The comic was illustrated by Jim Campbell, a writer/storyboard artist on the television series. A special variant cover, by McHale, was also released. The success of the standalone comic led to further issues being commissioned in May 2015 and began {{to be released in}} August 2015. According to Patrick McHale, the comic books would be similar to the one-shot comic, detailing the events that occurred in between certain episodes and will expand on the miniseries. The success of the series of one-shots led to an ongoing series of comics, serving as both a sequel and prequel to the series, rather than telling adventures that happened between episodes. The stories are told parallel, with half the comic detailing Greg returning to mysterious dreamlands in his sleep. The other half chronicles the Woodsman's daughter, Anna, and how she became lost in the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely <b>oversized</b> carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began {{to believe that the}} fish was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung under the direction of Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.|$|E
