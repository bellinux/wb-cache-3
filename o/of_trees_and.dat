5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. The moth flies over the crown <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Isabel passed 215miles (350km) {{southwest}} of the state, though its large wind core produced tropical storm force winds {{across much of the}} state. The winds downed hundreds <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands without power. A falling tree killed one person. Hurricane Isabel produced rough waves and a moderate storm surge along the coastline. One person was killed from the rough waves, and at least 50 locations along the Jersey Shore reported beach erosion from the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Along Long Island, {{the high}} storm surge flooded {{hundreds}} of streets and caused heavy beach erosion. High winds downed thousands <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> damaged hundreds of homes, causing widespread power outages. About 1.5 {{million people in}} the state lost power, including two-thirds of the Long Island Lighting Company customers, {{making it one of the}} worst power outages in the state. There were four deaths on Long Island, two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees. There were also 14 injuries in the region, many of them due to downed tree branches. In the New York mainland, heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions. Rough waves damaged boats and docks along the Hudson River. Unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the New York mainland.|$|E
5|$|Amanita aestivalis is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, {{meaning it}} forms a mutualistic relationship in which the vegetative hyphae of the fungus grow around and enclose the tiny roots <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> shrubs. In this way, the plant is better able to absorb phosphorus and other soil nutrients, while the fungus receives moisture, protection, and nutritive byproducts of the plant's metabolism. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow {{on the ground in}} deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forests. A preference has been noted for oak woods containing Tsuga or Pinus species, as well as beech wood with Picea, Abies, and Betula. Fruit bodies typically appear from late June until autumn. In North America, it has been found in the states of New England, as well as Alabama, New York, and Virginia. The distribution extends north to the southeastern provinces of Canada and south to Florida.|$|E

The winds damage or destroy thousands of homes, knock down tens of thousands <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> leave more than 2million Floridians without power. Charley results in eightdirect fatalities, 20indirect casualties, and 792reported injuries.

5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees.

In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} natural enemies of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these natural enemies, the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E

The hurricane destroyed a radio tower in Framingham and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state.
