40|$|The {{lightweight}} {{design of}} the <b>outer</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> installed on an electrical vehicle was achieved through material selection and optimization technique. The aluminum alloy Al 6082 M was selected as a steel-substitute, and its structural shape was optimized by applying metamodel-based optimization. In this process, finite element analysis was performed to predict the structural responses, such as buckling resistance and fatigue life. First, for an arbitrary base design made of steel, the structural responses were calculated. Then, the design variables were defined to find a lightweight design made of Al 6082 M. Secondly, metamodel-based optimization based on the kriging interpolation method was applied, leading to determination of an optimum design. The suggested optimum design has the minimum weight satisfying the critical design requirement. Finally, the numerical results of the buckling resistance and fatigue life were validated, through bucking and fatigue tests...|$|E
50|$|A {{parallelogram}} {{steering linkage}} is called such because like its name sake {{the two sides}} of the linkage run parallel to each other and are equal in distance. This type of steering linkage uses four <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> one inner and one outer on each side (left and right), a center link (which runs between the <b>tie</b> <b>rods),</b> an idler arm on the passenger side, and a pitman arm on the driver side. The pitman arm attaches to the steering gear output shaft which is also commonly called the pitman shaft. The pitman arm attaches to the center link and is moved by turning the steering wheel. The center link transfers the movement from the pitman arm and pitman shaft to the idler arm on the passenger side. The inner <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are mounted to the center link and transfer steering motion to the steering arms and <b>outer</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> All of the joints which mount these components are constructed of small ball and socket joints to provide the necessary freedom of movement required to maintain control over the vehicle while it is in motion. The most common type of steering is the parallelogram. The cross-steer and Haltenberger linkage designs are used on some trucks and vans.|$|R
5000|$|Lamela {{introduced}} in Spain {{the concept of}} [...] "suspended architecture" [...] with the Torres Colón project in Madrid, undertaken together with the engineer Fernández Casado. The structural system of the towers was completely designed in reinforced concrete using high strength post-tensioned concrete. In this way, it departed from the most widespread technique of constructing [...] "hanging" [...] buildings, which usesheads of structural steel, to instead adopt a [...] "suspended architecture" [...] solution: the floor slabs are supported at their perimeter by the <b>outer</b> <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> which are not tensioned {{as in the case}} of the [...] "hanging architecture", but compressed against the post-tensioned concrete structure of the head-beams. This upper structure, within which the installation machinery is located, receives the load from the 21 suspended slabs and transmits it to the core, through which it finally descends to the foundations in the ground. When they were built, the Colón Towers heldthe world record for the number of suspended slabs, 21, using the pre-stressed concrete technique. The result is a building one hundred metres tallwith twenty suspended floors. The Eduardo Torroja Institute presented this project as a Spanish technological contribution at the World Congress of Architecture and Public Works held in New York in 1975, and it was considered [...] "the building with the most advanced construction technology until 1975." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> style {{hydraulic}} cylinders use high strength threaded steel rods {{to hold the}} two end caps to the cylinder barrel. They are most often seen in industrial factory applications. Small bore cylinders usually have 4 <b>tie</b> <b>rods,</b> and large bore cylinders may require as many as 16 or 20 <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> in order to retain the end caps under the tremendous forces produced. <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> style cylinders can be completely disassembled for service and repair, {{and they are not}} always customizable.|$|R

With a modification of the weld design, the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> has withstood proof loading {{and there was no}} cracking after proof loading...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> in the Duomo are {{structural}} elements, {{subject to}} monotonic loading and cyclic loading. Non-destructive testing {{is used to}} find cracks and determine their geometry. Lamb waves are applied to determine the presence of cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> and to estimate their positions. The cracks are located using eddy current testing. Finally the geometries of the cracks are determined using active infrared thermography. Experimental testing {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics is done to determine the fracture toughness of wrought iron. Combining the geometry of the crack with the fracture toughness of the material, leads to an estimation of the critical crack size. The <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are made of wrought iron. The material properties are very heterogeneous. A <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is made out of multiple wrought iron bars of 1 - 1. 5 meters. These bars are welded together under an angle of 27 °. Cracks of two damaged <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are found to be under such an angle. The search for cracks will be concentrated on inclined cracks with a repetition of 1 - 1. 5 meters. Lamb waves is the first technique applied. An ultrasonic tomograph A 1040 MIRA is used for testing. The modelling of Lamb waves travelling in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the signal processing are based on the possibilities of the MIRA. The dispersion behaviour of Lamb waves is modelled to understand the wave propagation in <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> and the influence it has on the testing done with the MIRA. Using this knowledge, proper testing settings are found. Subsequently, signal processing is considered. The main objective of this part {{is to be able to}} identify cracks present in the <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> The position of the cracks in the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is determined using eddy current testing. Commercial eddy current probes are too sensitive to discontinuities to be applied to <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> Therefore, new probes are developed to overcome this drawback. Two probes are designed, both for the horizontal face and for the vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> The vertical face of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> are best accessible. Therefore, on-site testing is done with the probe specially designed for that face. Active infrared thermography is implemented to establish the geometry of the crack. A finite element analysis has been performed to model the propagation of heat through a <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> This is followed by experimental testing in the laboratory carried out on a broken <b>tie</b> <b>rod.</b> Finally, the results of the modelling and of the experimental testing are compared. The last part has a fracture mechanical nature. The fracture toughness of the material is determined assuming both linear-elastic and elastic-plastic material behaviour. Also the fatigue behaviour is evaluated. The values obtained from experimental testing have been applied to a simplified model of the crack geometry to determine the critical crack size of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod,</b> for monotonic loading, and the threshold crack size, for cyclic loading. Fatigue life is predicted taking the threshold crack size as the initial crack size and the critical crack size as the final crack size. <br/...|$|R
5000|$|In automobiles, the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> {{are part}} of the {{steering}} mechanism. They differ from the archetypal <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> by both pushing and pulling (operating in both tension and compression). In the UK, these items are generally referred to as track rods.|$|R
40|$|<b>Tie</b> <b>rods</b> or Track rods are an {{integral}} part of vehicle’s steering system. Just as its name suggests a <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> <b>ties</b> vehicle’s steering rack to the steering arm. <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> may get fail due to varying forces and bumping of vehicle during steering. The forces from the steering are also considered during the static condition of car. Vibration and buckling of <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> has been continuously a concern which may lead to structural failure if the resulting vibration and stresses are undesirable and excessive. So research work is aimed to assess buckling strength and compare buckling performance of <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> for different materials. Finite element models of the <b>Tie</b> <b>rod</b> also analyzed to obtain stiffness and stress distributions in each component. Based on the experimental test results, theoretical calculation results and finite element analysis with NASTRAN results, stiffness values are validated. The mode shape and natural frequency results for different materials obtained in the normal modal analysis are compared. In buckling analysis, the load factor obtained for different materials were compared and critical buckling load is calculated and is validated by theoretical calculations...|$|R
50|$|Bump steer can be {{adjusted}} by moving any of the front suspension components pickup points Up, down, in or out. For example: Say the inner <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> mounting point is moved up either by moving the rack or modifying the pitman arm mounting point or arm drop. The result is the <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> arc will change. It will then require {{a change in the}} <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> length to be in proper alignment so the radius of the arc will change as well. If the radius arc of the <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is longer than stock on a front steer setup then the car will have more toe understeer. If the same scenario was applied to a rear steering design, then the car would exhibit less toe understeer. This is because the effective length of the <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> is affected by its static length/arc radius, its pickup points and the angle of its arc during each phase of suspension travel in relation to the control arms.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{because the}} ratio of the typical <b>tie</b> <b>rod's</b> length to its cross section is usually very large, it would buckle under the action of {{compressive}} forces. The working strength of a <b>tie</b> <b>rod</b> is the product of the allowable working stress and the rod's minimum cross-sectional area.|$|R

40|$|The ATLAS Barrel Toroid (BT) {{consists}} of 8 superconducting coils of 25 m length and 5 m width. Each coil {{is equipped with}} eight titanium alloy <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> acting as support for the magnetic forces, the intensity {{of which will be}} up to 180 t for the most loaded one. The B 0 model coil is about 1 / 3 length scale of the BT, equipped with three <b>tie</b> <b>rods.</b> In order to simulate the behavior of the coil supports, a test facility has been built to test individual <b>tie</b> <b>rods</b> at cryogenic temperature. The initial aim was to verify the amount of stick and slip, the possibility of it occurring during the excitation and the flexion of the support at the anchoring point on the magnet. This was achieved by inducing in the support the same movements foreseen during the cool-down and the excitation of the magnet and loading with the same forces.
