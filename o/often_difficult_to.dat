5|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find P. fimbriata in the wild, as {{its shape}} and {{movements}} are well disguised. The Queensland variety is quite easy to raise, while the Northern Territory variety is quite troublesome to maintain.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from football, Gatski was a scout for the Boston Patriots {{for two years}} before becoming head football coach and athletic director at the West Virginia Industrial School for Boys, a correctional facility for young offenders in Pruntytown, West Virginia. He worked there until the school shut down in 1982. He hunted and fished in retirement, and was <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reach. He lived on a mountain in West Virginia and did not have a telephone for many years.|$|E

5|$|During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a {{frequent}} witness on charters. While it is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement {{near the top of}} the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives that are <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls {{the woods and}} wild places his home and kidnaps children.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{degree of}} Caroline's wealth was always {{problematic}} to trace, as {{the king had}} placed {{so much of it}} in different sources <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death. One 1912 source for instance reported that out of the king's estimated estate of $65,000,000, Caroline received $7,000,000, while others stressed still higher numbers, and that the majority of it came from Congo shares.|$|E
5|$|The first {{poultry breed}} {{to have its}} own {{specialist}} club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to poultry exhibition standards not long after their establishment. Today, they are among the most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay tiny, white eggs and are not kept for meat production.|$|E
5|$|For {{the human}} ear, it is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tell {{precisely}} where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, {{the sound is}} continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> superficially {{distinguish}} {{between male and}} female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Survivals {{from late}} Medieval church {{fittings}} and objects in Scotland are exceptionally rare even {{compared to those}} from comparable areas like England or Norway, probably because of the thoroughness of their destruction in the Scottish Reformation. The Scottish elite and church now participated in a culture stretching across Europe, and many objects that do survive are imported, such as Limoges enamels. It is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain {{function is to}} examine the consequences of damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E

5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It is <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{know whether or not}} spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|Further {{treatment}} for other complications such as seizure, hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, pulmonary edema, and acidosis may be required. Increased muscle activity and seizures {{should be treated}} with dantrolene or diazepam; diazepam should only be given with appropriate respiratory support. Hypotension requires treatment with intravenous fluids; vasopressors {{may be required to}} treat myocardial depression. Cardiac dysrhythmias are treated with standard advanced cardiac life support protocols. If severe, metabolic acidosis is treated with sodium bicarbonate. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate is controversial as acidosis may increase tissue oxygen availability. Treatment of acidosis may only need to consist of oxygen therapy. The delayed development of neuropsychiatric impairment {{is one of the most}} serious complications of carbon monoxide poisoning. Brain damage is confirmed following MRI or CAT scans. Extensive follow up and supportive treatment is often required for delayed neurological damage. Outcomes are <b>often</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> predict following poisoning, especially people who have symptoms of cardiac arrest, coma, metabolic acidosis, or have high carboxyhemoglobin levels. One study reported that approximately 30% of people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning will have a fatal outcome. It has been reported that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may increase the likelihood of delayed neuropsychiatric sequelae (DNS) after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning.|$|E
