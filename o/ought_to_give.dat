25|$|On June 20, Mardian and Fred LaRue {{met with}} Liddy in LaRue's {{apartment}} in the Watergate complex, where Liddy told him the full story of all the activities of 'the plumbers'. Mardian suggested to Liddy that he {{was likely to be}} traced and <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> himself up; he also said that Mitchell was unlikely to let CRP funds be used to bail the Cuban burglars, but the Cuban community in Florida might help.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin, {{complaining}} of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin's own account, Macklin told him he had been overdoing things and should try to [...] "lead a more regular life", to which Shackleton answered: [...] "You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up?" [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss," [...] replied Macklin. A few moments later, at 2:50a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E

500|$|Chivers is {{best known}} for his {{association}} with Edgar Allan Poe and, in fact, it is through this relationship that Chivers and his work was rediscovered in the 20th century. The first interaction between the two was in 1840 though they did not meet until 1845 in New York. The two became friends and Chivers was willing to give Poe lifetime financial support if he moved to the South. Chivers appreciated Poe's ability and wrote that George Rex Graham was seriously underpaying Poe for his work on Graham's Magazine. [...] "He <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you ten thousand dollars a year... It is richly worth it... is greatly indebted to you. It is not my opinion that you have ever been, or ever will be, paid for your intellectual labours. You need never expect it, until you establish a Magazine of your own", he wrote, referring to Poe's plans to begin The Stylus. Even so, Chivers was concerned about Poe's reputation as a severe literary critic, cautioning him about [...] "when you tomahawk people". Poe, in fact, had been hoping Chivers would lend his wealth as a financial backer for The Stylus and possibly even serve as a co-editor in its early planning stages. Chivers considered Poe's proposal but was not able to accept because of the death of his three-year-old daughter just over a week later.|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 1922, South Georgia was sighted, {{and late}} that morning Quest {{anchored}} at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton {{returned to the}} ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary. [...] "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. [...] "It is a strange and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay." [...] Later he slept, and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty. Shortly after 2a.m. {{on the morning of}} 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: [...] "You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up?" [...] Macklin replied [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." [...] Immediately afterwards Shackleton [...] "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died".|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} of substantive legitimate expectation {{has not yet}} been explicitly acknowledged as part of Singapore law. In Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor (1997), the Singapore Court of Appeal had to decide whether life imprisonment in the Penal Code meant imprisonment for 20 years, which was the prevailing understanding, or whether it meant imprisonment for the remaining period of the convicted person's natural life. The Court concluded that the latter interpretation was correct, but overruled the former interpretation prospectively such that it only took effect from the date of the judgment and did not apply to the appellant. One of the reasons the Court relied on for doing so was the administrative law {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation. It recognized that [...] "certain legitimate expectations could, in certain circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right". Since for many years life imprisonment had been reckoned as 20 years' incarceration, this had given rise to a legitimate expectation according to which individuals had arranged their affairs. Thus, the Court <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> effect to the expectation by prospectively overruling the prior interpretation. Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment. That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term {{restructuring}} generally {{refers to}} the creation of these markets and the disintegration of vertically integrated utilities. The theoretical gains from restructuring are numerous. Competition, coupled with freeing electricity generators from cost of service rates, <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> generators powerful incentives to cut costs, which will lower consumer prices in the long-term. In other words, deregulation is said to subject the electricity sector to the [...] "innovative and productive forces of competition".|$|E

The title is assumed to be a corruption of Dibre David, a work published in 1671. Reference to the quote is found in an early Holocaust denial book, The Six Million Reconsidered by William Grimstad.|$|E

2500|$|Montessori {{considered}} {{her work in}} the Orthophrenic School and her subsequent psychological studies and research work in elementary schools as [...] "scientific pedagogy", a concept current {{in the study of}} education at the time. She called for not just observation and measurement of students, but for the development of new methods which would transform them. [...] "Scientific education, therefore, was that which, while based on science, modified and improved the individual." [...] Further, education itself should be transformed by science: [...] "The new methods if they were run on scientific lines, ought to change completely both the school and its methods, <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> rise to a new form of education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liberal Democrats: Leader Nick Clegg {{stated in}} 2009 that his party backs legalisation. On 4 July 2009, {{in an article}} for LabourList, Clegg wrote that [...] "although civil {{partnerships}} have been a step forward, until same sex marriage is permitted {{it is impossible to}} claim gay and straight couples are treated equally." [...] Following this, the party's LGBT rights group LGBT+ Liberal Democrats launched a petition [...] "Marriage Without Borders" [...] calling for all gender restrictions on marriage and civil partnerships to be lifted, and for same-sex relationships to be recognised across Europe and internationally. The petition was run at Manchester Pride and Reading Pride in 2009, and launched online in January 2010 following an interview with Clegg in Attitude magazine in which he reaffirmed his commitment to equal marriage. However, this did not make it into the party's manifesto. In an interview in July 2010 Lib Dem deputy party leader Simon Hughes confirmed that the coalition Government plans to open marriage to same-sex couples, saying, [...] "It would be appropriate in Britain in 2010, 2011, for there to be the ability for civil marriage for straight people and gay people equally... The state <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> equality. We’re halfway there. I {{think we ought to be}} able to get there in this parliament".|$|E
