500|$|In September 2017, Matt Cameron told Billboard {{that he and}} {{the other}} {{surviving}} members of Soundgarden had yet {{to make a decision about}} the future of the band following Cornell's death. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't think we're ready to say anything other than ... Kim and Ben and I are certainly aware of how much <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> are hurting, and we're certainly hurting right there along with them. But we're extremely private people, and we're all still processing our grief in our own way and on our own time. But we definitely are thinking of <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> and love them very much." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2006, the Flames {{announced}} {{that they would be}} opening a hybrid restaurant, bar and entertainment facility in downtown Calgary on Stephen Avenue. In announcing the venture, Flames' President and CEO Ken King stated: [...] "While hockey remains our core competency, we are constantly seeking new opportunities in which to grow the Flames brand and allow <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> greater opportunities to enjoy hockey. We believe establishing a location outside of the Pengrowth Saddledome to share food, fun and hockey will bring <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> even closer to the team." [...] One year later, in April 2007, Flames Central opened to the public. In 2017, the facility reverted to its original name of The Palace Theatre.|$|E

50|$|We were {{basically}} a Beatles band to start with. We did all Beatles tunes. Then we started branching out. We {{also liked the}} Byrds and the Animals. It wasn’t long after our first show at Everett High School that we played Waverly Junior High School — we nearly started a riot. It was {{like something out of}} ‘Hard Day’s Night.’ We had a big local following; there were about 300 kids in <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> club.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{introduction}} of file-sharing technology—including Napster at inception—DeLonge and his Blink-182 bandmates were considering a [...] "plan B" [...] in regard to generating income from their music. The band's 1999 album, Enema of the State, had sold one million copies within two months of its release, but DeLonge explained in 2014: [...] "Napster was just hitting and the epicenter of <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base was suburbia where everyone had the newest Apple computer." ...|$|R
500|$|We {{have been}} working {{together}} as Destiny's Child since we were 9, and touring together since we were 14. After {{a lot of discussion}} and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny's Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, <b>our</b> <b>fans,</b> and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that {{now is the time to}} pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. —Destiny's Child, MTV ...|$|E

One2One collectibles produced 1:2 scale busts of the Master Chief.

5000|$|In March 2013, Floor reunited {{again and}} {{announced}} {{its intention to}} tour and release a new album through Season of Mist. Vialon said that after the group's 2010 reunion tours, Floor had, [...] "noticed that <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base had grown exponentially and doing a new record, kind of picking up where we'd left off, was something we agreed we should focus on." [...] Floor released its fourth studio album Oblation on April 29, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|The Rat {{was also}} {{considered}} important for {{its contribution to}} the Hardcore movement. In a 2010 interview, Ken Casey of the Dropkick Murphys said: [...] "(The Rat) afforded {{us the opportunity to}} have a place to play and develop <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base, and it was just amazing to us. And the reason I credit it with all of our success, was this is how we started to tour. The hardcore punk scene in the mid-’90s was huge in Boston." ...|$|R
5000|$|... it {{has always}} been our desire to publish The Settlers series on other {{platforms}} and expand <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base. Strategy games are, however, difficult to implement on consoles, mainly because of the controls. On the other hand, the Nintendo DS is suitable for the strategy genre because of the touchscreen controls. As both The Settlers and Nintendo DS appeal to the entire family, we think that with this platform, we have found the perfect target group for The Settlers.|$|R
500|$|On July 18, {{not even}} a month into the tour, the group was forced to cancel the {{remainder}} of their Lollapalooza appearances due to guitarist James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer recent diagnosis with viral meningitis. Jonathan Davis issued a written statement about Shaffer's illness saying, [...] "We love <b>our</b> <b>fans.</b> This {{is the last thing}} we want to do, but it's the only decision to make at this time.

500|$|In 2002, George Roca {{produced}} and directed a concert {{film about the}} band titled Nobody Knows How to Talk to Children. It chronicles The White Stripes' four-night stand at New York City's Bowery Ballroom in 2002, and contains live performances and behind-the-scenes footage. Its 2004 release was suppressed by the band's management, however, after they discovered that Roca had been showing it at the Seattle Film Festival without permission. According to the band, the film was [...] "not up to the standards <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> have come to expect"; even so, it remains a highly prized bootleg.|$|E
500|$|The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was {{released}} that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies {{in its first}} week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, {{with much of the}} criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, [...] "I know a lot of <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that".|$|E
5000|$|On July 4, 2012, Black Camaro {{released}} their long-awaited 6th studio album Black Camaricans. Garth told a reporter, [...] "To me, {{this is a}} gift to whoever's {{been listening}} to us for this long...In my mind, {{my goal was to}} completely please <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base with it." [...] On January 31, 2013 the band released B-Sides & C-Sides Vol. 2, a 20 track follow-up to Black Camaricans, which consisted mostly of the band's [...] "large back catalog of unrecorded or unreleased material".|$|R

500|$|In 2008, the NHL's {{official}} {{online shop}} came under criticism after they placed a T-shirt advertising Alexander Ovechkin as the award winner on sale {{a week before}} the results were revealed. A spokesperson for the league said [...] "in an effort to offer <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> the merchandise they want in a timely manner following an event such as the NHL Awards, our licensees prepare product for all possible outcomes. In this situation, the link for one of the possible products became live early through an error by our e-commerce provider." [...] Ovechkin was later confirmed to be the winner.|$|E
500|$|... "There are {{not that}} many artists that appeal to every {{territory}} with an MTV channel, but Britney Spears {{is one of the}} select few. We have been waiting for the opportunity to make a global splash, and the Britney tour is it. For {{the better part of the}} rest of the year, we’ll be on the road with Britney. This is more support than we’ve ever given an artist in the U.S., let alone all over the world. We love the association with Britney; she has always been a core part of this channel and <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> love Britney".|$|E
500|$|Binaural {{opens with}} three up-tempo songs before growing more diverse. [...] Vedder explained, [...] "We'd rather {{challenge}} <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> {{and make them}} listen to our songs than give them something that's easy to digest. There {{is a lot of}} music out there that is very easy to digest but we never {{wanted to be part of}} it." [...] As described by critic Jon Pareles on his review for Rolling Stone, Pearl Jam distances itself from the grunge that made them famous and [...] "delve elsewhere: jumpy post-punk and somber meditations, tightly wound folk rock and turbulent, neopsychedelic rockers that sound like they boiled out of jam sessions." ...|$|E
5000|$|The band {{stated the}} {{following}} about the EP: During the Death Magnetic album sessions in 2007 and 2008, we originally recorded 14 songs. When {{it came time}} to pick the songs for the final album, we decided on 10 songs that you've all come to know over the last three years... Some of you may have heard bits and pieces of those other songs on 'Mission Metallica' (remember 'Mission Metallica'?!) or heard rumors about them during the recording process, and wondered, 'What ever happened to those other four songs???.' We kept them in the vault and decided to pull them just for this special celebration, so here are the four leftover tracks from the Death Magnetic sessions. They are ROUGH mixes, unfinished to their original degree of mixing from March '08. These four songs were released as a gift to <b>our</b> closest <b>fans,</b> the members of <b>our</b> <b>Fan</b> Club, to enjoy. Now they're being made available to you.|$|R
5000|$|Pirates President Mark Sauer {{said that}} [...] "there {{are a lot}} of reasons for the Pirates to be in...the Central...Our key {{marketing}} people...all think {{this is the way to}} go." [...] He also cited that the [...] "Cleveland (Indians), the closest franchise to Pittsburgh, also chose the Central when faced with the same East vs. Central decision." [...] However, manager Jim Leyland felt that the [...] "move should have little on-field impact." [...] Pittsburgh's general manager, Cam Bonifay, said that [...] "based on our rivalries and <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base, we feel comfortable being in the Central Division." [...] He also based it that the Pittsburgh Steelers in the National Football League were in the same division as two of the same cities the Steelers have in their division, Cincinnati and Houston, saying that [...] "we don't feel that there's any major difference between the Eastern and Central Divisions. With the Steelers' being in the Central Division, from our fans' viewpoint, it would not limit <b>our</b> rivalries. <b>Our</b> <b>fan</b> base understands where we are geographically. The size of the markets of Houston, St. Louis and Cincinnati are more in line." [...] Additionally, even though the Marlins did offer to go to the Central, the Pirates didn't want to play in the same division as the Braves since the team wasn't sure how long the Braves were going to be good, and felt it would be more competitive in the Central.|$|R

She {{said at the time}} she planned to continue to kneel. Later that week on September 7, the Washington Spirit uncharacteristically played the national anthem prior to the teams taking the field, indicating that {{they did not want to}} [...] "subject <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent".

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Middle" [...] was {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston, who directed the video for the group's previous single [...] "Hole in the Head". It was filmed at Pinewood Studios, London in February 2004. The photography was completed by Martin Ahlgren. Buchanan refrained from revealing details about the video before its release, saying: [...] "The shoot went very well but what actually happens in the video is being kept a secret until it's shown. We’re all really excited and can't wait to hear what <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> think about it!" [...] It aired on the Sugababes' official website, and on television, on 20 February 2004 and was included on the single's CD release.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} this album {{represents}} a more [...] "mature" [...] Blink-182, hence {{the absence of}} songs with toilet humour or jokes for which the band had been known. [...] "We wanted to be different," [...] remarked DeLonge. [...] "Some of <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> were probably like, 'Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.' And I think this record {{is going to help}} those kids out.". In an interview with MTV Album Launch, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to it and say, [...] "Wait a minute...that's Blink-182?" [...] The themes for the album include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Nashville's The City Paper, Brother Henry's leader and cellist, David Henry discussed the marketing strategy behind the release. [...] "We're offering the CD as a free download for anyone who wants it on the Brother Henry Official Website", Henry said. [...] "Our philosophy now is we want to create and expand <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base, {{and we feel that}} anyone who's willing to download the CD will then want to hear those same songs in concert. It's our way of building our audience, without having {{to get involved in the}} huge money expenditures that you've have to do if you got involved with a big label." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Campaign is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by American metal band Affiance. The album was relatively well received. Vocalist Dennis Tvrdik stated, [...] "The {{vast majority of people}} like it. It rubbed some people the wrong way and to be honest, I’m glad it did. I don’t expect every person to agree with us or be <b>our</b> <b>fan.</b> There {{are a lot of people}} out there I don’t want at our shows because they are a part of the problem with the music scene. We want to be part of the solution." [...] Videos were made on Kings of Deceit, The Cynic and We The Machines.|$|R
5000|$|On 5 December 2008, 11 {{years after}} their disbandment, the band reunited for a {{performance}} at a party held by popular Athenian weekly LIFO - [...] "a gift to <b>our</b> old <b>fans</b> and <b>our</b> new friends" [...] as Kbhta stated.|$|R
500|$|In 2015, {{the group}} {{found out that}} [...] "Sad Song" [...] had become their most popular song, despite the song not having a music video nor being {{performed}} live on tour. They noticed that the song had accumulated around 20 million plays on Spotify, which Clark initially presumed to be a mistake. Previously, [...] "Check Yes Juliet" [...] was the group's most popular song, selling 2,000 copies per week. [...] "Sad Song", however, was selling 3,000 copies per week. Clark called it [...] "so strange. [...] I just remember finding out that it happened and just being so blown away that for once in our career, we let <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> choose, kind of accidentally, which song {{we were going to}} go with." ...|$|E
500|$|Universal Music Group took extreme {{measures}} {{to prevent the}} album from leaking, offering pre-release listening sessions for critics instead of sending out review copies. However, Universal Music Australia's online music store, getmusic.com.au, accidentally released the album for digital sale on 18February 2009, almost {{two weeks before the}} scheduled release date. The complete album appeared on the website for a short time before it was removed, and the accidental sale led to the album's being leaked and shared across the Internet. U2 reacted to the leak with some positivity. The Edge stated, [...] "The one good thing about that is a lot of <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> have already given us their thumbs up. Even though it was fans getting it for free." ...|$|E

The song was released in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 21 February 2010 as a digital download, and as a CD single the following day. During an interview with David Balls of Digital Spy, group member Heidi Range explained the reason for the song's release as the album's third single, saying: [...] "It's had a really good response from radio and <b>our</b> <b>fans</b> on the website.

5000|$|Need for Speed {{producer}} Jesse Abney thinks Shift 2: Unleashed will {{cross the}} racing divide to entice arcade fans {{as well as}} sim fans. Regarding the first Shift, [...] "‘accessible’ was used a lot, {{to the chagrin of}} simulation fans," [...] the producer told NowGamer. [...] "But you want those incremental steps to {{be a bit of a}} handholding exercise - Shift was developed as an acknowledgement that <b>our</b> <b>fan</b> base has grown up with us over 17 years. Their interests have changed. Some of them have grown up to become the race drivers we talk to today. They want that type of game. So we knew to acknowledge them and their interests, we really had to build an authentic racing game. And that’s what Shift was." ...|$|R
