5|$|Thomee (1986) mapped {{the habitat}} {{occupied}} by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The snails occupied {{an area of}} 53.7m2 at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Falls,</b> with most snails found {{in an area of}} 11.4m2. More intense studies from 2002 to 2004 have further defined the occupied habitat. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found on a ledge beginning at 4m from the eastern edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Falls</b> and extending to 16m from the Falls. In addition, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{can be found on the}} middle ledge 4m above the primary ledge and in the talus as far as 3m downslope from the primary ledge.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{commenced}} work on The Dalles Dam in 1952 {{and completed}} it five years later. On March 10, 1957, hundreds of observers looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and consumed {{the village of}} Celilo, ending an age-old existence for those who lived there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on a bluff overlooking the former location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b>|$|E
5|$|Humidity: Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{appears to}} require sustained, very high humidity. Active snails were found only when {{relative}} humidity approached 100 percent; during dry periods, snails {{were found to}} be relatively inactive. Portions of the habitat and substrate are consistently at near maximum humidity or saturation in the spray zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Falls.</b> However, during 2002, the majority of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found >5m {{from the edge of the}} ledge nearest the Falls. Recent monitoring (prior to 2006) with temperature and humidity data loggers shows that these snails occur in an area where the humidity generally varies from 80 to 100 percent during the active season. Further investigation is needed into seasonal and annual hydrological conditions within the Chittenango Creek watershed and at the Falls relative to the high-humidity areas used by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened strip of land was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E

5|$|Ricketts Glen is {{the name}} given to the Kitchen Creek valley south and {{downstream}} of Waters Meet. It is 1.8miles (2.9km) between Pennsylvania Route 118 and Waters Meet on the Falls Trail, making this the longest glen. The three northernmost waterfalls are all within 0.5miles (0.80km) of Waters Meet, and are only a short hike {{from the bottom of}} Ganoga Glen or Glen Leigh. The southern part of this glen has large areas of old-growth forest, chiefly hemlocks. Ricketts Glen is entirely in the Catskill Formation and all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> on this section of Kitchen Creek have plunge pools.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low herbaceous vegetation, including Eutrochium purpureum, Angelica atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 flood event. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Falls,</b> and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern skunk cabbage Symplocarpus foetidus and Angelica atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In the patch of watercress, the vegetation is dense and lush. Although the watercress is dominant, other species include Angelica atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints Mentha spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional sere, periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, Livingstone {{returned}} to the area and made a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> with John Kirk. Other early European visitors included Portuguese explorer Serpa Pinto, Czech explorer Emil Holub, who made the first detailed plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls</b> and its surroundings in 1875 (published in 1880), and British artist Thomas Baines, who executed {{some of the earliest}} paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>falls.</b> Until the area was opened up by the building of the railway in 1905, though, the falls were seldom visited by other Europeans.
