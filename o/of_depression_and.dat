40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of Pilates and walking on quality <b>of</b> life, <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> anxiety levels. Methods: Sixty-three overweight/obese {{participants}} were randomly divided into: control (n = 20), walking (n = 21), and Pilates (n = 22) groups. Pilates and walking groups attended eight weeks of 60 -minute exercise sessions three times per week. Quality <b>of</b> life, <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> state- and trait-anxiety levels were evaluated before and after eight weeks of training. Results: Scores of quality <b>of</b> life, <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> trait-anxiety improved in the Pilates and walking groups. State-anxiety levels improved only in the walking group. Conclusion: Pilates and walking positively impact quality <b>of</b> life, <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. The Pilates method {{could be used as}} an alternative to improve mood disorders in overweight/obese individuals...|$|R

5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility and disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{routinely}} written {{throughout his}} career, including developing his stand-up comedy routines {{in his early}} stand-up career, and then moving on to assist in writing sitcoms. In 1997, Carey published his autobiography, , wherein he shared memories of his early childhood and of his father's death when he was eight. He also revealed that he was once molested, had suffered bouts <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> had made two suicide attempts by swallowing {{a large amount of}} sleeping pills. The book discusses his college fraternity years while attending Kent State University and his professional career up to that time. The book featured large amounts of profanity and, as the title suggests, includes multiple dirty jokes (there is one at the start of each chapter) and references to beer, which was a departure from his on-screen persona. The book was featured on The New York Times bestseller list for three months.|$|E
40|$|Background: Traumatic {{injury and}} mental health {{disorders}} are co-associated. Early identification <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress following injury, and subsequent preventive intervention, may reduce the long-term symptoms and negative impacts associated with <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> anxiety. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the incidence, severity <b>and</b> predictors <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress in injured patients in the acute phase of care, and at six months following injury, as well as the effectiveness of an in-hospital screening tool. Methods: This descriptive longitudinal study of trauma patients was conducted at a Level 1 Metropolitan Trauma Centre in Australia over 14 months. Participants were interviewed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short-form version (DASS- 21) during hospital admission then at 3 and 6 months after injury. Descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate participant characteristics <b>and</b> incidence <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress. Correlations and logistic regression were conducted to investigate the ability of the DASS- 21 to predict symptoms <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress and to investigate factors associated with <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress 6 months after injury. Results: 201 participants ranging in age (18 – 94 years) and injury severity participated in the baseline interview and 109 completed all 3 interviews over 6 months. Over half (54 %) reported above normal scores for depression, anxiety and/or stress in at least one of the 3 time points. Intensive care unit admission <b>and</b> high levels <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress at 3 months post injury were predictors for high levels <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress at 6 months. Low scores for <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress during admission were correlated with low scores for <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress at 3 and 6 months. Conclusion: <b>Depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress in patients hospitalised following injury is common and should be anticipated in patients who have had an intensive care admission. Screening at 3 months following injury identifies patients at risk of long-term symptoms <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety <b>and</b> stress...|$|R

5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E

His son exhibited psychic potential and consequently is conscripted for the Confederate ghost program, where the intense training ultimately kills him. Afterward, Raynor's wife Liddy dies after a period <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> illness. As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in Queen of Blades, a novelization {{of the events of}} StarCrafts Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue Sarah Kerrigan from the Zerg on Char and eventually allies with the high templar Tassadar and renegade dark templar Zeratul, facilitating the reconciliation between the two estranged Protoss.|$|E

Bjaaland and Hassel declined; neither participated in any further polar ventures. Helmer Hanssen and Wisting both joined Maud; the latter took over the leadership when Amundsen left the expedition. In 1936 Wisting captained Fram on the ship's final voyage to Oslo, where it became a museum. Johansen, who {{had been unable to}} settle back into normal life on his return from Antarctica, became withdrawn and uncommunicative.

5|$|The Oliviers {{returned}} to Britain in March 1943, and Leigh toured through North Africa {{that same year}} {{as part of a}} revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week to volunteer as part of the war effort. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944 she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, then had a miscarriage. Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point, with her falling to the floor, sobbing in an hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns. Olivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode– several days of hyperactivity followed by a period <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit old man and lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E

40|$|Objective University {{students}} {{are vulnerable to}} <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> other co-occurring mental disorders, but few receive treatment. Male university {{students are}} at particular risk of not receiving assistance. A better understanding of {{gender differences in the}} experience <b>of</b> <b>depression</b> may assist in improving its detection and the provision of appropriate support and prevention strategies. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify whether male and female university students have different patterns <b>of</b> self-reported <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> co-occurring anxiety and stress. Method A total of 1, 401 first year students from a regional Australian university completed the 21 -item version <b>of</b> the <b>Depression</b> Anxiety <b>and</b> Stress Scales. Data were collected in 2001, 2006, 2010, and 2012. Multidimensional scaling analyses were conducted to identify patterns <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety, <b>and</b> stress in men and women with different depression severity. Results Depressed men reported mixed patterns <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety, <b>and</b> stress that were clustered by behavioural and physiological function, whereas depressed women reported distinctive patterns <b>of</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety, <b>and</b> stress as prescribed by categories <b>of</b> the individual <b>Depression</b> Anxiety <b>and</b> Stress Scales. Conclusions Depressed male and female university students may categorise and interpret their psychological distress differently. Depressed men might tend to categorise symptoms by function and physiology, whereas depressed women might prefer to use common verbally defined constructs of psychological distress. It may be important for mental health professionals to consider these gender differences in categorisation and patterns of symptoms when screening for depression to increase chances of university students receiving appropriately targeted treatment...|$|R
