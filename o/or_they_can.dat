5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E
5|$|Caesar's Legion – {{siding with}} the Legion will lead the Courier to help attack Hoover Dam. The Courier must also enter Oliver's {{compound}} where they have the choice to either convince him to retreat {{for the sake of}} his men, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> kill him. The Legion seizes Hoover Dam, forcing the NCR to retreat, allowing Caesar's Legion to gain control over New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland.|$|E
5|$|Full-featured USB3.1 Type-C cables are {{electronically}} marked cables {{that contain}} {{a full set}} of wires and a chip with an ID function based on the configuration data channel and vendor-defined messages (VDMs) from the USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification. USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V power bus in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|Mr. House – {{siding with}} Mr. House {{will lead the}} Courier to enter the control room in Hoover Dam and install the {{override}} chip in order to power the Securitron Army. The Courier must also either convince both General Oliver and the Legate to stand down <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> kill them. Mr. House and his Securitrons drive both the NCR and the Legion out of Hoover Dam, taking control of it, while still running New Vegas.|$|E
5|$|New California Republic – {{siding with}} the NCR will lead the Courier to defend Hoover Dam from the Legion. The Courier must also lead {{an attack on the}} Legate's camp where they have the choice to either {{convince}} the Legate to end the fighting peacefully, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> kill the Legate. The NCR then wins the battle and annexes New Vegas and the entire Mojave Wasteland.|$|E

5|$|Pyruvate {{molecules}} {{produced by}} glycolysis are actively transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, {{and into the}} matrix where they can either be oxidized and combined with coenzyme A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be carboxylated (by pyruvate carboxylase) to form oxaloacetate. This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.|$|E
5|$|Two-year-old bushes {{are usually}} planted but strong one-year-old stock {{can also be}} used. Planting {{certified}} stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses. On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of 1.5 to 1.8 metres (5 to 6ft) <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be set in rows with planting intervals of 1.2 metres (4ft) and row separations of 2.5 metres (8ft) or more. In the UK, young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base.|$|E

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{can bring}} mild weather {{with a little}} rain and surface winds of , <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding , (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation {{that is associated with}} the warm front is often extensive. In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the comma head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent thunderstorms, and thundersnows. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each of which provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI keyboard controller, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on grid-based {{self-contained}} maps and are governed by a turn-based system where units on both sides are given their chance to move and act. Once a unit has moved, depending on their position relative to allied units and enemies, they may perform actions such as attacking or supporting allied characters through statistic-enhancing abilities, <b>or</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> wait until the next turn. When attacking, the game transitions from the top-down view of the map to a side-view battlefield, where a cinematic battle plays between the player and enemy units. Each unit has access to different weapons and items, but these will break {{after a number of}} uses and must be repaired in between missions. The effectiveness of melee weapons is dictated with the series' recurring Weapons Triangle mechanic: axes are strong against lances, lances strong against swords, and swords strong against axes. Villages found during map battles will be attacked; if defended by the player, non-player characters within the village will give hints about future objectives. A map is cleared when the boss is defeated. If characters fall in battle, they are subjected to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of the}} game. If Roy dies, the game ends and the map must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} seven races in the game, but only TetraCorp (representing the human race) is playable. Upon {{discovering}} an alien race, diplomacy can be initiated in order to arrange actions such as non-aggression pacts and joint-combat treaties, as well as accuse them of spying or trading with the Mauna (Trading with the Mauna is illegal under Federation law). If a faction {{is found to be}} trading with the Mauna, Jane Fong (Federal minister for trade relations in addition to her role as Terran ambassador for the Fragmented Sectors) can be informed, who will in turn tell the Federation, which could result in increased hostility towards the offending faction from all others <b>or,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be threatened with blackmail and forced to pay a tribute in return for the players silence. Each race has a unique look and diplomatic strategies and everything happens in real time with highly detailed characters that are well animated and lip-synced. One of the factions — The Mauna, are not members of the Federation and are unable to be negotiated or traded with.|$|E
