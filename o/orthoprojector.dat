In this paper H is equipped with an identity resolving <b>orthoprojector</b> chain. The Weierstrass type result of Prenter, namely, if ƒ is any continuous function on H, then there exists a finite order approximating polynomic operator on every compact K ⊂ H, is sharpened by the extension: if ƒ is strictly causal (strictly anticausal) then the polynomic approximation can also be strictly causal (strictly anticausal).

40|$|AbstractFor a matrix-valued measure M we {{introduce}} {{a notion of}} convergence in measure M, which generalizes the notion of convergence in measure {{with respect to a}} scalar measure and takes into account the matrix structure of M. Let S be a subset of the set of matrices of given size. It is easy to see that the set of S-valued measurable functions is closed under convergence in measure with respect to a matrix-valued measure if and only if S is a ρ-closed set, i. e. if and only if SP is closed for any <b>orthoprojector</b> P. We discuss the behaviour of ρ-closed sets under operations of linear algebra and the ρ-closedness of particular classes of matrices...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this article}} a linear operator, K, defined on a Hilbert space {{equipped}} with a chain of <b>orthoprojectors</b> is considered. It is proved that if K enjoys a particular property {{with respect to the}} chain of <b>orthoprojectors,</b> then the series ∑n = 0 ∞ Kn converges in the uniform operator norm. The proof uses purely algebraic techniques and does not require compactness of K. As such, it is a significant generalization of the well-known Volterra principle of inversion...|$|R

40|$|In the Hamiltonian {{approach}} {{on a single}} spatial plaquette, we construct a quantum (lattice) gauge theory which incorporates the classical singularities. The reduced phase space is a stratified Kähler space, and we make explicit the requisite singular holomorphic quantization procedure on this space. On the quantum level, this procedure furnishes a costratified Hilbert space, that is, a Hilbert space together with a system which consists of the subspaces associated with the strata of the reduced phase space and of the corresponding <b>orthoprojectors.</b> The costratified Hilbert space structure reflects the stratification of the reduced phase space. For the special case where the structure group is SU(2), we discuss the tunneling probabilities between the strata, determine the energy eigenstates and study the corresponding expectation values of the <b>orthoprojectors</b> onto the subspaces associated with the strata in the strong and weak coupling approximations.

40|$|In a 1973 paper Carl de Boor conjectured and 26 {{years later}} in 1999 Alexei Shadrin proved in full {{generality}} that the L_∞-norm of the spline <b>orthoprojector</b> is bounded independently of the knot sequence for every order of the spline space. Following the appearance of Shadrin's proof, it was only very natural to carry the study of L_∞-boundedness of the <b>orthoprojector</b> over to L-splines. This is a modest attempt in the direction. We consider orthoprojectors on spaces of L-splines generated by certain second-order linear differential operators with constant coefficients. We concern ourselves with whether the L_ 2 -norms of the resulting orthoprojectors are bounded independenly of the knot sequence. For exponential splines generated by the operator L=D^ 2 -α^ 2 we find the exact mesh-independent bound, which proves {{to be the same}} as in the corresponding polynomial case of linear splines, that is 3. For exponential splines generated by the operator L=(D-α^ 2) (D+β^ 2) we prove mesh-independent boundedness without finding an explicit bound. For trigonometric splines generated by the operator L=D^ 2 +α^ 2 with standard constraints on the partition diameter we find a mesh-independent bound. We also consider a model example which shows that the above constraints are not necessary for mesh-independent boundedness to hold - due to an interesting "interference" phenomenon, the L_ 2 -approximant remains bounded while both its coefficients and the norms of LB-splines tend to infinity.

40|$|The {{fields of}} {{compressed}} sensing (CS) and matrix completion {{have shown that}} high-dimensional signals with sparse or low-rank structure can be effectively projected into a low-dimensional space (for efficient acquisition or processing) when the projection operator achieves a stable embedding of the data by satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). It {{has also been shown}} that such stable embeddings can be achieved for general Riemannian submanifolds when random <b>orthoprojectors</b> are used for dimensionality reduction. Due to computational costs and system constraints, the CS community has recently explored the RIP for structured random matrices (e. g., random convolutions, localized measurements, deterministic constructions). The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that any matrix satisfying the RIP (i. e., providing a stable embedding for sparse signals) can be used to construct a stable embedding for manifold-modeled signals by randomizing the column signs and paying reasonable additional factors in the number of measurements. We demonstrate this result with several new constructions for stable manifold embeddings using structured matrices. This result allows advances in efficient projection schemes for sparse signals to be immediately applied to manifold signal models...|$|R
40|$|By {{using the}} method of matrix Riccati ODE, we study Riemannian {{manifolds}} with foliations (distributions), whose mixed Ricci or scalar curvature is nonnegative and the norms of integrability tensors are bounded above. We obtain the integral formula for mixed scalar curvature along the complete leaf, rigidity of totally geodesic distribution, splitting of foliation with "large" dimension. 1. Main results For two complementary orthogonal distributions T 1 and T 2 on TM we define the structural tensors B 1 : T 2 Θ T 1 ! T 1; B 2 : T 1 Θ T 2 ! T 2 by formulae, where P i : TM ! T i are <b>orthoprojectors</b> B 1 (y; x) := P 1 (r x y); B 2 (x; y) := P 2 (r y x) : (1) Obviously, the equation B i = 0 means that T i is tangent to totally geodesic foliation.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of classical phase space singularities the standard methods are insufficient to attack the problem of quantization. In certain situations these difficulties can be overcome {{by means of the}} notion of stratified Kähler space. Examples include certain moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles on a Riemann surface as well as the closure of a holomorphic nilpotent orbit, a special case being reduced spaces arising from angular momentum. Projectivization of holomorphic nilpotent orbits yields exotic stratified Kähler structures on complex projective spaces and on certain complex projective varieties including complex projective quadrics. Symplectic reduction, applied to Kähler manifolds, yields a particular class of examples; this includes adjoint and generalized adjoint quotients of complex semisimple Lie groups which, in turn, underly certain lattice gauge theories. A suitable holomorphic quantization procedure on stratified Kähler spaces unveils a certain quantum structure having the classical singularities as its shadow. The new structure which thus emerges is that of a costratified Hilbert space, that is, a Hilbert space together with a system which consists of the subspaces associated with the strata of the reduced phase space and of the corresponding <b>orthoprojectors.</b> The costratified Hilbert space structure reflects the stratification of the reduced phase space. We will illustrate the approach with a quantum (lattice) gauge theory which involves certain classical singularities...|$|R
40|$|We give {{a summary}} of our results based on {{discrete}} Cauchy-Riemann operators in the plane. These operators are defined {{in a way that}} the factorization of the real Laplacian into two adjoint Cauchy-Riemann operators is possible. This property is similar to the continuous case and can especially be used for calculating the discrete fundamental solution of our finite difference operators. Based on the discrete fundamental solution we define a discrete operator that is right inverse to the discrete Cauchy-Riemann operator. In relation with this operator and an operator on the boundary we are able to prove a discrete version of the Borel-Pompeiu formula. In the second part we present a possibility to solve discrete Stokes and Navier-Stokes problems. The concept is based on the orthogonal decomposition of the space l 2 into the space of discrete holomorphic functions and its orthogonal complement. By introducing the <b>orthoprojectors</b> P+h and Q+h we can prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution of discrete Stokes problems. In addition we state a problem that is equivalent to the discrete Navier-Stokes problem and can be used in an iteration procedure to describe the solution of this problem. For a special case of the Navier-Stokes equations we are able to calculate discrete potential and stream functions. The adapted model includes important algebraical properties and can immediately be used for numerical calculations. A numerical example is presented at the end of the article...|$|R
