5|$|In January 2005, Pinker defended Lawrence Summers, {{president}} of Harvard University, whose comments about a gender gap {{in mathematics and}} science angered much of the faculty. Pinker noted that Summers's remarks, properly understood, were hypotheses about overlapping statistical distributions of men's and women's talents and tastes, and that in a university such hypotheses <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> subject of empirical testing rather than dogma and outrage. Edge.org ran a debate between Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke on gender and science.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Franklin Butler {{was born}} in Deerfield, New Hampshire, and later moved to Massachusetts to pursue a legal career. He built a {{successful}} practice in the 1840s and 1850s, and became involved in local politics as a Democrat. A compelling public speaker, Butler was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1853. He successfully ran for a Massachusetts Senate seat in 1859. Despite his Protestant upbringing he gained a faithful following among Massachusetts Catholics, and also built support among laborers. In the 1860 presidential campaign, Butler sought compromise with the slave power, and believed Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party's nominee for president.|$|E

5|$|There remains some {{uncertainty}} {{whether the}} source test or nature test <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> determining test. It appears, though, {{that the impact}} of Datafin remains qualified in the light of other decisions where the source of the power was held to be the determining factor. It is also worth noting that the effect of the nature test is greatly restricted in practice due to the insistence on the difference between contractual and governmental powers. Where there is a contractual relationship between an aggrieved person and the body making a decision affecting the person, this tends to place the dispute on the private law side of the public–private divide, making the decision not amenable to judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Before Little's purchase, the punchbowl {{had been}} the {{property}} of Sir Timothy Augustine Coghlan, New South Wales Agent-General in London, who bought the bowl for ₤40 in 1923 from one Miss Hall for his own collection. The bowl was subsequently {{in the possession of}} Francis Edwards Ltd before Coghlan's unexpected death in London on 30April 1926. Coghlan had personally collected the bowl from a Miss Hall at 'Highfield', 63 Seabrook Rd, Hythe (Kent), England, a few months after she had decided to offer the bowl to the New South Wales Government for ₤50. Earlier, a visit to Miss Hall by a Sydney schoolteacher, Jessie Stead, on 6August 1923, resulted in the proposal that the bowl <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> property of the City of Sydney. Jessie Stead later indicated that she was informed by Miss Hall that her father had acquired the bowl in the late 1840s – the earliest dating for the punchbowls' provenance – and that Miss Hall believed the bowl was commissioned for William Bligh, New South Wales's fourth Governor (in office 1806–1808). In 2002, the State Library of New South Wales digitised the punchbowl images {{with the support of the}} Nelson Meers Foundation, a philanthropic foundation supporting Australian arts, and the bowl became one of the 100 extraordinary library objects to be exhibited as part of Mitchell Library's centenary celebrations in 2010.|$|E

Israel's position is that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> negotiating partner in the peace talks, and not Hamas, which has at times engaged with Israel in escalations of the conflict and attacks Israel's civilian population. The Oslo Accords and the Camp David 2000 summit negotiations revealed the possibility of a two state system being accepted by Israeli leadership as a possible peace solution.|$|E

His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union he had so passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, {{and at the same time}} the equable quality, of Grattan's character.

Hart and Michaels then aired their grievances with one another while recognizing that their Ironman match at Wrestlemania XII <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> highlight of their relationship rather than the Montreal Screwjob. The pair shook hands and Michaels turned as if to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but instead chose to embrace Hart. While many cast doubts on the sincerity of their reconciliation, Hart has confirmed that it was indeed genuine, as did Michaels, and acknowledged that he felt that Michaels changed as a person, for the better. Later in the night, a storyline between Hart and McMahon began with the two appearing {{to have their own}} reconciliation only to have McMahon subsequently kick Hart in the gut: in real life, Hart and McMahon have been on slight speaking terms since 2002, when McMahon called Hart during his recovery from a stroke. The feud culminated in an encounter at WrestleMania 26, which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a match that involved the Hart family. After the match, Hart would continue to periodically work televised events for WWE.|$|E

A system which looks to the extinction of a race is too abhorant for a Nation to indulge in without without entailing upon the wrath of all Christendom, and without engendering in the Citizen a disregard for human life, and the rights of others, dangerous to society.

500|$|After the 2001 {{inauguration of}} Harvard University's twenty-seventh president, Lawrence Summers, Lewis and Summers came into {{conflict}} over {{the direction of}} the College and its educational philosophy. Lewis, for example, emphasized the importance of extracurricular pursuits, advising incoming freshmen that [...] "flexibility in your schedule, unstructured time in your day, and evenings spent with your friends rather than your books are all, in a larger sense, essential for your education", while Summers complained of an insufficiently intellectual [...] "Camp Harvard" [...] and admonished students that [...] "You are here to work, and your business here is to learn."

500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong {{would be the}} first person on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first guy out... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision."

That <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> measure of a man's fitness for the Hall of Fame, the only measure." [...] However, Warren Giles, then-chairman of the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee, pointed out to baseball historian Bob Broeg in 1972 that induction to the Hall required [...] "participation in ten championship seasons." [...] Joss {{had been on the}} Cleveland roster in 1911 and participated in spring training, falling ill just before regular season play commenced. Hence it was argued he had [...] "participated" [...] in the 1911 season, his tenth. The Hall's Board of Directors waived the eligibility requirements for Joss. Joe Reichler, a member of the Commissioner's office, worked to allow Joss to become eligible for the Hall and succeeded in 1977. Joss was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1978. He is the only player in the Hall of Fame whose regular season playing career lasted fewer than ten years.|$|E
