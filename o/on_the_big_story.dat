5000|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the person who brought ID (intelligent design) to DI (Discovery Institute)" [...] by historian Edward Larson, who was a fellow at the Discovery Institute prior to it becoming the center of the intelligent design movement. In 2004, the DI helped introduce ID to the Dover Area School District, which resulted in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District case where ID was ruled to be based on religious beliefs rather than scientific evidence. Discussing ID in relation to Dover, on May 6, 2005 Meyer debated Eugenie Scott, <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Story</b> with John Gibson. During the debate, Meyer argued that intelligent design is critical of more than just evolutionary mechanisms like natural selection that lead to diversification, but of common descent itself.|$|E
40|$|It’s {{hard for}} me to compare how Australians and others cover China, in part because we rarely {{actually}} meet each other to swap notes, except for the occasional encounter via the Foreign Correspondents Club of China (an admirable organization, but one without formal standing in China because it lacks—for obvious reasons on both sides—the sponsorship of a party or government body) and in part because the whole structure of journalism in China does not bring reporters together frequently, as it does in most other countries. I sometimes go for weeks without encountering another journalist. For China has few press conferences, parliament sessions (two weeks in a year), company annual general meetings or special meetings (never), court hearings open to the media (in my experience, again, never) that bring journalists together. We tend to do our own thing, often, which—if we are attentive to our audiences—reflects their interests. What, as a result, do I tend to report on? My readers like to see “their” correspondent’s name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> of the day. So I will cover the major domestic and international events involving China, as other journalists do. I was in Sichuan, for instance, covering the horrific human impact of the earthquake there. But because China has become Australia’s top trading partner—and has played a prominent role in driving Australia’s continued economic growth, now in its 17 th year—I also write substantially on economic and business stories. And there is a constant call for cultural and arts stories, about Chinese writers, film makers and artists...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{concepts}} to encourage quality living for us and our children is care for the environment. This work concentrates on possibility for environmental education through the popular media of computer games. The first part is trying to answer the question, how humans are nowadays effecting environment {{and what are the}} consequences of our behaviour. The main finding is that education plays a big role when trying to prevent pollution. Afterwards, it presents different goals and methods of environmental education and is later focused on influence of computer games in education. Review of current internet environmental games is done, while seeking a game which would incorporate high standards of environmental education. Due to presenting mostly narrow insight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>story</b> of polluting our planet, the ideal environmental game was not found. Main focuses in this part were also exploring educational parts of games and also user interfaces, their good use and testing. The main goal of this thesis was to design and to program internet based environmental computer game. The game was created in Adobe Flash Cs 4 and its Action Script 3. 0. It's presented through technical view and its content. Evaluation of game is done through educational evaluation and through user interface testing. The game is added to this diploma thesis. Evaluation shows that the goal of creating educational game was achieved. And also the results of user interface testing show that interaction is good in most cases. This work presents insight into high standards of environmental education and tries to keep up to them, while designing the browser game. By creating educational software using Adobe Flash, makes decisions on which tool to use to create educational material, easier. It also presents the potential usefulness of educational games and their important disadvantages. ...|$|E

Madeline and Harvey begin an affair, but when Dent decides to end the relationship and return to his wife-to-be, she is driven insane with rage and murders Marilyn. Harvey's therapy and surgery prevent him from tapping into his darker side, so he deliberately scars his face with hot coals, travels to Gotham's docks, and kills Madeline.

40|$|What is your {{purpose in}} life? This {{question}} {{is as old}} as the human race itself. Some argue that our purpose is to find happiness. Others say our purpose is to love others, to become the best version of ourselves, or to follow God’s will. Still others say there is no purpose to life at all. I believe that our lives do have a purpose, and that the clues are all around us in plain view. You can’t miss them. Our purpose is so deeply imbedded in our culture that we easily overlook it or take it for granted. Put simply, your purpose in life is to live the life of a hero. The hero’s journey is captured in all the great stories in literature, and in all the great movies we enjoy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> screen. Hero <b>stories</b> endow our lives with meaning and reveal how a human life is meant to be lived. Hero stories illuminate your true purpose in four ways: 1. You will go on a journey. At some point during your life, you will journey away from the comforts of your familiar world. In The Wizard of Oz, a tornado sends Dorothy to the land of Oz. In The Fault in Our Stars, cancer sends Hazel to Amsterdam...|$|R
