25|$|YBR134C (aka SUP45 {{encoding}} eRF1, {{a translation}} termination factor) {{is located on}} the right arm of chromosome 2 and is the 134th <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>ORF)</b> on that arm, starting from the centromere. The coding sequence is on the Crick strand of the DNA.|$|E
25|$|Transcribed {{from this}} gene is a 1.5kb mRNA with an <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>ORF)</b> of 969-975 bp {{encoding}} a 323-325 amino acid protein. In the rat, the ORF is 981 bp {{in length and}} encodes for a 327-amino acid protein. TRAP is translated as a single polypeptide.|$|E
25|$|The MIR155HG RNA {{transcript}} {{does not}} contain a long <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>ORF),</b> however, it does include an imperfectly base-paired stem loop that is conserved across species. This non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is now defined as a primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA). Once miR-155 pri-miRNA is transcribed, this transcript is cleaved by the nuclear microprocessor complex, of which the core components are the RNase III type endonuclease Drosha and the DiGeorge critical region 8 (DGCR8) protein, to produce a 65 nucleotide stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-mir-155) (see Figure 2).|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the proteome of E. coli. By 2006, 1,627 (38%) of the 4,237 <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORFs)</b> had been identified experimentally.|$|R
25|$|CCR5 {{is one of}} {{the cell}} entry co-factors {{associated}} with HIV, most frequently involved with nonsyncytium-inducing strains, is most apparent in HIV patients as opposed to AIDS patients. A 32 base pair deletion in CCR5 has been identified as a mutation that negates the likelihood of an HIV infection. This region on the <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> <b>ORF</b> contains a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon. This leads to the loss of the HIV-coreceptor function in vitro. CCR5-1 is considered the wild type and CCR5-2 is considered to be the mutant allele. Those with a heterozygous mutation for the CCR5 were less susceptible to the development of HIV. In a study, despite high exposure to the HIV virus, there was no one homozygous for the CCR5 mutation that tested positive for HIV.|$|E
25|$|The most {{abundant}} variant of CCDC130 is encoded {{by the second}} longest <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>ORF),</b> corresponding to a 396 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 44.8 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.252. The CCDC130 protein is rich in charged amino acids and deficient in uncharged, non-polar amino acids. Mobyle @ Pasteur predicted CCDC130 to be extremely hydrophilic due to {{the large numbers of}} charged and polar amino acids, with no site scoring above zero on the hydrophobicity graph and some sites reaching as low as -6 (F180). There is a region in the coiled coil domain (182-214) in which 14 of 18 amino acids are charged. SAPS analysis predicted that this protein would be unstable. Due to its high hydrophilicity, this protein definitely does not contain transmembrane segments.|$|E
25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>ORF),</b> and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence always carry an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.|$|E
25|$|The genome is {{arranged}} into three <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORFs),</b> with an overlap of approximately 70 nucleotides between ORF1a and ORF1b. The remaining ORF {{is known as}} ORF2.|$|R
50|$|A typical L1 {{element is}} {{approximately}} 6,000 base pairs long {{and consists of}} two non-overlapping <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORF)</b> which are flanked by UTR and target site duplications.|$|R
50|$|The genome is linear 30,898 base pairs {{in length}} and {{contains}} 309 base pair inverted terminal repeat sequences. The G+C content is 68.4%. It encodes 56 <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORFs).</b>|$|R
25|$|Frameshift {{mutations}} {{are known}} to be a factor in colorectal cancer as well as other cancers with microsatellite instability. As stated previously, frameshift mutations are more likely to occur in a region of repeat sequence. When DNA mismatch repair does not fix the addition or deletion of bases, these mutations {{are more likely to be}} pathogenic. This may be in part because the tumor is not told to stop growing. Experiments in yeast and bacteria help to show characteristics of microsatellites that may contribute to defective DNA mismatch repair. These include the length of the microsatellite, the makeup of the genetic material and how pure the repeats are. Based on experimental results longer microsatellites have a higher rate of frameshift mutations. The flanking DNA can also contribute to frameshift mutations. In prostate cancer a frameshift mutation changes the <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>ORF)</b> and prevents apoptosis from occurring. This leads to an unregulated growth of the tumor. While there are environmental factors that contribute to the progression of prostate cancer, there is also a genetic component. During testing of coding regions to identify mutations, 116 genetic variants were discovered, including 61 frameshift mutations. There are over 500 mutations on chromosome 17 that seem to play a role in the development of breast and ovarian cancer in the BRCA1 gene, many of which are frameshift.|$|E

50|$|Totivirus have a genome of 4700-6700 {{nucleotides}} {{in length}} and only a single copy of the genome {{is present in the}} particle. The nucleic acid content of Totivirus is usually of one molecule but can also contain three or four segments of linear double stranded RNA. The genome contains two large overlapping <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORFs).</b> These <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORFs)</b> code for a capsid protein (CP) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP). The 5' end of the positive strand of the dsRNA genome has no cap and is very structured.Totivirus contains a long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) which functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Totiviruses can have satellite RNAs encoding a toxin.|$|R
30|$|Although the HBV genome, {{which is}} {{circular}} and approximately 3200 nucleotides in length, is partially double-stranded DNA, it replicates via a single-stranded RNA intermediate (Summers et al. 1978). The HBV genome codes for seven proteins, in four overlapping, <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORFs)</b> (Michel and Tiollais 1987).|$|R
50|$|The genome is ~2.6 kilobases {{in length}} and encodes two <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frames</b> (<b>ORFs).</b> The larger of the ORFs encodes the {{replicase}} gene and the other the putative capsid protein.

50|$|An <b>open</b> <b>reading</b> <b>frame</b> (<b>ORF)</b> is {{a reading}} frame {{that has the}} {{potential}} to be transcribed into RNA and translated into protein. It requires a continuous sequence of DNA from a start codon, through a subsequent region which usually has a length that is a multiple of 3 nucleotides, to a stop codon in the same reading frame.|$|E
