40|$|Hot rolling {{is among}} the most widely used {{manufacturing}} techniques. However, rolling mills are major resource consumers; thus, urgent rationalisation is required in the relevant industrial systems. Roll pass design (RPD) is a principal factor that determines process efficiency, product quality and resource consumption. Therefore, it is important to optimise RPD including the selection of roll materials. New avenues for optimising RPD are to be found by extracting knowledge buried in the vast repository of industrial records. The extracted statistical functions are then used for the nonlinear optimisation of RPD parameters. The design of a leading <b>oval</b> <b>groove</b> for rolling a wire rod is presented as an example, along with a discussion of the general mathematical aspects. The presented case analysis shows how regression analysis and the probability density function (PDF) are used to define principal dimensions—height and width—for the leading <b>oval</b> <b>groove.</b> These two dimensions are inferred following the logic of probabilistic design, and are based on an understanding of the trend in groove contour changes, which occur due to surface wear during rolling campaigns...|$|R

The term was originally proposed by Teresa Miller and Reed Haslam in 1976 to describe a widespread type of rock carving in western North America.

The form is quite prevalent in California and is applied to a number of Native American rock carving sites in this portion of the United States.|$|R

40|$|A {{new engine}} design concept, {{characterized}} by a single cylinder-double piston and a cycloid crank rotor instead of the conventional crankshaft has been developed recently by Gul & Co Development AB, Sweden. The rotor (crank disc) is equipped with an <b>oval</b> <b>groove</b> {{in the shape of}} a sinusoidal cycloid according to the expression Y=S(-Sin(2 ) /(2 )) where S is the piston stroke and  varies from 0 to 1. Inside the <b>oval</b> <b>groove</b> a ball rolls/ slides in order to transfer force from the piston to the rotor. Such a rotor contains groove surfaces for the valve movement control as well. Each turn of the rotor corresponds to four strokes for both the pistons. Thus, a full 4 -stroke engine cycle is developed for a single nonconventional crankshaft revolution. Having the extra freedom to select an optimal piston movement, the new design is believed to have the potential to provide low emissions, low noise levels and lower fuel consumption. Therefore, it has been subjected to an engine thermodynamics simulation, to provide an insight to engine performance. Simulation results and preliminary laboratory tests have shown that the optimized cycloid crank rotor, which further intensifies the reduction of the piston speed close to both dead centers, gives better conditions for the combustion processes, and thus a higher efficiency. Since the single cylinder-double piston with cycloid crank rotor displays better performance and reduced size compared to conventional combustion engines, it is believed that this new patented Swedish engine will compete with conventional engines in lawn movers, chain saws, outboard motors and other engines in similar small-scaled equipment...|$|R

40|$|The current {{socioeconomic}} and climate trends {{imply that the}} sustainability of large industrial systems such as rolling industry must be urgently improved. Present design applications do not take sufficient advantage of big data accumulated in rolling mill repositories. At the same time, the nowadays information processors and analytical theories allow for performing real-time multivariate analysis and extracting important knowledge from industrial records. For this, however, {{there is a need}} to translate raw records into appropriate mathematical forms. The proposed approach to design of rolling process combines statistical analysis of rolling sequences with empirical and theoretical models of plastic flow. Deterministic models allow for creating rolling process that will function at some level of efficiency still below the possible higher level. This is evident due to the fact that the statistical analyses of production data recorded in identical mills show high dispersion. On the contrary to current methods, the proposed approach allows for diagnosing the causes for the existence of this gap, and also suggests how this gap can be decreased. An example of design of the leadeing <b>oval</b> <b>groove</b> for rolling wire rod is presented along with discussion of general mathematical aspects to demonstrate application of extracted statistics for probabilistic optimization of process parameters...|$|R

40|$|Engine pistons {{are one of}} {{the most}} complex {{components}} among all automotive or other industry field components. The engine can be called the heart of a car and the piston may be considered the most important part of an engine. There are lots of research works proposing for engine pistons, new geometries, materials and manufacturing techniques, and this evolution has undergone with a continuous improvement over the last decades and required thorough examination of the smallest details. Notwithstanding all these studies, there is huge number of damaged pistons. Damage mechanisms have different origins and are mainly wear, temperature, and fatigue related. Among the fatigue damages, thermal fatigue and mechanical fatigue, either at room or at high temperature, play a prominent role. This work is concerned only with the analysis of fatigue-damaged pistons. Pistons from diesel engines will be analyzed.

It is then cut with a <b>grooved</b> rolling <b>pin</b> in perpendicular directions, cutting a grid into the dough which prevents it from creating air pockets as it cooks. The grid cut can also aid in thinner rolling of the lefse, as the ridges help preserve structural integrity.

40|$|Abstract-The pinning {{characteristics}} of a domain wail with a step-like thickness change along the wall is investigated in 0. 15 - to O. 5 -p. m-thick films with an in-plane anisotropy using micromag-netic siinulation based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The asymmetric Bloch wall having the structure in which the mag-netostatic coupling develops between spins near the step when the wall is pinned shows the bi-directional pinning effect for magnetic fields applied along the magnetic domain. The wall energy of the pinned wall decreases with increasing step depth due to the largely decrease of the exchange energy component. The depinning field for the negative applied fields which drive {{the wall in the}} direction of the nongrooved region (thick film region) is considerably larger than that for the positive ones which drive the wall in the direc-tion of the grooved region (thin film region).

30|$|Groove filling was {{the first}} method {{proposed}} in the literature to produce a composite by FSP (Mishra et al. 2003). It is simple and requires less machining. A straight groove can be produced on the workpiece using ordinary milling cutter. Recently, Gandra et al. (2011) has studied {{the position of the}} groove with respect to the tool pin and demonstrated that if the groove is placed under the pin, the powder distribution is found to be more compared with placing the <b>groove</b> outside the <b>pin</b> interaction area (advancing or retrieving). Another strategy was proposed by Heydarian et al. (2014) in groove filling method in which parallel grooves with gradient groove depths were produced and FSP was carried out. Compared with single groove, composite produced from the gradient grooves was found to have uniform distribution of the powder. Whereas the groove filling and closing method needs additional tools such as pin-less FSP tool, and also the process involves two cycles; one to close the groove, and the second to produce the composite. The amount of secondary phase that can be introduced into the workpiece is more in groove filling and closing method compared with simple groove filling method because it prevents the escape of filled particles during FSP.|$|R
50|$|Various {{materials}} {{are used in}} the construction of compression driver diaphragms including titanium, aluminium, phenolic impregnated fabric, polyimide and PET film, each having its own characteristics. The diaphragm is glued to a voice coil former, typically made from a different material from the dome, since it must cope with heat without tearing or significant dimensional change. Polyimide film, Nomex, and glassfibre are popular for this application. The suspension may be a continuation of the diaphragm and is glued to a mounting ring, which may fit into a <b>groove,</b> over locating <b>pins,</b> or be fastened with machine screws. The diaphragm is generally shaped like an inverted dome and loads into a series of tapered channels in a central structure called a phase plug, which equalizes the path length between various areas of the diaphragm and the horn throat, preventing acoustic cancellations between different points on the diaphragm surface. The phase plug exits into a tapered tube, which forms the start of the horn itself. This slowly expanding throat within the driver is continued in the horn flare. The horn flare controls the coverage pattern, or directivity, and as an acoustic transformer, adds gain. A professional horn and compression driver combination has an output sensitivity of between 105 and 112 dB/watt/meter. This is substantially more efficient (and less thermally dangerous to a small voice coil and former) than other tweeter construction.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} investigation of low Weber number water drops impacting onto solid surfaces exhibiting anisotropic wetting. The wetting anisotropy {{is created by}} patterning the solid surfaces with unidirectional parallel grooves. Temporal measurements of impacting drop parameters such as drop base contact diameter, apparent contact angle of drop, and drop height at the center are obtained from high-speed video recordings of drop impacts. The study shows {{that the impact of}} low Weber number water drops on the grooved surface exhibits beating phenomenon in the temporal variations of the dynamic contact angle anisotropy and drop height {{at the center of the}} impacting drop. It is observed that the beating phenomenon of impacting drop parameters is caused by the frequency difference between the dynamic contact angle oscillations of impacting drop liquid oriented perpendicular and parallel to the direction of grooves on the grooved surface. The primary trigger for the phenomenon is the existence of non-axisymmetric drop flow on the <b>grooved</b> surface featuring <b>pinned</b> and free motions of drop liquid in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the grooves, respectively. The beat frequency is almost independent of the impact drop Weber number. Further experimental measurements with solid surfaces of different groove textures show that the grooved surface with larger wetting anisotropy may be expected to show a dominant beating phenomenon. The phenomenon is gradually damped out with time and is fully unrecognizable at higher drop impact Weber numbers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
