25|$|Robertson’s {{refusal to}} advise {{a halt to}} Third Ypres cost him the support of Smuts and Milner. By {{the end of the}} year the Cabinet Committee on Manpower were hearing about an {{alarming}} rise in drunkenness, desertions and psychological disorders in the BEF, and reports of soldiers’ returning from the front grumbling about “the waste of life” at Ypres, and even Haig himself writing (15 Dec, whilst arguing against a proposal that the BEF take <b>over</b> <b>line</b> from the French) that many of his divisions were “much exhausted and much reduced in strength”.|$|E

He agreed that the British could take <b>over</b> <b>line</b> up to the coast but only as further reinforcements arrived, which would not be until much later in 1915.|$|E

25|$|The Germans had {{recently}} added 300 battalions to their forces by intensive mobilisation, and Haig claimed (3 March) {{that with the}} BEF spread more thinly by having taken <b>over</b> <b>line</b> to the south, these forces {{might be used to}} attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. Assuming Haig was inventing this threat, Nivelle wrote him a letter, addressing him as a subordinate, and revived the idea of a British staff at GQG, this time reporting to Robertson, but through whom Nivelle would issue orders to Haig. Nivelle now demanded that the BEF be split into two Army Groups or else that Haig be sacked and replaced by Gough. Nivelle also believed that Lloyd George hoped to become Allied Commander-in-Chief, a suggestion so absurd that it caused President Poincaré to laugh.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1999, alleged {{insurgents and}} Pakistani {{soldiers}} from Pakistani Kashmir infiltrated Jammu and Kashmir. During the winter season, Indian forces regularly move down to lower altitudes, as severe climatic conditions makes {{it almost impossible}} for them to guard the high peaks near the Line of Control. This practice is followed by both India and Pakistan Army. The terrain makes it difficult for both sides to maintain a strict border control <b>over</b> <b>Line</b> of Control. The insurgents took advantage of this and occupied vacant mountain peaks in the Kargil range overlooking the highway in Indian Kashmir that connects Srinagar and Leh. By blocking the highway, they could cut off the only link between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh. This resulted in a large-scale conflict between the Indian and Pakistani armies. The final stage involved major battles by Indian and Pakistani forces resulting in India recapturing most of the territories held by Pakistani forces.|$|E
25|$|Robertson {{wrote to}} Haig (28 February) that Lloyd George was “an awful liar” for {{claiming}} that the French had originated the proposal (the Prime Minister had in fact met Major Berthier de Sauvigny (15 February), a French liaison officer in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive and that if necessary he would be replaced), and that he lacked the “honesty & truth” to remain Prime Minister. Haig claimed (3 March) that with the BEF spread more thinly by having recently taken <b>over</b> <b>line</b> to the south, German forces (they had recently added 300 battalions by more intensive mobilisation, and by withdrawing to the Hindenburg Line would later free up an extra 15–20 divisions (135 -180 battalions)) {{might be used to}} attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. The French assumed Haig was inventing this threat (possibly true – in the summer of 1917 Haig’s staff confessed to MacDonogh of playing up such a threat to avoid cooperating with the French).|$|E

500|$|A large {{militia force}} arrived from Salem and Marblehead. [...] They might have cut off Percy's route to Charlestown, but these men halted on nearby Winter Hill {{and allowed the}} British to escape. [...] Some accused the {{commander}} of this force, Colonel Timothy Pickering, of permitting the troops to pass because he still hoped to avoid war by preventing a total defeat of the regulars. [...] Pickering later claimed that he had stopped on Heath's orders, but Heath denied this. [...] It was nearly dark when Pitcairn's Marines defended a final attack on Percy's rear as they entered Charlestown. [...] The regulars took up strong positions on the hills of Charlestown. [...] Some {{of them had been}} without sleep for two days and had marched [...] in 21 hours, eight hours of which had been spent under fire. [...] But now they held high ground protected by heavy guns from HMS Somerset. Gage quickly sent <b>over</b> <b>line</b> companies of two fresh regiments—the 10th and 64th—to occupy the high ground in Charlestown and build fortifications. Although they were begun, the fortifications were never completed and would later be a starting point for the militia works built two months later in June before the Battle of Bunker Hill. General Heath studied the position of the British Army and decided to withdraw the militia to Cambridge.|$|E
2500|$|Germany {{launched}} an attack, [...] "Michael", on 21 March 1918. The German bombardment began at 4.45am; Haig was informed at 8am whilst he was dressing. 76 German divisions (German divisions were somewhat smaller than British), 6,608 guns and 534 heavy mortars hit 26 British divisions (the combined total of Fifth and Third Armies) and 2,686 guns. The Germans enjoyed superiority of 5:1 over the 12 divisions of Gough’s Fifth Army, which were spread thinly <b>over</b> <b>line</b> recently taken {{over from the}} French; on the southern wing the Germans enjoyed an 8:1 numerical superiority, and their attack was helped by fog in the morning.|$|E

2500|$|Germany {{launched}} an attack, [...] "Michael" [...] (21 March 1918), with 76 divisions and 7,000 guns, a force {{larger than the}} entire BEF (German divisions were somewhat smaller than British) and enjoying superiority of 5:1 over the 12 divisions of Hubert Gough's Fifth Army, which were spread thinly <b>over</b> <b>line</b> recently taken over from the French. Haig was initially calm on 21 March, as owing to the communications of the time GHQ was [...] "an information vacuum" [...] where news often took over a day to reach him, and {{spent much of the}} day entertaining foreign dignitaries including the US War Secretary. Third Army retreated as planned from the Flesquieres Salient, freeing up a division. On three-quarters of the 50-mile front attacked, British troops fought hard and the Germans failed to reach their first day objectives. However, lacking reserves Gough had to retreat behind the Crozat Canal. 22 March saw Fifth Army retreat to the Somme; Haig still anticipated further German attacks in Champagne or Arras. The Germans did not initially realise the importance of Amiens as an objective.|$|E
2500|$|Printed {{music is}} often written on several {{different}} staves. [...] For instance, piano music is typically written {{on two different}} staves combined into the grand staff: one for treble clef and one for bass clef, while choral music often has four different staves (one each for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). [...] The notes in different staves that play simultaneously are aligned vertically. Because of the linear nature of braille music {{and the fact that}} the blind musician can typically read only one staff at a time, multiple staves are handled in several ways depending on the complexity of the music and other considerations. Bar over bar format is most similar to print music. [...] Simple piano music in bar over bar format is quite similar to print music, with right-hand notation on the top line and left-hand notation on the bottom line. [...] Some degree of vertical alignment between the right and left hands is maintained. Other ways of dealing with multiple-staff music are line <b>over</b> <b>line</b> format, , paragraph style, and bar by bar format. [...] As a rule these formats take up less space on the page but require more of the musician in working out how to fit the staves together. For instance, in a piano score notated in section by section format, the right-hand part may be written out for the first 8 measures, followed by the left-hand part. [...] No attempt is made to align the parts. The same procedure is followed for measures 9-16, and so on, section by section, throughout the score. The blind musician learns and memorizes one section right hand alone, then left hand alone, then works out the hands together by memory and referencing various spots in the braille score to work out how the sections fit together. A note from the transcriber often clarifies the format used. [...] However, with many older and more complex scores the format must be determined by examination of the music and context.|$|E

40|$|Guidance molecules, such as Sema 3 A or Netrin- 1, can induce {{growth cone}} (GC) {{repulsion}} or attraction {{in the presence}} of a flat surface, but very little is known of the action of guidance molecules {{in the presence of}} obstacles. Therefore we combined chemical and mechanical cues by applying a steady Netrin- 1 stream to the GCs of dissociated hippocampal neurons plated on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces patterned with lines 2 µm wide, with 4 µm period and with a height varying from 100 to 600 nm. GC turning experiments performed 24 hours after plating showed that filopodia crawl <b>over</b> these <b>lines</b> within minutes. These filopodia do not show staining for the adhesion marker Paxillin. GCs and neurites crawl <b>over</b> <b>lines</b> 100 nm high, but less frequently and on a longer time scale <b>over</b> <b>lines</b> higher than 300 nm; neurites never crawl <b>over</b> <b>lines</b> 600 nm high. When neurons are grown for 3 days over patterned surfaces, also neurites can cross lines 300 nm and 600 nm high, grow parallel to and on top of these lines and express Paxillin. Axons - selectively stained with SMI 312 - do not differ from dendrites in their ability to cross these lines. Our results show that highly motile structures such as filopodia climb over high obstacle in response to chemical cues, but larger neuronal structures are less prompt and require hours or days to climb similar obstacles...|$|R
