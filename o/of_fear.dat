They faced The Public Enemy and Harlem Heat but lost when Rocco Rock from The Public Enemy pinned The Barbarian. At Fall Brawl 1997, The Barbarian and Meng faced Wrath and Mortis. Because Wrath and Mortis {{were part of}} a heel group, WCW had the Faces <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> compete as faces during the match. Wrath and Mortis won the match, as Wrath pinned Meng for the victory.

In the episode <b>of</b> Struldbruggs, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death is illustrated through <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> abandonment and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loss. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> abandonment and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loss cause the Struldbruggs to long for physical death to end emotional death. In the episode <b>of</b> Houyhnhnms, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> death is represented by <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> intimacy. <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> intimacy is expressed in Houyhnhnms’ cold attitudes to their friends and their family members...|$|R

5|$|The Faces <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> {{eventually}} split up, as Meng turned face. The former partners {{faced each}} other at Road Wild 1998; The Barbarian had heel manager Jimmy Hart in his corner. Meng won the match, but The Barbarian, Hugh Morrus and Hart attacked him after the match. Hart later convinced The Barbarian and Meng to reconcile, however, and they wrestled as a tag team again as part of Hart's First Family stable. The Faces <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> entered a tournament for the WCW World Tag Team Championship in early 1999 after an injury to co-champion Rick Steiner caused the belts to be vacated. According {{to the rules of}} the tournament, teams had to lose two matches before they were eliminated. The Faces <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> won one match in the tournament, defeating the team of David Taylor and Fit Finlay on the January 25 episode of WCW Monday Nitro. However, they were eliminated after losses to the team of Mike Enos and Bobby Duncum, Jr. and the team of Horace Hogan and Brian Adams. In the latter match, The Barbarian attacked Meng, which caused the loss and led to the team splitting up for good.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To explore Indigenous peoples' {{experience}} of relocation for medical treatment during end-of-life care Methods: The {{data were collected}} from 72 qualitative interviews conducted throughout the regional, rural and remote areas of the Northern Territory, Australia, with Aboriginal patients and carers and the health professionals who cared for them. Results: Relocation for indigenous peoples is a frightening experience. There are a myriad <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> including: the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> leaving home, especially for people who had never been away from their homelands; the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> disempowerment associated with leaving the support <b>of</b> family networks; <b>fears</b> about hospital environments and 'high-tech' treatments; <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> cultural alienation for familiar foods and ways <b>of</b> being; <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> travel; <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> loneliness; <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> language and communication barriers; financial fears; and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> dying away from the homeland. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the strong need for building-up local palliative care services and raise significant questions about the cultural appropriateness of the Western biomedical rationale for relocation during end-of-life care...|$|R

During the Second World War, the building's use by the Ministry of Information inspired two noted English writers. Graham Greene's novel The Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> (1943) and its film adaptation Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> by Fritz Lang (1944) set in Bloomsbury. George Orwell's wife Eileen worked in Senate House for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information, and her experiences inspired the description of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to France, {{he was offered}} a script written by Georges-Jean Arnaud, an expatriate living in South America who had written about his own experiences there. Clouzot found it easy to imagine {{the setting of the}} script and was very anxious to film Arnaud's story. He started writing the film, The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear,</b> with his brother, Jean Clouzot, who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of Jérôme Geronimi. Production on The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> lasted from 1951 to 1952. In order to gain as much independence as possible, Clouzot created his own production company called Véra Films, which he named after his wife. The sole female role in The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> is played by Véra. Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife, as the character does not exist in the original novel. The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying nitroglycerin through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire. The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> was the second most popular film in France in 1953 and was seen by nearly 7million spectators. It won awards for Best Film and Best Actor (for Charles Vanel) at the Cannes Film Festival. Clouzot's next big hit was Diabolique, whose screenplay he took away from director Alfred Hitchcock. Diabolique involves the story of a cruel headmaster who brutalizes his wife and his mistress. The two women murder him and dump his body in a swimming pool, but when the pool is drained, no corpse is found. In 1954, Diabolique won the Louis Delluc Prize and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best foreign film. In this early and mid-1950s period, with the films The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> and Diabolique, Clouzot came to be fully embraced by international critics and audiences. Both films were screened and reviewed in America as well as in France, and were rated among the best thrillers of the decade. In 1955, Clouzot directed the documentary The Mystery of Picasso, about the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. The film follows Picasso drawing or painting 15 different works, all of which were intentionally destroyed following the film's production. Clouzot and Picasso were old acquaintances, having met when Clouzot was 14. The Mystery of Picasso won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, but was a financial failure in France, being seen by only 37,000 filmgoers during its initial run in 1956. In 1984, the film was declared a national treasure by the government of France.|$|E

5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response.
