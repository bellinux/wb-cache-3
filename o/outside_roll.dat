40|$|The Mohawk Canal {{bridge was}} {{constructed}} in August 1994, just <b>outside</b> <b>Roll,</b> Arizona. It is a simple-span, double-lane, stress-laminated deck superstructure, approximately 6. 4 m (21 ft) long and 10. 4 m (34 ft) wide and constructed with Combination 16 F-V 3 Douglas Fir glued-laminated timber beam laminations. The performance of the bridge was moni-tored continuously for 2 years, beginning shortly after instal-lation. Performance monitoring involved gathering and evaluating data relative to the moisture content of the wood deck, the force level of the steel stressing bars, the vertical creep of the deck, and {{the behavior of the}} bridge under static load conditions. Furthermore, comprehensive visual inspec-tions were conducted to assess the overall condition of the structure. Based on field evaluations, the bridge is perform-ing properly with no structural deficiencies...|$|E

40|$|The {{discrete}} vortex {{method for}} gas flow {{and the moment}} method coupled with a unimodal lognormal particle size distribution were used to simulate the nanoparticle coagulation and dispersion in a round jet. The {{results show that the}} interface of the jet region and the <b>outside</b> <b>rolls</b> up to form coherent structures, which alters the particle concentrations and enhances the particle coagulation. The jet region of the particles mixture and the number of different particle sizes increase with increasing of the time, however, the number concentration of particles decreases in the jet region while increasing at its outside. The coherent structures {{play an important role in}} enhancing the particle coagulation and dispersion along the radial direction of jet, and make the particles disperse non-uniformly along the stream direction of jet. As the Schmidt number increases, the jet region of mixture of particles becomes narrower, and polydispersity turns unobvious, however, the particle number concentration grows accordingly. The gradient in particle size and the standard deviation of the particle size distribution increase along the radial direction of jet with increasing of the Damkohler number.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} skidded off {{the runway}} 32 seconds after landing, being almost on {{the axis of}} the runway with an air speed of about 215 km/h.

The plane continued to <b>roll</b> <b>outside</b> the runway slowly braking due to road bumps and snow cover.

50|$|The Chiko Roll was {{developed}} by Frank McEncroe, a boilermaker from Bendigo, Victoria, who turned to catering at football matches and other outdoor events. In 1950, McEncroe saw a competitor selling Chinese chop suey <b>rolls</b> <b>outside</b> the Richmond Cricket Ground and decided to add a similar product to his own line. McEncroe felt that the Chinese rolls were too flimsy to be easily handled in an informal outdoor setting and hit upon {{the idea of a}} much larger and more robust roll that would provide a quick meal that was both reasonably substantial and easily handled. The result was the Chiko Roll, which debuted at the Wagga Wagga Agriculture Show in 1951.|$|R
5|$|It {{was clear}} that the planned {{processing}} flow could not be followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results of}} tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was <b>rolled</b> <b>outside</b> its cleanroom to carry out communications tests.

60|$|There {{was much}} to do to the hut. The absence of {{anything}} but stunted and impoverished timber and the limitation of time, had forbidden a log hut, and their home was really only a double framework, rammed tight between inner and outer frame {{with a mixture of}} earth and boughs and twigs of willow, pine and balsam. The floor was hammered earth carpeted with balsam twigs and a caribou skin. Outside and within wall and roof were faced with coarse canvas--that was Trafford's idea--and their bunks occupied two sides of the hut. Heating was done by the sheet-iron stove they had brought with them, and the smoke was carried out to the roof by a thin sheet-iron pipe which had come up <b>outside</b> a <b>roll</b> of canvas. They had made the roof with about the pitch of a Swiss châlet, and it was covered with nailed waterproof canvas, held down by a large number of big lumps of stone. Much of the canvassing still remained to do when the men went down, and then the Traffords used every scrap of packing-paper and newspaper that had come up with them and was not needed for lining the bunks in covering any crack or join in the canvas wall.|$|R

5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the <b>outside</b> world, elaborate <b>roll</b> calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|R

Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper. If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally.

5000|$|Much of the Urus' {{diet and}} {{medicine}} also {{revolve around the}} same totora reeds used to construct the islands. When a reed is pulled, the white bottom is often eaten for iodine. This prevents goitres. This white part of the reed is called the chullo (Aymara [...] ). The Uru rely on totora reeds {{in the same way}} that the Andean people of Peru rely on the coca leaf for relief from hunger and the harsh climate. When in pain, they may wrap the reed around the body part that is in pain. If it is hot <b>outside,</b> they sometimes <b>roll</b> the white part of the reed in their hands and split it open, placing the reed on their forehead. In this form, it is very cool to the touch.

6000|$|With {{the death}} of the coral insects the foundation-stone of the island is laid, {{in the form of a}} ring just peeping out of the ocean. Thenceforth other creatures {{continue}} the work. The waves lash and beat upon the uppermost coral cells and break them up into fine white sand. Currents of ocean throw upon this beach pieces of sea-weed and drifting marine substances of various kinds. The winds convey the lighter seeds of land plants to it, and sea-birds that alight upon it to rest do the same thing. Thus, little by little, things accumulate on the top of the coral ring until the summit rises above the reach and fury of the waves. No sooner is this accomplished than the genial sun of those regions calls the seeds into life. A few blades of green shoot up. These are the little tokens of life that give promise of the luxuriance yet to come. Soon the island ring is clothed with rich and beautiful vegetation, cocoa-nut palms begin to sprout and sea-fowl to find shelter where, in former days, the waves of the salt sea alone were to be found. In process of time the roving South-Sea islanders discover this little gem of ocean, and take up their abode on it; and when such a man as Cook sails past it, he sees, perchance, the naked savage on the beach gazing in wonder at his [...] "big canoe," [...] and the little children swimming like ducks in the calm waters of the lagoon or gambolling like porpoises among the huge breakers <b>outside</b> that <b>roll</b> like driven snow upon the strand.|$|R
