40|$|Many {{valuation}} {{models in}} financial economics are developed using <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel approach {{to adjust for}} risk through the equivalent martingale representation. Often it is assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel exhibits constant elasticity with respect to <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market portfolio. In a representative agent economy this would be close to assuming that the representative agent has constant proportional risk aversion. <b>The</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel has also implications for <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> options. This paper shows, first, that given <b>the</b> forward <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market portfolio, all European options would have higher <b>prices</b> if <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel was declining instead of constant. Moreover, a volatility smile-effect is generated. Second, the paper shows that the standard geometric Brownian motion underlying the Black/Scholes model requires constant elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel. Third, if <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market portfolio at <b>the</b> expiration date <b>of</b> an option is lognormally distributed, then declining elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel implies a stochastic process which is characterized by higher volatility and negative autocorrelation.

40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} determinant <b>of</b> option <b>prices</b> is <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel used {{to price}} all {{claims in the}} economy. In this paper, we first show that for a given forward <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying asset, option prices are higher when <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel is declining than when it is constant. We then investigate <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel for <b>the</b> stochastic process followed by the underlying asset. Given that the underlying information process follows a geometric Brownian motion, we demonstrate that constant elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> kernel is equivalent to a Brownian motion for <b>the</b> forward <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying asset, so that the Black–Scholes formula correctly <b>prices</b> options on <b>the</b> asset. In contrast, declining elasticity implies that <b>the</b> forward <b>price</b> process {{is no longer a}} Brownian motion: it has higher volatility and exhibits autocorrelation. In this case, the Black–Scholes formula underprices all options. 1...|$|R

5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative bubble burst. Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth a fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> they had paid.

5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Price</b> Is Right which began airing in 1972. The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E
