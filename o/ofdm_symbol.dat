25|$|The {{effects of}} frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by {{multipath}} propagation, {{can be considered}} as constant (flat) over an OFDM sub-channel if the sub-channel is sufficiently narrow-banded (i.e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain equalization used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer only has to multiply each detected sub-carrier (each Fourier coefficient) in each <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbol</b> by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value.|$|E

30|$|In the following, {{we assume}} that the channel remains {{constant}} for the duration of NB <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols.</b> Hence, for this block of <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols</b> the calculation of the precoding matrices has to be performed only once, whereas the computation of the precoded signal, the FFT, and the selection metric have to be accomplished for each of the NB <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols.</b>|$|R

The OFDM guard interval for TM I is 246 microseconds, {{which means that the}} overall <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbol</b> duration is 1.246 milliseconds.

2500|$|Our example: The OFDM {{equalization}} in {{the above}} numerical example would require one complex valued multiplication per subcarrier and symbol (i.e., [...] complex multiplications per OFDM symbol; i.e., one million multiplications per second, at the receiver). The FFT algorithm requires [...] complex-valued multiplications per <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbol</b> (i.e., 10 million multiplications per second), at both the receiver and transmitter side. This should {{be compared with the}} corresponding one million symbols/second single-carrier modulation case mentioned in the example, where the equalization of 125 microseconds time-spreading using a FIR filter would require, in a naive implementation, 125 multiplications per symbol (i.e., 125 million multiplications per second). FFT techniques can be used {{to reduce the number of}} multiplications for an FIR filter based time-domain equalizer to a number comparable with OFDM, at the cost of delay between reception and decoding which also becomes comparable with OFDM.|$|E

Note that the conventional Gaussian assumption cannot be used for the data recovery of distorted <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols.</b> The article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we derive the PD of M-QAM modulated <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols.</b> Using our derivation of PD, we consider the data reconstruction (DRC) method {{in the presence of a}} soft limiter in Section 3.

However, for faster fading channels, multiple <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols</b> work only better at low-to-moderate SNR, but suffer from a noise floor at high SNR, where the BEM modeling error plays a dominant role. The BEM modeling error will become larger if more <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols</b> are considered and/or the channel varies faster. Increasing the BEM order Q can enhance the BEM modeling performance at the penalty that more channel unknowns need to be estimated. An alternative is not to estimate the channel of all the <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols,</b> but only the middle part, e.g., the 3 rd and 4 th symbols. This means that the channel estimator will work like an overlapping sliding window, an approach that is adopted in [25].|$|R

Moreover, the superposed band and the power of each interference is constant in each packet. Although the main purpose of inserting pilot <b>OFDM</b> <b>symbols</b> is to estimate channel coefficients, in addition to channel estimation, we exploit them to estimate noise and interference power based on the technique proposed in [18].|$|R

50|$|In digital {{terrestrial}} television (DVB-T, DVB-H and similar techniques) OFDM modulation is used; i.e., multi-carrier modulation.
