25|$|As {{explained}} above, {{the primary}} cause of ozone depletion is the presence of chlorine-containing source gases (primarily CFCs and related halocarbons).

The objective of the project was to map the vertical distributions of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which are believed {{to play an important role}} in the <b>destruction</b> of <b>ozone</b> in the Antarctic spring. Altitude, thickness, homogeneity, and duration of PSC events as well as information on particle shape, size or number density will be very useful in determining the exact role of PSCs in <b>ozone</b> <b>destructions,</b> and when combined with measurements of other investigators, additional properties of PSCs can be estimated.

25|$|These polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) form during winter, in {{the extreme}} cold. Polar winters are dark, {{consisting}} of 3 months without solar radiation (sunlight). The lack of sunlight contributes to a decrease in temperature and the polar vortex traps and chills air. Temperatures hover around or below −80°C. These low temperatures form cloud particles. There are three types of PSC clouds—nitric acid trihydrate clouds, slowly cooling water-ice clouds, and rapid cooling water-ice (nacerous) clouds—provide surfaces for chemical reactions whose products will, in the spring lead to <b>ozone</b> <b>destruction.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{eruption}} had {{a significant}} effect on ozone levels in the atmosphere, causing a large increase in the destruction rate of ozone. Ozone levels at middle latitudes reached their lowest recorded levels, while in the southern hemisphere winter of 1992, the ozone hole over Antarctica reached its largest ever size until then, with the fastest recorded ozone depletion rates. The eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile in August 1991 also contributed to southern hemisphere <b>ozone</b> <b>destruction,</b> with measurements showing a sharp decrease in ozone levels at the tropopause when the aerosol clouds from Pinatubo and Hudson arrived.|$|E
2500|$|The {{long term}} {{modeling}} of the process, its measurement, study, design of theories and testing take decades to document, gain wide acceptance, and ultimately {{become the dominant}} paradigm. Several theories about the destruction of ozone were hypothesized in the 1980s, published in the late 1990s, and are currently being investigated. Dr Drew Schindell, and Dr Paul Newman, NASA Goddard, proposed a theory in the late 1990s, using computational modeling methods to model <b>ozone</b> <b>destruction,</b> that accounted for 78 percent of the ozone destroyed. Further refinement of that model accounted for 89 percent of the ozone destroyed, but pushed back the estimated recovery of the ozone hole from 75 years to 150 years.

2500|$|In 1982 Australian {{physicist}} Brian Martin, {{who frequently}} corresponded with John Hampson, penned a short historical synopsis {{on the history}} of interest in the effects of the direct NOx generated by nuclear fireballs, and in doing so, also outlined Hampson's other non-mainstream viewpoints, particularly those relating to greater <b>ozone</b> <b>destruction</b> from upper-atmospheric detonations as a result of any widely used anti-ballistic missile (ABM-1 Galosh) system. However, Martin ultimately concludes that it is [...] "unlikely that {{in the context of a}} major nuclear war" [...] ozone degradation would be of serious concern. Martin describes views about potential ozone loss and therefore increases in Ultraviolet light leading to the widespread destruction of crops, as advocated by journalist Jonathan Schell in his popular 1982 book The Fate of the Earth, as highly unlikely.|$|E
2500|$|However, a {{paper in}} 1973 in the journal Nature depicts the stratospheric ozone levels {{worldwide}} overlaid upon the number of nuclear detonations during the era of atmospheric testing. The authors conclude that neither the data nor their models show any correlation between the approximate 500 Mt in historical atmospheric testing and an increase or decrease of ozone concentration. In 1976 {{a study on the}} experimental measurements of an earlier atmospheric nuclear test as it affected the ozone layer also found that nuclear detonations are exonerated of depleting ozone, after the at first alarming model calculations of the time. Similarly, a 1981 paper found that the models on <b>ozone</b> <b>destruction</b> from one test and the physical measurements taken were in disagreement, as no destruction was observed. In total about 500 Mt were atmospherically detonated between 1945 and 1971, peaking in 1961–62, when 340 Mt were detonated in the atmosphere by the United States and Soviet Union. During this peak, counting only the multi-megaton range detonations in the two nations nuclear test series, a total yield estimated at 300 Mt of energy was released. Due to this, 3 × 1034 additional molecules of nitric oxide (about 5000 tons per Mt, [...] "5 x 10^9 g per megaton") are believed to have entered the stratosphere, and while ozone depletion of 2.2 percent was noted in 1963, the decline had started prior to 1961 and {{is believed to have been}} caused by other meteorological effects. The 1985 book The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange states that: [...] "one can not draw definite conclusions about the effects of nuclear explosions on stratospheric ozone".|$|E

40|$|A three-year {{integration}} {{of a global}} three-dimensional model including dynamics and simple photochemistry is used to predict ozone. Good agreement with observation is obtained for stratospheric motion patterns, meridional circulations, ozone density {{as a function of}} height and latitude, eddy transports of <b>ozone,</b> surface <b>destruction</b> of <b>ozone,</b> and correlations of ozone with other variables. The annual cycle of columnar ozone in high latitudes is present, but at a smaller amplitude than observed. Vertical transport of ozone downward from the main generation level at 30 km is accomplished primarily by small-scale eddy diffusion between 20 and 30 km and again near the ground; large-scale vertical transport dominates in between. The model predicts a secondary maximum in ozone mixing ratio at 45 km somewhat equatorward of the winter polar-night zone. This feature, recently observed from satellite measurements, is thought to be caused by the temperature dependence of reaction rates in the Chapman scheme. The principal deficiency of the model is an underprediction of the spring ozone concentration in high latitudes in the lower stratosphere...|$|R
5000|$|The {{chemistry}} of the Antarctic polar vortex has created severe ozone depletion. The nitric acid in polar stratospheric clouds reacts with chlorofluorocarbons to form chlorine, which catalyzes the photochemical destruction of ozone. Chlorine concentrations build {{up during the}} polar winter, and the consequent <b>ozone</b> <b>destruction</b> is greatest when the sunlight returns in spring. These clouds can only form at temperatures below about -80 C. Since there is greater air exchange between the Arctic and the mid-latitudes, ozone depletion at the north pole is much less severe than at the south. Accordingly, the seasonal reduction of ozone levels over the Arctic is usually characterized as an [...] "ozone dent", whereas the more severe ozone depletion over the Antarctic is considered an [...] "ozone hole".

An accurate identification of burnt areas is therefore of paramount importance and we present a new vegetation index with optimal properties for burnt area discrimination. We begin by demonstrating the advantages of using the reflective part of the middle infrared (MIR) signal for burnt area detection. This is achieved by evaluating the performance of MODIS visible (bands 1 to 7) and MIR (band 20) channels in burnt area detection. Performance of channel 20 data is both evaluated using surface full normalized radiances (i. e. the sum of emitted and reflected components of the signal) and restricting to the reflected component.

40|$|All of us {{that are}} {{concerned}} about the environment should ask if the increase in capital mobility associated with the world-wide process of liberalization, deregulation and privatization known as the Neo-liberal global regime has contributed to the problems of higher emissions, <b>ozone</b> layer <b>destruction,</b> and pollution of water sources, as well as to create false economic bubbles that lead to increase consumption in these regions and force the poor to destroy the environment in order to survive and cope with the roles their society demands.

The forces of global Neo-liberalism are now so powerful that it has become difficult if not impossible for countries like Colombia to maintain non-Neo-liberal economic structures, in which countries are forced to deregulate FDI policies and receive inflows of capital no matter the terms and the objectives as long as it helps to maintain consumption levels...|$|R
