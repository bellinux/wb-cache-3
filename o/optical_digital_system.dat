40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between masticatory performance and maximum bite force in the primary dentition. The sample comprised 15 children of both genders, aged 3 to 5. 5 years, with good systemic and oral health, presence of all primary teeth without large caries, no structural anomalies, without severe malocclusion, and no history of orthodontic treatment. They chewed one standardized silicone tablet for 20 strokes and the median areas of the chewed particles were measured by an <b>optical</b> <b>digital</b> <b>system.</b> Enhanced performance was measured by a decrease in the chewed particle areas and an increase in the amount of chewed particles. The bite force was determined using a transmitter pressurized tube connected to an analog/digital electronic circuit. Weight, height and body mass index (kg/m²) were determined. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and Pearson or Spearman's correlations, after assessment of the normality of the distribution by Shapiro-Wilks' W-test. There was no correlation between bite force and particle area and amount (p > 0. 05), neither were the body variables correlated with the masticatory variables (p > 0. 05). It was concluded that the bite force was not a primary determinant of masticatory performance, and both variables were not dependent on body variables in the studied sample...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of traditional optical-only imaging systems can be eliminated with jointly optimized <b>optical</b> and <b>digital</b> imaging <b>systems.</b> Jointly optimized <b>optical</b> and <b>digital</b> imaging <b>systems</b> exploit the complementary aspects of optics and digital signal processing to form systems with characteristics not possible with traditional optics-only systems. For example, in traditional imaging systems light gathering and large depth of field are competing goals and are inversely related. On the other hand, in optimized optical/digital imaging systems light gathering and large depth of field can be independent parameters. Instead of requiring a small aperture to produce a large depth of field, a large aperture and a large depth of field are both possible and practical.

40|$|Introduction We {{consider}} an optical computing architecture called pure optical parallel array logic system (P-OPALS), {{for which we}} propose logical foundation of the P-OPALS called single-input optical array logic (S-OAL). On the P-OPALS, high density images can be processed in parallel using the optical system with high resolving power. Based on the proposed architecture, an experimental system of the P-OPALS is constructed by using three optical techniques: birefringent encoding, selectable discrete correlator, and birefringent decoding. To show processing capability of the P-OPALS, some basic parallel operations are attempted. The results obtained indicate that image consisting of 300 Θ 100 pixels can be processed in parallel on the experimental P-OPALS. 2.

40|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>digital</b> {{communication}} <b>system</b> {{requires that}} an accurate clock signal {{be available at}} the receiver for proper synchronization with the transmitted signal. Phase synchronization is especially critical in M-ary pulse position modulation (PPM) systems where the optimum decision scheme is an energy detector which compares the energy in each of M time slots to decide which of M possible words was sent. Timing errors cause energy spillover into adjacent time slots (a form of intersymbol interference) so that {{only a portion of}} the signal energy may be attributed to the correct time slot. This effect decreases the effective signal, increases the effective noise, and increases the probability of error. A timing subsystem for a satellite-to-satellite optical PPM communication link is simulated. The receiver employs direct photodetection, preprocessing of the detected signal, and a phase-locked loop for timing synchronization. The variance of the relative phase error is examined under varying signal strength conditions as an indication of loop performance, and simulation results are compared to theoretical calculations...|$|R
