5|$|One {{surprising}} {{prediction of}} the permutation by duplication mechanism is that intermediate permutations can <b>occur.</b> <b>For</b> instance, the duplicated {{version of the}} protein should still be functional, since otherwise evolution would quickly select against such proteins.

5|$|A slow-rotating {{white dwarf}} star can not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can <b>occur,</b> <b>for</b> example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E

However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that approximate the real situation {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. These models predict whether symptomatic bubble formation is likely to <b>occur</b> <b>for</b> a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play {{that members of the}} opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that <b>occur</b> <b>for</b> retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{show that}} when {{termites}} encounter {{each other in}} foraging areas, some of the termites deliberately block passages to prevent other termites from entering. Dead termites from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to {{the isolation of the}} area and thus the need to construct new tunnels. Conflict between two competitors does not always <b>occur.</b> <b>For</b> example, though they might block each other's passages, colonies of Macrotermes bellicosus and Macrotermes subhyalinus are not always aggressive towards each other. Suicide cramming is known in Coptotermes formosanus. Since C.formosanus colonies may get into physical conflict, some termites squeeze tightly into foraging tunnels and die, successfully blocking the tunnel and ending all agonistic activities.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may <b>occur</b> <b>for</b> severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|The {{radiation}} zone is {{the region of}} the stellar interior where the flux of energy outward is dependent on radiative heat transfer, since convective heat transfer is inefficient in that zone. In this region the plasma will not be perturbed, and any mass motions will die out. If this is not the case, however, then the plasma becomes unstable and convection will occur, forming a convection zone. This can <b>occur,</b> <b>for</b> example, in regions where very high energy fluxes occur, such as near the core or in areas with high opacity (making radiatative heat transfer inefficient) as in the outer envelope.|$|E

5|$|The small {{fields in}} the western part of the area are {{particularly}} characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Fields of this category are generally small in size, regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve the outlines of the earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do <b>occur.</b> <b>For</b> example, there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around Nempnett Thrubwell, south of Bishop Sutton and west and south of Chelwood.|$|E
5|$|These factors make eastern Pacific landfalls {{improbable}} {{north of}} about central Baja California. In those instances when upper level steering winds do allow a more northerly path, much cooler sea surface temperatures quickly weaken tropical cyclones that approach California, although torrential rainfall can still <b>occur.</b> <b>For</b> example, the September 24-hour rainfall record for Los Angeles {{is held by}} the 1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm, as of January 2007.|$|E
5|$|When {{subjected}} to external forces, like electrical fields, {{the shape of}} an atom may deviate from spherical symmetry. The deformation depends on the field magnitude and the orbital type of outer shell electrons, as shown by group-theoretical considerations. Aspherical deviations might be elicited for instance in crystals, where large crystal-electrical fields may occur at low-symmetry lattice sites. Significant ellipsoidal deformations have been shown to <b>occur</b> <b>for</b> sulfur ions and chalcogen ions in pyrite-type compounds.|$|E

5|$|Whether {{the drug}} {{has a unique}} effect on dental health has been {{questioned}} by a few academics, who note that the long-term use of several other drugs sometimes causes dental problems. Several academic reviews have contradicted this perspective, affirming meth mouth's status as a discrete condition. In favor of its unique status, these reviews cite the differences between methamphetamine-caused caries and those that <b>occur</b> <b>for</b> other reasons, such as cocaine use, {{as well as the}} scope of the tooth decay found in some long-term methamphetamine users.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions <b>occur</b> <b>for</b> weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may <b>occur</b> <b>for</b> a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
