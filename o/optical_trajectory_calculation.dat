The rising sand and dust is then transported {{to other places}} depending on the wind conditions (speed and direction) {{at different levels of}} the atmosphere. Considering dust as a moving object in space and time, <b>trajectory</b> <b>calculation</b> then can be used to determine the path it will follow. <b>Trajectory</b> <b>calculation</b> is used as a forecast supporting tool for both operational and research activities. Predefined dust sources can be identified and the trajectories can be precalculated from the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast. In case of long distance transported dust, the tool should allow the operational forecaster to perform online <b>trajectory</b> <b>calculation.</b> This paper presents a case study for using <b>trajectory</b> <b>calculation</b> based on NWP models as a forecast supporting tool in Oman Meteorological Service during some dust storm events.

40|$|We use {{kinematic}} and diabatic back <b>trajectory</b> <b>calculations,</b> {{driven by}} winds from a general circulation model (GCM) and two different data assimilation systems (DAS), {{to compute the}} age spectrum at three latitudes in the lower stratosphere. The age-spectra are compared to chemical transport model (CTM) calculations, and the mean ages from all of these studies are compared to observations. The age spectra computed using the GCM winds show a reasonably isolated tropics in good agreement with observations; however, the age spectra determined from the DAS differ from the GCM spectra. For the DAS diabatic <b>trajectory</b> <b>calculations</b> {{there is too much}} exchange between the tropics and mid-latitudes. The age spectrum is thus too broad and the tropical mean age is too old as a result of mixing older mid latitude air with tropical air. Likewise the mid latitude mean age is too young due to the in mixing of tropical air. The DAS kinematic <b>trajectory</b> <b>calculations</b> show excessive vertical dispersion of parcels in addition to excessive exchange between the tropics and mid latitudes. Because air is moved rapidly to the troposphere from the vertical dispersion, the age spectrum is shifted toward the young side. The excessive vertical and meridional dispersion compensate in the kinematic case giving a reasonable tropical mean age. The CTM calculation of the age spectrum using the DAS winds shows the same vertical and meridional dispersive characteristics of the kinematic <b>trajectory</b> <b>calculation.</b> These results suggest that the current DAS products will not give realistic trace gas distributions for long integrations; they also help explain why the extra tropical mean ages determined in a number of previous DAS driven CTM s are too young compared with observations. Finally, we note trajectory-generated age spectra. show significant age anomalies correlated with the seasonal cycles. These anomalies can be linked to year-to-year variations in the tropical heating rate. The anomalies are suppressed in the CTM spectra suggesting that the CTM transport scheme is too diffusive...|$|R
