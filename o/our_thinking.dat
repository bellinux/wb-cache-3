Philosophy of language {{has to do with}} the study of how our language engages and interacts with <b>our</b> <b>thinking.</b> Logic has an immediate impact on other areas of study. Studying logic and the relationship between logic and ordinary speech can help a person better structure his own arguments and critique the arguments of others. Many popular arguments are filled with errors because so many people are untrained in logic and unaware of how to formulate an argument correctly.|$|E

Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be {{the primary focus of}} <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.|$|E

This allowed for the network to run its new comedy, Outsourced, in two-hour comedy schedule block rather than Parks and Recreation. The schedule change meant that all sixteen episodes from the third season would be filmed before any of them were shown; the rest of the episodes, starting with the seventh, were filmed in the fall of 2010. [...] NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no negative effect on the show, but could actually build anticipation for its return. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the schedule changes were frustrating, but said: [...] "It sounds a little corny, maybe even a little community theater-ish, but when we got the bad news <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> was to just put our heads down and keep making the best show we could." [...] Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice."

Although the artist as a shaman has been a trend in modern art (Picasso, Gauguin), Beuys is unusual in that respect as he integrated “his art and his life into the shaman role.” Beuys believed that humanity, with its turn on rationality, was trying to eliminate “emotions” and thus eliminate {{a major source of}} energy and creativity in every individual. In his first lecture tour in America he was telling the audience that humanity was in an evolving state and that as “spiritual” beings we ought to draw on both our emotions and <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> as they represent the total energy and creativity for every individual. Beuys described how we must seek out and energize our spirituality and link it to <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> powers so that “our vision of the world must be extended to encompass all the invisible energies with which we have lost contact.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010 Mullen {{introduced}} {{the first ever}} Private Members' Motion in the Oireachtas dedicated {{to the issue of}} hospice care. The motion focused primarily on facilitating personal choice on dying at home and also on making end-of-life care a core hospital competence. The motion was based on the Irish Hospice Foundation's Audit of End of Life Care. The audit documented that over half the 1000 patients profiled died in multi-bed rooms, only 20-30% of persons received specialist palliative care, and that as many as 25% may have died alone. Speaking to the motion Mullen claimed that [...] "implicit sometimes in <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> on this issue is the view that policy focus should centre on those with the majority of their lives ahead of them; that dying is a taboo subject better skirted around for the sake of avoiding awkwardness and offence; and that as people gradually lose memory, consciousness, bodily control and even hope, they also lose their dignity".|$|E

2500|$|A {{student at}} the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Philosophy between 1951 and 1955, Ornea was, {{according}} to his colleague and future philosopher Cornel Popa, {{one of those who}} would not accept the strict interpretation of human endeavor as fostered by official Marxism-Leninism, seeking to inform himself on classical subjects directly from the sources. Popa stated that Ornea, himself and others (future academics Mircea Flonta, Ilie Pârvu, Vasile Tonoiu etc.) were in search of [...] "fresh air" [...] and [...] "could not bear to have <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> entrapped." [...] Ornea was at the time close to University professor Tudor Vianu, who, as he recalled, became one of his mentors. For the following thirty years, he adopted a Marxist perspective, but one largely differing from the official line, before altogether parting with the ideology. After graduation, Ornea began his career with Editura de stat pentru literatură și artă (ESPLA), a state-run publishing house based in Bucharest. During the same period, he married Ada Ornea, who gave birth to their son Liviu.|$|E

[...] Speaking of his earlier problems with video memory, Faulkner said [...] "the video memory situation has improved dramatically since last time. The problem {{was that there was}} too little video memory to fit all our textures, and the machine can't use a texture unless it's specifically in video memory. What we've found since then is that the PS2 has enough bus bandwidth to transfer each texture from main memory to video memory as it's needed. That's on the order of hundreds of MB per second. We hadn't anticipated that the PS2 had that kind of brute horsepower on its bus. We had to reorient <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> after that.

2500|$|The {{field of}} machine ethics is {{concerned}} with giving machines ethical principles, or a procedure for discovering a way to resolve the ethical dilemmas they might encounter, enabling them to function in an ethically responsible manner through their own ethical decision making. The field was delineated in the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics: [...] "Past research concerning the relationship between technology and ethics has largely focused on responsible and irresponsible use of technology by human beings, with a few people being interested in how human beings ought to treat machines. In all cases, only human beings have engaged in ethical reasoning. The {{time has come for}} adding an ethical dimension to at least some machines. Recognition of the ethical ramifications of behavior involving machines, as well as recent and potential developments in machine autonomy, necessitate this. In contrast to computer hacking, software property issues, privacy issues and other topics normally ascribed to computer ethics, machine ethics {{is concerned with}} the behavior of machines towards human users and other machines. Research in machine ethics is key to alleviating concerns with autonomous systems—it could be argued that the notion of autonomous machines without such a dimension {{is at the root of}} all fear concerning machine intelligence. Further, investigation of machine ethics could enable the discovery of problems with current ethical theories, advancing <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> about Ethics." [...] Machine ethics is sometimes referred to as machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality. A variety of perspectives of this nascent field can be found in the collected edition [...] "Machine Ethics" [...] that stems from the AAAI Fall 2005 Symposium on Machine Ethics.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first and}} best known book, Being and Time (1927), though unfinished, {{is one of}} the central {{philosophical}} works of the 20th century. In the first division of the work, Heidegger attempted to turn away from [...] "ontic" [...] questions about beings to ontological questions about Being, and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called Dasein ("being-there"). Heidegger argued that Dasein is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of Being-in-the-world, in opposition to Rationalist thinkers like René Descartes who located the essence of man in <b>our</b> <b>thinking</b> abilities. For Heidegger thinking is thinking about things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second division, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its Temporality, or its concern with, and relationship to time, existing as a structurally open [...] "possibility-for-being." [...] He emphasized the importance of Authenticity in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our thrownness into a world which we are [...] "always already" [...] concerned with, and to our Being-towards-death, the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.|$|E
