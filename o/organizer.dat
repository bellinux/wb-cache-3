40|$|Graphic <b>organizers</b> are {{instruments}} of representation, illustration and modeling of information.

Graphic <b>organizers</b> are instruments that addressed mostly visual learning style, but their use is beneficial to all learners.

In this research, the authors explored advance <b>organizers</b> from a business perspective, where larger documents are read under time pressure. Graphic and verbal advance <b>organizers</b> were manipulated into six versions of an advisory report, read by 159 experienced professional readers in a between-subjects design. Their reading time was limited to encourage selective reading. The results show that graphic advance <b>organizers</b> facilitate selective reading, {{but they do not}} enhance recall. Verbal advance <b>organizers</b> introducing a problem enhance recall, and graphic advance <b>organizers</b> moderate the effects on both selective reading and recall. © 2008 Sage Publications...|$|R

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if the use of graphic <b>organizers</b> affected the reading comprehension of college business students. Answers to the following three research questions were sought: (a) Do the reading comprehension levels of students using teacher-developed graphic <b>organizers</b> differ from the reading comprehension levels of students who do not use graphic <b>organizers</b> as a postreading activity? (b) Do the reading comprehension levels of students using student-developed graphic <b>organizers</b> differ from the reading comprehension levels of students who do not use graphic <b>organizers</b> as a postreading activity? and (c) Do the reading comprehension levels of students using teacher-developed graphic <b>organizers</b> differ from the reading comprehension levels of students who use student-developed graphic <b>organizers</b> as a postreading activity?Subjects were drawn from five sections of an undergraduate orientation course designed to assist first-year business students in their adjustment to college life and exploration of career options. Participants were assigned to a control experimental group within each section. Two intact classes received teacher-developed graphic <b>organizers,</b> two classes used student-developed graphic <b>organizers,</b> and one class received instruction without graphic <b>organizers.</b> The result of the Kruskall-Wallis Analyses of Variance revealed that the use of graphic <b>organizers</b> did not improve the reading comprehension level of college business students as measured by the Nelson-Denny Reading Test...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design a guide and {{curriculum}} to assist educators in effectively using Graphic <b>Organizers</b> during systematic instruction of vocabulary, comprehension and mathematics. Graphic <b>Organizers</b> are visual learning tools, the use of which can benefit student learning, memory and retention. This project describes how one education specialist discovered her students??? need for additional support during instruction of various subjects. The additional support provided, consisted of modified instruction, using Graphic <b>Organizers.</b> Pre-test and post-test results were gathered after six weeks of implementing the use of Graphic <b>Organizers.</b> The data was collected from sixth grade students with learning disabilities, before and after using Graphic <b>Organizers</b> in instruction. Analysis of {{the results from the}} post assessment indicated that both comprehension and retention improved after introducing the use of Graphic <b>Organizers.</b> The results of this study reinforced previous studies suggesting that when students are provided with Graphic <b>Organizers</b> during instruction, student test scores improved in the areas of vocabulary, comprehension and mathematical calculations/applications.

The relationship between most local <b>organizers</b> and the 100TPC headquarters remains informal, conducted primarily through e-mail. <b>Organizers</b> do not become officers or employees of 100TPC. <b>Organizers</b> can {{communicate with each other}} through the 100 TPC Organization & Communication Hub, a Facebook group available to 100TPC event <b>organizers,</b> where they are encouraged, but not required, to work together and to learn about each other's events to help develop event ideas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how graphic <b>organizers</b> can be used to further learning in science class. Graphic <b>organizers</b> facilitate learning in content areas by providing clear visualizations of ideas and facilitating student reflection. Research was conducted in a sixth grade science class with 25 students during a weather unit, and it was found that in using graphic <b>organizers</b> in science class, students were successful in using the open-endedness of graphic <b>organizers</b> to gain a more thorough understanding of concepts. In utilizing literacy strategies like graphic <b>organizers</b> in the content areas, student learning and independence is increased and they are more prepared to practice these skills independently throughout life...|$|R
50|$|Thirdly, {{critics also}} address {{the notion of}} advance <b>organizers</b> on whether they are {{intended}} to favour high ability or low ability students. However, Ausubel notes that “advance <b>organizers</b> are designed to favour meaningful learning..” (Ausubel, 1978, p. 255). Therefore, to question whether advance <b>organizers</b> are better suited for high or low ability students is unrelated as Ausubel argues that advance <b>organizers</b> can be catered to any student to aid them in bridging a gap between what they already know and what they are about to learn.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of graphic <b>organizers</b> on the comprehension of a health education brochure text and compared subjective with objective comprehension measures. Graphic <b>organizers</b> are graphical depictions of relations among concepts in a text. Participants read a brochure text about asthma with and without these <b>organizers,</b> and subjective and objective text comprehension was measured. It was found that graphic <b>organizers</b> had effects on four levels of objective comprehension as indicated by open comprehension questions. However, on the subjective comprehension measure using Likert-type scales, the groups with and without graphic <b>organizers</b> {{did not differ from}} each other. It is concluded that health education texts could benefit from relatively simple techniques to increase comprehension. Furthermore, in developing health education materials, comprehension should be measured objectively...|$|R
