[...] Mizar primarily used a short baseline (SBL) system to track the bathyscaphe Trieste 1. [...] However, its capability also included seafloor transponders, which in conjunction with early navigation satellites supported station-keeping with a precision of about 300 feet, considered remarkable at the time.|$|E

50|$|Starting In 1948, Evergreen {{served as}} part of the International Ice Patrol, in {{addition}} to her duties as a buoy tender. In 1956, Evergreen served as the commanding vessel in the rescue of survivors from the Andrea Doria sinking. In 1964, Evergreen was converted to an <b>oceanographic</b> <b>vessel</b> and re-designated WAGO-295. During the conversion, a computer was installed, and Evergreen became the first government oceanographic ship to have one. As an <b>oceanographic</b> <b>vessel,</b> she was also converted from a black hull paint scheme to a white hull paint scheme, which the vessel wore until it was decommissioned. In 1968 Evergreen suffered a major fire in her engine room while tied to the pier. The fire was extinguished and the vessel was repaired. In 1972, Evergreen underwent extensive modification, including the addition of a bow thruster, and changes to her superstructure. In 1982, when the Coast Guards oceanographic research program ended, the vessel was converted to a Medium Endurance Cutter, and re-designated WMEC-295.|$|E
