Mr. Garrison refers disparagingly to the 1997 science fiction drama film Contact.

5|$|Johnson's {{force was}} {{originally}} intended to join General William Hull at Detroit, but Hull surrendered Detroit on August 16 and his army was captured. Johnson reported to William Henry Harrison, Territorial Governor of Indiana, then {{in command of the}} entire Northwest frontier. He was ordered to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, which was already being attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson's men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush. They returned to Kentucky and disbanded, going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> burn Potawatomi villages along the Elkhart River.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series {{have said that the}} magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, both of whom are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E

25|$|Conflicts {{have arisen}} in the United States on federally-designated beaches, which are {{nevertheless}} patrolled by local police, {{since there is}} no federal law against nudity in these areas, but there may well be local ones.

25|$|For reasons unknown, {{mountain}} gorillas {{that have}} been studied appear to be naturally afraid of certain reptiles. Infants, whose natural behavior is to chase anything that moves, will go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid chameleons and caterpillars. They are also afraid of water and will cross streams only {{if they can do}} so without getting wet, such as by crossing over fallen logs. Dian Fossey observed and noted the mountain gorilla's obvious dislike of rain, as well.|$|E
25|$|The Shiba is a {{relatively}} fastidious breed and feels {{the need to maintain}} itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much like a cat. They generally go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housebreak and in many cases will housebreak themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route32A (NY32A) is a {{state highway}} in the Hudson Valley region of New York in the United States. It serves as a {{connector}} between NY32 {{in the town of}} Saugerties and NY23A in the town of Catskill. The road allows traffic from the Saugerties area, particularly from the New York State Thruway, to directly reach the interior of the Greene County portion of Catskill Park. The majority of traffic is tourism-oriented, from hikers in summer to skiers bound for Hunter Mountain in winter. If NY32A did not exist, drivers would have to go several miles <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the intersection of NY32 and NY23A.|$|E

Local cricket authorities went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> cater for the needs of the team and the sponsors. They provided grounds and sponsors booths without charge and let the sponsors keep the gate takings. The sponsors however, were not so generous in return. They quibbled with the Melbourne Cricket Club about paying £175 for damages to the MCG despite a prior arrangement to do so.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other {{research has}} also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees {{were more likely to report}} having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found that students who were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E
25|$|When two of Liza's female {{teachers}} (who live together) go {{on vacation}} during spring break, she volunteers {{for the job of}} taking care of their home and feeding their cats. The two girls stay at the house together, but in an unexpected turn of events a Foster Academy administrator discovers Liza and Annie together. Liza is forced to tell her family about her relationship with Annie, and the headmistress of her school organizes a meeting of the school's board of trustees in order to expel Liza. The board rules in favor of Liza staying at Foster, and she is allowed to keep her position as student president. However, the two teachers, who in the process are discovered to be gay, are fired. After their initial shock at discovering the girls together, the teachers are very supportive and go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reassure Liza not to worry about their dismissal, but a few ignorantly insensitive responses end up pushing Liza to leave Annie.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the many}} {{complaints}} made by fans was that the film failed {{to relate to the}} G.I. Joe franchise. G4tv.com stated that, [...] " [...] actually went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> butcher the G.I. Joe mythos in favor of derivative storyline devices." [...] They cited the Baroness, who was changed from an East European noble in the comics to Duke's brainwashed ex-girlfriend in the film.|$|E
500|$|While the {{finished}} product never saw an official release until 2015, it was significant in that it motivated Nintendo to start developing their games with international audiences in mind, sometimes going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make adjustments to their games prior to localization to make the latter process easier. According to Phil Sandhop, the director of Mothers localization, {{in an interview with}} LostLevels.org, [...] "the Mother project and localizing it really opened up a few eyes at Nintendo. They began working closer with Nintendo of America and the other subsidiaries to produce artwork for games that would be appropriately received anywhere in the world and not need localization." ...|$|E
500|$|Tony {{left the}} soap on 12 December 2008, after his true nature was exposed. It was {{announced}} on 7 September 2009 {{that he would}} return to EastEnders to be put on trial. Coghill was pleased to return, believing it right that Tony's story arc should conclude realistically, giving closure to the storyline and continuing to raise awareness of the issue. Santer commented: [...] "One of the unique things about EastEnders is its ability to play stories over months and years. Chris agreeing to come back for these episodes will enable us to continue showing the long-term consequences of Tony's abuse of Whitney and – I hope – continue to do justice to the issue of child sex abuse." [...] Grounds praised Tony's trial, stating that it demonstrated the importance for children of having their abusers brought to justice. Palmer felt that: [...] "If one person out there who's been abused saw that [...] go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of the war, No.82 Squadron was {{selected}} to join the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12September and 11January 1946, losing two aircraft to accidents in the process. The squadron deployed to Bofu, a former kamikaze base, during 13–18March 1946, once again as part of No.81 Wing with Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons; Nos.381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support, respectively. No.82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs, along with an escorting deHavilland Mosquito, in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members. From April 1946, the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts. The Australians found that, far from offering resistance, the Japanese went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> be accommodating. No.82 Squadron's [...] commanding officer, Squadron Leader Graham Falconer, remarked following a dinner with Bofu's mayor, [...] "I felt that we were being treated more as visitors than as an occupying force!" ...|$|E
500|$|While Carle Place was {{complaining}} about the inability to access their section of town, a January 1990 article in The New York Times mentioned that the Court's decision put Westbury alone against the state, then-Governor Mario Cuomo and regional planners, who were worried {{about the safety of}} the roughly 140,000 drivers who used the interchange daily. Local business leaders claimed that Westbury was being selfish in opposing inconvenient construction. Even after the ruling, Strada continued to claim that they wanted to be informed on the impacts of a nearby widening project on the Northern State. NYSDOT officials worried that this would add more bureaucratic levels to getting approval for local road projects and that it could set the project back three years. Officials also went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> call this a simple [...] "not in my backyard" [...] case. NYSDOT continued to claim that the projects were separate, and filed three years apart, despite the court's ruling that they were similar projects. Cuomo, worried about the safety of drivers, invited Strada to come to Albany to meet with NYSDOT Commissioner Franklin White and State Senator Norman J. Levy to make an agreement. Strada, however, felt that in order to compromise, they would have to continue the original [...] "violation" [...] of not giving a report.|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E
