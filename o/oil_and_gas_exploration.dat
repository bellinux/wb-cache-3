25|$|Mining which {{includes}} mostly <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exploration</b> and production in Houston accounts for 11 percent the region's GAPdown from 21 percent {{as recently as}} 1985. The reduced role {{of oil and gas}} in Houston's GAP reflects the rapid growth of other sectorssuch as engineering services, health services, and manufacturing. <b>Oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>exploration</b> and production, however, has increased in reaction to high energy prices and a reduced worldwide surplus oil production capacity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{satisfy the}} {{requirements}} of the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>explorations</b> in harsh conditions, an inclinometer based on dynamic tuning gyroscopes was developed. This inclinometer has remarkable temperature and pressure resistance which can be operated under with temperature higher than 175 C and pressure greater than 120 MPa. The azimuth angle error is less than 1 and the error of elevation angle is less than 0. 06. The results of in situ test indicated that this system is can meet {{the requirements of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>explorations</b> which needs the azimuth error 2 ≤ ± and slope angle error 0. 5 ≤ ± and is feasible for practical use...|$|R

25|$|Sodium {{chloride}} {{is heavily}} used, so even relatively minor applications can consume massive quantities.
