40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to explore the effects of warned and unwarned demand transitions in vigilance on performance and self-reported stress. Twenty observers (10 women and 10 men) were assigned at random to each of six conditions resulting from the factorial combination of signal salience (high and low salience signals) and switching (no <b>switch,</b> <b>switch</b> with <b>warning,</b> and <b>switch</b> without <b>warning).</b> Performance metrics and self-reported stress state (Task Engagement, Distress, and Worry) were collected. While demand transitions did destabilize subsequent performance, increasing intra-individual variability, overall performance efficiency was uninfluenced by either <b>switching</b> or <b>warning.</b> Demand transitions, whether warned or not, increased self-reported distress. A dynamic model of performance stress may be necessary and research employing vigilance tasks in the future may be useful for developing this performance-stress model...|$|R
30|$|The {{results show}} {{interesting}} behaviour, beyond {{the reduction of}} congestion in the system. By analysing the first 5 – 7 minutes of simulation time, {{we can see that}} the development of congestion is also slower once vehicles do start to slow down. This is because of the algorithm moving vehicles into the opposite lane to the obstacle, reducing the load on the lane with the obstacle and therefore reducing the number of stopped vehicles behind the obstacle which, when changing lane, cause a dramatic slowdown in the new lane. This reduction in stop-and-go vehicular formation is also seen elsewhere in the field when the cars are infected with the <b>warning</b> message and <b>switch</b> to our adapted algorithm.|$|R
5000|$|In theory, {{the motor}} failure {{on the plane}} could not present a problem because the locking lever {{would not be able}} to close. However, during the {{investigation}} a McDonnell Douglas test rig demonstrated that the entire locking pin operating system was too weak, allowing the handle to be forced closed even with the pins out of the locking holes. This occurred on Flight 96, when the handler forced the handle closed with his knee. In spite of the vent not closing completely, neither the handler nor the engineer considered this to be serious. Although the vent door remained partially open, it closed enough to cause it to [...] "blow shut", and thereby allow pressurization of the cargo hold. Although the handle did not seat the pins entirely, the small amount of motion it managed to cause was enough to press on the <b>warning</b> indicator <b>switch,</b> deactivating the cockpit warning light. It was only the combination of all of these failures that allowed the accident to happen. Yet all of these indicators had a single common point of failure: the mechanical weakness of the locking system that allowed the handle to be moved.|$|R
5000|$|Flight 981, named TC-JAV or [...] "Ship 29", {{had been}} ordered from McDonnell-Douglas {{three months after the}} service {{bulletin}} was issued, and was delivered to Turkish Airlines three months later. Despite this, the changes required by the service bulletin (installation of a support plate for the handle linkage, preventing the bending of the linkage seen in the Flight 96 incident) had not been implemented. Through either oversight or deliberate fraud, the manufacturer construction logs however showed that this work had been carried out. In reality, an improper adjustment had been made to the locking pin and warning light mechanism, causing the locking pin travel to be reduced. This meant that the pins did not extend past the torque tube flanges, allowing the handle to be closed without excessive force (estimated by investigators to be around [...] ) despite the improperly engaged latches. These findings concurred with statements made by Mohammed Mahmoudi, the baggage handler who had closed the door on Flight 981; he noted that no particular amount of force was needed to close the locking handle. Changes had also been made to the <b>warning</b> light <b>switch,</b> so that it would turn off the cockpit warning light even if the handle was not fully closed.|$|R
40|$|Task-switching {{experiments}} have documented a puzzling phenomenon: Advance <b>warning</b> of the <b>switch</b> reduces {{but does not}} eliminate the switch cost. Theoretical accounts have posited that the residual switch cost arises when one selects the relevant stimulus–response mapping, leaving earlier perceptual processes unaffected. We put this assumption to the test by seeking electrophysiological markers of encoding a perceptual dimension. Participants categorized a colored letter as a vowel or consonant or its color as “warm” or “cold. ” Orthogonally to the color manipulation, some colors were eight times more frequent than others, and the letters were in upper- or lowercase. Color frequency modulated the electroencephalogram amplitude at around 150 ms when participants repeated the color-classification task. When participants switched from the letter task to the color task, this effect was significantly delayed. Thus, even when prepared for, a task switch delays or prolongs encoding of the relevant perceptual dimension...|$|R
50|$|On Wednesday, May 4, 2005, at 11 AM, WQSR, an oldies {{station in}} Towson, Maryland which {{targeted}} Baltimore area listeners, changed its format from oldies to Jack FM. Listeners and staffers alike {{were surprised by}} the sudden change because many long-time DJs and on-air personalities were considered almost a Baltimore institution. WQSR received {{a large amount of}} negative publicity regarding their format change. Popular former WQSR personality Steve Rouse has since resurfaced as the new morning show host at sister station, the Soft AC-formatted WLIF.Not long after, on Friday, June 3, 2005, at 5:00 p.m. EDT, WCBS-FM, the oldies station in New York City, switched to Jack FM without any prior <b>warning.</b> The <b>switch</b> to a more generic format has been termed The Day the Music Died by some New Yorkers and has drawn criticism even from non-listeners of the station, particularly due to the sudden firing of DJs of historic renown such as Cousin Brucie. In a partial nod to this controversy, on June 14, 2005, it was announced that the station would be unique among those with the Jack format in that it would occasionally include 1950s and early 1960s songs in its rotation as well as songs by performers like Frank Sinatra that are normally not part of the Jack format, though a later Web update retracted this and songs from before the late 1960s were no longer played.|$|R

40|$|Bringing {{traffic to}} a safe stop at movable bridges : {{literature}} review with recommendations {{for the design of}} the initial warning system. The Centre for Transport and Navigation (DVS) of the Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management in the Netherlands is working at the design of new policy to further improve road user safety at movable bridges under its responsibility. One of the reasons for this new policy are several incidents which occurred at these types of bridges, one of them being the ‘Ketelbrug’ between the Dutch towns of Lelystad and Emmeloord. In recent years DVS organized several expert meetings to answer the question of how the road user can be brought {{to a safe}} stop at a bridge. The initial warning system for the ‘Ketelbrug’ has already been replaced by a new, temporary system. SWOV was asked to provide knowledge for the design of this initial warning system, and was specifically asked whether initial warnings at 900, 600, or 300 metres would be more effective and safer than an initial warning at 1500 metres (as {{was the case in the}} old situation). The literature used in this small-scale study provides general knowledge. This knowledge appears to be insufficient for a specific recommendation for the actual distance at which initial warning should commence. However, indications were found to be careful with initial warning at ‘very’ close distance from the bridge On the other hand, it is also important not place the initial warning at ‘too” large a distance from the bridge. This leaves the question of what exactly the optimal distance is. Furthermore, account must be taken of the variety of other aspects that may have a role in the safest possible design of the initial warning system. Examples are uniformity, homogeneity, credibility, understandability, communication of the reason why, communication in general, gradual activation of the initial <b>warning</b> system or <b>switching</b> on the entire system in one go, habituation, getting out of the habit, and confusion. Further research into behaviour and incidents in traffic in the proximity of movable bridges is recommended. This research can be carried out both in practice and in a simulator. This will provide more clarity about a safe design of the initial warning system...|$|R
