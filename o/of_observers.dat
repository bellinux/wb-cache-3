On March 10, 1957, hundreds <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> looked on as a rising Lake Celilo rapidly silenced the falls, submerged fishing platforms, and consumed {{the village of}} Celilo, ending an age-old existence for those who lived there. A small Native American community exists today at nearby Celilo Village, on a bluff overlooking the former location of the falls.|$|E
5|$|The {{transitional}} period was subsequently extended by a year. On 15 January 1998, the UNTAES mandate ended and Croatia regained {{full control of}} the area. As the UNTAES replaced the UNCRO mission, Prevlaka peninsula, previously under UNCRO control, was put under control of United Nations Mission <b>of</b> <b>Observers</b> in Prevlaka (UNMOP). The UNMOP was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996, and terminated on 15 December 2002.|$|E

40|$|When direct {{observations}} {{are used to}} study animal behavior the presence <b>of</b> the <b>observer</b> may alter the animal and hence influence the data being collected, yet few studies have quantified this effect. We conducted direct observation studies in the glasshouse to assess the relative influence <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence {{on the behavior of}} Pacific damsel bugs, Nabis kinbergii, a potentially important predator of crop pests. Comparisons of predator activity, predator distribution, prey (Helicoverpa armigera) mortality and prey distribution between frequently observed and minimally observed treatments, during diurnal and nocturnal observation sessions showed that the frequency <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence had no apparent impact on Pacific damsel bug behavior. This is the first documented test of the impact <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence in an insect system. To place our results in context, we reviewed 15 papers on the influence <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> presence in a range of animals. We established that just over half of these papers found evidence for an effect. Nevertheless, {{direct observations}} should be useful in further studies of Pacific damsel bug behavior, and researchers using direct observations to study the behavior of other animals should be cognizant <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> effects during design and interpretation of their study...|$|R

5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> noted smoke {{coming from}} the {{vicinity}} of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion. Compared with other nations' warships in wartime service, Japanese battleships contained {{a large amount of}} flammable materials including wooden decking, furniture, and insulation, as well as cotton and wool bedding. Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E
5|$|In the USA, The Smithsonian Institution {{developed}} {{its network}} <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> {{over much of}} the central and eastern United States between the 1840s and 1860s once Joseph Henry took the helm. The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not all the data on the map was used {{due to a lack of}} time standardization. The United States fully adopted time zones in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.|$|E
5|$|The IJN {{convened a}} {{commission}} {{three days after}} the sinking to investigate the loss. It issued its preliminary conclusions on 25 June, well before the investigation of the wreck was completed, and decided that the explosion {{was the result of a}} disgruntled seaman. The commission failed to consider the possibility of fire, which historian Mike Williams considers to be a possible cause, as a number <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> noted smoke coming from the vicinity of No. 3 turret. The truth, however, will never be known.|$|E

5|$|Until 1914, {{artillery}} generally fired over open sights at visible targets, {{the largest}} unit accustomed to firing {{at a single}} target was the artillery regiment or brigade. One innovation {{brought about by the}} adoption of trench warfare was the barrage—a term first used in the battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915. Trench warfare had created the need for indirect fire, with the use <b>of</b> <b>observers,</b> more sophisticated artillery fire plans, and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery, where artillerymen had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns. Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated with others to form a pattern; {{in the case of a}} barrage, the pattern was a line.|$|E
5|$|In {{what became}} known as the Battle of Stillman's Run, the two battalions of militia came into contact with Black Hawk and his warriors on May 14, near present-day Stillman Valley. Accounts of how the battle began are varied. Black Hawk later stated that he sent three men under a white flag to parley, but the Americans imprisoned them and opened fire on a second group <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> who followed. Some militiamen never {{reported}} seeing a white flag; others believed that the flag was a ruse the Indians used to set an ambush. All accounts agree that Black Hawk's warriors attacked the militia camp at dusk. To Black Hawk's surprise, his forty warriors completely routed the much larger militia force. Twelve Illinois militiamen were killed in the humiliating defeat; the British Band suffered only three fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The TuđmanĆosić {{agreement}} on the pullout of JNA troops from Konavle provoked an emotional response in Yugoslavia, where it was interpreted as a defeat and betrayal. Following the agreement, the Prevlaka Peninsula was demilitarized and placed under the United Nations Mission <b>of</b> <b>Observers</b> in Prevlaka (UNMOP), established by the UN Security Council Resolution 779 of 6 October 1992. The resolution placed the peninsula {{under the control of}} UNPROFOR. The UN Security Council Resolution 981 transferred control to the newly established United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia on 31 March 1995, and then to UNMOP through the UN Security Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996. The UN mission there expired two months later. , the Prevlaka Peninsula remains demilitarized, with Croatian and Montenegrin police jointly patrolling the sea. The border in the area remains disputed between Croatia and Montenegro.|$|E

5|$|The UNCRO {{mission was}} ended by UNSC Resolution 1025, passed on 30 November 1995. The {{resolution}} {{was passed in}} the wake of the Erdut Agreement between Croatia and representatives of Serbs in Sector East. It defined mechanisms for peaceful restoration of the region to Croatian control and established an interim period ending on 15 January 1996, when authority was to be transferred from UNCRO to a new transitional force to be deployed to the area. When the interim period expired, the UNSC adopted resolutions 1037 and 1038, which established the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium in the former Sector East and the United Nations Mission <b>of</b> <b>Observers</b> in Prevlaka. Commencement of the two new missions coincided with NATO's arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina to enforce the Dayton Accords.|$|E

25|$|Any {{event that}} changes the number <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> in the {{universe}} may have experimental consequences.

This has not happened and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to a true vacuum state has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This {{can be thought of as}} a variation on quantum suicide.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a formalisation of a notion <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> (or intruder) theories, {{commonly used in}} symbolic analysis of security protocols. An observer theory describes the knowledge and capabilities <b>of</b> an <b>observer,</b> and can be given a formal account using deductive systems, such as those used in various “environment-sensitive ” bisimulation for process calculi, e. g., the spi-calculus. Two notions are critical to the correctness of such formalisations {{and the effectiveness of}} symbolic techniques based on them: decidability of message deduction by the <b>observer</b> and consistency <b>of</b> a given <b>observer</b> theory. We {{consider a}} formalisation, in Isabelle/HOL, of both notions based on an encoding <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> theories as pairs of symbolic traces. This encoding has recently been used in a theory of open bisimulation for the spi-calculus. We machine-checked some important properties, including decidability <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> deduction and consistency, and some key steps which are crucial to the automation of open bisimulation checking for the spi-calculus, and highlight some novelty in our Isabelle/HOL formalisations of decidability proofs...|$|R
