The rate <b>of</b> <b>poverty</b> decline has not been higher in the post-reform period (since 1991).

The most pronounced example is an exceptionally high and persistent level of child malnutrition (46% in 2005–6).|$|E

This more recent focus on concentrated poverty grew largely out of concern about the nation’s inner cities {{in the wake of}} ongoing deindustrialization, civil unrest in the late 1960s, and the rapid suburbanization and out-migration that followed. In most cases, these poor inner city locations were populated predominantly by minorities, and many featured large public housing developments.|$|R
