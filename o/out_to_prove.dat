5|$|Homer {{stops by}} the Kwik-E-Mart {{on the way}} home from work, and {{witnesses}} a robbery committed by a masked clown, resembling Krusty. He identifies the clown as Krusty to the police, and Krusty is arrested, upsetting Bart, who considers him to be his idol. During his trial the next day, Krusty is revealed to be illiterate. After being called out to the stand, Homer points out Krusty as the robber, and he is convicted and sentenced to jail. The community then gathers up in a public burning as they burn up all of Krusty's merchandise. Krusty's sidekick Sideshow Bob becomes the new host of his show, making it a more educational program. Still refusing to accept that his hero could have committed the crime, Bart enlists the help of a reluctant Lisa and they set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> Krusty's innocence.|$|E
5|$|In the 8th century BC, {{after the}} end of the {{so-called}} Greek Dark Ages, Greece emerged with a network of myths and legends, the greatest of all being that of the Trojan Epic Cycle. In general, the Greeks of classical antiquity idealized the Mycenaean period as a glorious period of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth. The legends of Homer's Epics were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. At this time, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann undertook the first modern archaeological excavations in Greece at the site of Mycenae in 1876. Thus, Schliemann set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the historical accuracy of the Iliad by identifying the places described by Homer.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl {{hypothesized}} that the Pacific was settled by voyages from South America and set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that with his Kon-Tiki expedition. Scholars did not take Heyerdahl's hypothesis seriously. New Zealander Andrew Sharp proposed the accidental voyaging hypothesis in 1957, which (erroneously) argued that Oceania was too vast to have been settled by intentional voyaging so migrations must have happened by accidental drift voyages. Sharp granted that Polynesians likely settled the Pacific from Asia, but held the opinion that their crude vessels and navigational tools were not reliable for intentional sailing from Tahiti to Hawaii or New Zealand. He stated that voyages of more than 300 miles were likely accidental voyages, with landfall {{at the mercy of}} wind and current. A 1973 study and computer simulation by Levison, Ward, and Web investigated the probability of Sharp's hypothesis but found it improbable.|$|E

5|$|Van Meegeren {{felt that}} his genius had been misjudged, {{and he set}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> to the art critics {{that he could not}} only copy the style of the Dutch masters in his paintings, but produce a work of art so {{magnificent}} that it would rival the works of master painters. He moved with Jo to the South of France and began preparations for this ultimate forgery, which took him six years, from 1932 to 1937. In a series of early exercises, he forged works by Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, and Johannes Vermeer. Finally, he chose to forge a painting by Vermeer as his masterpiece. Vermeer had not been particularly well-known until {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century; his works were both extremely valuable and scarce — only about 35 had survived.|$|E

Trinny and Susannah both accompany their pink box around the country, {{to get a better}} idea of how the nation's uniforms look. They then descend upon the annual Somerfield supermarket manager's meeting. Trinny and Susannah then persuade the managers to let them do a re-design of the whole of supermarket's uniform.|$|E
25|$|The above {{shows the}} {{contribution}} Petty made to theoretical {{issues that have}} dominated the later subject of economics ever since.

He wrote rigorously, but also with concision and humour. The issues that Petty thought about and wrote are major topics that have plagued the minds of economic theorists ever since.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} two-round {{argument}} system for NP languages with polylogarithmic communication complexity. We introduce a novel property of private information retrieval (PIR) schemes, {{that we call}} database-awareness. We construct a concrete database-aware PIR scheme and build our argument system by combining a database-aware PIR scheme with a probabilistically checkable proof system (PCP). Dwork et. al. (2004) pointed <b>out</b> difficulties <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the soundness of such constructions for arbitrary PIR schemes. But we show the restriction to database-aware PIR schemes is sufficient to overcome these difficulties...|$|R

25|$|In the book, Menzies {{concludes that}} only China had the time, money, {{manpower}} and leadership to send such expeditions and then sets <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that the Chinese visited lands unknown in either China or Europe. He claims that from 1421 to 1423, during the Ming dynasty of China under the Yongle Emperor, the fleets of Admiral Zheng He, commanded by the captains Zhou Wen, Zhou Man, Yang Qing, and Hong Bao, discovered Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Antarctica, and the Northeast Passage; circumnavigated Greenland, {{tried to reach}} the North and South Poles, and circumnavigated the world before Ferdinand Magellan. The book has been published in many languages and {{countries around the world}} and was listed as a New York Times best seller for several weeks in 2003. Although the book contains numerous footnotes, references and acknowledgments, critics point out that it lacks supporting references for Chinese voyages beyond East Africa, the location acknowledged by professional historians as the limit of the fleet's travels. Menzies bases his main theory on original interpretations and extrapolations of academic studies of minority population DNA, archaeological finds and ancient maps.|$|E

[...] Political candidates and their campaigns know, through past election data, that youth are not a reliable voting group and choose to spend their campaign dollars on those who are more likely <b>to</b> turn <b>out</b> <b>to</b> vote.

500|$|The {{symbolic}} {{value of}} the head changed over time. While it was spiked on a pole above the London skyline, it gave a potent warning to spectators. In the 18th century, the head became a curiosity and a relic. The head has been admired, reviled, and dismissed as a fake throughout the centuries. After Thomas Carlyle dismissed the head as [...] "fraudulent moonshine", and after {{the emergence of a}} rival claimant to the true head of Oliver Cromwell, scientific and archaeological analysis was carried <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the identity. Inconclusive tests culminated in a detailed scientific study by Karl Pearson and Geoffrey Morant, which concluded, based on a study of the head and other evidence, that there was a moral certainty that the head belonged to Oliver Cromwell.|$|E

500|$|Not {{only was}} Christian metal criticized by non-Christian metal fans, {{but soon the}} {{movement}} was also criticized by fundamentalists; Allmusic wrote that [...] "when church leaders were accusing heavy metal of encouraging Satanism, Stryper set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that metal and hard rock {{could be used to}} promote Christianity. The southern California band was viewed with suspicion by both ministers (who refused to believe that Christianity and metal were compatible) and fellow headbangers—and yet, Stryper managed to sell millions of albums to both Christian and secular audiences." [...] For example, the televangelist Jimmy Swaggart wrote a book titled Religious Rock n' Roll – A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing in 1987 and criticized the scene, particularly Stryper, for using heavy metal music to preach the gospel of Christianity. Many new bands began to arise, eventually drawing the attention of record labels that specialized in Christian music.|$|E

500|$|The report's visionary {{goal for}} {{preservation}} {{has been both}} lauded and criticized. Author of the book Searching for Yellowstone: Ecology and Wonder in the Last Wilderness, Paul Schullery, wrote of the report: [...] "Scholars return to it for new interpretations and even inspiration regularly, speakers invoke it on all occasions, and it is trotted <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> almost every perspective in debates about modern park management." [...] On the other hand, Alston Chase, a vocal critic of the National Park Service, disapproved of the limited scope of the Leopold Report, arguing that it had [...] "inadvertently replaced science with nostalgia, subverting the goal it had set out to support". The report's insistence to return parks to the condition that [...] "prevailed when the area was first visited by the white man" [...] has also been criticized for ignoring the Native Americans' historical presence in the area. Historian and author Philip Burnham in particular stated in his 2000 book, Indian Country, God's Country: Native Americans and the National Parks, that although Leopold et al. were more progressive than their predecessors, they [...] "still dismissed native people as passive onlookers".|$|E
