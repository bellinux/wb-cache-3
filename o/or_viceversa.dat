Pushing {{monotone}} constraints in frequent pattern mining {{can help}} pruning the search space, {{but at the}} same time it can also reduce the effectiveness of anti-monotone pruning.

In this paper, we deeply characterize this trade-off and its related computational problem. As a result of this characterization, we introduce an adaptive strategy, named ACP (Adaptive Constraint Pushing) which exploits any conjunction of monotone and anti-monotone constraints to prune the search space, and level by level adapts the pruning to the input dataset and constraints, in order to maximize efficiency. ...|$|E
