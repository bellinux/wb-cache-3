The influence of stiffness and flexibility on machining systemcapability is analytically and experimentally investigated. Theexperimental work presented in the thesis complies with the theoriesand shows the relation between machine tool capability and theoutcome on the machine component. The concept of capability analysis by elastic linked system andthe currently available tools for such an evaluation is presented anddiscussed. The basis of elastic linked system analysis is the use ofmeasurements under loaded condition. The machine tool is loadedwith a known force creating a test condition closer to real machining,compared to current methods of unloaded machine tools.

40|$|The {{aerospace}} {{manufacturing sector}} is continuously seeking automation {{due to increased}} demand {{for the next generation}} single-isle aircraft. In order to reduce weight and fuel consumption aircraft manufacturers have increasingly started to use more composites as part of the structure. The manufacture and assembly of composites poses different constraints and challenges compared to the more traditional aircraft build consisting of metal components. In order to overcome these problems and to achieve the desired production rate existing manufacturing technologies have to be improved. New technologies and build concepts have to be developed in order to achieve the rate and ramp up of production and cost saving.

50|$|The {{limitations}} of boring {{in terms of}} its geometric accuracy (form, position) and the hardness of the workpiece have been shrinking in recent decades as machining technology continues to advance. For example, new grades of carbide and ceramic cutting inserts have increased the accuracy and surface quality that can be achieved without grinding, and have increased the range of workpiece hardness values that are workable. However, working to tolerances of only a few micrometres (a few tenths) forces the manufacturing process to rationally confront, and compensate for, the fact that no actual workpiece is ideally rigid and immobile. Each time a cut is taken (no matter how small), or a temperature change of a few hundred degrees takes place (no matter how temporary), the workpiece, or a portion of it, is likely to spring into a new shape, even if the movement is extremely small. In some cases a movement of a fraction of a micrometre in one area is amplified in lever fashion to create a positional error of several micrometres for a feature of the workpiece several decimetres away. It is factors such as these that sometimes preclude finishing by boring and turning as opposed to internal and external cylindrical grinding. At the extreme, no perfection of machining or grinding may be enough when, despite the part being within tolerance when it is made, it warps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> in following days or months. When engineers are confronted with such a case, it drives the quest to find other workpiece materials, or alternate designs that avoid relying so heavily on the immobility of part features on the micro or nano scales.|$|E

This concept has similarity with the concept of scoring a 'goal' in the game of football or hockey, because a goal is counted 'one' irrespective of the location of strike of the ball in the 'goal post', whether it is in the center or towards the corner.

40|$|Abstract — The {{tolerance}} design directly {{influences the}} functionality {{of products and}} production costs. Tolerance synthesis is a procedure that distributes assembly tolerances between components. To ensure that the selected components and its tolerances give the assembly tolerance less than a desired value, worst-case analysis is commonly used. Even though the worst-case analysis is used, {{there is still a}} probability that a product performance is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its <b>tolerance.</b> Moreover, using the worst-case analysis, some assumptions need to be realized. The first is, nominal value of components and assembly are at the desirable values. The second is, left-sided and right-sided tolerances are symmetric in both components and assembly. Use <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>tolerance</b> synthesis may relax those assumptions and quantify the loss due to falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> assembly limit. This paper then gives a comparative study of worst-case and probabilistic tolerance syntheses. A numerical example is used to illustrate the use of worst-case and probabilistic tolerance syntheses. Conclusion and discussion are given. Index Terms—tolerance synthesis, quality engineering, randomness. I...|$|R
40|$|State {{of the art}} in {{multi-stage}} {{production systems}} is End-Of-Line (EOL) quality control. The main drawback of EOL inspection is the off-line inspection at {{the final stage of}} the manufacturing chain, where already all possible defects of the production chain have been accumulated. Thus, a defective workpiece is machined wasting time, money and energy resources for creating a final product, which is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> and has to be recycled or scrapped. To overcome this drawback it is necessary to create solutions to reduce either defect generation or defect propagation. This paper focusses on the second approach, which aims at repairing defective workpieces by adapting consecutive process parameters in a multi-stage production system (downstream repair). By applying this concept to the production of electrical drives for power train applications, the effort needed for EOL testing can be reduced by shifting testing steps into the previous process chain. The currently used total flux measurement of laminated steel stacks is replaced by a space-resolved measurement. This permits the identification and local allocation of deviations in the magnetic field due to defective or weak magnets. The downstream repair strategy solves an optimization problem in order to compensate deviations in the magnetic field of single laminated steel stacks by adapting the assembly stage. Two repair strategies are discussed within this paper, namely sequential and selective assembly. In the proper assembling sequence, the laminated steel stacks are then assembled on the rotor according to the optimal assembling policy. Thus deviations of the laminated steel stacks are compensated. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

A randomly chosen sample of 9 % (124 skis/ 62 pairs) of S-B-B systems from the total ski rental fleet was tested using a Wintersteiger calibration machine. There were a high percentage of Class I deviations in the rental fleet: 50 % (2 seasons), 95 % (3 seasons), and 64 % (4 seasons). Class 1 deviations do not require corrective action; however, increased sampling is indicated. Based on the high percentage of Class I deviations the entire fleet should be inspected.
