5|$|Before {{the release}} of Pixies' debut mini-album Come On Pilgrim in October 1987, Ivo Watts-Russell, head of 4AD, {{suggested}} they return to the studio to record a full-length album. The original plan was to record new material at Fort Apache Studios, where the band had produced The Purple Tape and Come On Pilgrim. However, due to differences between the band's manager Ken Goes and The Purple Tape producer Gary Smith, Pixies ended up {{looking for a new}} producer and recording studio. On the advice of a 4AD colleague, Watts-Russell looked to hire Steve Albini, ex-frontman of Big Black, as the record's engineer and producer. Having sent a pre-release tape <b>of</b> <b>Come</b> On Pilgrim to Albini, Pixies' manager, Ken Goes, invited him to a Boston dinner party at drummer David Lovering's house a few weeks after Come On Pilgrims release.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 American {{romantic comedy}} film Come September, {{featuring}} Rock Hudson and Gina Lollobrigida, directed by Robert Mulligan, was a worldwide box office success, especially in Chennai. The film {{tells the story}} of Robert (Hudson), an American millionaire, who arrives at his villa for his vacation. His girlfriend, Lisa (Lollobrigida), has given up waiting for him and has decided to marry another man. Robert's villa manager, Maurice (Walter Slezak), converts the villa into a hotel while Robert is away. The villa is now occupied by a group of young American girls trying to fend off a gang of boys, led by Tony (Bobby Darin). A. C. Tirulokchandar, who was then a screenwriter for AVM Productions, adapted the screenplay <b>of</b> <b>Come</b> September for his film Anbe Vaa, although AVM Productions did not buy the rights to adapt the film. According to The New Indian Express, it was AVM Productions' 50th film. Tirulokchandar's salary was ₹70,000.|$|E

25|$|Tarkan's last Turkish {{language}} {{album was}} Dudu, in 2003. His first English language work, Come Closer {{did not bring}} satisfactory results {{when compared to the}} sales of his previous albums. It did not even reach gold sales, according to the list published by MÜ-YAP (Turkish Phonographic Institute). After the failure <b>of</b> <b>Come</b> Closer Tarkan decided to release a new, Turkish album and in the beginning of 2007 he declared that he was working on new songs. However, release dates were continuously being postponed. The Turkish daily Hürriyet reported that the album would be released around Ramadan Fest, the three-day celebration after the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. It was rumoured that the first single would be called Biraz Nezaket (A Little Courtesy), written by Sezen Aksu. Tarkan denied this in an interview given at the Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, declaring that release was delayed and the Sezen Aksu song was taken off the track list.|$|E
25|$|Van Asseldonk {{graduated}} into single-seaters at {{the start}} of the 2010 season, moving into Formula BMW. He made his début at the level in the Pacific series with Motaworld Racing, taking part in the season-opening round at Sepang as a guest driver. This was a precursor to his main campaign in the pan-European championship later in the year, competing for the Josef Kaufmann Racing team alongside Robin Frijns and Petri Suvanto. Van Asseldonk had a tough first half of the season, taking only one top-five finish in four meetings; a fifth-place finish at Zandvoort during the Masters of Formula 3-support event. The first of two late-season podiums came at Hockenheim for van Asseldonk, as he finished in third place behind Frijns and Jack Harvey; the first time that two Dutch drivers had featured on the podium, while it was van Asseldonk's first victory in the Rookie Cup for first-season drivers. He took another third place at the final meeting of the year – and, ultimately the series – at Monza, with Frijns winning the race again ahead <b>of</b> <b>Côme</b> Ledogar. He ultimately finished seventh in the Drivers' Championship, and second to Carlos Sainz Jr. in the Rookie Cup.|$|E

500|$|... "Come Dancing" [...] {{served as}} the title number for a stage musical {{of the same name}} that Ray Davies had created. Set in a 1950s music hall, Come Dancing premiered at the Theatre Royal Stratford East on 13 September 2008. Ray Davies had written the {{original}} version of the play in 1997, although he had begun work on it since not long after he had written the original song. The final version <b>of</b> <b>Come</b> Dancing featured a book co-written by Davies and Paul Sirett and a score written by Davies that included three Kinks hits (including the title song) and a number of original songs. Davies also appeared as the narrator in the production, which ran until 25 October 2008.

500|$|Meanwhile, the Pixies {{signed an}} American {{distribution}} deal with major record label Elektra. Around this time, the Pixies {{struck up a}} relationship with the British producer Gil Norton. Norton produced their second full album, Doolittle, which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound <b>of</b> <b>Come</b> on Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa. Doolittle had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of US$40,000, which was quadruple that of Surfer Rosa. Doolittle featured the single [...] "Here Comes Your Man", which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band. [...] "Monkey Gone to Heaven" [...] was a Top 10 modern rock radio hit in the U.S., and reached the Top 100 in the U.K. Like Surfer Rosa, Doolittle was acclaimed by fans and music critics alike.|$|E
500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what we want, the riffs and melodies just kind <b>of</b> <b>come.</b> The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is just where we're at right now with music." [...] Of the end result, drummer Vince Nudo said, [...] "Our individual tastes came out more [...] [...] It's more organic. We're not holding back so much." ...|$|E
500|$|For the 30th {{anniversary of}} The Joshua Tree, U2 staged a 2017 concert tour in North America, Europe, and Latin America, {{on which the}} album was played in its {{entirety}} at each show. It {{was the first time}} the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue, rather than a new release. As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind <b>of</b> <b>come</b> full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E
