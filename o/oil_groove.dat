40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out on a high side scroll compressor having a fixed scroll equipped with a circular <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> on its thrust surface. Oil is supplied to the <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> through an intermittent opening from a high pressure oil reservoir formed inside the orbiting scroll hub. Oil in the groove is then delivered to both suction and back pressure chambers by pressure differentials and viscous pumping action of the orbiting scroll base plate. Mathematical modeling of this <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> system has been incorporated into main compressor performance simulation program for optimum <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> design. Pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> can be controlled by changing the oil passage area and <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> configuration. With an enlarged oil passage, pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> increases due to increased flow rate, but pressure increase in the back pressure chamber is not that large, resulting in reduced friction loss at the thrust surface between the two scrolls. On the other hand, by increasing the oil passage area, oil content in the refrigerant flow increases, and the orbiting scroll stability could be negatively affected by <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> pressure increase. Considering all these factors, EER could be improved by about 3. 6 % at ARI condition by optimum <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> design...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} circuit, {{through which}} the mineral oil is brought, {{is an important part}} of hydrostatic bearings. The annular hydrostatic thrust bearing consists of two sliding plates divided by a layer of mineral oil. In the lower plate, there are <b>oil</b> <b>grooves</b> which distribute the liquid between the sliding areas. The hydraulic circuit is made of two basic parts: the energy source and the controlling part. The hydraulic pump, which brings the liquid into the sliding bearing, is the source of the pressure energy. The sliding bearing is weighted down by axial force, which can be changed during the process. That´s why in front of the particular <b>oil</b> <b>grooves</b> control components adjusting pressure and flow size are located. This paper deals with a project of a hydraulic circuit for regulation of fluid layer in the annular hydrostatic thrust bearing and the testing equipment for measuring its physical properties.

30|$|By {{comparing}} Figures  14 and 15, one can {{see that}} when the piston rod is not subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused to {{the periphery of the}} oil chamber in an elliptical shape. When the piston rod is subjected to a partial load, the oil is diffused into a square shape and the pressure in the oil return groove is low. Additionally, the pressure around the oil chamber gradually decreases and the pressure cloud map changes from orange to yellow, light green, and light blue in sequence. The pressure drop gradient is large and the pressure drop is significant. This is because the gap between the piston rod and sealing oil edge is reduced when the rod is subjected to a partial load. The oil in the oil chamber experiences increased resistance through the return oil gap and the return oil flow rate decreases. Therefore, the pressure in the return <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> is lower than that without a partial load. The reduced return oil flow causes the pressure in the oil chamber to rise and the oil film pressure drop between the oil chamber and return <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> increases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Designing {{hydrodynamic}} bearings {{usually requires}} a total numerical {{analysis of the}} pressure distribution and corresponding design quantities such as the load capacity, load position, oil flowrate, power loss, coefficient of friction and relative power loss. Another option {{is to determine the}} design quantities from design diagrams, which may give rise to inaccurate results, especially if interpolation between the curves is needed. Instead, {{it would have been better}} to have functions describing the design quantities. The objective of this work is to determine curve-fitted functions describing each design quantity, by following a well-defined procedure. Three different kinds of geometry are analysed: rectangular tilting-pad thrust bearings, sector-shaped tilting-pad thrust bearings and journal bearings with two axial <b>oil</b> <b>grooves.</b> In addition, an optimum analysis is performed.

The RPW process was effective in refining both Mg 2 Si reinforcements and α-Mg grains causing the matrix hardening. When increasing the repetition number of RPW process from 200 to 600 cycles, the particle size of Mg 2 Si additives changed from 8 [*]μm to 1 ~ 2 [*]μm, and α-Mg grain size was 1 [*]μm or less. With regard to the defensive and offensive properties of Mg alloys reinforced with Mg 2 Si dispersoids, the composite had superior adhesive wear resistance compared with the conventional Mg alloys because of its extremely high microhardness of 95 ~ 180 Hv by RPW process. The uniform distribution of refined Mg 2 Si particles was useful for improving both defensive and offensive properties against AZ 31 B counter disk specimens. The Mg 2 Si prominent dispersoids in the matrix were also effective in forming the <b>oil</b> <b>grooves</b> around them, and caused the low and stable friction coefficient.

Lubricant is generally fed at a specific supply pressure {{to ensure that the}} journal and the bearing surface are separated. Shearing action between lubricant and bearing parts creates friction which contributes to power loss in the bearing. In this study, experimental work was conducted to determine the effect of oil supply pressure at different <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> positions on torque and frictional force in hydrodynamic journal bearing. The journal bearing test rig with a journal diameter of 100 mm and a length-to-diameter ratio of ½ was used. The oil supply pressure was set at 0. 2, 0. 5 and 0. 7 MPa.

It is found that the bush rotational speed levels off at a lower shaft rotational speed, resulting in the lower bush speed, and that the oil whip disappears at a lower shaft speed, when the supplied pressure is lower. The groove, the driving torque of which cannot be negligible, lowers the bush rotational speed and heightens largely the stability in high-speed region.

A set of experiments using simulated sources of AE {{were carried out}} on a cylinder liner of around 600 mm bore, allowing the development of techniques to accurately identify wave arrival time, attenuation and effects of geometric changes on propagating waves. The experiments with simulated AE sources were used to characterise the signal propagation to chosen locations on the liner surface. Wave propagation within the liner is complex due to variations in wall geometry and is further complicated when a number of waves can propagate around the liner and arrive at the sensor at the same time. A technique for source identification on the cylinder liner has been developed based on wave arrival time. In a practical application of the technique to running engines we also make use {{of knowledge about the}} timing and duration of the mechanical events which occur during normal running.

Second, a lubricant model applied to elastohydrodynamically lubricated (EHL) line contacts considering wall-slip is presented. Finally, an experimental apparatus for investigations of lubricants at high pressures is presented. The design of hydrodynamic bearings usually requires a total numerical analysis of the pressure distribution and the corresponding design quantities such as load capacity and power loss. The objective of this part of the thesis was to determine curve-fitted functions describing each design quantity. Three different kinds of geometry were analysed; rectangular tilting-pad thrust bearings, sector-shaped tilting-pad thrust bearings and journal bearings with two axial <b>oil</b> <b>grooves.</b> The approximate design functions obtained are shown to be in very good agreement with the numerically calculated results. The functions are intended to be implemented in short computer programs. A wall-slip model including limiting shear stress is presented. The lubricant model was applied to EHL line contacts using isothermal conditions. The main part of the model concerns the lubricant velocity at each surface that is decoupled from the corresponding surface velocity giving two new variables in the EHL equations. The lubricant velocity at the surface is related to the corresponding shear stress. As long as the value of the shear stress is below the limiting shear stress, the lubricant velocity is equal to the surface velocity. However, when the shear stress reaches the limiting shear stress, interfacial slip appears and the lubricant velocity differs from the surface velocity. Both smooth and wavy surfaces were used in the calculations and the influence of the wall-slip model on the results compared to a Newtonian model was investigated. Results from a high pressure chamber are presented. It is possible to use the apparatus for a number of different measurements.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an integrated investigation of {{various aspects of}} hydrodynamic lubrication in a journal bearing. Hydrodynamic journal bearings arc critical power transmission components used to carry high loads in different machines applications. In machine design, {{it is essential to}} know the true or expected operating conditions of the bearings. These operating conditions can be explored in laboratory using a specific test rig. In the present study, the hydrodynamics lubrication behaviour in a journal bearing has been investigated. The work described is based on the direct measurement of temperature, pressure, frictional force and ultrasonic reflection coefficients from a fluid interface using longitudinal and shear transducers. Measurement of temperature profile in hydrodynamic lubrication journal bearing has been investigated for different conditions later compared to predicted values from effective temperatures. In this study effective temperatures were calculated by two different methods using (1) Raimondi and Boyd chart s and (2) inlet and outlet temperature values. From the results obtained, it was found that speed, load, oil inlet supply pressure and <b>oil</b> <b>groove</b> locations have affected the temperature profiles to some extent. In other investigation, measurements of pressure profiles in hydrodynamic lubrication in journal bearing were plotted. Predicted maximum pressure from Raimondi and Boyd charts were obtained for comparison purposes. Theoretical pressure profiles by short-bearing and long-bearing approximations were computed. It was found that the experimental maximum pressure is higher compared to the predicted value. In another investigation, an ultrasonic method was deployed to map thickness profile around the journal bearing. A purpose built transducer using a longitudinal wave was used to obtain the reflection coefficient from the lubricant layer. The thickness profile obtained in converging section agrees well with classical hydrodynamic predictions. In the diverging section, transformation from reflection coefficient values to oil film thickness is no longer valid due to the presence of a second phase, air. This caused the reflection coefficient values tend to 1. In measurement of viscosity around bearing circumferential, a shear wave was deployed to obtained reflection coefficient from the lubricant layer. A different plug was used for the purpose built transducer. Viscosity values were calculated using Spring Model for thin layer and Bulk Model in thick layer. It was observed that viscosity in operating journal bearing differ from the values obtained by effective temperatures...|$|E

40|$|In Squeeze Film Dampers, (SFD), grooves (deep or shallow) {{are used}} to feed oil into the damper and prevent oil {{starvation}} within the fluid film lands. In oil seals with film land of clearance c, short shallow grooves (depth ? 15 c, length ? 30 c) are machined to reduce the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients, and thus improve the seal stability characteristics. Moreover, test stands for these devices can also incorporate grooves or recesses as part of oil feeding/ discharge arrangements. A common assumption is that these grooves do not influence the test system forced response. However, unexpected large added mass coefficients are reported in these configurations and not adequately predicted. In the case of <b>grooved</b> <b>oil</b> seals, experimental results also show that circumferential grooves do aid to reduce cross-coupled force coefficients but {{to a lesser extent}} than predictions otherwise indicate. A linear fluid inertia model for analysis of multiple-groove SFD or oil seal configurations is advanced. A perturbation analysis for small motion about a journal centered and off-centered position yields zeroth and first order flow equations defined at each individual flow region (land and grooves) of constant clearance (c). The analysis considers both the circumferential and axial dynamic pressure variations across the groove and land regions. At the groove regions, an effective groove depth (d?) and effective clearance (c d c ? ? = +) are defined based on qualitative observations of the laminar flow pattern through annular cavities. This depth differs from the actual physical groove depth. The boundary conditions at the inlet and exit plane are a function of the geometric configuration. Integration of the resulting dynamic pressure fields on the journal surface yields the force coefficients (stiffness, damping, and inertia). Comparisons between predicted and experimental force coefficients for a <b>grooved</b> <b>oil</b> seal and a SFD show excellent correlation over a narrow range of effective groove depths. The results confirm that large added mass coefficients are associated to the feed/discharge grooves in the scrutinized test configurations. Furthermore, predictions, benchmarking experimental data, corroborate that short inner land <b>grooves</b> in an <b>oil</b> seal do not isolate the pressure field of the adjacent film lands, and hence contribute greatly to the force response of the seal...|$|R

40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} reduction {{of more than}} 20 % can be achieved through engine friction reduction. Piston and piston rings contribute {{approximately half of the}} total engine friction and are therefore central to friction reduction efforts. The most common method to reduce mechanical losses from piston rings has been to lower ring tension, the normal force providing sealing between the piston ring and the cylinder liner. However tension reduction can result in additional lubricant consumption. The objective of this thesis is to understand and model the physical mechanisms resulting in flow of oil to the combustion chamber in order to achieve optimal designs of piston rings. The optimal design is a compromise between friction reduction and adequate gas and lubricant sealing performance. To do so a multi-scale curved beam finite element model of piston ring is developed. It is built to couple ring deformation, dynamics and contact with the piston and the cylinder. Oil flow at the interfaces between the ring and the cylinder liner and between the ring and the piston groove can thus be simulated. The piston ring model is used to study the sealing performance of the Oil Control Ring (OCR), whose function is to limit the amount of oil supplied to the ring pack. The contributions of the three main mechanisms previously identified, to oil flow past the OCR are quantified: - Deformation of the cylinder under operating conditions can lead to a loss of contact between the ring and the liner. - Tilting of the piston around its pin can force the OCR to twist and scrape oil from the liner. - Oil accumulating below the OCR can flow to the groove and leak {{on the top of the}} OCR The OCR is found to be flexible enough to limit the impact of cylinder deformation on oil consumption. Both ring scraping and flow through the OCR groove can contribute to oil consumption in the range of engine running conditions simulated. Reduction of scraping is possible by increasing the ability of both OCR lands to maintain contact with the liner regardless of piston groove tilt. The flow of oil through the OCR groove can be reduced by designing appropriate draining of <b>oil</b> in the <b>groove</b> and an adequate oil reservoir below the OCR. The piston ring oil transport model developed in this thesis will be a valuable tool to optimize ring pack designs to achieve further ring pack friction reduction without increasing oil consumption. by Camille Baelden.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study into the flow behaviour of lubricant in a reciprocating contact simulating a piston ring–cylinder liner pair. The {{aim was to}} understand the effects of cavitation, starvation and surface texture, as well as the interaction between these, in order to improve automotive engine performance. A custom-built test rig was used, in which a section of piston ring is loaded against a reciprocating, laser-textured, fused silica pad representing the liner. A fluorescence microscope focusses through the silica specimen onto the contact in order to image the distribution of dyed oil. Tests were performed using a range of texture geometries and orientations, under starved and fully-flooded lubrication conditions, with measurements being compared against those from a non-textured reference. Under limited oil supply conditions, the non-textured reciprocating contact sweeps oil towards the reversal points (TDC and BDC), leading to starvation and increased friction. This issue is alleviated by the presence of surface texturing, with each pocket transferring oil from the inlet to the outlet of the contact as it passes; the result being 33 % lower friction and oil distributed evenly over the liner surface. Even under fully flooded conditions, starvation is shown to occur following each reversal, as the change in sliding direction causes the cavitated outlet to become the oil-deprived inlet. This proof of cavitation-reversal-starvation, which occurs for up to the first 5 % of the stroke length, depending on the lubricant’s viscosity, corresponds to regions of high wear, measured in this study and on actual cylinder liners reported in the literature. This process is also counteracted by the presence of surface texture, with each pocket depositing oil into the cavitated region prior to reversal. Fluorescence data also provides insights into other mechanisms with which different textures geometries control friction. Grooves oriented parallel to sliding direction increase friction as they appear to connect the high pressure inlet with the low pressure outlet, leading to <b>oil</b> film collapse. <b>Grooves</b> oriented transverse to sliding direction produce localised cavitation inside each pocket, which supports the theory that texture draws lubricant into the contact through the ‘inlet suction’ mechanism. These findings can aid texture design by showing how pockets can be used in practice to simultaneously control oil consumption, and reduce friction and wear along the stroke. It {{should be noted that the}} lubricant transport mechanisms described above should also result from other types of depressions, such those produced by porous coatings (provided they are smaller than the contact area) ...|$|R
