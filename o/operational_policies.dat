2500|$|The direct {{source for}} this {{information}} {{comes from an}} independent report produced by Compliance Strategy Group for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The report is called An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In the report that is available through access to information, the authors argued that the CEW was, for several years after its adoption by the RCMP, erroneously characterized as a prohibited [...] "weapon" [...] under the Criminal Code, {{as opposed to a}} prohibited [...] "firearm". This misunderstanding was subsequently incorporated into the RCMP's <b>operational</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures {{as well as those of}} other police services in Canada.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1987 and 1989, new Boeing 737s {{arrived to}} replace the older ones, and six Fokker 50s {{were added to the}} Commuter fleet. During 1990, after the passage of the {{deregulation}} act for the airline industry in Ireland, Aer Lingus reconsidered its <b>operational</b> <b>policies.</b> It retired the BAC One-Elevens and replaced them with five new 737s. In 1991, four Saab 340Bs arrived at the commuter division {{to replace the}} Short 360 aircraft. By 1992 Aer Lingus's entire original 737-200 fleet had been replaced and it was now the first carrier in the world [...] operating all three versions of the second generation 737. These were the −300, −400 and −500 series, although the −300 did not stay long in Aer Lingus service.|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>operational</b> <b>policy,</b> the Process Intermediate Storage (PIS) <b>operational</b> <b>policy,</b> is {{introduced}} {{and used to}} synthesize, schedule and design multipurpose batch plants. The model {{is based on the}} State Sequence Network (SSN) and non-uniform discretization of the time horizon of interest model developed by Majozi&Zhu (2001). Two cases are studied to determine the effectiveness of the <b>operational</b> <b>policy.</b> A plant without dedicated intermediate storage is considered in the first case. In this case the throughput is maximized with and without the use of the PIS <b>operational</b> <b>policy.</b> The use of the PIS <b>operational</b> <b>policy</b> results in a 50 % improvement in the throughout. The second case is used to determine the minimum amount of intermediate storage while maintaining the throughput achieved with infinite intermediate storage. This resulted in a 33 % reduction in the amount of dedicated intermediate storage. The models developed for both cases are MILP models. A design model is then developed to exploit the attributes of the PIS <b>operational</b> <b>policy.</b> The design model is a MINLP due to the capital cost objective function. This model is applied to a literature example and an industrial case study and in both cases results in improved flowsheets and reduced capital cost.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} volatility in the call money rate and its association to monetary policy operations of Bangladesh Bank (BB). In the process, it explores empirical issues like the comovement of money market rates {{and the presence of}} heteroscedasticity in the call money rate. The first stage analysis supports the view that money market rates co-move and there is a co-integration relationship between overnight money market rate and BB's policy interest rates. At the second stage, long-run properties of the data were incorporated while trying to investigate the efficacy of <b>operational</b> <b>policy</b> of BB in the indirect policy regime by separating the short-run and long-run effects. As the variances of the error terms are not constant, OLS estimation provides a false sense of precision. A GARCH model is therefore estimated which suggests that the <b>operational</b> <b>policy</b> of BB is effective in influencing the rate volatility in Bangladesh. The empirical evidence of this study will assist in better understanding the interest rate channel of monetary transmission, overnight money market behavior, and <b>operational</b> <b>policy</b> of BB...|$|R
