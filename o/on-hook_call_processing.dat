40|$|New {{telephone}} {{features and}} their increasingly complex interactions {{with one another}} requires better performance from Telecommunication Switching systems. Since <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> is the most computationally expensive task in a switch, multi-processor systems are being considered for the <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> cores of many commercial switch architectures. In this thesis, the design criteria for such a <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> system have been generated and analyzed. A new approach, the heterogeneous linear pipelined array is proposed and compared with a common load sharing architecture. The linear pipelined array has been simulated using a detailed Verilog Hardware Description Language model, to further verify its suitability for <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> applications. Several fixed assignment schemes and three simple heuristic assignment schemes have been simulated and the resulting throughput and processor utilizations has been studied. A semi-static approach has been tested, where an optimal schedule is determined based on the relative quantities of calls in specific states. The performance of the array for the <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> task is shown, {{for a variety of}} cases, to be dependent on the degree of load balancing which can be achieved in the array {{and the extent to which}} processing bottlenecks can be avoided. The results for the semi-static schedules are significantly better than for the fixed schemes. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Internet Telephony is {{the next}} {{generation}} of telephony with many new features and low cost. Because of the explosion of new features, it has become critical to control and manage these features. The main challenge in Internet Telephony is service programming. The <b>Call</b> <b>Processing</b> Language (CPL) is a solution for end users to describe and control their services in Internet Telephony. Current CPL focuses on <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> services only. It is not adequate for the definition of many types of new services, such as the combination of telephony services with email, instant messaging, presence etc. This thesis extends CPL to describe new Internet Telephony services including presence services and <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> services related to presence. In the thesis, the presence system is systematically described in a three-layer architecture. End user’s presence services and system basic services are clearly separated in the architecture. Presence information, as the basis of presence services, is extended from traditional “online ” and “offline ” indicators to include broader meaning, such as location, phone line status, role and availability status etc. Through CPL extensions for presence, user’s new presence services and new presence related <b>call</b> <b>processing</b> services are illustrated by using various examples. A simulation system is implemented to demonstrate the Internet Telephony services specified in extended CPL. End users can create and modify their own services via the Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) and access their services at any location through the Internet. The simulation system is verified with various test cases...|$|R
