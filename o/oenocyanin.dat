Here the hypothesis was tested that <b>oenocyanin</b> added to the diet can interfere with intestinal adenoma development in the ApcMin mouse, a model of intestinal carcinogenesis linked to an Apc mutation. Methods: Mice received <b>oenocyanin</b> (0. 3...|$|E
40|$|Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) -modified {{electrodes}} {{have been}} used for the estimation of the polyphenolic content and of the colour index of different samples of wines. Synthetic wine solutions, prepared with different amount of <b>oenocyanins,</b> have been analysed spectrophotometrically and electrochemically in order to find a correlation between the total polyphenolic content or colour index and the current peak. The regression curves obtained {{have been used}} as external calibration lines for the analysis of several commercial wines, ranging from white to dark red wines. In this way, a rapid estimation of the total polyphenolic content and of the colour index may be accomplished from a single voltammetric measurement. Furthermore, principal component analysis has also been used to evaluate the effect of total polyphenolic content and colour index on the whole voltammetric signals within a selected potential range, both for the synthetic solutions and for the commercial products...|$|R
