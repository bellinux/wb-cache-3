That is what inspired {{me to do something}} for these people". In an interview to TOI, the actress said: [...] "We feel sympathetic towards them, but we never employ them. We are scared because we have not grown up with them. While these people might be visually impaired, their other senses are very strong. So they can effectively give foot and back massages and treatments like reflexology. It's important to understand that you are not doing a favour on them but they are doing a favour on you".|$|E

[...] And my dad, who worked from home, and who was very dry, not one to soft-pedal things, turned slowly in his chair and said: 'Oh yeah. There's a serial killer who has killed four or five people, who calls himself Zodiac, who's threatened to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tires of a school bus, and then shoot the children as they come off the bus. For Fincher as a young boy, the killer [...] "was the ultimate boogeyman". The director was also drawn to the unresolved ending of Vanderbilt's screenplay because it felt true to real life, as cases are not always solved. Toschi later stated that he had watched Zodiac several times and added [...] "I thought Ruffalo did a good job," [...] but also reported that the film reminded him of old frustrations that the case was never closed.|$|E

These surveys are used to make informed planning decisions about programs to help prevent bullying and promote a safe and inclusive school environment.|$|E

Pritilata was a meritorious student. A {{teacher in the}} school, whom students affectionately used called Usha Di, used stories of Rani Lakshmibai to inspire nationalism in her students. Kalpana Datta, a classmate of Pritilata, writes in the biography Chittagong Armoury Raiders– [...] "We had no clear idea in <b>our</b> <b>school</b> days about our future. Then the Rani of Jhansi fired our imagination with her example. Sometimes {{we used to think}} of ourselves as fearless...". Arts and literature were Pritilata's favourite subjects. She passed out of Dr. Khastagir Government Girls' School in 1928 and in 1929, got admitted to the Eden College, Dhaka. In the Intermediate examinations, she stood first among all students who appeared in that year's examination from the Dhaka Board. As a student in Eden College, she participated in various social activities. She joined the group Sree Sangha, headed by Leela Nag, under the banner Dipali Sangha.|$|E
2500|$|Through his {{association}} with Don Leicht and Fashion Moda, Fekner stenciled six spray painted messages at [...] Charlotte Street including Decay, Broken Promises, Falsas Promesas, Last Hope, Broken Treaties and Save <b>Our</b> <b>School.</b> The message of Fekner’s stencils focused on pointing out the deteriorating conditions and issues of inadequate housing, poor services and deplorable social problems afflicting the neighborhood residents for over two decades. Fekner's messages were succinct and dramatic in size while the Birdfeeders of collaborator Don Leicht were intimate, small-scaled painted sculptures {{for the children of}} the neighborhood. Their work transversely complemented each other with two different and distinct approaches that identified and drew attention to the existing conditions of the immediate Black and Latino communities, as well the concerns of Native American Indians. The stencils were visible at the People's Convention on August 8–10, an alternative and direct response to the National Convention of the Democratic Party being held at Madison Square Garden from August 11 -14th in New York City. After Presidential Candidate Ronald Reagan stood in front of Fekner’s stencils, Decay and Broken Promises on Charlotte Street on August 5, 1980, Fekner detoured away from the notoriety to explore a new found interest in multimedia art.|$|E
