40|$|Petunia grandiflora Juss. and Nicotiana alata Link & Otto {{are two of}} {{the most}} widely spread plants on the market for annual potted {{ornamental}} plants. In order to identify the most adequate substrate formula we analyzed the effects of different potting growing media used for P. hybrida grandiflora 'Bravo' and N. alata 'Dinamo' on their photosynthetic capacity, leaf area, and flowering potential. Optimization of growing media formula for petunia and <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> was performed by preparing four growing media mixing fallow soil (FS), Biolan peat (BP), acid peat (AP), leaf compost (C), and perlite (P) in different proportions. The physiological potential of petunia and <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> was investigated by photosynthesis and respiration rate and chlorophyll pigments in leaves, while the vegetative and flowering phenological stages were evaluated by number of leaves per plant, leaf area, number of flowers per plant and leaf area/flowers ratio. These measurements were significantly influenced by the different potting growing media used in this study. In the flowering stage, the highest photosynthesis rates (8. 612 μmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) as well as leaf area (1. 766 dm²) of petunias were obtained on growing media with 60 % biolan peat, 30 % acid peat and 10 % perlite (BP 60 -AP 30 -P 10). Flowering responses to growing conditions vary greatly among plants and the biggest number of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> flowers (22 flowers plant- 1) was registered as an effect of BP 60 -AP 30 -P 10 media. Growing media with the BP 60 -AP 30 -P 10 formula seem to be the most adequate growth substrate to develop profitable crops for petunias and <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> with high decorative value...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} and characterized the cDNA encoding the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana langsdorffii X N. sanderae) homolog of the antirrhinum (Antirrhinum majus) MYB 305. This transcription factor was robustly expressed at Stage 12 of nectary development but was only weakly {{expressed in the}} earlier Stage 6 nectaries. The <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> MYB 305 contains a conserved R 2 R 3 MYB DNA binding domain with 76 amino acids in the activation domain. A green fluorescent protein-MYB 305 fusion localized to nucleus of tobacco protoplasts and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrated that it functions as a transcription activator. A conserved 23 –amino acid C-terminal domain is required to activate gene expression. The coding region of the myb 305 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and was purified to homogeneity. This protein shows binding to two consensus MYB binding sites on the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> Nectarin I (nec 1) promoter {{as well as to}} the single site located on the Nectarin V (nec 5) promoter. Deletions of either of the binding sites from the nec 1 promoter significantly reduced expression in nectary tissues. Temporally, MYB 305 expression precedes that of nec 1 and nec 5, as would be expected if the MYB 305 factor regulates expression of the nec 1 and nec 5 genes. Ectopic expression of MYB 305 in foliage was able to induce expression of both nec 1 and nec 5, as well as two flavonoid biosynthetic genes in the foliage. Finally, RNA interference knockdown of MYB 305 resulted in reduced expression of both nectarins and flavonoid biosynthetic genes. We conclude that expression of MYB 305 regulates expression of the major nectarin genes in the floral nectary...|$|E

5000|$|Phytophthora nicotinae {{has a wide}} host range, {{affecting}} agriculture rich areas {{all over}} the world. In the United States {{this is a major}} pathogen of <b>ornamentals,</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and tomato. Black Shank {{is one of the most}} damaging and far reaching diseases of tobacco. In 1896, Black Shank was first described in Indonesia by Van Breda de Haan. Disease was observed near Georgia in 1915 and reached major tobacco growing areas of Kentucky and North Carolina in the 1930s and 1940s. In North Carolina black shank can be found in every county that grows flue-cured tobacco and currently causes statewide losses of 1 to 2.5 percent per year. This pathogen thrives in warm climates, so it is destructive on crops grown in these areas. During favorable conditions, new generations of spores can be produced every 72 hours, so if this disease is not managed well it can be very destructive. Susceptible cultivars in the right conditions can reach losses of 100 percent, because infected plants do not recover. Less than one propagule per gram of soil can lead to an epidemic.|$|R

40|$|We {{isolated}} and characterized the cDNA encoding the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> (N. langsdorffii X N. sanderae) homolog of the antirrhinum (Antirrhinum majus) MYB 305. This cDNA encodes a MYB family transcription factor protein which contains a conserved R 2 R 3 MYB DNA binding domain with 76 amino acids in the activation domain. This myb 305 gene is expressed uniquely in floral organs {{with the highest}} level in the mature nectary and with lower levels in the ovary, floral tube, petals and flower abscission zone. A GFP-MYB 305 fusion protein localizes to nucleus of tobacco protoplasts and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrates that it functions as a transcription activator. A conserved 23 amino acid C-terminal domain is required to activate gene expression. Functional study discovered that MYB 305 is involved in many physiological processes in plants. First, MYB 305 regulates expression of the major nectarin genes Nectarin I (nec 1) and Nectarin V (nec 5) in the nectary of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> plants. Temporally, myb 305 gene expression precedes that of nec 1 and nec 5 genes. The purified GST-MYB 305 proteins bind two consensus MYB-binding sites on the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> nec 1 promoter as well as bind the single site located on the nec 5 promoter. Deletions of either of the binding sites from the nec 1 promoter significantly reduce expression in nectary tissues. Ectopic expression of MYB 305 in foliage is able to induce the expression of both nec 1 and nec 5. Further knockdown of MYB 305 result in reduced expression of nec 1 and nec 5. Second, MYB 305 plays important roles in floral organ development and maturation by regulating starch metabolism. In the MYB 305 knockdown plants, the nectaries retain juvenile character and secrete reduced levels of nectar, the petals are smaller and do not fully expanded during anthesis. Abnormal starch metabolism {{has been found to}} contribute to these phenotypes because reduced starch accumulation was found in both the nectary, before nectar secretion, and in petals, before anthesis. The reduced levels of starch accumulation correlate with the expression of starch metabolic genes in both nectary and petal of MYB 305 RNAi plants, suggesting that MYB 305 is involved in starch metabolism by controlling the expression of starch metabolic genes...|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{changes of}} floral nectary gland and {{subcellular}} transition of floral nectary cells of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> LxS 8 were exclusively investigated in this study. Enlargement of the floral nectary gland of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> LxS 8 that occurs during development {{is accompanied by}} a major accumulation of Periodic Acid-Schiff 2 ̆ 7 s staining (PAS-staining) starch grains in nectary amyloplasts. Quantification of starch purified from the nectary at various stages of development showed little starch at an early developmental stage, soon thereafter the amount of starch increased dramatically, reaching a peak approximately 24 hours prior to anthesis. After this time, the amount of starch declined dramatically until the flower reached anthesis, suggesting that the accumulated starch was converted to sugars (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) for nectar production that occurs prior to anthesis. A Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) study of plastid development further verified that <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> nectaries accumulate large amounts of starch during floral development and hydrolyze that starch prior to anthesis. Compositional and structural analyses of nectary starch showed that amylose content and degree of amylopectin branching varied during nectary development. The average chain length in amylopectin was relatively short at early developmental stages, reached maximal length towards the end of nectary development, and was reduced again at anthesis, consistent with the synthesis of an increasingly complex form of starch up to middle stages of nectary development, followed by decreases in starch complexity and amount due to starch degradation in the mature nectary.;Tobacco floral nectaries undergo changes in form and function. As nectaries change from green to orange, a new pigment is expressed. Analysis demonstrated that it is beta-carotene. Plastids undergo dramatic changes. Early in nectary development, they divide and by stage 9 (S 9) they are engorged with starch. About S 9, nectaries shift from quiescent anabolism to active catabolism resulting in starch breakdown and production of nectar sugars. Starch is replaced by osmiophilic bodies, which contain needle-like carotenoid crystals. Between S 9 and S 12, amyloplasts are converted to chromoplasts. Changes in carotenoids and ascorbate were assayed and are expressed at low levels early in development; however, following S 9 metabolic shift, syntheses of beta-carotene and ascorbate greatly increase in advance of expression of nectar redox cycle. We propose that biosynthesis of these antioxidants is governed by availability of substrate molecules that arise from starch breakdown. These processes and events may be amenable to molecular manipulation to provide a better system for insect attraction, cross pollination, and hybridization.;Thirty-nine different nectary-expressed cDNAs from the nectaries of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> plants that encode 14 different starch metabolic enzymes, 7 different mevalonate metabolic enzymes, 7 different MEP metabolic enzymes, 8 different beta-carotene metabolic enzymes, and 3 different ascorbate metabolic enzymes were identified from <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> LxS 8. The translated protein sequences were used to identify gene functionality by comparison with well characterized protein sequences from Arabidopsis, maize and solanaceous species. Subsequently RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR were used to evaluate gene expression throughout nectary development. This analysis revealed that starch metabolism was highly regulated at transcriptional level in <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> floral nectary. Three different classes of starch metabolic gene expression pattern appeared. Most starch anabolic genes, including starch synthase 1 (SS 1), starch synthase 3 (SS 3) and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS), were expressed early in nectary development (Stage 2 and Stage 6), and the expression was significantly down-regulated after Stage 9. In contrast, the starch catabolic genes, including branching enzyme 1 (BE 1), isoamylase 1 (ISA 1), alpha-amylase (AMY), beta-amylase (BMY), were not highly expressed at early stages, but were significantly induced by Stage 9 of nectary development. A third class of gene expression that included R 1, phosphorylase (PHO), and starch branching enzyme 2 (SBE 2) were expressed through nectary development. Immnunodetection shows that ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) small subunit and sucrose synthase (SuSy) were highly expressed at early stages. Enzyme activity analysis of AGPase also shows that enzyme activity was higher at early stages. Transcript analysis for carotenoid and ascorbate biosynthetic pathways showed that these genes are significantly expressed at S 6, prior to the S 9 metabolic shift. Thus, formation of antioxidants beta-carotene and ascorbate after the metabolic shift is independent of transcriptional regulation.;We also evaluated the transport of radiolabeled sugars nectar. Consistency in the amounts and ratios of radiolabeled sugars in nectar indicates that the transported photosynthate sugars were subject to metabolic constraints in the nectary tissue prior to their incorporation into nectar. The velocity of radiolabeled sugars accumulated in nectar illustrates that transported photosynthate contributes to the later nectar production. A series of transgenic plants had been generated. The genetic evidence verified that starch regulates the timing and amount of floral nectar...|$|E

40|$|Predators {{belonging}} to the genus Orius were collected in several areas in Italy on 18 species of vegetable crops, 10 species of <b>ornamental</b> crops, on <b>tobacco</b> and prickly pear, and on 6 species of wild plants. Five Orius species which prey on small arthropods (thrips included) and one species, O. pallidicornis (Reuter), which feeds on pollen of the wild plant Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Richard were found. The most common species were O. niger Wolff, O. laevigatus (Fieber) and O. majusculus (Reuter). No clear host-plant preferences of these thrips species were recorded. The species showed different geographic distributions. O. niger {{was found to be}} widely common in all the Italian regions. O. laevigatus was frequently found, was the most abundant species in cen-tral and southern regions, but was rare in the northern regions. O. majusculus decreased in abundance from northern to central It-aly, and was absent below 38 ° N latitude. O. horvathi (Reuter) and O. vicinus (Ribaut) were recorded only once on raspberry (in northern Italy) and on sweet pepper (on Sicily), respectively. The phytophagous species O. pallidicornis was found only on Sicily. The distribution map of the predators indicates that O. laevigatus is the predominant species in the warmest areas, O. majusculus in the coldest areas, while O. niger occurs all over Italy in similar amount. The survey indicates that O. niger and O. laevigatus are well adapted to the Mediterranean area which may make them good candidates for biological control of thrips.

Surprisingly, PI precursors adopt this circular structure regardless {{of the number of}} inhibitor domains, suggesting this bracelet-like conformation is characteristic of the widespread potato inhibitor II (Pot II) protein family...|$|E
40|$|Background: The <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> Nicotiana alata {{produces}} {{a series of}} proteinase inhibitors (Pls) that are derived from a 43 kDa precursor protein, NaProPl.

An unusual feature of NaProPl is that the structural domains lie across adjacent repeats and that the sixth Pl domain is generated from fragments of the first and sixth repeats. Although the homology of the repeats suggests that they may have arisen from gene duplication, the observed folding does not appear to support this. This study of the solution structure of a single NaProPl repeat (aPl 1) forms a basis for unravelling the mechanism by which this protein may have evolved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana alata) {{produces}} {{a series of}} 6 kDa proteinase inhibitors belonging to the potato type II inhibitor family. These proteins inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin, the main digestive enzymes of predatory insects, thus leading to starvation, impaired larval development or death. In this context, the three-dimensional structures of these inhibitors are important for developing novel strategies for pest control. The solution structures of C 1 and T 1, the two main prototypes of the N. alata inhibitors, were originally determined {{more than a decade}} ago (J. Mol. Biol. 242, 231 - 243 (1994) and Biochemistry 34, 14304 - 14311 (1995)). Since then methods for NMR structure calculations have evolved considerably. Here we report the refinement of the structures of C 1 and T 1 with state-of-the-art protocols for NMR structure calculations. This refinement leads to an improved quality of the structures, making them a more reliable basis for the development of novel pesticides and modeling applications...|$|E
40|$|Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs), {{isolated}} from the pistils of Nicotiana alata, an <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco,</b> are developmentally regulated. Both the total amount and concentration of AGP in the stigma increase during flower development, reaching 10 micrograms AGP/stigma at maturity. In contrast, AGP concentration in the style remains constant throughout the maturation period reaching 12 micrograms AGP/style at maturity. The classes of AGP present in the stigma and style during flower development, separated according to their charge by crossed-electrophoresis, are different and change during development. Pollination of flowers of N. alata with compatible or incompatible pollen results in a significant and reproducible increase {{in the amount of}} AGPs in the stigma, but not the style, compared with control unpollinated pistils. Pollination with ethanol vapor inactivated pollen also results in an increase in the amount of AGP in the stigma, but this is less than half that observed following pollination with viable pollen.

The other four proteinase inhibitors (Tl to T 4) contain reactive sites for trypsin. The three-dimensional structure of Cl is generally well defined and contains a triple stranded P-sheet as the dominant secondary structural feature. Several turns and a short region of 3 (10) helix are also present. The putative chmotrypsin reactive site is present on an exposed loop which is less defined {{than the rest of the}} protein.

40|$|Nicotiana alata defensins 1 and 2 (NaD 1 and NaD 2) are plant defensins {{from the}} <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> that have {{antifungal}} activity against {{a variety of}} fungal pathogens. Some plant defensins interact with fungal cell wall O-glycosylated proteins. Therefore, we investigated {{if this was the}} case for NaD 1 and NaD 2, by assessing the sensitivity of the three Aspergillus nidulans (An) O-mannosyltransferase (pmt) knockout (KO) mutants (An∆pmtA, An∆pmtB, and An∆pmtC). An∆pmtA was resistant to both defensins, while An∆pmtC was resistant to NaD 2 only, suggesting NaD 1 and NaD 2 are unlikely to have a general interaction with O-linked side chains. Further evidence of this difference in the antifungal mechanism was provided by the dissimilarity of the NaD 1 and NaD 2 sensitivities of the Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) signalling knockout mutants from the cell wall integrity (CWI) and high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.

40|$|The stigmas of the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> plant Nicotiana alata {{accumulate}} {{large quantities}} {{of a series of}} 6 -kD proteinase inhibitors (PIs) in the central vacuole that are derived from a 40 -kD precursor protein, Na-PI. The sorting information that directs Na-PI to the vacuole is likely to reside in a C-terminal propeptide domain of 25 amino acids that forms an amphipathic � helix. Using cell fractionation techniques, we have examined transit of Na-PI through the endomembrane system and have identified a prevacuolar compartment that contains Na-PI with an intact targeting signal. In contrast, the targeting signal is not present on the predominant form of Na-PI in the vacuole. The prevacuolar compartment is marked by the presence of homologs of both the t-SNARE, PEP 12 p, and the putative vacuolar sorting receptor BP- 80. Cross-linking and affinity precipitation studies revealed that Na-PI associates with BP- 80 within this compartment, providing in vivo evidence for the function of BP- 80 as a sorting receptor for a protein with a C-terminal vacuolar targeting signal...|$|E
40|$|A gene {{encoding}} a 40. 3 -kDa serine {{proteinase inhibitor}} (PI) precursor is expressed {{at high levels}} in the stigma of the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco,</b> Nicotiana alata. The precursor is processed proteolytically in vivo to release five homologous proteinase inhibitors of approximately 6 kDa, {{as well as two}} flanking peptides. The five PIs have been purified from stigmas and identified by N-terminal sequencing, electrospray mass spectrometry and inhibition activity against chymotrypsin or trypsin. One of the PIs inhibits chymotrypsin and the other four are most active on trypsin. Cleavage occurs in a linker region (EEKKND) that is repeated six times in the precursor molecule. In the plant, the initial cleavage probably occurs between asparagine and the aspartate residues and ragged ends are formed by subsequent trimming. In vitro, the protease-sensitive linker region is selectively cleaved by the endoproteinases Asp-N, Glu-C and Lys-C to release fully active approximately 6 -kDa PIs that are resistant to further proteolytic digestion. The precursor, produced by a recombinant baculovirus, inhibits chymotrypsin more effectively than trypsin. The stoichiometry of 2. 6 trypsin molecules/ 1 precursor molecule indicates that processing is required to activate or expose all of the four trypsin inhibitory sites...|$|E
40|$|Potato type I and II serine {{protease}} inhibitors {{are produced by}} solanaceous plants as a defense mechanism against insects and microbes. Nicotiana alata proteinase inhibitor (NaPI) is a multidomain potato type II inhibitor (pin II) that is produced at high levels in the female reproductive tissues of the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco,</b> Nicotiana alata. The individual inhibitory domains of NaPI target the major classes of digestive enzymes, trypsin and chymotrypsin, in the gut of lepidopteran larval pests. Although consumption of NaPI dramatically reduced the growth and development of a major insect pest, Helicoverpa punctigera, we discovered that surviving larvae had high levels of chymotrypsin activity resistant to inhibition by NaPI. We found a potato type I inhibitor, Solanum tuberosum potato type I inhibitor (StPin 1 A), was a strong inhibitor of the NaPI-resistant chymotrypsin activity. The combined inhibitory effect of NaPI and StPin 1 A on H. armigera larval growth in the laboratory {{was reflected in the}} increased yield of cotton bolls in field trials of transgenic plants expressing both inhibitors. Better crop protection thus is achieved using combinations of inhibitors in which one class of proteinase inhibitor is used to match the genetic capacity of an insect to adapt to a second class of proteinase inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{requiring}} {{an insect}} pollinator often produce nectar {{as a reward}} for the pollinator 2 ̆ 7 s visitations. This rich secretion needs mechanisms to inhibit microbial growth. In Nicotiana spp. nectar, anti-microbial activity is due to the production of hydrogen peroxide. In a close relative, Petunia hybrida, limited production of hydrogen peroxide was found; yet petunia nectar still has anti-bacterial properties, suggesting that a different mechanism may exist for this inhibition. The nectar proteins of petunia plants were compared with those of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> and significant differences were found in protein profiles and function between these two closely related species. Among those proteins, RNase activities unique to petunia nectar were identified. The genes corresponding to four RNase T 2 proteins from Petunia hybrida that show unique expression patterns in different plant tissues were cloned. Two of these enzymes, RNase Phy 3 and RNase Phy 4 are unique among the T 2 family and contain characteristics similar to both S- and S-like RNases. Analysis of amino acid patterns suggest that these proteins are an intermediate between S- and S-like RNases, and support the hypothesis that S-RNases evolved from defence RNases expressed in floral parts.

Three different approaches {{have been used to}} assess the potential of these proteinase inhibitors (PIs) in insect control. The first was an in-vitro approach in which all five inhibitors, the single chymotrypsin inhibitor or three of the four trypsin inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit gut protease activity in insects from four orders. The second approach was to incorporate the N. alata PIs in the artificial diet of the native budworm (Helicoverpa punctigera) and the black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus). H. punctigera larvae and T. commodus nymphs had a significant (P< 0. 01) reduction in growth after ingestion of the PI and were more lethargic than insects on the control diet. Several of the H. punctigera larvae also failed to complete moulting at the third or fourth instar. The third approach was to express the N. alata PIs in transgenic tobacco {{under the control of the}} 35 S CaMV promoter. When H. punctigera larvae were fed tobacco leaves expressing the N. alata PIs at 0. 2 % soluble protein, significant (P< 0. 01) differences in mortality and/or growth rate were observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{flowers of}} the solanaceous plants <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana alata) and petunia (Petunia hybrida) produce {{high levels of}} defensins {{during the early stages}} of development. In {{contrast}} to the well-described seed defensins, these floral defensins are produced as precursors with C-terminal prodomains of 27 to 33 amino acids in addition to a typical secretion signal peptide and central defensin domain of 47 or 49 amino acids. Defensins isolated from N. alata and petunia flowers lack the C-terminal domain, suggesting that it is removed during or after transit through the secretory pathway. Immunogold electron microscopy has been used to demonstrate that the N. alata defensin is deposited in the vacuole. In addition to the eight canonical cysteine residues that define the plant defensin family, the two petunia defensins have an extra pair of cysteines that form a fifth disulfide bond and hence define a new subclass of this family of proteins. Expression of the N. alata defensin NaD 1 is predominantly flower specific and is most active during the early stages of flower development. NaD 1 transcripts accumulate in the outermost cell layers of petals, sepals, anthers, and styles, consistent with a role in protection of the reproductive organs against potential pathogens. The floral defensins inhibit the growth of Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium oxysporum in vitro, providing further support for a role in protection of floral tissues against pathogen invasion...|$|E
40|$|A {{small set}} of proteins, termed Nectarins, are {{secreted}} into the nectar of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana langsdorffii x Nicotiana sanderae). The most highly expressed protein, Nectarin I (29 kD monomer), was originally {{identified as a}} germin-like protein (GLP) of unknown function. This remarkably stable protein was later shown to possess manganese dependent superoxide dismutase activity. Hydrogen peroxide, the product of SOD activity, was found to accumulate in nectar at levels up to 4 mM. The promoter (1. 2 kb) of the Nectarin I gene was fused to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) and shown to be expressed in mature nectary tissues only at times when nectar is actively being secreted.;Nectarin II (35 kD) {{was identified as a}} dioscorin-like protein and found to be a degradation product of Nectarin III (40 kD). These proteins were shown to posses monodehydroascorbate reductase and carbonic anhydrase activity. Nectarin V (~ 65 kD) was identified as a berberine bridge enzyme-like protein and found to contain a covalently bound molecule of FAD. Both Nectarin III and Nectarin V shared very similar expression patterns with those of Nectarin I.;The hypothesis of this work is that nectar proteins are secreted into nectar to maintain an axenic state and to protect the developing gynoecium from microbial attack and oxidative damage. Specifically, the proposed functions of these nectar proteins include: the production of hydrogen peroxide for floral defense, maintenance of nectar pH, and maintenance of ascorbate levels in nectar...|$|E
40|$|Plants secrete nectar {{to attract}} mutualistic animals, which {{predominantly}} function as pollinators, {{as in the}} case of floral nectar, or defenders against herbivores, {{as in the case}} of extrafloral nectar (Nicolson et al., 2007). Because nectars usually represent aqueous solutions containing sugars and other nutrient metabolites (Baker and Baker, 1983), they are susceptible to infestation by microbial organisms, which can use the nectar-secreting tissues as entry sites to infect the plant. Nectar-secreting tissues thus require an efficient shield against pathogen infections. To date, our knowledge about the way that plants protect their nectar from microorganisms is rather limited. Several reports have focused on ‘defensive chemicals’, such as alkaloids and phenols, or a defense system based on proteins named nectarins (cf. Escalante—Pérez and Heil, 2012). In floral nectar of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco,</b> nectarins have been associated with a so-called ‘nectar redox cycle’. In this system, the production of high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides for microbe-free nectar. In addition to the nectarins, hydrolytic enzymes such as ribonucleases, peroxidases, chitinases, glucanases, and other pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were discovered in both floral and extrafloral nectars (for review, see Escalante—Pérez and Heil, 2012). To study the blend of antimicrobial proteins active in poplar extrafloral nectaries, we investigated the secretome and transcriptome of this organ. Thereby, we discovered a set of defense proteins that proved to be effective against a plant and human pathogenic fungus and thus could serve pharmaceutical purposes...|$|E
40|$|Nectars {{are rich}} in primary {{metabolites}} and attract mutualistic animals, which serve as pollinators or as an indirect defense against herbivores. Their chemical composition makes nectars prone to microbial infestation. As protective strategy, floral nectar of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana langsdorffii × Nicotiana sanderae) contains “nectarins,” proteins producing reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. By contrast, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were detected in Acacia extrafloral nectar (EFN), which is secreted {{in the context of}} defensive ant-plant mutualisms. We investigated whether these PR proteins protect EFN from phytopathogens. Five sympatric species (Acacia cornigera, A. hindsii, A. collinsii, A. farnesiana, and Prosopis juliflora) were compared that differ in their ant-plant mutualism. EFN of myrmecophytes, which are obligate ant-plants that secrete EFN constitutively to nourish specialized ant inhabitants, significantly inhibited the growth of four out of six tested phytopathogenic microorganisms. By contrast, EFN of nonmyrmecophytes, which is secreted only transiently in response to herbivory, did not exhibit a detectable inhibitory activity. Combining two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that PR proteins represented over 90 % of all proteins in myrmecophyte EFN. The inhibition of microbial growth was exerted by the protein fraction, but not the small metabolites of this EFN, and disappeared when nectar was heated. In-gel assays demonstrated the activity of acidic and basic chitinases in all EFNs, whereas glucanases were detected only in EFN of myrmecophytes. Our results demonstrate that PR proteins causally underlie the protection of Acacia EFN from microorganisms and that acidic and basic glucanases likely represent the most important prerequisite in this defensive function...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> (Nicotiana langsdorffii X N. sanderae) secretes {{a limited}} array of {{proteins}} (nectarins) into its floral nectar. Careful sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of tobacco nectar {{revealed that a}} broad protein band from 61 to 65 kD actually consists of five discrete protein bands. N-terminal sequencing and tryptic peptide mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis demonstrated that the upper three bands are isoforms of the same protein, NEC 5 (Nectarin V), whereas the lower two bands, NEC 4 (Nectarin IV), are {{related to each other}} but not to NEC 5. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based upon N-terminal sequence of NEC 5 generated a short cDNA that encoded the N terminus of the NEC 5 protein. Two rounds of inverse-PCR using genomic DNA permitted the isolation of approximately one-half of the coding region of the nec 5 gene along with 787 nucleotides of the 5 ′-flanking region. This DNA fragment was used as a probe to isolate a near full-length nec 5 clone from a nectary-derived cDNA library. BLAST analysis identified the nec 5 cDNA as a berberine bridge enzyme-like protein. Approximately 40 % of the cDNA sequence corresponded to peptides that were identified by tryptic peptide mass spectrometry fingerprint analysis of the NEC 5 protein, thereby confirming that this cDNA encoded the NEC 5 protein. In-gel assays also demonstrated that NEC 5 contains a covalently linked flavin, and it possesses glucose oxidase activity. RT-PCR-based expression analyses showed that nec 5 expression is limited exclusively to the nectary gland during late stages of floral development...|$|E
40|$|The walls {{deposited}} {{by growing}} pollen tubes contain {{two types of}} β-glucan, the (1, 3) -β-glucan callose and the (1, 4) -β-glucan cellulose, as well as various α-linked pectic polysaccharides. Pollen tubes of Nicotiana alata Link et Otto, an <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco,</b> were therefore used to identify genes potentially encoding catalytic subunits of the callose synthase and cellulose synthase enzymes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with pollen-tube RNA and primers designed to conserved regions of bacterial and plant cellulose synthase (CesA) genes amplified a fragment that corresponded to an abundantly expressed cellulose-synthase-like gene named NaCslD 1. A fragment from a true CesA gene (NaCesA 1) was also amplified, but corresponding cDNAs could not be identified in a pollen-tube library, consistent with the very low level of expression of the NaCesA 1 gene. RT-PCR with pollen-tube RNA and primers designed to regions conserved between the fungal FKS genes [that encode (1, 3) -β-glucan synthases] and their presumed plant homologs (the Gsl or glucan-synthase-like genes) amplified a fragment that corresponded to an abundantly expressed gene named NaGsl 1. A second Gsl gene detected by RT-PCR (NaGsl 2) was expressed at low levels in immature floral organs. The structure of full-length cDNAs of NaCslD 1, NaCesA 1, and NaGsl 1 are presented. Both NaCslD 1 and NaGsl 1 are predominantly expressed in the male gametophyte (developing and mature pollen and growing pollen tubes), and we propose that they encode the catalytic subunits of two β-glucan synthases involved in pollen-tube wall synthesis. Different β-glucans deposited in one cell type may therefore be synthesized by enzymes from different gene families...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structures of}} a series of 6 -kDa trypsin inhibitors isolated from the stigma of the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> Nicotiana alata have been determined by H- 1 NMR spectroscopy combined with simulated annealing calculations. The proteins, T 1 -T 4, are proteolytically cleaved from a 40. 3 -kDa precursor protein, NA-proPI, together with a chymotrypsin inhibitor, C 1, the structure of which was reported recently [Nielsen, K. J., Heath, R. L., Anderson, M. A., & Craik, D. J. (1994) J. Mel. Biol. 242, 231 - 243]. Each of the proteinase inhibitors comprises 53 amino acids, including 8 cysteine residues which are linked to form 4 disulfide bridges. The proteins have a high degree of sequence identity and differ mainly in residues around the putative reactive sites. The structure of T 1 was determined using a set of 533 interproton distance restraints derived from NOESY spectra, combined with 33 dihedral restraints derived from (3) J(NH-H alpha) coupling constants and 16 hydrogen bonds. The structures of the remaining inhibitors (T 2 -T 4) were deduced to be almost identical to T 1, {{on the basis of their}} similar chemical shifts and 2 D spectra. The current study demonstrates that the structures of the trypsin inhibitors (T 1 -T 4) are similar to that previously found for the chymotrypsin inhibitor, C 1. Despite differences in sequence, there is conservation in backbone geometry between the reactive site loops of the two classes of inhibitors. From this, it is clear that the nature of the side chain on the primary binding residue, rather than the backbone fold, is the main determinant of the enzyme specificities of these proteinase inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|NA-proPI is a 40. 3 -kDa multidomain {{precursor}} protein {{found in the}} stigma of the <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> Nicotiana alata, It is selectively targeted to the vacuole and, as the plant matures, is processed to produce a series of five 6 -kDa proteinase inhibitors (one chymotrypsin and four trypsin reactive sites) which are thought to {{play a vital role}} in plant protection against insect pests. A putative sixth domain with a chymotrypsin reactive site is likely to be formed by three disulfide bridges linking the N- and C-terminal fragments of NA-proPI, This domain contains two distinct structural elements: a 54 -residue sequence with high identity to each of the five repeated PI domains, and a nonrepeated 25 -residue sequence at the C-terminus which is proposed to contain a vacuolar targeting peptide. The structure of the putative sixth domain was predicted using a combination of secondary structure prediction and homology modeling based on the known structure of one of the intact domains. A 26 -residue peptide corresponding to the nonrepeated C-terminal sequence and encompassing the putative vacuolar targeting sequence was synthesized and its structure determined using H- 1 NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations, The peptide was found to adopt an amphipathic helical structure. The calculations based on NOE data suggested that the helix is curved, with a hydrophobic concave face and a hydrophilic convex face. This curvature is consistent with an observed periodicity in backbone NH chemical shifts. The structure of the entire sixth domain was modeled by combining the experimentally determined structure of the putative vacuolar targeting peptide with the homology model of the PI domain. In this model the alpha-helix of the putative targeting peptide protrudes from the otherwise compact PI domain. This observation is consistent with the requirement for targeting sequences to be relatively exposed for recognition by the sorting apparatus. As there is no consensus on the structure of vacuolar targeting sequences, this study provides a valuable insight into their potential mechanism of interaction with the cellular sorting apparatus...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} and characterized the Nectarin IV (NEC 4) protein that accumulates in the nectar of <b>ornamental</b> <b>tobacco</b> plants (Nicotiana langsdorffii × Nicotiana sanderae var LxS 8). This 60 -kD protein has a blocked N terminus. Three tryptic peptides of the protein were {{isolated and}} sequenced using tandem mass spectroscopy. These unique peptides {{were found to}} be similar to the xyloglucan-specific fungal endoglucanase inhibitor protein (XEGIP) precursor in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and its homolog in potato (Solanum tuberosum). A pair of oligonucleotide primers was designed based on the potato and tomato sequences that were used to clone a 1, 018 -bp internal piece of nec 4 cDNA from a stage 6 nectary cDNA library. The remaining portions of the cDNA were subsequently captured by 5 ′ and 3 ′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Complete sequencing of the nec 4 cDNA demonstrated that it belonged to a large family of homologous proteins {{from a wide variety of}} angiosperms. Related proteins include foliage proteins and seed storage proteins. Based upon conserved identity with the wheat (Triticum aestivum) xylanase inhibitor TAXI- 1, we were able to develop a protein model that showed that NEC 4 contains additional amino acid loops that are not found in TAXI- 1 and that glycosylation sites are surface exposed. Both these loops and sites of glycosylation are on the opposite face of the NEC 4 molecule from the site that interacts with fungal hemicellulases, as indicated by homology to TAXI-I. NEC 4 also contains a region homologous to the TAXI- 1 knottin domain; however, a deletion in this domain restructures the disulfide bridges of this domain, resulting in a pseudoknottin domain. Inhibition assays were performed to determine whether purified NEC 4 was able to inhibit fungal endoglucanases and xylanases. These studies showed that NEC 4 was a very effective inhibitor of a family GH 12 xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase with a Ki of 0. 35 nm. However, no inhibitory activity was observed against other family GH 10 or GH 11 xylanases. The patterns of expression of the NEC 4 protein indicate that, while expressed in nectar at anthesis, it is most strongly expressed in the nectary gland after fertilization, indicating that inhibition of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes may be more important after fertilization than before...|$|E
