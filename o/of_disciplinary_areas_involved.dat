40|$|DoIT's Academic Technology and the UW-Madison Library's Office of Scholarly Communication and Publishing {{conducted}} {{discussion group}} meetings with invited participants representing {{a broad spectrum}} of faculty and administrative interests, focusing on digital asset management in the context of evolving technology-driven forms of scholarship, the reassessment of traditional dichotomies between pedagogy and research, and rising tension between central and distributed IT. Participant feedback provided insight into several problem areas, highlighting that attempts by DoIT to assist digital resource management must take into account problems with current institutional focus and resource allocation; that the loss of the culture of curatorship in the transition to a digital scholarly record severely threatens the preservation of institutional memory; and that adoption of solutions depends upon the implementation of trusted, comprehensive, interfederated identity management and access control. To address these concerns, DoIT should promote emerging open access paradigms in publication and the open data movement in research, collaborating with campus partners to provide encouragement and education in order to promote the growth of the new culture of digital curatorship. Further, DoIT should support emerging cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional social networks, providing liaison functions and facilitating coordination between potential partners, discovering opportunities for collaboration, and providing resources to seed their growth. This activity should take place in partnership with distributed IT staff, developing solutions and services that directly address the needs <b>of</b> their <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas,</b> and <b>Involving</b> them directly through shared decision-making and collaborative work. Developed solutions should emphasize integration and interoperability as primary characteristics. Finally, DoIT should adopt open, standards-based identity management and access control mechanisms that support interfederation of credentials and access control policies.

40|$|Introduction In this blog, we analyse ‘pathways to impact’ {{in grant}} {{applications}} {{that led to}} the top scoring impact case studies in the latest UK assessment of research excellence and impact (REF 2014). It is easy to find the top scoring case studies, and straight-forward enough to find good examples of pathways to impact, {{but this is the first}} time that pathways have been paired with high-scoring case studies. To do this, we contacted those responsible for the majority of impact case studies we could identify that scored the highest grade (4 *) in REF 2014, and asked if they would allow us to share their pathways to impact. In our analysis, we have identified elements that pathways to winning impact case studies have in common, from a wide range <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas.</b> In doing so, we provide suggestions that complement official guidance on writing ‘pathways to impact’ and can help you develop a pathway to significant and far-reaching impacts.  ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} five {{interdisciplinary}} case studies that explore academic value systems as they influence publishing behavior {{and attitudes of}} University of California, Berkeley faculty. The case studies are based on direct interviews with relevant stakeholders—faculty, advancement reviewers, librarians, and editors—in five fields: chemical engineering, anthropology, law and economics, English-language literature, and biostatistics. The {{results of the study}} strongly confirm the vital role of peer review in faculty attitudes and actual publishing behavior. There is much more experimentation, however, with regard to means of in-progress communication, where single means of publication and communication are not fixed so deeply in values and tradition as they are for final, archival publication. We conclude that approaches that try to "move" faculty and deeply embedded value systems directly toward new forms of archival, "final" publication are destined largely to failure in the short-term. From our perspective, a more promising route is to (1) examine the needs of scholarly researchers for both final and in-progress communications, and (2) determine how those needs are likely to influence future scenarios in a range <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{major theme}} of the {{following}} discussion {{is the importance of}} a transdisciplinary approach to guide sustainability-related planning and management activities. The proposed approach involves much more than the usual interaction between partners from different disciplines. A revised process is needed to allow real cooperation in sustainability planning. This process will require a more open recognition of the subjective priorities that become the framework of sustainable development issues of various interest groups and disciplines. The sustainable development agenda should be more geared towards learning processes than projected future outcomes. Learning is enhanced through a participatory framework inclusive of stakeholder interests. Insights from a broad range <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas</b> including the science of complexity, sociology, philosophy, law, economics and management are presented to support this position. The conventional stranglehold <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> thinking in policy circles limits the capacity of our decision makers to unravel the complexity of all real world environmental policy and management problems. Policy making needs to embody respect for that complexity and allow flexibility to promote perpetually evolving learning. As a fundamentally transdisciplinary framework, ecological economics has some prospect to represent these interests in a purposeful and necessarily pragmatic way. © 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Ethical {{consumerism}} {{is on the}} rise. No longer {{bound to}} the counter-cultural fringes, ethical concerns and practices are reaching {{into the mainstream of}} society and being adopted by everyday consumers – from considering carbon miles to purchasing free-range eggs to making renewable energy choices. The wide reach and magnitude of ethical issues in society across individual and collective consumption has given rise to a series of important questions that are inspiring scholars from a range <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas.</b> These differing <b>disciplinary</b> lenses, however, tend to be contained in separate streams of research literature that are developing in parallel and in relative isolation. Ethics in Morality and Consumption takes an interdisciplinary perspective to provide multiple vantage points in creating a more holistic and integrated view of ethics in consumption. In this sense, interdisciplinary presupposes the consideration of multiple and distinct disciplines, which in this book are considered in delineated chapters. In addition, the Editors make an editorial contribution in the final chapter of the book by combining these separate disciplinary perspectives to develop a nascent interdisciplinary perspective that integrates these perspectives and presents platforms for further research...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability can be {{manifested}} {{in a number}} of ways at universities and on university campuses. Opportunities to promote sustainability and to meet societies aspirations for improved environmental management and reduced ecological impacts are available to universities through the mediums of research, teaching, facility operations, and community engagement. The considerable learning resources that exist within universities provide impetus for the institution and the individual to take leading roles in improved environmental outcomes, both in facility development and management on the university campus, and in external activities. In the field of research, universities and other higher education centres play key roles in advancing sustainability through research and development programs addressing societal problems and needs (e. g. the effects of climate change on crop production; solar power generation for dwellings). This is often achieved through collaborative research programs involving academic institutions, industry bodies and government agencies (e. g. The Australian Government's Cooperative Research Centres program). Interdisciplinary research approaches are vital to unlocking otherwise intractable problems by integrating diverse conceptual understanding from a number <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas</b> within the university.

40|$|Background: The {{concept of}} pedagogic frailty has been {{proposed}} as a unifying concept that may help to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvement within universities by helping to maintain a simultaneous focus on four key areas that are thought to impede development. Purpose: The variation in internal structure of the four dimensions of pedagogic frailty and the links that have been proposed to connect them are explored here through the analysis of interviews with academics working in a variety <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas.</b> Methods: The application of concept map-mediated interviews allows us to view the variable connections within and between these dimensions and the personal ways they are conceptualised by academics working across the heterogeneous university context. Results: The data show that academics conceptualise the discourse of teaching in various ways that have implications for the links that may be developed to integrate the elements within the model. Conclusions: Whilst the form {{and content of the}} maps representing dimensions of the pedagogic frailty model exhibit considerable variation, it is suggested that factors such as academic resilience and the explicit use of integrative concepts within disciplines may help to overcome some of the vulnerabilities that accompany pedagogic frailty. The data also raises questions about the links between factors that tend to be under individual control and those that tend towards institutional control...|$|R

40|$|This Journal of Electronic Publishing article {{summarizes}} CSHE research exploring academic {{value systems}} as they influence publishing behavior {{and attitudes of}} University of California, Berkeley faculty. It derives from five disciplinary case studies developed from direct interviews with relevant stakeholders [...] faculty, advancement reviewers, librarians, and editors [...] in five fields: chemical engineering, anthropology, law and economics, English-language literature, and biostatistics. The {{results of the study}} strongly confirm the vital role of peer review in the choices faculty make regarding their publishing behavior. The perceptions and realities of the reward system keep faculty strongly adhered to conventional, high-stature print publications (and their electronic surrogates) as the means of reporting research and having it institutionally evaluated. Perceptions of electronic-only publications are frequently negative because those venues are considered to lack strong peer review and are, consequently, believed to be of relatively lower quality. There is much more experimentation, however, with regard to means of in-progress communication, where single means of publication and communication are not fixed so deeply in values and tradition as they are for final, archival publication. We conclude that approaches that try to "move" faculty and deeply embedded value systems directly toward new forms of archival, "final" publication are destined largely to failure in the short-term.

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{trajectory of}} building institutional research performance mirrors {{the trajectory of}} individual research careers. An increase in the volume of research activity precedes a more mature phase when work of high quality and impact is generated which attracts attention from international peers resulting in {{the opportunity to develop}} international collaborations, highly cited outputs and associated awards and public recognition. Research evaluation frameworks such as Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) focus appropriately on measuring the ‘destination’ of a research trajectory- world class performance in disciplinary fields. As would be expected, in the most recent ERA exercise, there is a clear relationship between the age of Australian institutions and the number <b>of</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas</b> in those institutions assessed as being of world standard or above. In this context, it is important for institutions to determine whether they are ‘hitting above their weight’ and are on an upward trajectory in terms of research performance relative to their institutional age. Thus ERA outcomes, in combination with a dashboard of other research performance measures can inform institutions of the effectiveness of their research strategy. The major limitation of ERA, however, is the long shadow cast by the 6 year reference period – the length of the reference period necessarily limits the usefulness of the outcomes for those younger institutions which are rapidly growing their research capacity, activity and quality ‘in real time’. This is of particular relevance in Australia where the median age of universities is around 24 years and where the future of Australia’s research capacity will reside in the growth of high quality research in those institutions which are currently ‘market challengers 2 ̆ 7...|$|R
