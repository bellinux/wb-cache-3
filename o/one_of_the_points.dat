5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has important parts constructed in several different centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent the propeller to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with the propeller design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E

5|$|Voronoi or Dirichlet tilings are tessellations {{where each}} tile {{is defined as}} the set of points closest to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> in a {{discrete}} set of defining points. (Think of geographical regions where each region is defined as all the points closest to a given city or post office.) The Voronoi cell for each defining point is a convex polygon. The Delaunay triangulation is a tessellation that is the dual graph of a Voronoi tessellation. Delaunay triangulations are useful in numerical simulation, in part because among all possible triangulations of the defining points, Delaunay triangulations maximize the minimum of the angles formed by the edges. Voronoi tilings with randomly placed points can be used to construct random tilings of the plane.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian Armed Forces {{were aware}} of the {{strategic}} importance of the Rogaland region, where Egersund is located, and in 1939 decided to change the war plans for the local 8th Infantry Regiment. The 8th Infantry Regiment had been intended to move to the Kristiansand in case of a mobilization, plans which in 1939 were changed to the regiment to instead focus on the defence of the Rogaland region. As Egersund was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> where potential landings were feared, Årstaddalen near the town of Egersund was chosen as the mobilization area for two companies of landvern soldiers, and a supply depot established there.|$|E

25|$|It {{may seem}} {{paradoxical}} that the Air Force changed opinion {{on nuclear weapons}} given {{the expansion of the}} relative importance of the US Air Force following America's adoption of nuclear weapons. At the time, however, the Air Force was facing an expensive acquisition of the Saab 37 Viggen, and feared that a full-scale nuclear weapons program would compete with it for resources. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> that Norén wanted to investigate was what conventional forces Sweden could acquire if it decided not to develop nuclear weapons. It should be noted that it was the plan that the United States suggested Sweden to follow in 1960.

25|$|The first {{investments}} in road infrastructure {{have given up}} in the 1920s, the government of Washington Luis, being pursued in the governments of Getúlio Vargas and Eurico Gaspar Dutra. President Juscelino Kubitschek (1956–61), who designed and built the capital Brasília, was another supporter of highways. Kubitschek {{was responsible for the}} installation of major car manufacturers in the country (Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors arrived in Brazil during his rule) and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> used to attract them was, of course, support for the construction of highways. With the implementation of Fiat in 1976 ending an automobile market closed loop, {{from the end of the}} 1990s the country has received large foreign direct {{investments in}}stalling in its territory other major car manufacturers and utilities, such as Iveco, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota among others.

25|$|This {{definition}} for addition works {{except in a}} few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is when <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> is O. Here, we define P + O = P = O + P, making O {{the identity of the}} group. Next, if P and Q are opposites of each other, we define P + Q = O. Lastly, if P = Q we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point R and we can take its opposite. However, if P happens to be an inflection point (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take R to be P itself and P + P is simply the point opposite itself.|$|E

25|$|Rapid City's {{location}} on the boundary of the Western and Eastern power grids, together with the hydroelectric plants of the Mainstem Dams on the Missouri River and the large coal fields and power plants of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming make it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> where the two national power grids connect with each other, allowing switching of electrical power {{from east to west}} and vice versa. Rapid City previously had its own coal-fired power plant before Federal regulations forced it and many other coal plants in the area such as power stations near Gillette, Wyoming, to shut down. The Ben French power station located within city boundaries shut down September 2012, more than 2 years ahead of its scheduled shut down. Rapid City now obtains much of its power from both the Missouri dams and importing it from elsewhere. Electrical rates used to be considered relatively low until the shut down of the coal plants, so have progressively climbed the last several years as a lack of local power sources means massive expenses to import it from greater distances.|$|E
25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, {{and became one of}} his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|E

500|$|The {{location}} of the star's five points is determined by an imaginary disk centered on the star's center, its diameter equal to roughly 15% {{the length of the}} flag.

The star is surrounded on its left by a red crescent made by the intersection of two arcs, an outer arc whose diameter is equal to one-fourth of the length of the flag, and an internal arc with a diameter equal to one-fifth of the flag's length. In addition, at the top of the flag used by the President of the Republic, the words [...] "for the nation" [...] (...) are written in gold.

Even William IV (in his last recorded utterance) thought the building a [...] "nasty little pokey hole", while William Makepeace Thackeray called it [...] "a little gin shop of a building". The twentieth-century architectural historian Sir John Summerson echoed these early criticisms when he compared the arrangement of a dome and two diminutive turrets on the roofline to [...] "the clock and vases on a mantelpiece, only less useful". Sir Charles Barry's landscaping of Trafalgar Square, from 1840, included a north terrace so that the building would appear to be raised, thus addressing <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> of complaint.

500|$|Maken X {{was first}} {{announced}} in November 1998. Maken X {{was published by}} Atlus on November 25, 1999. While Atlus' earlier Megami Tensei titles were aimed fully at the Japanese market, Maken X had been designed from the outset to have an international appeal. Voice recording for the international release took place in North America. Meguro {{was involved in this}} process, which he remembered as a positive experience. The localization was handled cooperatively by Atlus and the American branch of Sega, who acted as the game's publishers. The game's international release was announced in February 2000. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> Atlus was concerned about for the international version was the use of Nazi imagery for some enemies. Due to what were described as [...] "cultural points that could be harmful", the game's graphics were altered for the international release to avoid controversy. The gameplay remained unchanged between versions. Kaneko described the voice recording as {{the most difficult part of}} the localization. Initially scheduled for release in March, the game was pushed forward into April for unspecified reasons, although it was speculated that it was due to that month already boasting several game releases. Maken X was eventually released in North America on April 26, 2000. In Europe, the game was released on July 7 of that year.|$|E
