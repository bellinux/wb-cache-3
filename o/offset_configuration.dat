40|$|In {{cultures}} of normal rat hepatocytes, isolated by collagenase perfusion, formation of junctions started 4 — 7 h after seeding. The junctional complexes were localized at two preferential {{sites of the}} contiguous membrane: apically and {{on both sides of}} open spaces with microvilli at some distance from the free upper surface. The domains of early contact formation are charac{erized by a flattening of the membranes, a decrease in intercellular space, a depletion of intramembrane particles (IMPs) and a concentration of electron-dense and of fine fibrillar material in the cytoplasm immediately adjacent to the mem-brane. We were able to demonstrate the presence of cholesterol in these domains by formation of cholesterol-filipin complexes that deformed the membrane. However, membrane-deformation in these domains was often inhibited. This inhibition appeared to be due to the presence of pepsin-sensitive material, since full deformation was induced after mild proteolysis.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this deliverable is to describe the expected influence of the candidate test procedures developed in FIMCAR for frontal impact on other impact types. The other impact types of primary interest are front-to-side impacts, collisions with road restraint systems (e. g. guardrails), and heavy goods vehicle impacts. These collision types were chosen as they involve structures that {{can be adapted to}} improve safety. Collisions with vulnerable road users (VRU) were not explicitly investigated in FIMCAR. It is expected that the vehicle structures of interest in FIMCAR can be designed into a VRU friendly shell. Information used for this deliverable comes from simulations and car-to-car crash tests conducted in FIMCAR or review of previous research. Three test configurations (full width, offset, and moving deformable barriers) were the input to the FIMCAR selection process. There are three different types of offset tests and two different full width tests. During the project test procedures could be divided into three groups that provide different influences or outcomes on vehicle designs: 1. The ODB barrier provides a method to assess part of the vehicles energy absorption capabilities and compartment test in one test 2. The FWRB and FWDB have similar capabilities to control structural alignment, further assess energy absorption capabilities, and promote the improvements in the occupant restraint system for high deceleration impacts. 3. The PDB and MPDB can be used to promote better load spreading in the vehicle structures, in addition to assessing energy absorption and occupant compartment strength in an <b>offset</b> <b>configuration.</b> The consortium selected the ODB and FWDB as the two best candidates for short term application in international rulemaking.

The bearing uses leading-edge-groove lubrication {{and has the}} following characteristics: 5 -pads, 101. 6 mm (4. 0 in) nominal diameter,. 0814 -. 0837 mm (. 0032 -. 0033 in) radial bearing clearance,. 25 to. 27 preload, 60. 325 mm (2. 375 in) axial pad length. Operating conditions included loads from 0 to 3101 kPa (450 psi) and speeds from 7 to 16 krpm. Dynamic tests were conducted over a range of frequencies to obtain complex dynamic stiffness coefficients as functions of excitation frequency. For most test conditions, the direct real dynamic stiffnesses were well fitted with a quadratic function with respect to frequency. This curve fit allowed for the stiffness frequency dependency to be captured by including an added mass matrix [M] to a conventional [K][C] model, producing a frequency independent [K][C][M] model. The direct imaginary dynamic stiffness coefficients increased linearly with frequency, producing frequency independent direct damping coefficients. Compared to the 50 percent offset, the 60 percent offset configuration?s direct stiffness coefficients were larger at light unit loads. At high loads, the 50 percent <b>offset</b> <b>configuration</b> had a larger direct stiffness in the loaded direction. Negative direct added-mass coefficients were regularly obtained for both offsets, especially in the unloaded direction. Added-mass magnitudes were below 32 kg for all test cases. No appreciable difference was measured in direct damping coefficients for both pivot offset. A bulk-flow Navier-Stokes CFD code provided rotordynamic coefficient predictions. The following stiffness and damping prediction trends were observed for both 50 and 60 percent offsets. The direct stiffness coefficients were modeled well at light loads and became increasingly over-predicted with increasing unit load. Stiffness orthotropy was measured at zero and light load conditions that was not predicted. Direct damping predictions in the loaded direction increased significantly with unit load while the experimental direct damping coefficients remained constant with load. The direct damping coefficients were reasonably modeled only at the highest test speed of 16 krpm. Experimental cross-coupled stiffness coefficients were larger than predicted for both offsets, but were of the same sign and considerably smaller than the direct coefficients...|$|E
40|$|Water lost through leaks can {{represent}} high percentages {{of the total}} production in water supply systems and constitutes an important issue. Leak detection can be tackled with various techniques such as the ground-penetrating radar (GPR). Based on this technology, various procedures have been elaborated to characterize a leak and its evolution. In this study, we focus on a new full-wave radar modelling approach for near-field conditions, which {{takes into account the}} antenna effects as well as the interactions between the antenna(s) and the medium through frequency-dependent global transmission and reflection coefficients. This approach is applied to layered media for which 3 -D Green’s functions can be calculated. The model allows for a quantitative estimation of the properties of multilayered media by using full-wave inversion. This method, however, proves to be limited to provide users with an on-demand assessment as it is generally computationally demanding and time consuming, depending on the medium configuration as well as the number of unknown parameters to retrieve. In that respect, we propose two leads in order to enhance the parameter retrieval step. The first one consists in analyzing the impact of the reduction of the number of frequencies on the information content. For both numerical and laboratory experiments, this operation has been achieved by investigating the response surface topography of objective functions arising from the comparison between measured and modelled data. The second one involves the numerical implementation of multistatic antenna configurations with constant and variable offsets in the model. These two kinds of analyses are then combined in numerical experiments to observe the conjugated effect of the number of frequencies and the <b>offset</b> <b>configuration.</b> To perform the numerical analyses, synthetic Green’s functions were simulated for different multilayered medium configurations. The results show that an antenna offset increase leads to an improvement in the response surface topography, which is more or less marked according to the initial information content. It also highlights the theoretical possibility of significantly reducing the number of frequencies without degrading the information content. This last statement is confirmed with the laboratory experiment which incorporates measurements done with a Vivaldi antenna above a medium composed of one or more sand layers characterized by different water contents. As a conclusion, the offset and frequency analyses highlight the great potential of the model for improving the soil parameter retrieval while reducing the computation time for a given antenna(s) – medium configuration.

Tightening of the constraints on the siting of wind farms {{is likely to increase}} the scale of the problem in the future. The aerodynamic performance of turbine rotors and the mechanisms that couple the fluid dynamics of multiple rotors can be most readily understood by simplifying the problem and considering the interaction between only two rotors. The aerodynamic interaction between two rotors in both co-axial and <b>offset</b> <b>configurations</b> has been simulated using the Vorticity Transport Model. The aerodynamic interaction {{is a function of the}} tip speed ratio, and both the streamwise and crosswind separation between the rotors. The simulations show that the momentum deficit at a turbine operating within the wake developed by the rotor of a second turbine is governed by the development of instabilities within the wake of the upwind rotor, and the ensuing structure of the wake as it impinges on the downwind rotor. If the wind farm configuration or wind conditions are such that a turbine rotor is subject to partial impingement by the wake produced by an upstream turbine, then significant unsteadiness in the aerodynamic loading on the rotor blades of the downwind turbine can result, and this unsteadiness can have considerable implications for the fatigue life of the blade structure and rotor hub...|$|R

Uncemented PROMOS ® reverse shoulder prostheses were implanted in eight human cadaveric shoulder specimens. Passive range of motion was evaluated with a robot-assisted shoulder simulator. Three movements were tested: abduction, ante-rior elevation and external rotation. Each specimen was tested with a customary reverse humeral component and two eccentric components with 3 and 6 mm of posterior offset respectively. Mean abduction was 81 ° (standard deviation [SD] 12) for the customary reverse components, 81 ° (SD 13) for the 3 mm eccentric and 82 ° (SD 15) for 6 -mm eccentric implants. Mean anterior elevation was 68 ° (SD 13) in the regular group and 66 ° (SD 14) and 63 ° (SD 14) for 3 - and 6 -mm eccentric groups. With all config-urations, 90 ° of external rotation were achieved without requiring more than 2 N·m of applied rotational moment. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the conventional and the eccentric implants, anterior elevation was decreased by almost 20 ° in three of eight shoulders with the posterior <b>offset</b> <b>configurations.</b> This was due to a conflict between the proximal humerus and the anterior aspect of the acromion or the coracoid. Although eccentric humeral components can be useful in reverse shoulder arthroplasty to avoid anterior cortical defects in individuals with pronounced humeral head posterior offset, a potential conflict between proximal humerus and scapula may have an unfavourable effect on range of anterior elevation.

The exhaust system consisted of externally-mixed-convergent nozzles and an external plug. Bypass- and tertiary- to-core area ratios between 1. 0 and 2. 5, and 0. 4 and 1. 0, respectively, were studied. Axisymmetric and offset tertiary nozzles were investigated for heated and unheated conditions. For axisymmetric configurations, {{the addition of the}} third stream was found to reduce peak- and high-frequency acoustic levels in the peak-jet-noise direction, with greater reductions at the lower bypass-to-core area ratios. For the <b>offset</b> <b>configurations,</b> an <b>offset</b> duct was found to decrease acoustic levels on the thick side of the tertiary nozzle relative to those produced by the simulated two-stream jet with up to 8 dB mid-frequency noise reduction at large angles to the jet inlet axis. Noise reduction in the peak-jet-noise direction was greater for supersonic core speeds than for subsonic core speeds. The addition of a tertiary nozzle insert used to divert the third-stream jet {{to one side of the}} nozzle system provided no noise reduction. Noise predictions are presented for selected cases using a method based on an acoustic analogy with mean flow interaction effects accounted for using a Green's function, computed in terms of its coupled azimuthal modes for the offset cases, and a source model previously used for round and rectangular jets. Comparisons of the prediction results with data show that the noise model predicts the observed increase in low-frequency noise with the introduction of a third, axisymmetric stream, but not the high-frequency reduction. For an offset third stream, the model predicts the observed trend of decreased sound levels on the thick side of the jet compared with the thin side, but the predicted azimuthal variations are much less than those seen in the data. Also, the shift of the spectral peak to lower frequencies with increasing polar angle is over-predicted.

50|$|The Temple No. I is nirandhara shrine with bi-partite <b>offset</b> (dwi-anga) plan <b>configuration.</b> It is {{situated}} on east-facing jagati (plinth). The entrance mandapa is of prag-griva style with four pillars. The inner sanctum is square. The plinth has moldings of bhita and pattika. The circumvention path (pradakshina) {{is provided by}} space on the plinth. The outer walls of the shrine is devoid of ornamentation. The mandapa has phansana type roof and the latina type spire over the main shrine has elaborate bold jala pattern carvings. It is topped by large amalaka. The Temple No. II It has a phansana styled spire, not usual latina spire. The Temple No. III is almost similar to Temple No. I except its tri-partite <b>offset</b> (tri-anga) plan <b>configuration.</b> The Temple No. VII has a gudhamandapa with a porch while other temples have prag-griva as in Temple No. I. Except No. VII, the pillars of these temples are of ruchaka type with carved upper parts. The ceilings are mostly flat with floral or other geomatric carvings. These temples has elaborate carvings only on the doorways of small sanctuaries of the temples and porch columns. The carvings of basement is fewer and heavy. The sculptures of Narsimha, Trivikrama and Varaha is {{on the walls of}} Vishnu temple. There is a Shiva temple (No. VII) near the curve of the river. There is also Vishnu temple (No. V). It had ornamented doorway but has no detailed sculptural ornamentation.|$|R
40|$|Recent studies {{sponsored}} by NASA and United States industry indicate {{a need for}} technology to handle large space-based antenna systems. These systems will require apertures of up to 100 m and more {{in order to be}} capable of radio frequency operation up to Ku-band for communications, earth observations, and radio astronomy applications. They must also be cost-effective and compatible with the Space Transportation System. Selection criteria for the antennas which include such considerations as surface precision in the intended service environment and mechanical packaging efficiency, are enumerated. Space testing of the antennas will be carried out as part of NASA's Large Space Systems Technology (LSST) Program, which will be continued through fiscal year 1984. Deployable antennas have been selected for development by the LSST Program. The maturity of this class of antennas is such that a significant number of near-term space based applications will be satisfied (mobile communications, submillimeter radio astronomy, orbiting deep space relay station ODSRS, orbiting VLBI, earth-looking radiometry). Two antenna concepts selected for development are the <b>offset</b> wrap-rib <b>configuration</b> and the maypole (hoop/column) configuration with details for these concepts presented...|$|R
