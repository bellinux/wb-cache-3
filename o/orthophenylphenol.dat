40|$|AbstractPhotochemistry {{studies can}} be helpful in {{assessing}} the environmental fate of chemicals. For this reason, the photodegradation kinetic studies of the two pesticides <b>orthophenylphenol</b> (OPP) and monuron, largely used in agriculture, were carried out in solid phase. The fungicide OPP and the herbicide monuron were irradiated on the clay fractions (montmorillonite and modified clays) using a suntest simulator. The phototransformation of the parent compound was followed by HPLC technique. The photodegradation process appears to follow the first order reaction. Kinetic parameters were determined and the experimental results show that the photodegradation of these substrates was enhanced in presence of K-montmorillonite, in comparison with Fe(III) exchanged montmorillonite and montmorillonite complexed with humic acid complexes. This study has shown that the iron and humic acid adsorbed on clay surfaces did not increase the degradation rate...|$|E

Bedding samples were examined on days 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 12 and 15 for total bacterial counts (TBC) and coliform counts. Teat swabs {{collected on the}} same days were examined for coliforms. TBC, coliform counts and moisture content were all reduced in bedding treated with slaked lime or paraformaldehyde. All three treatments increased the pH of the bedding. Coliform contamination of teat ends was reduced by slaked lime and paraformaldehyde treatments. Slaked lime is preferred because of ease of application and it {{is less likely to}} injure cattle or workers. ...|$|E
