500|$|I often {{experience}} combat as {{it should}} be. I see myself {{in the middle of}} a British [...] swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E

Why, the place is so strong that even the Douglases have not cared to carry out the terms of the treaty, for the arrest of William Baird as a notorious breaker of the truce between the two countries." ...|$|R
500|$|Finally, a Bedouin story {{states that}} Allah created the Arabian horse {{from the south}} wind and exclaimed, [...] "I create thee, Oh Arabian. To thy forelock, I bind Victory in battle. On thy back, I set a rich spoil and a Treasure in thy loins. I {{establish}} thee {{as one of the}} Glories of the Earth... I give thee flight without wings." [...] Other versions of the story claim Allah said to the South Wind: [...] "I want to make a creature out of you. Condense." [...] Then from the material condensed from the wind, he made a kamayt-colored animal (a bay or burnt chestnut) and said: [...] "I call you Horse; I make you Arabian and I give you the chestnut color of the ant; I have hung happiness from the forelock which hangs between your eyes; you shall be the Lord of the other animals. Men shall follow you wherever you go; you shall be as good for flight as for pursuit; you shall fly without wings; riches shall be <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> and fortune shall come through your meditation." ...|$|E

And recent information would suggest that these evil persons are frequenting drinking establishments in loyalist towns and along the Golden Mile in Belfast, to try and tempt off-duty Security Force members and loyalist paramilitaries back to their lair to receive a coup de grace. So loyalists beware when you are drinking in town or you could end up <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>backs</b> for all the wrong reasons." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. March {{broke the}} silence that {{followed}} Jo's words, by saying in her cheery voice, [...] "Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrims Progress when you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>backs</b> for burdens, give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a Celestial City." ...|$|R
2500|$|A Midrash {{found in}} [...] {{support for the}} proverb that if a person tells {{you that you have}} a donkey's ears, do not believe it, but if two tell it to you, order a halter. For Abraham called Hagar Sarai's servant the first time in [...] saying, [...] "Behold, your maid is in your hand." [...] And then the angel called Hagar Sarai's servant the second time in [...] saying, [...] "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid." [...] Thus, {{thereafter}} in [...] Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai." [...] Similarly, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari where Scripture supports the saying of the Rabbis that if your neighbor (justifiably) calls you a donkey, you should put a saddle <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> (and not quarrel to convince the neighbor otherwise). Rabbah bar Mari replied that the saying found support in [...] where first the angel calls Hagar [...] "Sarai's handmaid," [...] and then Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.".

2500|$|The common {{legend of}} Yue {{receiving}} the tattoo {{from his mother}} first appeared in Shuo Yue Quanzhuan. In chapter 21 titled [...] "By a pretext Wang Zuo swore brotherhood, by tattoos Lady Yue instructed her son", Yue denounces the pirate chief Yang Yao (杨幺) and passes on {{a chance to become}} a general in his army. Yue Fei's mother then tells her son, [...] "I, your mother, saw that you did not accept recruitment of the rebellious traitor, and that you willingly endure poverty and are not tempted by wealth and status ... But I fear that after my death, there may be some unworthy creature who will entice you ... For these reason ... I want to tattoo <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> the four characters 'Utmost', 'Loyalty', 'Serve' and 'Nation' ... The Lady picked up the brush and wrote out on his spine the four characters for 'serving the nation with the utmost loyalty' ... she bit her teeth, and started pricking. Having finished, she painted the characters with ink mixed with vinegar so that the colour would never fade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beckett's prose pieces {{during the}} late period were not so {{prolific}} as his theatre, {{as suggested by the}} title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company (1980), which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said (1982) and Worstward Ho (1984), later collected in Nohow On. In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine." [...] "To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said." [...] Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including Company and Rockaby.|$|E
