5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've Got to Get Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boat</b> <b>and</b> Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E

25|$|Manet painted several boating {{subjects}} in 1874. Boating, {{now in the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art, exemplifies in its conciseness the lessons Manet learned from Japanese prints, and the abrupt cropping by the frame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> sail adds to the immediacy of the image.|$|E
2500|$|... 3. On {{the radio}} {{frequency}} {{used by the}} U-Boats, the Admiral commanding the fleet would be kept constantly informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dispositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> intentions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U-Boat Command.|$|R
60|$|Now {{that there}} was danger of going down some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sailors seemed to grow crazy. Half a dozen tumbled into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> began to lower it of their own accord.|$|R
60|$|Felix did no {{work that}} day. In the afternoon, with Gertrude, {{he got into}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> floated about with idly-dipping oars. They talked {{a good deal of}} Mr. Brand--though not exclusively.|$|R
25|$|Elwood was {{involved}} in the Madison Street Bridge streetcar disaster, when on the morning of November 1, 1893, the swinging draw section of the Madison Street Bridge, in Portland, opened to allow passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> <b>and</b> a streetcar on the bridge failed to stop for the open draw.|$|E
25|$|Kayak – slim boat, {{normally}} {{pointed at}} both ends and usually propelled by one kayaker who sits in a low seat and uses paddles with a blade at each end. Kayaks usually have a covered deck, with a cockpit covered by a spray deck to keep the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> (<b>and</b> the paddler's lower body) dry.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum is a {{circular}} device that is set to the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> draws in the nets. The powered drum allowed the nets to be drawn in much faster and along with the faster gas powered boats, fisherman were able to fish in areas they had previously been unable to go into, thereby revolutionizing the fishing industry.|$|E
60|$|While {{this talk}} {{was going on}} there was a rush for two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>and</b> before Captain Blossom could do {{anything}} his men were off, taking Jack Lesher and Dan Baxter with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "2nd, By <b>the</b> {{appointment}} <b>of</b> paid coxswains, {{who have}} charge of, and are held responsible for, the good order <b>and</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>and</b> by a quarterly exercise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew <b>of</b> each <b>boat.</b>|$|R

25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them to get out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point he stopped and sat down.|$|E
25|$|Frightened, Pi {{constructs}} a small raft out {{of rescue}} flotation devices, tethers {{it to the}} bow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> makes it his place of retirement. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer, and seasickness as a punishment mechanism, while using a whistle for signals. Soon, Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal, and is eventually able to share the boat with his feline companion, admitting {{in the end that}} Richard Parker is the one who helped him survive his ordeal.|$|E
25|$|The Malaitans {{are famous}} for their music and dance, which are {{sometimes}} associated with rituals. Several of the groups, including the 'Are'are, famous for their panpipe ensembles, are among SSEC members whose traditional music is no longer performed for religious reasons. Secular dancing is similar to widespread patterns in the Solomons, following patterns learned from plantation labor gangs or moves learned at the cinema in Honiara. Sacred dances follow strict formal patterns, and incorporate panpipers in the group. Some dances represent traditional activities, such as the tue tue dance, about fishing, which depict movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> fish, and the birds overhead.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is murder}} and mutiny {{on the high}} seas," [...] I told them this morning, when they came aft in a body to {{complain}} about <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> to demand my intentions.|$|R
6000|$|... "So we engaged one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>and</b> {{went down}} to it on the beach, and put our baggage in. And this is <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> my part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> account. Waldron is to write the rest.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> costs <b>of</b> setting up, {{financing}} <b>and</b> administering a <b>boat</b> sharing scheme may {{be offset}} by the eventual higher utilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> moorings, producing cheaper rates of sailing for its members compared to private boat ownership.|$|R
25|$|A coxswain is {{the coach}} in the boat, in {{addition}} to following the orders of the team coach, the coxswain {{is connected to the}} way the boat feels, what's working, what needs to be changed, and how. A successful coxswain must keep track of the drill, time, pace, words of the coach, feel of the boat, direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> <b>and</b> safety. During a race, a coxswain is responsible for steering, calling the moves, and responding to the way the other boats are moving. Success depends on the physical and mental strength of the rowers, ability to respond to the environment, {{and the way in which}} the coxswain motivates the rowers, not only as individuals but as members of the crew.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a {{circular}} device that was set to the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose built stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated {{the era of the}} 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. The ship served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.|$|E
25|$|The next rower ('seven' in an eight) sits {{directly}} behind stroke and is typically both fit and skilled: this rower {{acts as a}} buffer between the stroke {{and the rest of}} the crew. They closely follow the rhythm set by the stroke and help transmit this rhythm to the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> <b>and</b> particularly to the rowers rowing on the same side as seven, since rowers tend to look at the blades on their side of the boat to check their timing. If the strokeman increases or decreases the stroke rate it is essential that seven follows this change so that it is translated to the rest of the crew. Number seven usually watches the back of stroke so that they can time when to move up the slide and copy their rhythm. The job of seven is to emulate the rhythm of the strokeman.|$|E
60|$|The chums ran {{forward and}} reached <b>the</b> doorway <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{boathouse}} just as Shadow Hamilton was coming out. The somnambulist {{had a pair}} of oars, and he stepped to <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dock <b>and</b> untied one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> leaped in.|$|R
6000|$|Each princess entered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>and</b> Michael {{slipped into}} that which held <b>the</b> youngest. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> glided along rapidly, but Lina's, from being heavier, was always behind the rest. 'We never went so slowly before,' said the Princess; 'what {{can be the}} reason?' ...|$|R
50|$|While not {{exclusive}} to the party, Jingle Cruise {{is limited to}} the Christmas season after debuting in 2013. The original Jungle Cruise ride is upgraded to include some Christmas details throughout the queue, a rename <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> some new jokes from the skippers.|$|R
25|$|Matthew Turner {{was born}} in Geneva, Ohio on June 17, 1825, the fourth child of George Turner and Emily Atkins. George Turner owned a sawmill {{on the shores of}} Lake Erie and later {{launched}} his first ship, the sloop Geneva, in 1839, to ship lumber and building stone. Matthew, after watching the construction of the Geneva and a later vessel the Philena Mills, designed his first ship, the schooner G.R. Roberts. His father was sufficiently impressed with the design to build the boat, which was launched in 1848. Matthew took on the command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> later that year married Amanda Jackson. Amanda died in childbirth with their first child. On a trip down the Mississippi river in late 1849 he heard about gold mining in California and set off for the West Coast in 1850. He spent 3½ years mining gold in Calaveras County and was quite successful.|$|E
25|$|Muldoon {{initially}} opposed indirect consumer taxation on {{the basis}} that it would penalise poor people and increase inflation due to compensatory wage increases. However, in May 1979 he attempted to increase tax revenue by levying 10–20% taxes {{on a wide range of}} goods, including petrol, lawnmowers, caravans and boats. The taxes were criticised for being discriminatory, ineffective and a quick means of raising more revenue for the government without any accompanying fundamental reform of the taxation system – there were no income tax cuts to reflect the shift to indirect taxation. The immediate result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> caravan levy, in particular, was the decimation of both industries as potential buyers could not afford to pay the 20% tax on top of the construction costs; the tax also had the additional effect of adding to the numbers of unemployed as boat and caravan builders could not pay their employees because of the order cancellations.|$|E
25|$|The crew of Adjuster {{abandoned}} her in sinking {{condition for the}} life raft which overturned and they spent the last hour clinging to it before rescue by Kingurra. The yacht Clwyd was swamped and eventually overturned when the keel fell off, the crew were rescued by Nynja Go then transferred to the radio relay vessel. The NZ yacht Swuzzlebubble VIII was rolled 360 degrees by a breaking wave, turtled, dismasted and swamped. On deck crew harnessed on were all recovered. The crew then cut the rig off, put out a No 3 headsil as a sea anchor and bailed her out while other yachts stood nearby. They managed to start the engine and motored into Eden. Meanwhile, Prime Factor of Adelaide came off a big wave at speed when the mast and the main bulkhead to which it was fastened pulled {{straight out of the}} deck <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> disappeared over the side. Two crew members of Advantaged were injured when the yacht capsized, snapping the mast off at the base, four crew were flung overboard but quickly recovered. The navigator was thrown through a bulkhead, head first. On Atara the mast slammed through the port side and it began taking water, but reached Eden where many sought shelter and carried out repairs. Brindabella a new Jutson 75 was retired with delamination at the bow, possibly after hitting a whale. By the end of 28 December 56 yachts had retired, a further 11 by the 30th see list below. At least one of the smallest yachts sheltered in NSW ports during the worst conditions and managed to complete the race within time.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} after this, the order was given to lower one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>and</b> a crew jumped into her, among whom were Larry and Muggins. Will Osten asked {{permission}} to go, and Griffin granted his request with a grin that was <b>the</b> reverse <b>of</b> amiable.|$|R
60|$|Even as {{he spoke}} a black cloud of smoke shot up from amidships, {{followed}} by a shower of fiery fragments, some of which struck in <b>the</b> immediate vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>the</b> glare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflagration suddenly vanished as the Sea Dream sank beneath the waves.|$|R

Large numbers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> rafts are broken up after a single voyage. The wood barges are towed by tug.|$|R
500|$|During {{the conference}} room scene, Michael asks if anyone has seen the 1997 film Titanic. Pam and Jim pretend that they've {{never heard of the}} movie, and Pam {{suggests}} that Michael is thinking of the 1990 movie The Hunt for Red October. Upon boarding, Michael soon stands at the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> yells, [...] "I'm the king of the world!" [...] in reference to the famous scene in Titanic.|$|E
500|$|James Orsborne, giving evidence, {{said that}} he had learned from his brother about Moore's {{proposal}} to get rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat,</b> <b>and</b> had told George that he would be [...] "a darned fool" [...] even to consider the suggestion. He had stayed with his brother because [...] "I thought that {{if he was going to}} do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him". Recalled to the witness box, Moore {{said that he}} had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest.|$|E
500|$|The submarines' hulls {{were tested}} to a nominal depth of [...] by filling the hull {{with water and}} {{subjecting}} it to a pressure of , but the maximum operational depth {{was considered to be}} [...] Nonetheless several boats safely dived to [...] during World War I. It took about three minutes to dive the boat due to the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>and</b> that it could dive out of control if water was pumped into the ballast tanks too quickly. Submerged endurance was officially considered to be 10 hours, but several boats were submerged for 16 hours during the war.|$|E
60|$|Peer as I would I {{could not}} {{penetrate}} the darkness, and then I listened intently for <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> breathing near me; but except for <b>the</b> noise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rapids, <b>the</b> soft scraping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lapping <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water at their sides I could distinguish no sound. As usual, I thought rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there were}} still pollution-related {{problems}}, odor and garbage problems were {{not as bad as}} they were during the Magsaysay Lines and Starcraft Ferry days. Through <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government, but <b>the</b> persistent problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water lilies blocking <b>the</b> pathway <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> their infestation on the stations on the river remained.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> course <b>the</b> {{brothers}} had {{no objection to}} this plan, and accordingly they, with the mate and four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship's crew--all armed with cutlasses and pistols--got into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> were lowered into the water on <b>the</b> lee side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vessel, where Dominick and Otto had been quietly awaiting <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foregoing discussions.|$|R
