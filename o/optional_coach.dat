40|$|Purpose A {{multifaceted}} {{implementation strategy}} was targeted at supervisors {{to encourage them}} to apply a participatory approach (PA) in dealing with employees' work functioning problems due to health concerns. This paper assesses the effect on employees' perceived social norms regarding the use of the PA to deal with work functioning problems. Methods Three organizations participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial, with randomization at the department level. Supervisors in the PA intervention departments received the implementation strategy consisting of a working group meeting, supervisor training, and <b>optional</b> <b>coaching.</b> Supervisors in the control departments received written information about the PA only. In two of the organizations, employees were invited to complete surveys at baseline and at 6 -month follow-up. The primary outcome was perceived social norms regarding the use of the PA to deal with work functioning problems. Secondary measures included attitudes and self-efficacy, and intention regarding joint problem solving, and sick leave data. Effects were analyzed using multilevel analyses to account for nesting of cases. Results At baseline, 273 employees participated in the survey, with follow-up analyses of 174 employees. There were no statistically significant group effects on employee outcome measures. The intervention group showed a larger reduction in mean sick days (from 4. 6 to 2. 4 days) versus the control group (from 3. 8 to 3. 6 days), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (p >. 05). Conclusion The multifaceted strategy to implement the participatory approach for supervisors did not show effects on outcomes at the employee level. To gain significant effects at the employee level, may require that an implementation strategy not only targets management and supervisors, but also employees themselves.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Ways {{to prevent}} gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) remain unproven. We compared {{the impact of}} three lifestyle interventions (healthy eating [HE], physical activity [PA], and both HE and PA [HE+PA]) on GDM risk in a pilot multicenter randomized trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pregnant women at risk for GDM (BMI ≥ 29 kg/m 2) from nine European countries were invited to undertake a 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test before 20 weeks' gestation. Those without GDM were randomized to HE, PA, or HE+PA. Women received five face-to-face and four <b>optional</b> telephone <b>coaching</b> sessions, based {{on the principles of}} motivational interviewing. A gestational weight gain (GWG) < 5 kg was targeted. Coaches received standardized training and an intervention toolkit. Primary outcome measures were GWG, fasting glucose, and insulin sensitivity (HOMA) at 35 - 37 weeks. RESULTS: Among the 150 trial participants, 32...|$|R
40|$|To {{perform a}} process {{evaluation}} of a multifaceted strategy to implement the participatory approach for supervisors to prevent sick leave in three organisations. The implementation strategy incorporated a working group meeting with stakeholder representatives, supervisor training, and <b>optional</b> supervisor <b>coaching.</b> Context, recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, and satisfaction with the strategy were assessed at organisational and supervisor level using questionnaires and registration forms. At least 4 out of 6 stakeholders were represented in the working group meetings, and 11 % (n = 116) of supervisors could be reached. The working group meetings and supervisor training were delivered and received as planned and were well appreciated within all three organisations. Three supervisors made use of coaching. At 6 -month follow-up, 11 out of 41 supervisors (27 %) {{indicated that they had}} applied the participatory approach at least one time. The implementation strategy was largely carried out as intended. However, reach of both supervisors and department managers should be improved. Future studies should consider targeting employees with the strategy...|$|R

For the shorter AECs and Leylands the Britannia was finally replaced by the Hendon-built Commodore, which was a modification of the mass market Bella Vista body being 1 ft 10in longer with a front entrance and a maximum capacity of 45. Total Continental/Alpine Continental sales were 17, while only six Dragonflies were built, two Leyland demonstrators on Leopard and four for BET coach operator Samuelson of Victoria. The Commodore was also a sales disappointment, eight Reliance and three Leopard L2 being sold. Willowbrook however were gaining express-coach orders for its version of the BET-standard single decker.

40|$|Purpose To {{study the}} {{effectiveness}} of a multifaceted strategy to implement the participatory approach (PA) for supervisors to increase their self-efficacy in addressing risk of sick leave of employees. Methods Supervisors from three organizations were invited to participate. Randomization was performed at department level. Supervisors (n = 61) in the intervention departments received the implementation strategy consisting of a working group meeting, supervisor training in PA application, and <b>optional</b> supervisor <b>coaching.</b> Supervisors in the control departments (n = 55) received written information on PA. The primary outcome was supervisors' self-efficacy to apply the PA, measured at baseline and 6 months' follow-up. The number of employees with whom supervisors discussed work functioning problems or (risk of) sick leave was also assessed. Effects were tested using multilevel analyses. Results The strategy did not increase self-efficacy to apply the PA. Subgroup analyses showed that self-efficacy increased for supervisors who at baseline reported to have discussed (risk of) sick leave with less than three employees during the last 6 months (B = 1. 42, 95 % CI 0. 34 - 2. 50). Furthermore, the implementation strategy increased the number of employees with whom supervisors discussed work functioning problems or risk of sick leave (B = 1. 26, 95 % CI 0. 04 - 2. 48). Conclusion Although the implementation strategy cannot be recommended for all supervisors, for supervisors who less frequently discuss (risk of) sick leave with employees the implementation strategy might be helpful.

Primary outcome measures were GWG, fasting glucose, and insulin sensitivity (HOMA) at 35 - 37 weeks. Among the 150 trial participants, 32 % developed GDM by 35 - 37 weeks and 20 % achieved GWG < 5 kg. HE women had less GWG (- 2. 6 kg [95 % CI - 4. 9, - 0. 2]; P = 0. 03) and lower fasting glucose (- 0. 3 mmol/L [- 0. 4, - 0. 1]; P = 0. 01) than those in the PA group at 24 - 28 weeks. HOMA was comparable. No significant differences between HE+PA and the other groups were observed. An antenatal HE intervention is associated with less GWG and lower fasting glucose compared with PA alone. These findings require a larger trial for confirmation but support the use of early HE interventions in obese pregnant wome...|$|R
