5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} prescribed to treat behavioral symptoms of dementia. However, like antidepressants, {{they have little}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> although antipsychotics have shown some benefit. Cognitive impairing effects of benzodiazepines that occur frequently in the elderly can also worsen dementia.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study aims to {{test the}} {{influence}} {{of participation in the}} budget <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> and professionalism <b>of</b> the organization structure of moderation. The specific goal was to test how the influence of participation budget <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the budget, how to influence the professionalism <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> budget, organizational structure of moderation on the influence of participation budget <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> budget and organizational structure of moderation on the influence of the professionalism <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the budget. Population research is SKPD District Employees Temanggung that each 1 SKPD taken people from all over SKPD as many as 47, because a population of less than 100 respondents, the research is research with a census sample of 47 respondents. Determination SKPD employees as the sample is due SKPD institutions authorized to run at the same time preparing the budget. This research model formulated {{in the form of a}} simple regression and moderating Regression analysis (MRA) using the method of absolute difference. Absolute difference between the selection method is based on the assumption that this method is more secure against potential problems multikolinieritas compared with the method of interaction. Based on the results of the analysis carried out this research proves that: (1) Participation budget positive effect <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the budget, the higher the participation in the budgeting, the higher the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the budget.

He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range.

An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> on defense.|$|E

40|$|Perceptions and {{judgments}} of 84 managers were analyzed {{in the development}} of models <b>of</b> organisational <b>effectiveness</b> applied in managerial judgments. Managers described 283 subordinate organization units in terms of 114 variables often mentioned as indicative <b>of</b> organizational <b>effectiveness.</b> Managers also made judgments <b>of</b> the overall <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> these organizations. Analysis of the descriptions indicated that the 114 variables reflect 24 basic dimensions <b>of</b> organizational <b>effectiveness.</b> Models predictive <b>of</b> managerial judgments <b>of</b> organizational <b>effectiveness</b> were developed using these 24 dimensions. A general model accounted for 56 per cent of the variance of judgments <b>of</b> overall <b>effectiveness</b> made by the 84 managers. Other models developed for more homogeneous sub-samples of managers accounted for 75 to 85 per cent of the variance in judgments <b>of</b> overall <b>effectiveness.</b> These models typically involve only seven of the 24 dimensions <b>of</b> organizational <b>effectiveness</b> with a single dimension carrying the most weight in judgments. These models of managerial judgments <b>of</b> organisational <b>effectiveness</b> identify the basic dimensions viewed by managers in judging subordinate organizations and the relative weights assigned them. As such, they provide a useful framework for the development of criteria for judging organizations for administrative and research applications. ...|$|R

5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, incising, sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> is weak.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used with a degree <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|The Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) are {{the armed}} forces of the Republic of Liberia. Tracing its origins to a militia that was formed by the first black colonists in what is now Liberia, it was founded as the Liberian Frontier Force in 1908, and retitled in 1956. For {{virtually}} all of its history, the AFL has received considerable materiel and training assistance from the United States. For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U.S. advisers, though this assistance has not prevented the same generally low levels <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> common to most of {{the armed forces}} in the developing world.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{military}} was chiefly organized {{to ensure that}} the army could not threaten Imperial control, often at the expense <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> in war. Northern Song's Military Council operated under a Chancellor, who had no control over the imperial army. The imperial army was divided among three marshals, each independently responsible to the Emperor. Since the Emperor rarely led campaigns personally, Song forces lacked unity of command. The imperial court often believed that successful generals endangered royal authority, and relieved or even executed them (notably Li Gang, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong).|$|E
5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery is not an option. About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
