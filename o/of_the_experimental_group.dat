50|$|Effects coding {{can either}} be {{weighted}} or unweighted. Weighted effects coding is simply calculating a weighted grand mean, thus {{taking into account the}} sample size in each variable. This is most appropriate in situations where the sample is representative of the population in question. Unweighted effects coding is most appropriate in situations where differences in sample size are the result of incidental factors. The interpretation of b is different for each: in unweighted effects coding b is the difference between the mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> and the grand mean, whereas in the weighted situation it is the mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> minus the weighted grand mean.|$|E

Furthermore, the increased hydrostatic pressure led to an increased hatching rate in each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>The</b> induction rate <b>of</b> tetraploidy was highest at 7500 psi among <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{the moments}} before the examination, {{situational}} stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states. In the experimental group, participants engaged in three self-regulating techniques (concentration on respiration, general body relaxation, {{and the creation of}} a mental image of successfully passing the examination). During the examination, the anxiety levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> were lower than that of the control group. Also, the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1.7 times less than in the control group. From this data, Scherbatykh concluded that the application of self-regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain, which can help lead to better performance results.|$|E

50|$|Dummy coding is {{used when}} there is a control or {{comparison}} group in mind.

It is suggested that three criteria be met for specifying a suitable control group: the group should be a well-established group (e.g. should not be an “other” category), there should be a logical reason for selecting this group as a comparison (e.g. the group is anticipated to score highest on the dependent variable), and finally, the group’s sample size should be substantive and not small compared to the other groups.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{experiment}} was aimed {{to discover the}} influence of self-management {{on the level of}} productivity. To test this opinion, Baveals let workers decide themselves the level of output without strong control from the management side. He had a small group of workers plan their own hourly pace and daily work level as long as they kept at or above the obligatory minimum quota. The planning of the pace was made with the use of [...] "pacing cards". These workers were on piece work, and therefore, the more they produced above the minimum quota the greater was their pay. Bavelas also established a control group whose work arrangements were not changed. The level of production of the control group didn’t change, whereas the output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> grew from 67 units per hour to 82 units. Lewin concluded the main cause of such a positive result was lowering the pressure from managerial side toward workers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{procedure}} {{of the experiment}} was {{very similar to the}} one conducted in 1961. Children between the ages of 2.5 to 6 years watched a film of a mediated model punching and screaming aggressively at a Bobo doll. Depending on the experimental group, the film ended with a scene in which the model was rewarded with candies or punished with the warning, [...] "Don't do it again". In the neutral condition the film ended right after the aggression scene toward the Bobo doll. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> the child was in, after watching the film the child stayed in a room with many toys and a Bobo doll. The experimenter found that the children often showed less similar behavior toward the model when they were shown the clip that ended with the punishment scene as compared to the other conditions. Also, boys showed more imitative aggression than girls toward the Bobo doll. That is the measure of the performance and it supports the results of the experiments in 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Reisinger {{started his}} {{education}} in music at Vienna Boys' Choir {{at the age}} of 5. Then, he studied piano at the Music and Arts University of the City of Vienna and percussion at the University of Music and Performing Arts in the same city under Richard Hochrainer. In 1973, he became a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>group</b> Erster Wiener Musikzirkus, which made music for dance performances. Since the middle of 70s, he has worked with the composer Thomas Pernes. From 1975 to 1977, Reisinger {{was a member of the}} trio Medaya (with Voja Brkovitc, the guitarist and Beat Furrer, the pianist). As a member of the trio, he made tours all over Austria, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. In 1978, his work Hippodrome was published as a composition order for Burgtheater. In 1979, he played as a percussionist in the Vienna Art Orchestra and was its member until 1989. In 1981, he founded the group Part of Art. Other members of the group were Wolfgang Puschnig, Uli Scherer, Herbert Joos, Jürgen Wuchner and other soloists of Vienna Art Orchestra. He performed with Part of Art in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and France and recorded his first CDs as band leader. After a tour with Hans Koller, he founded the group Air Mail (with Harry Pepl), Wolfgang Puschnig and Mike Richmond. In 1986, he became a member of Wolfgang Mitterer's quartet Pat Brothers (with Linda Sharrock and Wolfgang Puschnig), the album of which Pat Brothers No. 1 was awarded the Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik. In 1987, he started to cooperate with London Symphony Orchestra. After leaving Vienna Art Orchestra, Reisinger became a member of the European Jazz Trio with François Couturier and Jean-Paul Cèléa in 1989. Besides, he worked in Paris with Dominique Pifarély, Yves Robert and Philippe Deschepper and performed in Moers Festival with Louis Sclavis. In the same year the album Matador was created in cooperation with Mitterer. As a member of the quintet Passagio (with Armand Angster, Françoise Kubler, François Couturier and Jean-Paul Céléa [...] ), which was founded in 1990, he published the CDs Passagio and L'Ibere. In 1991, he performed in the first performance of Luciano Berio's Circles in Austria. Reisinger concentrated on Passagio in France in the middle of 90s. Between 1994 and 1996, he worked with musicians Like Enrico Rava, John Abercrombie, Evan Parker, Michel Godard, Herb Robertson and Peter Kowald.|$|E
