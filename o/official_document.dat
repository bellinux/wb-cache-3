5|$|After Longchamp's exile Coutances {{was named}} {{head of a}} council of regency, which is {{sometimes}} equated to the post of Chief Justiciar, although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any <b>official</b> <b>document.</b> Most modern historians, however, name him as justiciar. He held that power until about 25 December 1193, when Hubert Walter was appointed Justiciar.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no <b>official</b> <b>document</b> making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of the first people to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an <b>official</b> <b>document)</b> {{and the fact that it}} is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E

5|$|In 1349, John plundered a Venetian {{commercial}} ship {{which had}} been shipwrecked on the coast he controlled, {{in accordance with the}} medieval principle of jus naufragii. This act necessitated the involvement of Stephen Dušan in order to settle the dispute between Venice and John, as evidenced by an <b>official</b> <b>document</b> from 13 April 1350. Despite this conflict, under John the Principality of Valona was an active partner of Venice and Ragusa (modern Dubrovnik) in maritime commerce. Two receipts from 27 April 1350 document John's role as a mediator in cattle, sugar and pepper trade and reveal that he received significant income from the Valona customs. The customs was profitable because the port was often visited by merchant ships. Even though all of these documents were written in Slavic, John signed his name in Greek, which testifies to his Hellenisation. At the time, John also had ties with the Mamluk rulers of Egypt, who addressed him as “King of Serbia and Bulgaria” in correspondence.|$|E
5|$|The Leges Henrici Primi or Laws of Henry I {{is a legal}} treatise, {{written in}} about 1115, that records the legal customs of medieval England in the reign of King Henry I of England. Although {{it is not an}} <b>official</b> <b>document,</b> it was written by someone {{apparently}} associated with the royal administration. It lists and explains the laws, and includes explanations of how to conduct legal proceedings. Although its title implies that these laws were issued by King Henry, it lists laws issued by earlier monarchs that were still in force in Henry's reign; the only law of Henry that is included is the coronation charter he issued at the start of his reign. It covers a diverse range of subjects, including ecclesiastical cases, treason, murder, theft, feuds, assessment of danegeld, and the amounts of judicial fines.|$|E

Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the <b>official</b> <b>document.</b> So the modern world's standard unit of length is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.|$|E
