25|$|Portland {{experiences}} a temperate climate with both oceanic and Mediterranean features. This climate {{is characterized by}} warm, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. The precipitation pattern is distinctly Mediterranean, with little to no rainfall occurring {{during the summer months}} {{and more than half of}} annual precipitation falling between November and February. Portland experiences somewhat cooler winters than areas of similar latitude on the west coast of Europe. Of the three most populated cities within the Pacific Northwest (Seattle, Vancouver and Portland) Portland has the warmest average temperature, the highest number of sunshine hours, and the fewest inches of rainfall and snowfall. According to the Köppen climate classification, Portland falls within the dry-summer mild temperate zone (Csb), also referred to as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate with a USDA Plant Hardiness Zones between 8b and 9a. Other climate systems, such as the Trewartha climate classification, places it within the <b>oceanic</b> <b>zone</b> (Do), like much of the Pacific Northwest and Western Europe.|$|E
500|$|The {{aphotic zone}} can be {{subdivided}} into three different vertical regions, based on depth and temperature. First is the bathyal zone, extending from {{a depth of}} 1000metres down to 3000metres, with water temperature decreasing from [...] to [...] as depth increases. Next is the abyssal zone, extending from a depth of 3000metres down to 6000metres. The final zone includes the deep oceanic trenches, and {{is known as the}} hadal zone. This, the deepest <b>oceanic</b> <b>zone,</b> extends from a depth of 6000metres down to approximately 11000metres. Abyssal plains are typically in the abyssal zone, at depths from 3000 to 6000metres.|$|E

[...] These zones are not associated with a typical mediterranean climate, and would be classified as Temperate Oceanic (Cfb), except dry-summer patterns typical to the Pacific Northwest meet Koeppen's minimum Cs thresholds.

2500|$|Otolith and {{vertebrae}} {{studies have}} proved useful {{in determining the}} age and thus growth patterns of the species, with other methods including scale and fin ray sectioning having lesser value. The species otoliths {{have been the subject}} of detailed X-ray diffraction studies, which have indicated biomineralisation of the otoliths occurs predominantly in the aragonite phase. Females grow faster than males, reaching 266.5mm after their first year of life, 364.4 after their second, 370.9mm after the third and 546.7 after their fifth. A female of 676.6mm was 9 years old. Males reach 252.4mm in their first year, 336.2mm in their second, 363.8 in the third and 510.3 in their fifth. A male of 554mm was eight years old. The oldest studied individual was a 934-mm individual of unspecified sex, which was 17 years old. The larvae are pelagic and are found over continental shelf waters and occasionally in the <b>oceanic</b> <b>zone</b> proximal to the continental slope. They are present all year round in the Gulf of Mexico, with a peak in abundance during the summer months due to spawning peaks. While the young juveniles live in the exposed pelagic environment, they use a behaviour called 'piloting' to [...] swim in very close proximity to both larger animals and floating objects, such as sargassum mats, buoys and even boats. By the time juveniles make their way to shore, they may have been dispersed large distances from their initial spawning grounds and may face the challenge of migration to warmer climates during winter if they are to survive as outlined previously. Juveniles use estuaries and seagrass beds as their main nursery habitats.|$|E

30|$|The {{property}} {{and behavior of}} deep subduction-zone fluids are substantial to the mass transfer at the slab-mantle interface in subduction channels. This is also a particularly important challenge because the fluids mediate the recycling of crustal components into the mantle and the reworking of the crust itself. Continental deep subduction triggers metamorphic dehydration and partial melting at the slab-mantle interface, {{but it did not}} create juvenile crust like arc volcanics above <b>oceanic</b> subduction <b>zones.</b> Nevertheless, partial melting of the SSC ultramafic metasomes gives rise to mafic igneous rocks in collisional orogens. The geochemical differentiation through dehydration melting and melt-peridotite reaction in continental subduction zones generally resembles that in <b>oceanic</b> subduction <b>zones.</b> However, this represents a different type of recycling of the continental crust compared to the more common recycling of terrigenous sediment in <b>oceanic</b> subduction <b>zones.</b> Partial melting of the continental SSC ultramafic metasomes also represents a different way of crustal growth and crust-mantle interaction with element fractionation from that in the much better studied case of arc volcanism above <b>oceanic</b> subduction <b>zones.</b> Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate comprehensively UHP metamorphic rocks and their associated assemblages such as ophiolites, peridotites, and pyroxenites in order to unravel the geochemical behavior of fluids and element recycling in the subduction factory.|$|R
50|$|A north-south {{arrangement}} of continents and oceans leads to much more diversity and isolation than east-west arrangements. North-to-south arrangements give climatically different zones along the communication routes {{to the north}} and south, which are separated by water or land from other continental or <b>oceanic</b> <b>zones</b> of similar climate. Formation of similar tracts of continents and ocean basins oriented east-west would lead to much less isolation, diversification, and slower evolution, since each continent or ocean is in fewer climatic zones. Through the Cenozoic, isolation has been maximized by a north-south arrangement.|$|R
