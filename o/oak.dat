5|$|In the Nescopeck Creek watershed, {{pitch pine}} – scrub <b>oak</b> forests occur on Arbutus Peak and several barren {{areas in the}} {{southern}} part of watershed. In this type of forest, pitch pine, scrub <b>oak,</b> black <b>oak</b> and chestnut <b>oak</b> are the main trees. Bracken fern, teaberry, black chokeberry, blueberry, and huckleberry are the most common shrubs in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oak</b> savanna {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered <b>oak</b> trees, {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. The Takelma tribe often set fires in the <b>oak</b> savanna and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk. It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white <b>oak</b> and ponderosa pine are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison <b>oak</b> are also common.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its {{affinity}} for <b>oak,</b> either during fermentation or in barrel aging. In addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavors of vanilla and spice complement the natural grape flavors of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 liter (59 gallon) barrique were a significant influence in making that barrel size one {{of the most}} popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of <b>oak</b> influence (as well as which type of <b>oak)</b> will have a strong impact on the resulting wine. American <b>oak,</b> particularly from new barrels, imparts stronger <b>oak</b> flavors that are less subtle than those imparted by French <b>oak.</b> Even within the American <b>oak</b> family, the location of the <b>oak</b> source also plays a role with <b>oak</b> from the state of Oregon having more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than <b>oak</b> from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of <b>oak</b> barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.|$|E

5|$|The Mingo <b>Oak</b> (also {{known as}} the Mingo White <b>Oak)</b> was a white <b>oak</b> (Quercus alba) in the U.S. state of West Virginia.

5|$|The fruit bodies grow in {{clusters}} or {{scattered on the}} decomposing leaves and acorns of <b>oak</b> trees, such as Coast Live <b>Oak,</b> Valley <b>Oak</b> and Black <b>Oak.</b> It is common in the coastal <b>oak</b> woodlands of California, where it appears from late autumn to early winter.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers {{can also}} control the {{influence}} of <b>oak</b> by using alternatives to the standard barrique barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and therefore less pronounced <b>oak</b> flavors. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is tea bagging with <b>oak</b> chips or adding <b>oak</b> planks to the wines while fermenting or aging it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than <b>oak</b> barrels, they create more pronounced <b>oak</b> flavors, which tend not to mellow or integrate {{with the rest of}} the wine's components; nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel aging.|$|E
