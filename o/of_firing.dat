5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

5|$|The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) was {{a privately}} financed light fighter, {{designed}} and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop's F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIdentifying {{the factors}} that drive the spatial {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> is one <b>of</b> the most challenging issues facing fire science in a changing world. We investigated the relative influence of humans, land cover and weather on the regional distribution <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> in a Mediterranean region using boosted regression trees {{and a set of}} seven explanatory variables. The spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> weather, which is seldom accounted for in regional models, was estimated using a semi-mechanistic approach and expressed as the length <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> weather season. We found that the drivers of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> followed a fire size-dependent pattern in which human activities and settlements mainly determined the distribution <b>of</b> all <b>fires</b> whereas the continuity and type of fuels mainly controlled the location <b>of</b> the largest <b>fires.</b> The spatial structure <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> weather was estimated to be responsible for an average of 25 % of the spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>fires,</b> suggesting that climate change may directly affect the spatial patterns <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> hazard in the near future. These results enhance our understanding of long-term controls of the spatial distribution of wildfires and predictive maps <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> hazard provide useful information for fire management actions...|$|R
5|$|According to Admiral Kummetz' report, {{the first}} torpedo hit Kesselraum 2 (boileroom 2, {{just under the}} funnel) and the second hit Turbinenraum 2/3 (the turbine room for the side shafts). Boiler 1 had already been {{destroyed}} by gunfire. Only one boiler remained, but the steam pipes through boiler 1 and 2 and turbine room 2/3 had been damaged and turbine 1 for the main shaft lost its power. By 04:34, the ship had been severely damaged, but had successfully passed through the firing zone; the Norwegian guns could no longer bear on her. The 15cm guns in the Kopås battery were all standing in open positions with a wide sector <b>of</b> <b>firing.</b> After the torpedo hits, Blücher was still within range. The battery asked for orders, but Eriksen concluded: The fortress has served its purpose. With all propellers stopped, about 60% of the electric power gone, Blucher quickly lost speed and at about 04:50 dropped anchors at Askoholmene.|$|E

The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama. In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes.|$|E
5|$|By about noon, the Confederates {{had formed}} an attack line {{and were in}} {{position}} to advance on the works. Because of the forest {{on the west side}} of the Mauckport Road, a company of men dismounted and attacked the works head on. They were repulsed three times, but the Legion suffered a casualty during the second wave. Simultaneously, the Confederates launched a flanking maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works. The initial flanking attempt was prevented because of the superior weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing. They were equipped with Henry rifles capable <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> fourteen rounds before reloading, and were able to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes.|$|E

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> {{different}} <b>fire</b> severity on {{the changes}} of the soil organic matter (SOM) and soil structure was evaluated. Soil samples were collected (May 2010) in the locality of Nitra-Dražovce (Slovakia) from the following plots: 1) control (unburned place), 2) low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and 3) higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> The {{results showed that the}} content of water-stable microaggregates (WSAmi) increased by 20 % in the area with a low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> but on the other hand, it decreased by 42 % in the area with the higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> in comparison to control. The higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> resulted in a decrease of smaller size fractions of water-stable macroaggregates (WSAma) (0. 5 − 0. 25) and a low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> resulted in the decrease of WSAma 2 − 0. 5 mm. On the other hand, the content of WSAma in the size fraction > 5 mm was higher by 54 % and by 32 % in the lower and higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> respectively, than in unburned soil. The higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> had a more positive effect on increases of the structure coefficient and coefficient of aggregate stability, {{as well as on the}} decrease of the vulnerability coefficient compared to the low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> After burning, the contents of soil organic carbon (Corg) and labile carbon were significantly increased by the severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> However, the low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> affected more markedly the increase of hot water-soluble and cold water-soluble carbon than the higher severity <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> After burning and due to the severity <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> both the carbon of humic and carbon of fulvic acids ratios and SOM stability increased. The parameters of SOM due to fire significantly increased also in WSA with the least changes in WSAmi. The results showed that a low severity <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> increased Corg mainly in WSAma > 2 mm and WSAmi, whereas high severity fire increased Corg content in the smaller fraction of WSAma...|$|R
5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a path between the ridge and the beach. After about 30 minutes <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape to the beach. Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines {{made it to the}} beach near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at the beach in effort to keep them from successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the landing craft and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E

In the ensuing action, both ships were hit several times, forcing Glasgow to break off and fall behind the more powerful armored cruisers. Leipzig was battered severely by Cornwall and Kent and set on fire; she nevertheless remained in action and continued to fight. In the course of the engagement, Leipzig hit Cornwall eighteen times, causing a significant list to port. She fired three torpedoes at the British ships, but failed to score any hits with them. At 19:20, Haun issued the order to scuttle his wrecked ship; the British approached and opened fire on the stricken cruiser at close range, killing large numbers of the crew. The British also destroyed a cutter filled with survivors, killing all of them. Leipzig finally capsized and sank at 21:05, with Haun going down with his ship. Only eighteen men were pulled from the freezing water.|$|E

The Dutch centre, consisting of the ships of the line Brutus, Leijden and the fifth rate razee Mars, pulled away from the engagement behind them under Rear-Admiral Johan Bloys van Treslong, coming under only distant fire from the ships of Onslow's division. Isolated, the Dutch rearguard were rapidly overwhelmed, with Jupiter, Haarlem, Alkmaar and Delft all surrendering to Onslow's attack before 13:45, while the battered Monnikkendam was seized by the frigate Beaulieu.|$|E
5|$|Johnson left Washington, D.C. {{just before}} Congress adjourned. He raised one {{thousand}} men, nominally {{part of the}} militia brigade under Kentucky Governor Isaac Shelby, but largely operating independently. He disciplined his men, required that every man have arms in prime condition and ready to hand, and hired gunsmiths, blacksmiths, and doctors at his own expense. He devised a new tactical system: when any group of men encountered the enemy, they were to dismount, take cover, and hold the enemy in place. All groups not in contact were to ride to the sound <b>of</b> <b>firing,</b> and dismount, surrounding the enemy when they got there. Between May and September, Johnson raided throughout the Northwest, burning the war supply centers of Indian villages, surrounding Indian fighting units and scattering them, killing some Indian warriors each time.|$|E
