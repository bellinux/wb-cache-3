25|$|At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob {{goes into}} the freezer to get Krabby Patties, only to {{discover}} that none are left. He and Mr. Krabs try to make more, but Plankton comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> with the formula. Mr. Krabs catches him and decides to send it to a bank since he got tired of stopping Plankton. He then realizes that he needed the formula so he gives SpongeBob the key to the vault in which the recipe is hidden, and he and Patrick board a train to the bank for the safe deposit box. Eventually, the key is stolen and SpongeBob and Patrick must find the culprit. Just then, Plankton walks up and Patrick searches him, but finds him clean. The duo stops the train to find the suspect responsible for stealing the key. A nanny and her baby are searched, only to find a stolen jewel that was stolen by triplets. The next suspect, a butler, is revealed to be a thief named Orin J. Ruffy who stole $75,000 worth of ham sandwiches.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says there was {{something}} in the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that anything found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba go and look for the device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E
2500|$|In the Vaishnava {{version of}} the myth, Indra has been {{replaced}} by his former helper Vishnu. The heavenly waters are now a river called Vishnupadi (padi: Skt. [...] "from the foot of"). As he completes his celebrated three strides—of earth, sky, and heaven—Vishnu as Vamana stubs his toe on the vault of heaven, punches open a hole, and releases the Vishnupadi, which until now had been circling around the cosmic egg within. Flowing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vault,</b> she plummets down to Indra's heaven, where she is received by Dhruva, the once steadfast worshipper of Vishnu, now fixed in the sky as the polestar. Next, she streams across the sky forming the Milky Way and arrives on the moon. She then flows down earthwards to Brahma's realm, a divine lotus atop Mount Meru, whose petals form the earthly continents. There, the divine waters break up, with one stream, the Alaknanda, flowing down one petal into Bharatvarsha (India) as the Ganges.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, for {{business}} purposes, this idea was new enough! The idea was [...] "difficult to work," [...] says Dickens, with obvious truth.

They were, however, compelled to obey, and, with unwilling hands, built up such a pile upon the secret door, that it could not be lifted from beneath without gigantic strength, and a noise which would re-echo through the Castle. This done, Sir Eustace watched them all <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> himself, closed the door, locked it, and announced to the Seneschal his intention of relieving him for the future from the care of the keys. Still watching him closely, he ascended to the hall, and gave the signal for the supper, which shortly made its appearance.|$|E

60|$|I {{know that}} I {{ought to do}} with the Taj as I was obliged to do with Niagara--see it fifteen times, and let my mind {{gradually}} get rid of the Taj built in it by its describers, by help of my imagination, and substitute for it the Taj of fact. It would be noble and fine, then, and a marvel; not the marvel which it replaced, but still a marvel, and fine enough. I am a careless reader, I suppose--an impressionist reader; an impressionist reader of what is not an impressionist picture; a reader who overlooks the informing details or masses their sum improperly, and gets only a large splashy, general effect--an effect which is not correct, and which is not warranted by the particulars placed before me-- particulars which I did not examine, and whose meanings I did not cautiously and carefully estimate. It is an effect which is some thirty-five or forty times finer than the reality, and is therefore a great deal better and more valuable than the reality; and so, I ought never to hunt up the reality, but stay miles away from it, and thus preserve undamaged my own private mighty Niagara tumbling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vault</b> of heaven, and my own ineffable Taj, built of tinted mists upon jeweled arches of rainbows supported by colonnades of moonlight. It is a mistake for a person with an unregulated imagination to go and look at an illustrious world's wonder.|$|E
60|$|There was no bar to the door. Yes, there was. Catherine Douglas, {{worthy of}} her name, {{worthy of the}} {{cognizance}} of the bleeding heart, thrust her arm through the empty staples to gain for her sovereign a few moments more for escape and safety! But though true as steel, the brave arm was not as strong. It was quickly broken. She was thrust fainting aside, and the ruffians rushed in. Queen Joan stood {{in the midst of}} the room, with her hair streaming round her, and her mantle thrown hastily on. Some of the wretches even struck and wounded her, but Graham called them off, and bade them search for the King. They sought him in vain in every corner of the women's apartments, and dispersed through the other rooms in search of their prey. The ladies began to hope that the citizens and nobles in the town were coming to their help, and that the King might have escaped through an opening that led from the vault into the tennis court. Presently, however, the King called to them to draw him up again, for he had not been able to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vault,</b> having a few days before caused the hole to be bricked up, because his tennis balls used to fly into it and be lost. In trying to draw him up by the sheets, Elizabeth Douglas, another of the ladies, was actually pulled down into the vault; the noise was heard by the assassins, who were still watching outside, and they returned.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, {{how does}} Edwin, once <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vault,</b> make good a secret escape from Cloisterham? Mr. Proctor invokes {{the aid of}} Mr. Grewgious, but does not explain why Grewgious was on the spot. I venture to think it not inconceivable that Mr. Grewgious having come down to Cloisterham by a late train, on Christmas Eve, to keep his Christmas {{appointment}} with Rosa, paid a darkling visit to the tomb of his lost love, Rosa's mother. Grewgious was very sentimental, but too secretive to pay such a visit by daylight. [...] "A night of memories and sighs" [...] he might [...] "consecrate" [...] to his lost lady love, as Landor did to Rose Aylmer. Grewgious was to have helped Bazzard to eat a turkey on Christmas Day. But he {{could get out of}} that engagement. He would wish to see Edwin and Rosa together, and Edwin was leaving Cloisterham. The date of Grewgious's arrival at Cloisterham is studiously concealed. I offer at least a conceivable motive for Grewgious's possible presence at the churchyard. Mrs. Bud, his lost love, we have been told, was buried hard by the Sapsea monument. If Grewgious visited her tomb, he was on the spot to help Edwin, supposing Edwin to escape. Unlikelier things occur in novels. I do not, in fact, call these probable occurrences in every-day life, but none of the story is probable. Jasper's [...] "weird seizures" [...] are meant to lead up to SOMETHING. They may have been meant to lead up to the failure of the murder and the escape of Edwin. Of course Dickens would not have treated these incidents, when he came to make Edwin explain,--nobody else could explain,--in my studiously simple style. The drugged Edwin himself would remember the circumstances but mistily: his evidence would be of no value against Jasper.|$|E

5000|$|One Woman Man {{garnered}} {{more critical}} claim {{than any other}} Jones LP in years but in reality it was a hodgepodge collection of new material, previously released tracks {{and a couple of}} unreleased cuts fished <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaults</b> and dusted off with fresh vocals. [...] "Burning Bridges" [...] and the murder ballad [...] "Radio Lover", for example, had already appeared on the 1983 album Jones Country.

[...] "Winter Nights" [...] was recorded during early sessions for Night <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stormrider while Gene Adam was still on vocals, {{but this was the}} track which prompted Schaffer to ask Adam to get singing lessons, as it was felt he could not handle the high notes.
