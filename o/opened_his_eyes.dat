25|$|A {{high school}} English teacher {{convinced}} {{him to go to}} college. He enrolled at Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas, in 1965, intending to major in engineering. Living in south Texas made him curious about his roots there, and he enrolled in a Texas history which, he said, <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to the exploitation of Mexican Americans and farmworkers. A local Roman Catholic priest assisted him in obtaining financial aid, and he transferred to Ohio Northern College (a private, United Methodist Church-affiliated school) in 1966. He transferred to Bluffton College (a private, Mennonite-affiliated school) a year later. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} was suddenly changed, however, and Philip was tardily forced {{again into the}} opposition against the Emperor, by the Treaty of Crépy of 1544, which <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to the danger threatening Protestantism. He prevented the Roman Catholic Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Lüneburg from taking forcible possession of his dominions and unsuccessfully planned a new alliance with German princes against Austria, pledging its members to prevent {{the acceptance of the}} decrees of the projected Council of Trent. When this failed, he sought to secure the neutrality of Bavaria in a possible war against the Protestants and proposed a new Protestant alliance {{to take the place of}} the Schmalkaldic League.|$|E

25|$|Several years later, a king named Sagara magically {{acquired}} sixty thousand sons. One day, King Sagara {{performed a}} ritual of worship {{for the good}} of the kingdom. One of the integral parts of the ritual was a horse, which was stolen by the jealous Indra. Sagara sent all his sons all over the earth to search for the horse. They found it in the nether-world (or Underworld) next to a meditating sage Kapil tied by Lord Indra(the king of Swarg). Believing that the sage had stolen the horse, they hurled insults at him and caused his penance to be disturbed. The sage <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> for the first time in several years and looked at the sons of Sagara. With this glance, all sixty thousand were burnt to death.|$|E

Before his spiritual awakening, Harrison sings of variously possessing, seeing, feeling and knowing [...] "ot a thing" [...] until, Allison writes, [...] "he called upon God's love, which then came into him." ...|$|E

[...] His work experiences <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to see the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write. [...] Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well. In her review of Ellis Paul Live for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, [...] "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels.

Knox wrote {{that one of the}} soldiers near Wolfe shouted [...] "They run, see how they run." [...] Wolfe, on the ground, <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and asked who was running.

500|$|In {{response}} to this angle, the IWA began hinting that Colón would be joining a heel stable known as [...] "Capitol Sports" [...] (borrowing the name that WWC used during the 1970s-90s), which in storyline was being covertly operated by González in cooperation with his [...] "business partners" [...] (a reference to Colón, Sr. and Jovica) {{with the intention of}} taking over the promotion. In a segment of their television show, the company ran a script where a surprise arrival was announced, which was promoted as [...] "a young wrestler [...] with a tremendous future in the United States [...] who has Capitol flowing through veins" [...] and with whom González had differences in the past that were overcome when he <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> (in reference to WWC's heel turn) so that he could [...] "complete" [...] an unspecified task in the invasion. The IWA further mocked Colón in a skit where Savio Vega dismissed this revelation, citing that he had video evidence of a match where Flash Flanagan (who was active in the promotion performing as [...] "Slash Venom") pinned him at OVW. This angle was concluded in a segment where González berated an unknown individual during a call for being unable to appear in a card, claiming that [...] "he [...] as mediocre as [...] father and brother".|$|E
500|$|Though often {{considered}} an art film by modern audiences, Caligari was produced and marketed {{the same way}} as a normal commercial production of its time period, able to target both the elite artistic market as well as a more commercial horror genre audience. The film was marketed extensively leading up to the release, and advertisements ran even before the film was finished. Many posters and newspaper advertisements included the enigmatic phrase featured in the film, [...] "Du musst Caligari werden!", or [...] "You must become Caligari!" [...] Caligari premiered at the Marmorhaus theatre in Berlin on 26 February 1920, less than one month after it was completed. The filmmakers were so nervous about the release that Erich Pommer, {{on his way to the}} theatre, reportedly exclaimed, [...] "It will be a horrible failure for all of us!" [...] As with the making of the film, several urban legends surround the film's premiere. One, offered by writers Roger Manvell and Heinrich Fraenkel in The German Cinema, suggest the film was shelved [...] "for lack of a suitable outlet", and was only shown at Marmorhaus because another film had fallen through. Another suggested the theatre pulled the film after only two performances because audiences demanded refunds and demonstrated against it so strongly. This story was told by Pommer, who claimed the Marmorhaus picked Caligari back up and ran it successfully for three months after he spent six months working on a publicity campaign for the film. David Robinson wrote that neither of these urban legends were true, and that the latter was fabricated by Pommer to increase his own reputation. On the contrary, Robinson said the premiere was highly successful, showing at the theatre for four weeks, an unusual amount for the time, and then returning two weeks later. He said it was so well received that women in the audience screamed when Cesare <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> during his first scene, and fainted during the scene in which Cesare abducts Jane.|$|E

500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to hear how you sound.' When I was done with the audition, he <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E

[...] To his surprise, rather than arriving in Biblical Israel (with people riding camels and living in tents), he found himself in a modern society in which {{for the first time he}} met Jews from around the globe. [...] The experience was a culture shock, and he was attracted to the culture and the everyday life. [...] It changed the NBA-bound basketball player's goals in life. Eventually, because he was Jewish he agreed to take up the challenge and stay. His decision completely changed Israeli basketball.|$|E

[...] Speaking of Kat and Alfie's relationship and the fact that Alfie finds the bandage, they said, [...] "Alfie hasn't got any idea at all about what Kat's up to [...] so he isn't looking out for signs that she's cheating on him. In fact, he thinks they're in a good place right now. Finding the [...] might not have the impact Kat's fearing.
