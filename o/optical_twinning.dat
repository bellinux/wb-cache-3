40|$|We investigate, {{theoretically}} and experimentally, a novel {{scheme to}} suppress the nonlinear crosstalk between wavelengths in wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) analog fiber systems. It {{is based on an}} improvement to a previously introduced crosstalk-suppression technique by complementary modulation of two closely spaced <b>optical</b> <b>twin</b> carriers (TCs). By combining the modulated TCs by a balanced detector (TCs-balanced detection [TC-BD]), the suppression can be improved further. We have obtained up to 50 -dB crosstalk reduction at low modulation frequencies, where crosstalk is most severe, and in the most interesting region for cable television systems. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Using the twin beams with the quantum intensity correlation of 5 dB the effective bit rate of 2 × 10 ^ 7 bits/s is completed.

40|$|Complex optical {{properties}} of plagioclase, such as twinning, present a particularly difficult challenge to image processing techniques. Conventional image processing methods attempt to recognize mineral grain boundaries by grey level gradients {{and are likely}} to classify <b>optical</b> <b>twin</b> zones as different grains. To overcome this problem, automated grey level processing of small areas under different orientations of cross polarization is used to identify both twinned and un-twinned plagioclase areas as seeds. In an interactive procedure, seeds are projected onto polarized images and are built-up to individual grains. An independent grey level utility supplements automatic processing, allowing grey level profiling down to groups of a few pixels, providing a means for preliminary examinations of thin sections, and to establish typical differences between grain types...|$|R

PACS numbers: 42. 50. Gy, 42. 50. Hz, 42. 65. -k In modern communication, the transmission of information is usually carried out among multi-users which are organized in a network. The network consists of spatially separated nodes in which information can be stored and locally manipulated. Recently, experiments have demonstrated that optical signal {{can be stored in}} and then retrieved from an atomic ensemble[1][2]. Light storage is implemented in a scheme of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in which the atoms with a Λ configuration interact resonantly with both a signal beam and a control beam[3]. Theoretically, it has been proved that the scheme can also be used as a quantum memory[4]-[9]. Then, EIT is extended to a double Λ configuration in which two couples of probe and control beams interact resonantly with a four-level atom[10]-[16]. In this model the two Λ subsystems share a common dark state and the quantum interference exists not only between the two lower states, but also between the two Λ channels. Therefore, the EIT effect occurs only when the ratio of Rabi frequencies in each Λ channel is equal. Ref. [10] pointed out the lossless propagation of shape matched probe pulses interacting with one Λ channel when the strong identical pulses drive another Λ channel. However, the storage mechanism of optical pulse in the standard EIT interaction can be applied to double Λ configuration where two probe pulses can ∗ Corresponding author...|$|R

The paper describes the experimental setups and the results obtained at 295 K for strain rates 10 - 3 s- 1 ≤ dε/dt ≤ 104 s- 1 and plastic strains up to large values ε- 0. 8. Stress-strain diagrams have been found for all conditions mentioned. The rate dependence of stress indicates two regions of the rate sensitivity. The low strain rate range shows only slight rate sensitivity, but it increases rapidly at strain rates above 103 s- 1.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{introduces}} {{an original}} MAC protocol for a passive op-tical {{metropolitan area network}} using time-domain wavelength interleaved net-working (<b>TWIN).</b> <b>Optical</b> channels are shared under the distributed control of destinations using a packet-based polling algorithm. This MAC is inspired more by EPON dynamic bandwidth allocation than the slotted, GPON-like ac-cess control generally envisaged for TWIN. Management of source-destination traffic streams is flow-aware {{with the size of}} allocated time slices being propor-tional to the number of active flows. This emulates a network-wide, distributed fair queuing scheduler, bringing the well-known implicit service differentiation and robustness advantages of this mechanism to the metro area network. The paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation based on analytical modelling supported by simulations. The proposed MAC is shown to have excellent performance in terms of both traffic capacity and packet latency. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{experimental}} realization of a theoretical effect discovered by Olivares and Paris, {{in which a}} pair of entangled optical beams undergoing independent losses can see nonlocal correlations restored {{by the use of}} a nonlocal resource correlating the losses. <b>Twin</b> <b>optical</b> beams created in an entangled Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state by an optical parametric oscillator above threshold were subjected to 50 % loss from beamsplitters in their paths. The resulting severe degradation of the signature quantum correlations observed between the two beams was then suppressed when another, independent EPR state impinged upon the other input ports of the beamsplitters, effectively entangling the losses inflicted to the initial EPR state. The additional EPR beam pair was classically coherent with the primary one but had no quantum correlations with it. This result may find applications as a quantum tap for entanglement.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we compare}} {{the cost of}} the survivable optical {{transport}} solutions with subwavelength switching granularity. The focus is on Time-Domain Wavelength Interleaved Network (<b>TWIN)</b> and Packet <b>Optical</b> Add/Drop Multiplexer (POADM) network. Both technologies exploit <b>optical</b> slot switching: <b>TWIN</b> on a physical mesh topology, and POADM on aphysical ring. The cost model accounts for the node components, the transponder cost and the cost of wavelength use per km of fiber. For the first time, a single network dimensioning model supporting protection is proposed for these metro technologies. The network planning solution is based on linear programming, and addresses the routing and wavelength assignment problem (RWA) and the optimal scheduler calculation. We consider dedicated protection, which consist in doubling the capacity of each operational connection in the network and shared protection, in which the protection capacity is potentially shared between multiple backup flows. By running the linear programming optimization we study the impact of different protection models on the cost of networks in different configurations and identify the scenarios for which each of the technologies is best suited...|$|R

Some particularities of RbLiSO 4 and NH 4 LiSO 4 were also studied. The grown-in and transformation twins of KLiSO 4 were characterized in situ by means of X-ray topography and <b>optical</b> microscopy. The <b>twins</b> of the room-temperature modification were additionally examined by polarity-sensitive experiments. The twin laws and the preferred orientations of the domain walls and phase boundaries were interpreted {{with respect to the}} crystal structures. The ferroelectric domains and the phase boundary of the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of NH 4 LiSO 4 were characterized, too. The crystal structures of the two highly disordered high-temperature modifications II and I were extensively analysed. X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments in the temperature interval from 300 K to 960 K were carried out on (twinned) single crystals. Different structural models were tested and the atomic parameters were refined. For phase II a Pcmn symmetry with a twofold disorder of the SO 4 and LiO 4 tetrahedra could be proved. Apart from the larger displacement parameters of the oxygen atoms it is iso-structural to the Pcmn high-temperature modification of RbLiSO 4. Phase I is characterized by a P 63 /mmc structure with a fourfold disorder of the tetrahedra. Both high-temperature modifications of KLiSO 4 exhibit pronounced quasi-elastic neutron scattering...|$|R

They {{are the first}} satellites of Europe with sub-meter resolution. Airbus DS (formerly Astrium Geo) runs a MyGIC (formerly Pléiades Users Group) program to validate Pléiades images worldwide for various application purposes. The authors conduct three projects, one is within this program, the second is supported by BEU Scientific Research Project Program, {{and the third is}} supported by TÜBİTAK. Assessment of georeferencing accuracy, image quality, pansharpening performance and Digital Surface Model/Digital Terrain Model (DSM/DTM) quality subjects are investigated in these projects. For these purposes, triplet panchromatic (50 cm Ground Sampling Distance (GSD)) and VNIR (2 m GSD) Pléiades 1 A images were investigated over Zonguldak test site (Turkey) which is urbanised, mountainous and covered by dense forest. The georeferencing accuracy was estimated with a standard deviation in X and Y (SX, SY) in the range of 0. 45 m by bias corrected Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RPC) orientation, using ~ 170 Ground Control Points (GCPs). 3 D standard deviation of ± 0. 44 m in X, ± 0. 51 m in Y, and ± 1. 82 m in Z directions have been reached in spite of the very narrow angle of convergence by bias corrected RPC orientation. The image quality was also investigated with respect to effective resolution, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and blur coefficient. The effective resolution was estimated with factor slightly below 1. 0, meaning that the image quality corresponds to the nominal resolution of 50 cm. The blur coefficients were achieved between 0. 39 - 0. 46 for triplet panchromatic images, indicating a satisfying image quality. SNR is in the range of other comparable space borne images which may be caused by de-noising of Pléiades images. The pansharpened images were generated by various methods, and are validated by most common statistical metrics and also visual interpretation.

40|$|Integral field {{spectroscopy}} (IFS) is {{the ability}} to record spectral information from all pixels on an astronomical field. Regions of interest include the cores of galaxies and images produced by gravitational lenses, where the velocities derived from the spectral lines across the whole field of view can map the dynamic conditions of gas and nebulae in these objects. Classical long-slit spectroscopy can only record a single line of information per exposure, and if more data are needed then the slit has to be rotated or moved and another exposure taken. For faint objects that require long integrations only three or four such exposures can be taken in one night, leading to inefficient and incomplete sampling. IFS requires new instrumentation techniques to reformat an area of sky into a long slit suitable for dispersion with a spectrograph, and new computer software to reconstruct the image of the sky for a given spectral line or region. This thesis begins with a review of different IFS techniques, suggesting that the use of optical fibres as spatial reformatters leads to one of the simplest optical designs. Investigating the transmission properties of optical fibre leads to an efficient spectrograph design optimised for use with a dedicated fibre-feed, and such a prototype spectrograph (called SPIRAL - Segmented Pupil/Image Reformatting Array Lenslets) was built and tested at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The techniques for accurately handling and positioning fibres in this prototype are presented. Subsequent developments of these techniques are then successfully used in the construction of an IFS unit and <b>twin</b> <b>optical</b> fibre feed for the Cambridge OH Suppression Instrument (COHSI) infra-red spectrograph. Information from IFS {{is in the form of}} a ‘data cube’, with flux as a function of x, y, and wavelength and this three-dimensional array of data can be interpreted in many ways. The computer data reduction techniques are closely linked with the software needed for presentation and interpretation of the data, and IRAF programs developed for this purpose are presented along with scientific results from the SPIRAL spectrograph. A discussion and some simulations of cross-talk effects induced in closely packed spectra are also presented. The supernova SN 1987 A and the discovery of a brown dwarf with the SPIRAL spectrograph demonstrates the efficiency and capability of IFS for small fields of view. This leads to the design study of a larger fibre image reformatter SPIRAL ‘B’, in which the techniques and methods developed with SPIRAL and COHSI are incorporated. Many of the next generation of telescopes have plans for instruments with IFS capabilities and this thesis goes toward addressing some of the issues involved with these new and powerful instruments...|$|R
