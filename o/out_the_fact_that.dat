5|$|After {{breaking}} up with Owen, Cristina continues to excel at surgery and becomes de facto chief of cardio. Although supportive of Meredith's choice to become a mother, Cristina points <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it has hurt Meredith's career and clinical judgement. This causes a wedge in their friendship. Grey attempts to catch up professionally with a research trial, but the divide widens when Cristina's trial overshadows Grey's and steals Grey's resources. When Dr. Shane Ross, a second-year resident, stands up to Meredith for her, Cristina gives Shane a kiss. Later, she begins sleeping with him, as well as becoming his mentor and passing on the skills learned from Altman. Cristina's project is immensely successful and she is informed {{that she could be}} considered for the Harper Avery award from her 3-D printing of a heart conduit. Grey and Yang reconcile when Grey acknowledges that Yang is correct, she has surpassed Grey, and that Grey is jealous of Yang's professional freedom and success, while her own is hampered by her family.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} seizure of power, Gelimer's {{domestic}} position began to deteriorate, as he persecuted his political enemies among the Vandal nobility, confiscating their property and executing many of them. These actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy {{in the eyes}} of many, and contributed to the outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of the Vandal kingdom: in Sardinia, where the local governor, Godas, declared himself an independent ruler, and shortly after in Tripolitania, where the native population, led by a certain Pudentius, rebelled against Vandal rule. Although Procopius' narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental, Ian Hughes points <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> both rebellions broke out shortly before the commencement of the Roman expedition against the Vandals, and that both Godas and Pudentius immediately asked for assistance from Justinian, as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by the Emperor in their preparation.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{arrive in}} Comity after arguing over {{directions}} along the way. They meet a local detective, Angela White (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), {{and go to}} Boom's funeral. Scully, in a bad mood, is skeptical of these claims. The high school principal, Bob Spitz, interrupts the funeral by ranting Inquisitorial-style about Satanic cults murdering their children when suddenly the coffin starts smoking and catches on fire. Mulder and Scully go into separate rooms to interview Margi and Terri, both of whom offer an identical story about a satanic ceremony where a baby was sacrificed. Scully thinks their stories are cliché and points <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the belief in a satanic conspiracy is illogical and paranoid. Looking at the latest victim's body, Mulder and Detective White find a burn mark {{in the shape of}} a horned beast; Scully says she doesn't see anything. Mulder goes to see White to apologize for Scully's behavior and the two visit the local astrologist Madame Zirinka who claims the town's crazy behavior is due to the rare planetary alignment of the planets Mars, Uranus, and Mercury. Terri and Margi watch basketball practice, lusting over one of the players, Scott, whose girlfriend is fellow cheerleader Brenda (much to Terri and Margi's displeasure). One of the other players accidentally spills a table of drinks on them, so they cause the basketball to bounce underneath the bleachers and it closes when he goes to get it, killing him. Scully is angry at Mulder for ditching her to be with Detective White.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its small}} size, Singapore has a {{diversity}} of languages, religions, and cultures. Former Prime Ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have stated that Singapore does not fit the traditional description of a nation, calling it a society-in-transition, pointing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Singaporeans do not all speak the same language, share the same religion, or have the same customs. Even though English is the first language of the nation, according to the 2010 census, 20% of Singaporeans are illiterate in English.

It featured questions from journalists Roberto Napoletano of Il Messaggero and Marcello Sorgi of La Stampa. It was watched by over 16 million people, {{a record for}} a political TV show. During his final speech, Berlusconi, who often overran his intervention times, attacked {{the rules of the}} debate, in his opinion too strict, whereas Prodi praised them, pointing <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they are used in US debates this way, as well. Some observers commented that Berlusconi had been disappointing in this debate, scribbling nervously while he was talking and at a point confusing Iran and Iraq; while all politicians claimed their candidate had won the debate, it was generally agreed that Berlusconi had not dealt a strong blow to Prodi.|$|E
25|$|By 1931 {{the planes}} {{used by the}} Aeronáutica Naval were {{becoming}} obsolete. Commander Francisco Moreno Fernández made a survey between 1932 and 1933 {{and concluded that the}} old Dornier and Savoia seaplanes were not fit to carry aerial torpedoes or bombs and were only fit for reconnaissance missions. Some Vickers Vildebeest were being built under license by CASA for the Aeronáutica Naval, but they had not been ordered with weapon-carrying systems, therefore many officers had doubts about their usefulness. Those officers concerned about the modernization of the Republican Armada also pointed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> none of the newest vessels at that time were equipped to carry planes. The seaplane carrier , although it had very useful and efficient aircraft-repair workshops on it, was a slow and old steamer that could not last much longer, in the words of Admiral Francisco Moreno.|$|E
25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they end up making love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he is the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go {{of the fact that he}} never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

500|$|The final scene, {{featuring}} {{a conversation between}} Mulder and Scully, has been examined by author V. Alan White due to its perceived religious undertones. In the book The Philosophy of The X-Files, {{he notes that the}} final scene [...] "undermines Mulder's seemingly persistent scorn of traditional" [...] religion and his subtle acceptance of theism. In previous episodes—mainly those dealing with Scully's Catholicism—Mulder shows a lack of approval {{when it came to the}} concept of organized religion, often pointing out that [...] "theologians can be just as dogmatic as scientists" [...] when it comes to unexplained phenomena. White proposes that this needling may be intentional on Mulder's part, as a form of [...] "ironic reversal of [...] skepticism about the paranormal". However, the final lines of [...] "The Truth" [...] see Mulder talking about a belief in [...] "something greater than us, greater than any alien force". White also points <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> during this scene Mulder grabs Scully's gold cross, an icon that symbolizes her belief through much of the series.|$|E
500|$|In April 1945, Waddy joined Caldwell, Arthur, Gibbes {{and four}} other senior pilots of No.1 TAF in an action that {{became known as the}} [...] "Morotai Mutiny". The eight {{attempted}} to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of the RAAF's fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Earlier that month, Waddy had asked his intelligence officer to produce a [...] "profit and loss statement" [...] for No.80 Squadron, covering the period 1October 1944 to 31March 1945, in order to [...] "bring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the expenditure by the squadron was not compensated for by the achievements of the Squadron". In that time, Waddy had lost eleven pilots with the unit, including seven to enemy action. Arthur had produced a similar [...] "balance sheet" [...] for No.81 Wing. Both had become frustrated with the lack of attention paid by superior officers to their concerns regarding the usefulness of No.1 TAF operations. At the subsequent inquiry into events on Morotai, Justice John Vincent Barry cleared the pilots of fault over the incident, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere. Waddy continued to lead No.80 Squadron until handing over command on 1June 1945. For his service in the Pacific, he was mentioned in despatches and awarded the US Air Medal, the former promulgated on 25June 1946 and the latter on 1July 1948.|$|E
