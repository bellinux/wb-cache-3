5|$|Some {{scientific}} {{studies suggest that}} <b>ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. <b>Ozone</b> <b>depletion</b> over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling {{has the effect of}} intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E

This paper presents methodology for detection of <b>ozone</b> layer <b>depletion</b> using satellite imagery of O 3. The chlorofluorocarbon and the Greenhouse gases are potent ozone depletors. One {{of the main reasons}} for the widespread concern about <b>depletion</b> of the <b>ozone</b> layer is the anticipated increase in the amounts of ultraviolet radiation received at {{the surface of the earth}} and the effect of this on human health and on the environment. The present analysis applies k-means clustering on the satellite imagery in order to compute normality for O 3. By using normality, pH value is computed and if the value lies in the range of 1 ≤ pH ≤ 5, it is identified as <b>ozone</b> layer <b>depletion.</b> The proposed methodology is addressed for the first time using data mining and image processing.
