5|$|After the Santa Ana Register {{published}} its article, {{a nationwide}} network <b>of</b> <b>activists</b> began a vociferous campaign to torpedo the Alaska Mental Health Bill. The campaigners included, among other groups and individuals, the white supremacist Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith; Women for God and Country; the For America League; the Minute Women of the U.S.A.; the right-wing agitator Dan Smoot; the anti-Catholic former US Army Brigadier General Herbert C.

Activists such a Richardson shared the aim of Landmarks to rehabilitate Pittsburgh's existing built landscape rather than to demolish and redevelop.|$|E
40|$|Although {{discourse}} analysis {{methods have been}} used for the critical analysis <b>of</b> <b>activist</b> practice theories, the application of these methods to practice processes has remained a largely unchartered territory. A chief aim {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the possibilities {{discourse analysis}} offers for the investigation <b>of</b> <b>activist</b> practice processes. The paper introduces a discourse model which combines poststructural discourse principles and conversation analysis methods. The model is then applied to the study of the effects <b>of</b> <b>activist</b> perspectives for service users and workers within a context <b>of</b> <b>activist</b> practice in which one of the authors has been involved as a social worker. This analysis reveals the local interactions amongst workers and service users to be considerably more complex than has been allowed within activist practice discourses...|$|R

5|$|Câmpineanu, who had {{proposed}} a reformist constitution {{to replace the}} Regulament entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation <b>of</b> <b>activists,</b> both Wallachian and Moldavian. The latter group, comprising many young boyars who had studied in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the Carbonari (and even, through Teodor Diamant, from Utopian socialism). It was this faction who would first explicitly publicize the demands for national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and European solidarity. Societatea Studenților Români (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine for its honorary president.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 the DF renamed {{itself the}} Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and {{underwent}} an internal reorganisation. However, {{the group was}} facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division {{between the two groups}} developed into open conflict, with the majority <b>of</b> <b>activists</b> sharing Morris' position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters – most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling – left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1913, Stojanović {{commenced}} {{the final year of}} his secondary education. National Unity was visited that year by a group <b>of</b> <b>activists</b> of Young Bosnia who were university students in Prague, Vienna, and Switzerland. They held a series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of South Slavic peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanović to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ilić and Stojanović became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of National Unity, which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats. At that time, National Unity {{was one of the most}} active groups of Young Bosnia.|$|E

5|$|When he {{came upon}} the Meng River, he {{found it to be}} guarded, but crossed anyway and was not stopped; he later stated that he {{believed}} the guards had been asleep. Though he recollected his immediate surroundings from his childhood explorations, he eventually passed into less familiar territory; he later told his supporters that he fell more than 200 times during his escape. Communicating with a network <b>of</b> <b>activists</b> via a cell phone, he reached a pre-determined rendezvous point where He Peirong, an English teacher and activist, was waiting for him. A chain of human rights activists then escorted him to Beijing. Several of the activists reported to be involved were detained or disappeared in the days following the announcement of Chen's escape.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu {{was also}} {{introduced}} to Frederica, Duchess of Cumberland, and became relatively {{close to her}} son George of Cumberland and Teviotdale, the future ruler of Hanover. Initially hosted by a community of the Huguenot diaspora, he later became the guest of a Calvinist pastor named Jonas, in whose residence he witnessed gatherings <b>of</b> <b>activists</b> in favor of German unification (see Burschenschaft). According to his own recollections, his group of Moldavians was kept under close watch by Alexandru Sturdza, who, in addition, enlisted Kogălniceanu's help in writing his work Études historiques, chrétiennes et morales ("Historical, Christian and Moral Studies"). During summer trips to the Pomeranian town of Heringsdorf, he met the novelist Willibald Alexis, whom he befriended, and who, as Kogălniceanu recalled, lectured him on the land reform carried out by Prussian King Frederick William III. Later, Kogălniceanu studied the effects of reform when on visit to Alt Schwerin, and saw the possibility for replicating its results in his native country.|$|E
5|$|Once Birmingham Dissenters {{started to}} agitate for {{the repeal of}} the Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted}} Dissenters' civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town's elite disappeared. Unitarians such as Priestley were {{at the forefront of the}} repeal campaign, and orthodox Anglicans grew nervous and angry. After 1787, the emergence of Dissenting groups formed for the sole purpose of overturning these laws began to divide the community; however, the repeal efforts failed in 1787, 1789, and 1790. Priestley's support of the repeal and his heterodox religious views, which were widely published, inflamed the populace. In February 1790, a group <b>of</b> <b>activists</b> came together not only to oppose the interests of the Dissenters but also to counteract what they saw as the undesirable importation of French Revolutionary ideals. Dissenters by and large supported the French Revolution and its efforts to question the role monarchy should play in government.|$|E

No local farmers participated in the uprooting; only the small number <b>of</b> <b>activists</b> damaged the golden rice crops because the farmers believe local customs which imply that killing a living rice plant is unlucky.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the “activist effect” on the levels and structures of CEO compensation {{when a company}} is targeted by a sample <b>of</b> <b>activist</b> groups. Activist investors are focused funds that use their resources to influence management of target investments {{in an effort to}} increase shareholder value. Due to their efforts to impose return enhancing agendas on the management <b>of</b> targets, <b>activists</b> have developed a reputation as “raiders” and are commonly feared by management. In this paper, the nature <b>of</b> <b>activist</b> investing is discussed, including a review of previous research on activism, and an explanation of why compensation changes are a logical focus for extension of the previous research. The study is based on a sample of hand-collected data <b>of</b> 53 <b>activist</b> investments from 2007 to 2008. This analysis finds that contrary to fears, evidence suggests that the presence <b>of</b> an <b>activist</b> – particularly larger more famous activist investors – is associated with an increase in total CEO compensation achieved through a change in compensation structure...|$|R
