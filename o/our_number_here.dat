40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{construct}} new families of special numbers with their generating functions. These numbers are related to the many well-known numbers, which are the Bernoulli numbers, the Fibonacci numbers, the Lucas numbers, the Stirling numbers of the second kind and the central factorial <b>numbers.</b> <b>Our</b> other inspiration of this paper is related to the Golombek's problem golombek“ Aufgabe 1088, El. Math. 49 (1994) 126 - 127 ”. <b>Our</b> first <b>numbers</b> are not only related to the Golombek's problem, but also computation of the negative order Euler numbers. We compute a few values of the numbers which are given by some tables. We give some applications in Probability and Statistics. That is, special values of mathematical expectation in the binomial distribution and the Bernstein polynomials give us the value of <b>our</b> <b>numbers.</b> Taking derivative of our generating functions, we give partial differential equations and also functional equations. By using these equations, we derive recurrence relations and some formulas of <b>our</b> <b>numbers.</b> Moreover, we give two algorithms for computation <b>our</b> <b>numbers.</b> We also give some combinatorial applications, further remarks on <b>our</b> <b>numbers</b> and their generating functions.
