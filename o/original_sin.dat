5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b> If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|For ten centuries {{after the}} fall of the Roman Empire, {{lesbianism}} disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind; <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> among women was a particular concern, especially because women were perceived as creating life. During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.|$|E

5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from <b>original</b> <b>sin,</b> and may even be the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{believed}} that Burnt Norton could benefit society. The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} <b>Original</b> <b>Sin,</b> that they can follow the paths of either good or evil, {{and that they can}} atone for their sins. To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world and look into their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E
5|$|In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, {{published}} in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance on free will {{and argued that}} it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.|$|E

5|$|Pfeiffer {{chose to}} begin the process of {{dissolving}} her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called, <b>Original</b> <b>Sin</b> (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> and Adam's fall {{when talking about}} the past and points out that such events can be {{forgotten}} but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
50|$|The Hardest Way is {{the second}} album by American garage punk band The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins,</b> {{released}} in 1989 through Psonik Records. The CD version of the album included bonus tracks that {{were taken from the}} band's Australia-only extended play Party's Over.|$|R

50|$|Big Soul is {{the debut}} album of American garage punk band The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins,</b> {{released}} in 1987 through Bar/None Records on vinyl format. The record was reissued in 1994 on CD format, which included bonus tracks, an alternative track listing, and different artwork.|$|R
5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b> All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E
5|$|The twentieth-century philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr {{attempted}} to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy {{in the light}} of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without mythology. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil ontological existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the Pelagian view that human will could overcome sin on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b> He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.|$|E
5000|$|Out There is {{the fifth}} studio album by garage rock band The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins,</b> {{released}} during the later half of 1992, {{only a couple of}} months after their previous release Move. It is the first album by the group to feature drummer Seth Baer.|$|R
50|$|During an {{interview}} session, John Terlesky called the album his favorite release by The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins.</b> He also mentioned {{the possibility of}} reissuing the record some time after the band's breakup, which would have included live recordings as bonus tracks, but the reissue has yet {{to see the light}} of day.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins</b> were {{a garage}} rock band that formed in 1987 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The group were known for {{combining}} the musical stylings of punk rock, psychedelic rock, and even pop music with their songs. The band released {{a total of}} nine full-length studio albums across their entire career before they band broke up in early 1998.|$|R
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from <b>original</b> <b>sin,</b> but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} {{includes}} several essays on <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> {{and the fall}} of man, which directly refer to Augustine, who developed these doctrines. He often cited the Church Fathers in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology. In Calvin's view, sin began {{with the fall of}} Adam and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil. Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived {{during the time of the}} Old Testament. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the Old Covenant was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes the New Covenant using the passage from the Apostles' Creed that describes Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate and his return to judge the living and the dead. For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience to the Father removed the discord between humanity and God.|$|E
50|$|In New York {{they saw}} Robyn Hitchcock in concert; in Washington, D.C. they met Tommy Keene and saw The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins.</b> They then headed to Easter's studio in Winston-Salem, where R.E.M. had {{recorded}} their first album, to find to their disappointment that the Drive-In Studio {{was no more}} than a converted sleep out at Easter's parents' house.|$|R
5000|$|Acidbubblepunk is {{the sixth}} {{full-length}} studio album by garage rock band The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins,</b> released in 1994 through Psonik records. The album {{is considered by}} many fans as a disappointing record, with Trouser Press referring to the record as a [...] "disappointing drop in Original Sins' standards". The album cover was drawn by frontman John Terlesky.|$|R
50|$|Turn You On is {{the seventh}} studio album by garage rock band The <b>Original</b> <b>Sins,</b> which was {{independently}} released in 1995 through there very own Bedlam Records imprint, a label John Terlesky uses to release his solo material. The album was only ever released as a limited edition vinyl, with its artwork screen printed by hand.|$|R
5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on <b>original</b> <b>sin,</b> Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E
5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected quantum jump upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Anglican Geoffrey Paxton, {{during the}} 1960s {{scholars}} such as Ford and Edward Heppenstall began to try to highlight {{a shift in the}} concept of <b>original</b> <b>sin</b> within the SDA church, away from its foundational belief that Seventh-day Adventists do not believe in <b>original</b> <b>sin.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Original</b> {{antigenic}} <b>sin</b> is {{the phenomenon}} in which prior exposure to an antigen {{leads to a}} subsequent suboptimal immune response to a related antigen. Immune memory normally allows for an improved and rapid response to antigens previously seen and is the mechanism by which vaccination works. I here develop a dynamical system model of the mechanism of <b>original</b> antigenic <b>sin</b> in influenza, clarifying and explaining the detailed spin-glass treatment of <b>original</b> antigenic <b>sin.</b> The dynamical system describes the viral load, the quantities of healthy and infected epithelial cells, the concentrations of naı̈ve and memory antibodies, and the affinities of naı̈ve and memory antibodies. I give explicit correspondences between the microscopic variables of the spin-glass model {{and those of the}} present dynamical system model. The dynamical system model reproduces the phenomenon of <b>original</b> antigenic <b>sin</b> and describes how a competition between different types of B cells compromises the overall effect of immune response. I illustrate the competition between the naı̈ve and the memory antibodies {{as a function of the}} antigenic distance between the initial and subsequent antigens. The suboptimal immune response caused by <b>original</b> antigenic <b>sin</b> is observed when the host is exposed to an antigen which has intermediate antigenic distance to a second antigen previously recognized by the host’s immune system...|$|R
