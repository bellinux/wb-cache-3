40|$|Purpose: Ultrasonic seaming: the pertained {{technology}} {{for this research}} is identified {{as one of the}} alternatives which offers many advantages over traditional sewing. Ultrasonic technology was initially used for plastic welding. It has been utilized in automotive, electronics and electrical appliances, filtration, packaging, aerospace and apparel industries. However, the use of sewing machine, needle and threads still remains as the most popular method of joining fabrics together. The aim of this research is to investigate the possibility of constructing different types of seams for clothing using ultrasonic technology which is an existing technology that is not fully utilized and not fully realized the advantages associated with it in the apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental reflective practice' was used as the main method for practical investigation. The basis for analysis was formed by reflections made during and after the experimentations. Findings: Though the construction of the seams are possible, due to thickness of the layers, LSc and LSe seam types were not successful in terms of quality. The bound seam type and the flat seams are possible using ultrasonic technology without the blade, the quality is not satisfactory when comparing to the conventional sewing technique. However, <b>ornamental</b> <b>stitching</b> (OS) and edge finishing (EF) with ultrasonic are possible and successful. Originality/value: The results of this study will shed more light on ways of using ultrasonic technology in the apparel industry...|$|E

At its times, couples dance forming the pandilla (a kind of dance) around the humishas - trees adorned with quitasueños, small mirrors, <b>ornamental</b> chain <b>stitches</b> and pennants.

Besides the now widely used cross-stitch, {{there is still}} the <b>ornamental</b> needle-weaving <b>stitch</b> called “nyzynka”, which is executed predominantly on the reverse of the fabric and gives a sort of “tweed” effect. This {{is one of the most}} archaic of traditional Ukrainian stitches that, in combination with the predetermined areas of white background material that peek through the densely laid threads, emphasizes the clear-cut silhouette of the main patterns.|$|R
