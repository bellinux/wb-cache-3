25|$|Until summer 2018 {{there will}} be major track, {{signalling}} and station remodelling works at London Bridge station {{as part of the}} Masterplan project (some works within the station building started during Key Output 1). A grade-separated junction is being created at Bermondsey. New permanent way (track level, in this case including both plain rail and junctions) and overhead line equipment will be laid out in the new Canal Tunnels just north of St Pancras between the Thameslink route and the East Coast Main Line, thereby opening up the Thameslink network to new destinations north of London.

50|$|It {{is notable}} {{for being the}} only swing bridge in the United Kingdom to carry an {{overhead}} electrified railway track (25kV 50Hz). Other examples can be found along the Northeast Corridor in the United States; see for instance Portal Bridge, and the Galata Bridge over the Golden Horn in Istanbul. The power supply to trains is provided by an <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> instead of a wire, and there are short lengths of <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> {{either side of the}} bridge on the fixed approaches. There is a 40 mph speed limit over the bridge in both directions as trains are about to arrive at, or have just departed from, Norwich Station.|$|E
50|$|Unusual {{engineering}} {{works on}} the line include the road-rail Cize-Bolozon viaduct, carrying the railway on the high level and the road on the low level and the <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> used in the Bolozon I and Bolozon II tunnels and the open track in between. There are few examples of overhead conductor rails in France {{and this is the}} first at 25kV.|$|E
50|$|Where {{there is}} limited {{clearance}} such as in tunnels, the overhead wire may be replaced by rigid overhead rail. An early example was in the tunnels of the Baltimore Belt Line, where a ∏ section bar (fabricated from three strips of iron and mounted on wood) was used, with the brass contact running inside the groove. When the overhead line {{was raised in the}} Simplon Tunnel to accommodate taller rolling stock a rail was used. A rigid overhead rail may also be used in places where tensioning the wires is impractical, for example on moveable bridges. Short <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rails</b> are also installed at tram stops as for the Combino Supra.|$|R
25|$|Three-phase {{systems have}} the serious {{disadvantage}} of requiring {{at least two}} separate <b>overhead</b> <b>conductors</b> plus <b>rail</b> return.

5000|$|There are 3 fixed {{approach}} spans at the Norwich city end and {{the main}} swing bridge section. The swing bridge raises some 300 mm on 4 main jacks, mounted on to substantial sub-frame in the turning pit. The swing bridge raises to clear the fixed span and land abutment's scarfed rail joints and to also clear the fixed <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rails,</b> which are gantry mounted to the swing bridge and the approach spans. The bridge [...] "slew" [...] is provided by 2 hydraulic motors driving against the main slewing ring bearing, manufactured by Robello. The swing bridge section is constructed to be a flat span in the open to rail/service position and not cambered, as are many other bridges.|$|R
5000|$|Siemens three car trams {{are to be}} {{used for}} Education City in Doha, the capital of Qatar. The opening was {{scheduled}} for autumn 2015 but has been delayed until 2019.

50|$|The new tunnel is {{the first}} in Western Australia to use a rigid <b>{{overhead}}</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> instead of overhead wires, the same system as used on the Madrid Metro. With overhead wires, the clearance between the new tunnel and the existing Joondalup line tunnel is only 75 cm. By using a conductor rail, the new tunnel could be built to a smaller diameter, allowing for an increased clearance between the two. The new tunnel opened on 18 July 2013.|$|E
5000|$|A {{consortium}} led by Siemens {{is building}} a tram system for Education City in Doha, the capital of Qatar. The opening was scheduled for autumn 2015 but has been delayed to 2016.

50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry collector shoes projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the guide bars on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level power supply systems, stud contact systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a stud contact system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the studs. Contact shoes may also be used on <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rails,</b> on guide bars or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R
50|$|Finally, a short freight-only line, the Newcastle Quayside Branch {{left the}} Tynemouth lines {{just east of}} Manors East station at Trafalgar South yard, {{opposite}} Argyle Street signal box, and emerged after traversing through three tunnels into the Quayside yard adjacent to the quayside at Newcastle. This route was equipped with both <b>overhead</b> line and <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> to enable electric operation in June 1905.|$|R
5000|$|The early systems used a low {{frequency}} ( [...] Hz), and {{a relatively low}} voltage (3,000 or 3,600 volts) compared with later AC systems. The system provides regenerative braking with the power fed back to the system, so it is particularly suitable for mountain railways provided the supply grid or another locomotive on the line can accept the power. Three-phase systems have the serious disadvantage of requiring at least two separate <b>overhead</b> <b>conductors</b> plus <b>rail</b> return. Locomotives operate at one, two or four constant speeds.

50|$|In February 2012, a {{recharging}} {{facility was}} {{built at the}} station {{for use by the}} experimental NE Train battery railcar, which is undergoing testing on the line. The recharging facility consists of a rigid <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> enabling the train to be recharged via its pantograph. The <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> bar is electrified at 1,500 V DC, powered from the local electricity grid 6.6 kV AC supply.|$|R
50|$|With the {{political}} {{support of the}} rural districts (Landkreis) of Rastatt and Freudenstadt, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (Alb Valley Transport Company, AVG), leased the Murg Valley Railway from Deutsche Bahn until 2000 by lease and upgraded it in subsequent years for light rail operations. The renovations included the electrification of the line on the 15 Kv AC 16.7 Hz system, duplication between Kuppenheim and Bad Rotenfels, the construction or reconstruction of crossing loops in Hörden, Hilpertsau, Langenbrand, Raumünzach and Heselbach, the construction of 14 new stations and the upgrading the existing stations, replacement of the signal and safety systems and the rehabilitation of bridges and tunnels. During the electrification of the tunnel sections, {{for the first time}} in Germany, <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> was installed on open line. This rail could be supported by masts outside the tunnel so that the number of masts required could be significantly reduced. A total of € 53 million was invested in infrastructure.|$|E
40|$|In <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> lines, {{aluminium}} beams {{are usually}} mounted with support spacing between 8 and 12 meters, {{to limit the}} maximum vertical deflection {{in the center of}} the span. This small support spacing limits the use of <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> to tunnels, therefore it has been used almost exclusively in metropolitan networks, with operation speeds below 110 km/h. Nevertheless, due to the lower cost of maintenance required for this electrification system, some railway administrations are beginning to install it in some tunnels on long-distance lines, requesting higher operation speeds [1]. Some examples are the Barcelona and Madrid suburban networks (Spain), and recent lines in Turkey and Malaysia. In order to adapt the design of the overhead conductor for higher speeds (V > 160 km/h), particular attention must be paid to the geometry of the conductor rail in critical zones as overlaps, crossings and, especially, transitions between conductor rail and conventional catenary, since the use of <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> is limited to tunnels, as already mentioned. This paper describes simulation techniques developed in order to take into account these critical zones. Furthermore, some specific simulations results are presented that have been used to analyze and optimizes the geometry of this special zones to get a better current collection quality, in a real suburban network. This paper presents the work undertaken by the Railways Technology Research Centre (CITEF), having over 10 years of experience in railways research [1 - 4]...|$|E
40|$|Overhead rigid {{conductor}} {{arrangements for}} current collection for railway traction have some advantages compared to other, more conventional, energy supply systems. They are simple, robust and easily maintained, {{not to mention}} their flexibility as to the required height for installation, which makes them particularly suitable for use in subway infrastructures. Nevertheless, due to the increasing speeds of new vehicles running on modern subway lines, a more efficient design is required {{for this kind of}} system. In this paper, the authors present a dynamic analysis of <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> systems focused on the design of a new conductor profile with a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. This means that either an increase in running speed can be attained, which at present does not exceed 110 km/h, or an increase in the distance between the rigid catenary supports with the ensuing saving in installation costs. This study has been carried out using simulation techniques. The ANSYS programme has been used for the finite element modelling and the SIMPACK programme for the elastic multibody systems analysis...|$|E

40|$|Overhead rail current {{collector}} systems for railway traction offer certain features, such as low installation height and reduced maintenance, which make them predominantly {{suitable for use}} in underground train infrastructures. Due to the increased demands of modern catenary systems and higher running speeds of new vehicles, a more capable design of the conductor rail is needed. A new <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> <b>rail</b> has been developed and its design has been patented [13]. Modern simulation and modelling techniques {{were used in the}} development approach. The new conductor rail profile has a dynamic behaviour superior to that of the system currently in use. Its innovative design permits either an increase of catenary support spacing or a higher vehicle running speed. Both options ensure savings in installation or operating costs. The simulation model used to optimise the existing conductor rail profile included both a finite element model of the catenary and a three-dimensional multi-body system model of the pantograph. The contact force that appears between pantograph and catenary was obtained in simulation. A sensitivity analysis of the key parameters that influence in catenary dynamics was carried out, finally leading to the improved design...|$|E
