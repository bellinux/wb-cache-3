40|$|Sintered {{silicon carbide}} (SSiC) is {{becoming}} {{one of the most important}} materials for the optical mirrors due to its excellent specific stiffness (E/ρ) and demission stability (λ/α). However, it is difficult to fabricate the monolithic structure SSiC optical mirror with demission of larger than Φ 1. 5 m because of process limitation. Joining of SSiC segments (brazing) provide a good solution to prepare large size mirror optics. However, compared with the uniform properties of the monolithic structure SSiC optical mirror, the brazed mirror is composed of two materials (SSiC segments and brazing material), so the performance of <b>optical</b> <b>grinding</b> and reliability of brazed optical mirrors become the focus. In this paper, the Φ 300 mm and Φ 600 mm brazed optical mirrors was used to evaluate the reliability of different conditions.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{fabricating}} a precise, diffraction- limited, ultra-lightweight, composite- material (matrix/fiber) paraboloidal telescope mirror has been devised. Unlike the traditional {{process of fabrication}} of heavier glass-based mirrors, this process involves a minimum of manual steps and subjective judgment. Instead, this process involves objectively controllable, repeatable steps; hence, this process is better suited for mass production. Other processes that have been investigated for fabrication of precise composite-material lightweight mirrors have resulted in print-through of fiber patterns onto reflecting surfaces, and have not provided adequate structural support for maintenance of stable, diffraction-limited surface figures. In contrast, this process does not result in print-through of the fiber pattern onto the reflecting surface and does provide a lightweight, rigid structure capable of maintaining a diffraction-limited surface figure {{in the face of}} changing temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The process consists mainly of the following steps: 1. A precise glass mandrel is fabricated by conventional <b>optical</b> <b>grinding</b> and polishing. 2. The mandrel is coated with a release agent and covered with layers of a carbon- fiber composite material. 3. The outer surface of the outer layer of the carbon-fiber composite material is coated with a surfactant chosen to provide for the proper flow of an epoxy resin to be applied subsequently. 4. The mandrel as thus covered is mounted on a temperature-controlled spin table. 5. The table is heated to a suitable temperature and spun at a suitable speed as the epoxy resin is poured onto the coated carbon-fiber composite material. 6. The surface figure of the optic is monitored and adjusted by use of traditional Ronchi, Focault, and interferometric optical measurement techniques while the speed of rotation and the temperature are adjusted to obtain the desired figure. The proper selection of surfactant, speed or rotation, viscosity of the epoxy, and temperature make it possible to obtain the desired diffraction-limited, smooth (1 / 50 th wave) parabolic outer surface, suitable for reflective coating. 7. A reflective coat is applied by use of conventional coating techniques. 8.

The dimension of a triangular pyramid with acute angle of 85 on the W-steel mold is about 300 lm in width and 139 lm in height. The pitch between two triangular-pyramidal tips is about 170 lm. Then, only {{the portion of}} the tip area of the triangular-pyramidal patterns is transferred on bulk metallic glass (BMG, Mg 58 Cu 31 Y 11) using this mod-ified multi-step hot-embossing method to reduce the pattern size.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} advanced {{tools for}} ultra precision grinding which offer a high wear resistance {{and can be}} used to generate high-quality parts with an ultraprecise surface finish. The first approach features defined dressed, coarse-grained, single layered, metal bonded diamond grinding wheels. These grinding wheels are called Engineered Grinding Wheels and have been dressed by an adapted conditioning process which leads to uniform abrasive grain protrusion heights and flattened grains. This paper shows the results from <b>grinding</b> <b>optical</b> glasses with such Engineered Grinding Wheels regarding the specific forces and the surface roughness. The results show that the cutting mechanism turns into ductile removal and optical surfaces are achievable. On the other hand, the specific normal force F´n increases due to increased contact area of the flattened diamond grains. It is shown that the topography of the Engineered Grinding Wheels has a strong beneficial influence on surface roughness. The second new tool for ultra precision grinding is made of a CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) poly-crystalline diamond layer with sharp edges of micrometre-sized diamond crystallites as a special type of abrasive. The sharp edges of the crystallites act as cutting edges which can be used for grinding. It is shown that by using CVD-diamond-coated grinding wheels a high material removal rate and a high surface finish with surface roughness in the nanometre range can be achieved. The CVD-diamond layers exhibit higher wear resistance compared to conventional metal and resin bonded diamond wheels. In conclusion, this paper shows that not only conventional fine grained, multi-layered resinoid diamond grinding wheels but also coarse-grained and binderless CVD-coated diamond grinding wheels can be applied to machine brittle and hard materials by ultra precision grinding...|$|R

Different types of coolant conditions were generated throughout the application of heat pump and megasonic actuating nozzle. Normal, actively cooled, megasonic and actively cooled megasonic coolant were obtained. Simulation results shown that almost all heat generated from the grinding zone is taken away by the cooled coolant.. Megasonic and actively cooled megasonic coolant can act as better machines not only provide better surface quality, but also reduce the stress containing inside the machined workpiece even if deeper depth of cut is applied.

40|$|Machining of {{hard and}} brittle {{materials}} always pose {{problems such as}} rough surface, cracks, subsurface damage and residual stresses mainly due to its brittle nature. Recent developments in cutting tool technology coupled with rigid ultraprecision machine tools {{have made it possible}} to machine hard and brittle materials like optical glass in ductile mode with crack free surfaces. However this technique is reported to be relatively slow and too expensive for manufacturing less precision products like ophthalmic lenses, which do not require extreme form accuracy. Though not possible to machine glass in fully ductile mode with conventional grinding, substantial amount of partial ductile mode areas generated on the ground surface is proven to reduce polishing time significantly to get mirror finish. In this study, resinoid bonded diamond pins, with and without a central hole were used to <b>grind</b> BK 7 <b>optical</b> glass. Plano <b>grinding</b> operation was carried out using a high-speed jig grinder air motor, which was attached to a vertical spindle CNC milling machine. Both wet and dry grinding operations were performed. In wet grinding, ductile-fracture areas and surface roughness of ground surface were investigated by varying grinding conditions. Diamond grinding pins with and without central hole were found to have an effect on surface finish and flatness on the ground surfaces. Central holed diamond pins produced better surface finish and were 5 times superior in flatness compared to surfaces ground with diamond pins without central hole. Subsequently, zero velocity effect that cause chips trapped underneath of diamond pins are completely eliminated. Insufficient coolant penetration into grinding zone and fixture rigidity were found to have contributed stalling marks. Applications of higher coolant flow rate of 5 litres/min together with a rigid pocket groove holder were successfully used to eliminate stalling and this set-up was used in subsequent experimental trials for ductile-fracture and surface roughness analysis. Maximum ductile streaks were obtained at the lowest feed (5 mm/min) and in-feed (5 Âµm) for both 64 Âµm and 126 Âµm grit diamond pins. Finer ductile streaks were observed with 64 Âµm than 126 Âµm grit diamond pins in almost all conditions probably due to grain size effects. An image processing procedure has been successfully developed to quantify objectively the fraction of ductile and fracture areas generated on ground surfaces. Among the four alternatives developed, method B provided the least error. A linear relationship model was established for surface roughness when grinding with 64 Âµm grit diamond pins. The feed was found to have significant effect on the response investigated. The model was verified by the confirmation run and therefore can be used for prediction within the limits of the factors investigated. In dry grinding, various types of chips morphology were observed. A discovery was made during this study, namely the observation of solid spherical glass chips obtained at the lowest cutting condition (feed = 2. 5 mm/min and infeed = 5 Âµm) and its formation mechanism is described. ...|$|R
