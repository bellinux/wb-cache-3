In the late 1970s, Charley and Humphrey were spun off into a daily children's program on KTVU, which was hosted by McCormick. Channel 2 also served as the Bay Area's <b>originating</b> <b>station</b> for the children's television program franchise Romper Room; originally hosted by Nancy Besst, the half-hour program aired at 8:30a.m. on weekday mornings {{for much of the}} 1980s.|$|E

25|$|On August 6, 2010, the CBC {{issued a}} press release stating that due to {{financial}} reasons, the CBC and Radio-Canada would only transition 27 transmitters total, one in each market where there was an <b>originating</b> <b>station</b> (i.e. a CBC or Radio-Canada television station located in that market). Further, the CBC stated in the release, that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by August 31, 2011 {{due to lack of}} available funds, and that the remainder would not be on the air until as late as August 31, 2012. Additionally, the CBC stated in the release that it was asking the CRTC for permission to continue broadcasting in analogue until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running. At the time of the press release, only eight of the corporation's transmitters (four CBC and four Radio Canada) were broadcasting in digital.|$|E
25|$|TV station callsigns in Canada {{are usually}} {{made up of}} four letters, {{although}} two stations have three call letters (CKX in Brandon and CKY in Winnipeg) and some (primarily CBC-owned Radio-Canada stations) have five. The first call letter is always C, and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the two-letter combinations of CF, CH, CI, CJ, or CK. The combinations CG, CY, CZ and several combinations beginning with V and X are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to take a call sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule for the call letters of rebroadcasterssome are labelled by the call-letters of the <b>originating</b> <b>station,</b> followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters CH followed by four numbers.

2500|$|The first RTTY Contest {{was held}} by the RTTY Society of Southern California from October 31 to November 1, 1953. [...] Named the RTTY Sweepstakes Contest, twenty nine {{participants}} exchanged messages that contained a serial number, <b>originating</b> <b>station</b> call, check or RST report {{of two or three}} numbers, ARRL section of originator, local time (0000-2400 preferred) and date. Example: NR 23 W0BP CK MINN 1325 FEB 15. By the late 1950s, the contest exchange was expanded to include band used. Example: NR 23 W0BP CK MINN 1325 FEB 15 FORTY METERS. The contest was scored as follows: one point for each message sent and receipted entirely by RTTY and one point for each message received and acknowledged by RTTY. The final score was computed by multiplying the total number of message points by the number of ARRL sections worked. Two stations could exchange messages again on a different band for added points, but the section multiplier did not increase when the same section was reworked on a different band. Each DXCC entity was counted as an additional ARRL section for RTTY multiplier credit.|$|E
