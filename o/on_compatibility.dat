40|$|Abstract. The {{influences}} of steel slag <b>on</b> the <b>compatibility</b> of cement-superplasicizer system and workability of concrete were investigated in this study. Results {{show that there}} are differences among the effects of different steel slags on the fluidity of paste and workability of concrete. Steel slag is not so good as GGBS in improving the workability of concrete. Some steel slags have negative effects <b>on</b> the <b>compatibility</b> of cement-superplasicizer system by accelerating the fluidity loss of paste, but the negative effects can be weakened by adding superplasiticizer content to the saturation dosage. Concrete containing steel slag can get good workability by adding proper superplasiticizer amount...|$|R
