5|$|In 2012, Switzerland's {{population}} slightly exceeded eight million. In {{common with}} <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990.

GDP growth in China outstrips all <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> countries, with only India after 1990 coming close to China's experience. Scholars believe that high rates of investments, especially increases in capital invested per worker, have contributed to China's superior economic performance.

5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} {{has been a}} recognized medical specialty in the United States and <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> countries for nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s.

They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and development organizations, international emergency medicine fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.|$|E
5|$|From 2009, the Swedish economy {{emerged as}} one of the world's fastest {{recovering}} economies with high competitiveness. Sweden was noted for having proved to overcome the crisis better than any <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> countries, and this was highlighted by the Government as a force in the run-up to 2010 general election. As Sweden emerged as the best country on several areas after the financial crisis it brought a resurgence of support, which eventually resulted in his re-election in 2010. This was the first time ever that the Moderate Party was re-eleted after completing a full first term.|$|E

Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Setting {{national}} {{renewable energy}} targets {{can be an}} important part of a renewable energy policy and these targets are usually defined {{as a percentage of the}} primary energy and/or electricity generation mix. For example, the European Union has prescribed an indicative renewable energy target of 12 per cent of the total EU energy mix and 22 per cent of electricity consumption by 2010. National targets for individual EU Member States have also been set to meet the overall target. <b>Other</b> <b>developed</b> countries with defined national or regional targets include Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, and some US States.|$|E

Population density appears to be considerably more important for banking sector development in Africa than elsewhere. Hence, technology advances such as mobile banking could be a promising way to facilitate African financial development. Similar to <b>other</b> <b>developing</b> countries, natural resources endowment and weak general institutional environment are associated with lower level of financial development in Africa...|$|R

5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E

25|$|Measured for all households, U.S. income {{inequality}} {{is comparable to}} <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> countries before taxes and transfers, but is among the highest after taxes and transfers, meaning the U.S. shifts relatively less income from higher income households to lower income households. Measured for working-age households, market {{income inequality}} is comparatively high (rather than moderate) {{and the level of}} redistribution is moderate (not low). These comparisons indicate Americans shift from reliance on market income to reliance on income transfers later in life and less than households in <b>other</b> <b>developed</b> countries do.|$|E
