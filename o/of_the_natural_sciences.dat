Historically, astronomy has included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy and the making of calendars, but professional astronomy is now often considered to be synonymous with astrophysics.|$|E

25|$|Astronomy is {{the oldest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences,</b> dating back to antiquity, with its origins in the religious, mythological, cosmological, calendrical, and astrological beliefs and {{practices}} of prehistory: vestiges of these are still found in astrology, a discipline long interwoven with public and governmental astronomy, and not completely disentangled from it until a few centuries ago in the Western World (see astrology and astronomy). In some cultures, astronomical data was used for astrological prognostication.|$|E
25|$|Victor-Alphonse Huard (born Joseph-Alphonse, {{sometimes}} {{given as}} Joseph-Victor Alphonse; 28 February 1853–15 October 1929) was a French-Canadian churchman, naturalist, writer and editor.

25|$|During {{the advance}} of Islamic science some of the {{practices}} of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were conjectural rather than empirical, and conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars through {{the suggestion that the}} Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance. Such refutations mainly concerned 'judicial branches' (such as horary astrology), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as medical and meteorological astrology, these being seen as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> of the time.|$|E
25|$|In February 1935 Clark had {{suggested}} that the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia rename itself as the Prehistoric Society, thus stretching its remit far beyond East Anglia. A vote on the issue produced an overwhelming majority {{in support of the}} change. Membership of the group then grew rapidly; in 1935 it had 353 members, and this had increased to 668 in 1938. Under Clark's lead, the new Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society published articles by prominent archaeologists like Childe, Piggott, Philips, and Glyn Daniel, and emphasised interdisciplinary examinations that took into account the work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b> Clark also encouraged archaeologists working on non-British prehistory to submit to the journal, and met with the prominent French archaeologist Henri Breuil on the latter's visit to Cambridge.|$|E

25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|His {{academic}} career began in 1948 with a teaching position at Iowa State College; {{he served as}} Assistant Professor of Chemistry. In his capacity there he published Hammon's postulate which has widely known {{as the most important}} publication in the field of organic photochemistry. He moved to the University of Oxford and University of Basel as a Guggenheim Fellow and National Science Foundation Fellow, respectively. In 1958, he moved to the California Institute of Technology as a Professor of Organic Chemistry. Later he was appointed the Arthur Amos Noyes Professor of Chemistry and subsequently went on to lead the Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. After 14 years teaching and serving as an academic administrator at Caltech he moved in 1972 to the University of Santa Clara. At Santa Clara he served as both a professor and the Chancellor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Copenhagen {{he comes}} {{into contact with}} the Modern as a revolutionary force in the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> and technology, but also the {{cosmopolitan}} and intellectual circles of the wealthy Jewish milieu in Copenhagen. He becomes a friend of the banker Philip Salomon and has a brief relationship with his daughter Jakobe. Jakobe is young a passionate and not inhibited by Per's Protestant sense of guilt at indulging in the pleasures of life - but Per is unable to set his own passions free. Per also meets the charismatic Dr. Nathan, a fictionalized version of the intellectual Georg Brandes, who influences Per with his progressive ideals of bringing the future to Denmark. Although sympathetic, Per eventually rejects Dr. Nathan's influence, as he comes to see him as a representative of a purely humanistic intellectualism with no interest in science and technological progress.|$|E

25|$|The Romualdo Member of the Santana Formation is {{generally}} {{assigned to the}} Albian and thus the last section of the Early Cretaceous. The layers are aged to approximately 110 million years and {{to have come from}} a time in which the continents of Africa and South America were still connected with one another {{in the northern part of}} Brazil. The material of I. challengeri, not counting that of A. limai, likely hails from the Romualdo Member of the Santana Formation in Brazil. The holotype is SMNS 58022, from the Stuttgart State Museum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Sciences,</b> and it consists of an incomplete skull, lacking the anterior (front) portion. The exact discovery site of the Irritator fossil skull is unknown; the fossil was collected by illegal fossil dealers. The skull and the matrix have been assigned to a rock of the Romualdo Member due to lithological characteristic. This classification was confirmed by microfossils of the ostracod Pattersoncypris. Questioning of local fossil dealers resulted in the identification of the discovery site near the village of Buxexé close Santana Do Cariri at the flank of the Chapada do Araripe, at a height of approximately 650 meters. Since rock from the Romualdo Member is indeed exposed there, this discovery site is regarded as very probable for the fossil.|$|E
500|$|The positivist {{perspective}} {{has been}} associated with 'scientism'; the view that the methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> may be applied to all areas of investigation, be it philosophical, social scientific, or otherwise. Among most social scientists and historians, orthodox positivism has long since lost popular support. Today, practitioners of both social and physical sciences instead take into account the distorting effect of observer bias and structural limitations. This scepticism has been facilitated by a general weakening of deductivist accounts of science by philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, and new philosophical movements such as critical realism and neopragmatism. [...] The philosopher-sociologist Jürgen Habermas has critiqued pure instrumental rationality as meaning that scientific-thinking becomes something akin to ideology itself.|$|E
500|$|Znaniecki saw {{sociology}} as an objective, inductive and generalizing science. According to Szacki, [...] Znaniecki viewed sociology as a nomothetic {{science that}} {{should be able to}} use a methodology similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>sciences</b> (however, Znaniecki's daughter Helena Znaniecki Lopata, in her introduction to Social Relations and Social Roles, contradicts Szacki, writing that, for Znaniecki, sociology was a science [...] "whose subject matter calls for a method {{different from that of the}} natural sciences."). In 1934 he formulated the principle of analytic induction, designed to identify universal propositions and causal laws. He contrasted it with enumerative research, which provided mere correlations and could not account for exceptions in statistical relationships. He was also critical of the statistical method, which he did not see as very useful.|$|E

50|$|Though he {{used more}} or less the same {{methodology}} as Evans-Pritchard, he did not share Evans-Pritchard's hope that a theory of religion could ever be found.

50|$|Even though {{others will}} disagree, Crassus states that an expert <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>science</b> also must use oratory style {{to give an}} {{effective}} speech on his subject.
