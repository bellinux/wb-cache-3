Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The Chicago Tribune, investigating the scandal, reported {{that a majority of}} students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student was admitted to the university's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, {{despite the fact that she}} had ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC.|$|E

25|$|One {{issue with}} trials is what {{to use as}} a placebo {{treatment}} group or non-treatment control group. Often this is patients <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list,</b> or people receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. One issue {{is the best way to}} match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in placebo-controlled studies in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Finagy and Roth's opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{the work of}} Emily Kngwarreye, from the Utopia {{community}} north east of Alice Springs, became very popular. Although she {{had been involved in}} craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. Her works include Earth's Creation. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece Kathleen Petyarre, Minnie Pwerle, Dorothy Napangardi, Lena Pwerle, Angelina Ngale (Pwerle) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centres have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{proportion}} {{of patients who}} undergo surgery within a clinically safe time is an important performance indicator in health systems that use <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> to manage access to care. However, {{little is known about}} chances of on-time surgery according to variations in existing demand. We sought to determine what {{proportion of}} patients have had late coronary bypass surgery after registration on <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> of different size in a network of hospitals with uniform standards for timing of surgery. Methods Using records from a population-based registry, we studied wait-list times prospectively collected in a cohort of patients registered on <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> for coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. We compared the number of weeks from registration to surgery against target access times established for three urgency groups. The chances of undergoing surgery within target time have been evaluated in relation to wait-list size at registration and the number of surgeries performed without registration <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b> Results In 1991 – 2001, two in three patients were at risk of late surgery when registered on <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> for isolated coronary bypass procedures in British Columbia, Canada. Although urgent patients had never seen <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> with clearance time exceeding one week, the odds of on-time surgery were reduced by 25 %, odds ratio [OR] = 0. 75 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 65 – 0. 87) for every additional operation performed without registration <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>list.</b> When the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> at registration required a clearance time of over one month, semi-urgent patients had 51 % lower odds of on-time surgery as compared to lists with clearance time less than one week, OR = 0. 49 (95 %CI 0. 41 – 0. 60), after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidity, calendar period, hospital and week on the list. In the non-urgent group, the odds were 69 % lower, OR = 0. 31 (95 %CI 0. 20 – 0. 47). Every time an operation in the same hospital was performed without registration <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> the odds of on-time surgery for listed patients were reduced by 7 %, OR = 0. 93 (95 %CI 0. 91 – 0. 95) in the semi-urgent group, and by 10 %, OR = 0. 90 (95 %CI 0. 87 – 0. 94), in the non-urgent group. Conclusion Chances of late surgery increase with the wait-list size for semi-urgent and non-urgent patients needing coronary bypass surgery. The weekly number of patients who move immediately from angiography to the operation without registration <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> reduced chances of surgery within target time in all urgency groups of listed patients. When advising patients who will be placed on the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> about the expected time to treatment, hospital managers should take into account the current list size as well as the weekly number of patients who require CABG immediately after undergoing coronary angiography. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{deciding}} {{where to}} undergo coronary-artery bypass grafting, {{the length of}} surgical <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> is often the only information available to cardiologists and their patients. Our objective was to compare the cumulative incidence for death on the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> {{according to the length}} of <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> at the time of registration for the operation. Methods The study cohort included 8966 patients who registered to undergo isolated coronary-artery bypass grafting (82. 4 % men; 71. 9 % semi-urgent; 22. 4 % non-urgent). The patients were categorized according to wait-list clearance time at registration: either " 1 month or less" or "more than 1 month". Cumulative incidence for wait-list death was compared between the groups, and the significance of difference was tested by means of regression models. Results Urgent patients never registered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> with <b>a</b> clearance time of more than 1 month. Semi-urgent patients registered on shorter <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> more often than non-urgent patients (79. 1 % vs. 44. 7 %). In semi-urgent and non-urgent patients, the observed proportion of wait-list deaths by 52 weeks was lower in category " 1 month or less" than in category "more than 1 month" (0. 8 % [49 deaths] vs. 1. 6 % [39 deaths], P P Conclusion Long <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> for coronary-artery bypass grafting are associated with increased probability that a patient dies before surgery.
