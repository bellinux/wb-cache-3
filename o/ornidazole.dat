50|$|From the {{chemistry}} perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics {{can be classified}} according {{to the location of}} the nitro functional group. 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, dimetridazole, 6-Amino PA824, <b>ornidazole,</b> megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTRecent {{reports of}} the {{pathogenic}} potential of Dientamoeba fragilis have underlined {{the need for an}} effective treatment against this colon-dwelling protozoan. Metronidazole is a well-known and commonly used anti-protozoal agent, but another 5 -nitroimidazole derivative, <b>ornidazole,</b> may be preferable, where available, because of its longer half-life and fewer side-effects. This study compared the efficacies of metronidazole and <b>ornidazole</b> in a group of 112 patients with dientamoebiasis. Patients were randomised into two treatment groups: group 1 (n = 56) received metronidazole for 5 days, 20 mg/kg/day for children and 1. 5 g/day for adults, in three oral doses, while group 2 (n = 56) received a single oral dose of <b>ornidazole,</b> 30 mg/kg for children and 2 g for adults.

40|$|Plasma and epiploic fat drug {{concentrations}} and fat {{penetration of}} ceftriaxone and <b>ornidazole</b> given for antimicrobial prophylaxis were studied in 11 patients scheduled for liver transplantation. Ceftriaxone (1 g) and <b>ornidazole</b> (500 mg) were infused during 30 min after the induction of anesthesia. Arterial blood and epiploic fat {{samples were collected}} at 30, 60, and 120 min and then every 90 min {{following the end of}} the infusion until closure of the peritoneum. Blood samples were immediately centrifuged, and plasma and fat were stored at - 35 degrees C until analysis. Ceftriaxone and <b>ornidazole</b> concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Surgery lasted 440 +/- 84 min and required a mean of 9. 5 units of packed erythrocytes and 13 units of fresh frozen plasma. Plasma ceftriaxone concentrations decreased from 89 +/- 34 to 41 +/- 16. 5 micrograms/ml {{from the beginning of the}} operation until the time of closure of the peritoneum. Corresponding levels in epiploic fat decreased from 8. 7 +/- 3. 3 to 4. 5 +/- 3. 5 micrograms/g. <b>Ornidazole</b> concentrations ranged, respectively, between 8. 7 +/- 2. 5 and 4. 9 +/- 1. 7 micrograms/ml in plasma samples and 4. 6 +/- 1. 2 and 2. 5 +/- 1. 1. micrograms/g in fat samples. Rates of penetration into the omentum remained at about 9 % for ceftriaxone and between 50 and 70 % for <b>ornidazole.</b> Tissue ceftriaxone concentrations were, in all cases, greater than typical MICs for 90 % for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella isolates tested (MIC 90 S). They were insufficient in 40 % of patients after 60 min with regard to the MIC 90 S for Staphylococcus aureus. Tissue <b>ornidazole</b> concentrations were not superior to MIC 90 S for anaerobes after 30 min in 50 % of patients. These results show that a single dose of 1 g of ceftriaxone provides adequate coverage against gram-negative bacteria and that 1 g instead of 500 mg <b>ornidazole</b> may provide a protective effect against anaerobes during liver transplantation. Prophylaxis against S. aureus and Streptococcus faecalis requires more specific antibiotics. Prophylaxis for patients with significant blood loss or initial severe renal or hepatic failure needs further evaluation...|$|E
