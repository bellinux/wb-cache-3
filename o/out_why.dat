5|$|The matches {{took place}} and Barnes did not play. He {{was unable to}} find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> he had been {{excluded}} and was resigned to making an appearance before the board at its next meeting in September 1952 to ask for an explanation.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant, flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then {{set out to find}} <b>out</b> <b>why</b> the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited Berkeley, California, where he spoke persuasively to Ernest O. Lawrence. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to James B. Conant, Arthur H. Compton and George B. Pegram. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States from England in August 1941 to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> Briggs and his {{committee}} were apparently ignoring the MAUD Report. Oliphant discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with {{all members of the}} committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with Allison, Coolidge, Conant and Fermi to explain the urgency. In these meetings Oliphant spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty, and explained that Britain did not have the resources to undertake the project alone, so it was up to the United States.|$|E

5|$|That night, Jack tells {{everyone}} that he trusts Juliet {{and that should}} be enough, but Sayid disagrees. Jack continues to explain that John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it to her. At the camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She was brought to the island to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 White House {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} November 11, 2011, when Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an unemployed 21-year-old man, fired a semi-automatic rifle at the White House, the official {{residence of the}} U.S. President in Washington, D.C. At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama were home at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the shooting from an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> the first family had not been informed.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigation}} into the accident was led by Turkey's Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA, Turkish: Sivil Havacılık Genel Müdürlüğü, SHGM) which immediately deployed a team of four investigators to the crash site.

25|$|In {{case of a}} bimodal {{distribution}} (seen at right), {{it is useful to}} find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> this is the case. Two reference ranges can be established for the two different groups of people, making it possible to assume a normal distribution for each group. This bimodal pattern is commonly seen in tests that differ between men and women, such as prostate specific antigen.|$|E

25|$|Each {{company has}} its own unique {{turnover}} drivers so companies must continually work to identify the issues that cause turnover in their company. Further the causes of attrition vary within a company such that causes for turnover in one department might {{be very different from}} the causes of turnover in another department. Companies can use exit interviews to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> employees are leaving and the problems they encountered in the workplace.|$|E

With the {{occasional}} assistance and sometimes hindrance of his mother, Madeline, Westen battles an array of criminals such as mobsters, gang members, con artists, murderers, rapists, kidnappers, foreign wet-work operatives, drug traffickers, sex traffickers, arms traffickers, and war criminals. At the same time, Michael must follow the trail that leads him to the people responsible for his being burned, and later finding <b>out</b> <b>why.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is, however, {{hardly any}} {{agreement}} as to exactly {{why such a}} murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of trying to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting {{to have taken place}} would have been to fake his death.|$|E

25|$|Vascular {{anomalies}} – vascular malformations, hemangiomas, {{and rare}} vascular tumors. Not only do vascular anomalies have often prominent interior bodily effects; they manifest themselves physically as well. For this reason, {{the involvement of}} multiple specialties in coordinating care is of utmost importance. Specialists involve in vascular anomalies and hemangioma care often hail from the disciplines of general surgery, vascular anomalies research, plastic surgery, dermatology, cardiology, hematology/oncology, neurology/neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, and otolaryngology. The child needs treatment not only to minimize the physical side effects of a hemangioma or vascular anomalies, but also help in finding <b>out</b> <b>why</b> the tumor is present (if {{it is in fact}} a tumor), and developing a course of treatment if necessary.|$|E
25|$|With {{help from}} QualPro, Boise Cascade {{discovered}} {{there was no}} connection between the quality of wood they purchased as raw material {{and the quality of}} wood pulp it produced for paper and packaging products. QualPro worked with Elo TouchSystems to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> 25 percent of the touch-screens they manufactured had bubbles between the screen and coating. Statisticians identified three causes, which reduced the defects to less than 1 percent: the type of polyester, the coversheet shaping process and the type of adhesives used. A Unifi yarn plant worked with QualPro to identify ways {{to reduce the number of}} broken yarns. Out of the 25 quality improvement ideas Unifi had, testing found that five were effective.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, on April 5, a {{northbound}} train {{ran through}} a wildfire on the Isleta Pueblo reservation. No {{one was hurt}} and no equipment was damaged, but officials soon tried to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> no one received notification of the blaze until the incident actually occurred. On the evening of August 24, a southbound train hit a vehicle at a private grade crossing south of Los Lunas. Two people in the vehicle were killed. No one aboard the train was injured. It appears that the Rail Runner personnel followed procedure. On the evening of September 19, a southbound train hit a vehicle at a private grade crossing between Belen and Los Lunas. One person in the vehicle was killed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Healey & Baker's Development Team, which is now owned by Cushman & Wakefield, were {{appointed}} by Liverpool City Council to conduct a retail study of the Liverpool City Centre for the replacement Unitary Development Plan. The {{purpose of the study}} was to enable the Council to identify ways of protecting and improving the City Centre and also to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> the City Centre was perceived as unattractive to new high quality retailers. Cushman & Wakefield's study revealed that Liverpool's reputation as a regional shopping centre was under serious threat, but the study underlined that a feasible scheme and redevelopment site existed within the heart of the city.|$|E
25|$|Siblings {{taken into}} care {{together}} were often separated and contact between siblings was discouraged. Boys and girls were usually separated in institutions so {{brothers and sisters}} rarely had close contact. Family ties were cut when one sibling ended up in care while others remained {{at home with their}} parents or were sent elsewhere. The result is that many people never knew they had siblings or only found out much later in life. Children's names were often changed and poor and incomplete records kept of children in care. This makes it difficult for older care leavers to find <b>out</b> <b>why</b> and how they ended up in care, and to trace parents, siblings or other living relatives.|$|E
25|$|In 260, {{the fourth}} Wei emperor, Cao Mao, {{attempted}} a coup to seize back {{power from the}} regent, Sima Zhao, who had been monopolising state power since 255. Sima Zhao's younger brother, Sima Gan (司馬幹), heard of the coup and tried to enter the palace to help his brother. However, he was denied entry by Sun You (孫佑), an officer guarding the main gate, {{so he had to}} enter the palace through another gate. When Sima Zhao found <b>out</b> <b>why</b> Sima Gan showed up late, he wanted to execute Sun You and his family. However, Xun Xu advised him against it by pointing out that it would be unfair and unjust to punish Sun You's family as well. Sima Zhao heeded Xun Xu's advice and punished Sun You only, by demoting him to the status of a commoner.|$|E
