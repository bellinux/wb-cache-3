5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} atomic hydrogen first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, {{experiments}} by physicists Ernest Rutherford, Henry Moseley, James Franck and Gustav Hertz {{had largely}} established {{the structure of}} an atom as a dense nucleus of positive charge surrounded by lower-mass electrons. In 1913, Danish physicist Niels Bohr postulated that electrons resided in quantized energy states, with their energies determined by the angular momentum of the electron's orbit about the nucleus. The electrons could move between those states, or orbits, by the emission or absorption of photons of specific frequencies. By means of these quantized orbits, he accurately explained the spectral lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atom. However, Bohr's model failed {{to account for the}} relative intensities of the spectral lines and it was unsuccessful in explaining the spectra of more complex atoms.|$|E

5|$|Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated {{back to the}} 1930s, when he was {{a member}} of {{numerous}} Communist front organizations, and was associated with Communist Party USA members, including his wife and his brother. These associations were known to Army Counter-intelligence at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947.

5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg.

5|$|Hydrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{technological}} important impurities in semiconductors, including diamond. Hydrogen-related defects are very different in natural diamond and in synthetic diamond films. Those films are produced by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques in an atmosphere rich in hydrogen (typical hydrogen/carbon ratio >100), under strong bombardment of growing diamond by the plasma ions. As a result, CVD diamond is always rich in hydrogen and lattice vacancies. In polycrystalline films, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> may be located at the boundaries between diamond 'grains', or in non-diamond carbon inclusions. Within the diamond lattice itself, hydrogen-vacancy and hydrogen-nitrogen-vacancy complexes have been identified in negative charge states by electron paramagnetic resonance.

5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers).

This second layer prevented leakage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hydrogen</b> lifting gas from the envelope.

The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
