25|$|Typically, {{both male}} and female {{mosquitoes}} feed on nectar and plant juices, but in many species the mouthparts of the females are adapted for piercing the skin of animal hosts and sucking their blood as ectoparasites.

A mosquito has a variety <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> finding its prey, including chemical, visual, and heat sensors. Both plant materials and blood are useful sources of energy in the form of sugars, and blood also supplies more concentrated nutrients, such as lipids, but the most important function of blood meals is to obtain proteins as materials for egg production.|$|E

25|$|As an undergraduate, Whitworth {{became the}} {{founding}} {{editor in chief}} of the Messenger of Mathematics, and he continued as its editor until 1880. He published works about the logarithmic spiral and about trilinear coordinates, but his most famous mathematical publication is the book Choice and Chance: An Elementary Treatise on Permutations, Combinations, and Probability (first published in 1867 and extended over several later editions). The first edition of the book treated the subject primarily from the point of view of arithmetic calculations, but had an appendix on algebra, and was based on lectures he had given at Queen's College. Later editions added material on enumerative combinatorics (the numbers <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> arranging items into groups with various constraints), derangements, frequentist probability, life expectancy, and the fairness of bets, among other topics.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{huge number}} <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> diversifying. Farmland may, for example, be {{converted}} to equestrian facilities, amenity parkland, country clubs, hotels, golf courses, camping and caravan sites. Farmers open shops, restaurants and even pubs to sell their products. The Farm Diversification Benchmarking Study, which was commissioned by DEFRA and carried out by Exeter University {{in conjunction with the}} University of Plymouth, found that 65% of full-time farming businesses had diversified, but in the June census of the preceding year (2003), the estimate was 19% of full-time farming businesses. The large discrepancy is probably because the census data excluded the letting or subletting of buildings. The most common kinds of diversification are probably letting of barns as warehouses and storage, letting of former farm labourers' cottages (whether as holiday cottages or on longer leases), and farm shops. The number of farm shops in the UK increased by more than 50% between 1999 and 2003.|$|E
25|$|This {{thesis of}} {{negative}} capability {{is a key}} component in Unger's theory of false necessity and formative context. The theory of false necessity claims that our social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, {{and there is no}} necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop the forms and the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and anti-necessitarian social thought, Unger recognized that there are an infinite number <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and empowerment (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.|$|E

He describes how institutionalization socializes people {{into the role of}} a good patient, someone [...] "dull, harmless and inconspicuous" [...] – a condition which in turn reinforces notions of chronicity in severe mental illness. Total institutions greatly affect people's interactions; yet, even in such places, people find ways to redefine their roles and reclaim their identities.|$|E
