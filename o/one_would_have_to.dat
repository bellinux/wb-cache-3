5|$|It has {{not been}} said of any people on the earth that the moon was {{observed}} that night such {{that it could be}} stated that it was not split. Even if this had been reported from many different places, so that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people... An eclipse is visible in one country but not in the other one; in one place it is total, in the other one only partial.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also helps explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E

25|$|In {{the folk}} blues the singer fills up {{occasional}} gaps with words like 'Oh, lawdy' or 'Oh, baby' and the like. This meant that in writing a melody to be sung in the blues manner <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide gaps or waits.|$|E
25|$|Besides narrow {{meaning of}} karma as the {{reaction}} or suffering being due to karma {{of their past}} lives and that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> transmigrate to another body in their next life, it is often used in the broader sense as action or reaction.|$|E
25|$|A {{refinement}} of this method, known as importance sampling in statistics, involves sampling the points randomly, but more frequently where the integrand is large. To do this precisely <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{already know the}} integral, but one can approximate the integral by an integral of a similar function or use adaptive routines such as stratified sampling, recursive stratified sampling, adaptive umbrella sampling or the VEGAS algorithm.|$|E

5000|$|In my own {{thinking}} on this vital subject I am {{in a much}} more satisfied state of mind than I could have been at any earlier stage of science. If the statements of the laws of physics were assumed correct, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> suppose (as did most philosophers) that the feeling of freedom is illusory, or if free choice were considered effective, that the laws of physics ... were unreliable. The dilemma has been an uncomfortable one.|$|R
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to abolish blood feud (that was quite common at that time), “RP” narrowed its “usage” and limited the number of avengers to the closest {{relatives}} of the dead. If there were no avengers on the victim’s side, the killer had to pay a fine (called “vyra”) in favour of the knyaz’ and partial compensation to the relatives of the victim (the killer’s community had to help him pay his fine). If a woman were killed, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay half of the regular fine (called “poluvir’ye”, half of “vyra”).|$|E
25|$|While this {{provides}} a valid proof (for matrices over the complex numbers), {{the argument is}} not very satisfactory, since the identities represented by the theorem do {{not in any way}} depend {{on the nature of the}} matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them). We shall therefore now consider only arguments that prove the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also have the benefit of working for matrices with entries in any commutative ring.|$|E
25|$|Sailors might hope to {{supplement}} their meager diets with fish if they were lucky enough to catch them. The islands frequented were plentiful with potential foods, such as turtle, seafowl, shellfish, and fish. Sea turtle was considered {{some of the best}} meat possible. While at sea, when supplies were low, fresh fish such like snapper, shark, catfish, grouper, albacore were caught and often barbecued, though <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be certain not to let the deck on fire. When food was scarce, a rationing system may be put in place similar to legal sailors. In some cases, the only items there were requested of the looted victim from pirates was food and drink. When gold or silver was found, food was a popular item to barter for when bartering was easier than fighting.|$|E

25|$|The {{financial}} {{success of these}} early titles has ensured competition in the genre since that time. MMORPG titles now exist on consoles and in new settings. The current market for MMORPGs has Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft dominating as the largest MMORPG, alongside other titles such as Final Fantasy XIV and Guild Wars 2, though an additional market exists for free-to-play MMORPGs, which are supported by advertising and purchases of in-game items. This free-to-play model is particularly common in South Korea such as MapleStory, , and Atlantica Online. Also, there are some free-to-play games, such as RuneScape and Tibia, where the game is free, but <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay monthly {{to play the game}} with more features. Guild Wars and its sequel avoid some degree of competition with other MMORPGs by only requiring the initial purchase of the game to play.|$|E
25|$|His main asset is his {{practical}} application {{of scientific knowledge}} and inventive use of common items. The clever solutions MacGyver implemented to seemingly unsolvable problemsoften in life-or-death situations requiring him to improvise complex devices {{in a matter of}} minuteswere a major attraction of the show, which was praised for generating interest in the applied sciences, particularly engineering, and for providing entertaining storylines. All of MacGyver's exploits on the show were ostensibly vetted by consulting scientists for the show's writers to ensure a basis on scientific principles (even though, the creators acknowledged, in real life <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be extraordinarily lucky for most of MacGyver's ideas to succeed). In the few cases where MacGyver used household chemicals to mix up poisons, explosives or other items deemed too dangerous to be accurately described to the public, details were altered or left vague or an essential component or step was omitted.|$|E
25|$|Rice is {{a staple}} food in Gullah {{communities}} {{and continues to}} be cultivated in abundance in the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina. Rice is also an important food in West African cultures. As descendants of enslaved Africans, the Gullah continued the traditional food and food techniques of their ancestors, demonstrating another link to traditional African cultures. Rice is a core commodity of the Gullah food system: a meal was not considered complete without rice. There are strict rituals surrounding the preparation of rice in the Gullah communities. First, individuals would remove the darker grains from the rice, and then hand wash the rice numerous times before it was ready for cooking. The Gullah people would add enough water for the rice to steam on its own, but not so much that <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stir or drain it. These traditional techniques were passed down during the period of slavery and are still an important part of rice preparation by Gullah people.|$|E

50|$|Around 1996-1997, {{one year}} was reduced {{from the entire}} {{education}} system and one was honored with a diploma after three years in high-school. However, if <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked <b>to</b> continue her/his education towards university degrees, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been required <b>to</b> take the last year, so called pre-university year. This year had been a requirement {{to participate in the}} Iranian University Entrance Exam for high school students. Again, around 2012, the system turned back to its previous system, consisting of two 6-year periods.|$|R

50|$|The new league was {{nominally}} going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 18 clubs; however, in its first, transitional {{season the}} DFB permitted up to 22 {{clubs in the}} league.
