5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E

25|$|Some phlogiston proponents {{explained}} this by concluding that phlogiston had negative mass; others, such as Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, gave the more conventional argument {{that it was}} lighter than air.

25|$|Edelsbrunner and Welzl (1986) first {{studied the}} problem of {{constructing}} all k-sets of an input point set, or dually of constructing the k-level of an arrangement. The k-level version of their algorithm {{can be viewed as}} a plane sweep algorithm that constructs the level in left-to-right order. Viewed in terms of k-sets of point sets, their algorithm maintains a dynamic convex hull for the points on each side of a separating line, repeatedly finds a bitangent of these two hulls, and moves each of the two points of tangency to the opposite hull. Chan (1999) surveys subsequent results <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> and shows that it can be solved in time proportional to Dey's O(nk1/3) bound on the complexity of the k-level.|$|E
25|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a classic}} problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms (PID controllers, state space representation, neural networks, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, etc.). Variations <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> include multiple links, allowing {{the motion of the}} cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the center of gravity is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability. The understanding of a similar problem can be shown by simple robotics {{in the form of a}} balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing personal transporters such as the Segway PT, the self-balancing hoverboard and the self-balancing unicycle.|$|E
25|$|Lightning strikes to a {{metallic}} structure {{can vary from}} leaving no evidence, except perhaps, a small pit in the metal, to the complete destruction of the structure. When there is no evidence, analyzing the strikes is difficult. This means that a strike on an uninstrumented structure must be visually confirmed, and the random behavior of lightning renders such observations difficult. There are also inventors working <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> such as through a lightning rocket. While controlled experiments may be off in the future, very good data is being obtained through techniques which use radio receivers that watch for the characteristic electrical 'signature' of lightning strikes using fixed directional antennas. Through accurate timing and triangulation techniques, lightning strikes can be located with great precision, so strikes on specific objects often can be confirmed with confidence.|$|E

25|$|Since Descartes's {{proposal}} of dualism, {{it became a}} general consensus that the mind had {{become a matter of}} philosophy and that science was not able to penetrate the issue of consciousness- that consciousness was outside of space and time. However, over the last 20 years, many scholars have begun to move toward a science of consciousness. Antonio Damasio and Gerald Edelman are two neuroscientists that have led the move to neural correlates of the self and of consciousness. Damasio has demonstrated that emotions and their biological foundation {{play a critical role in}} high level cognition, and Edelman has created a framework for analyzing consciousness through a scientific outlook. The current problem consciousness researchers face involves explaining how and why consciousness arises from neural computation. In his research <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> Edelman has developed a theory of consciousness, in which he has coined the terms primary consciousness and secondary consciousness.|$|E
500|$|Harrison used Campbell's {{image filter}} theory, {{which was the}} most {{advanced}} filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem. More advanced filter theory was brought to bear <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being [...] "maximally flat". Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter. The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter, that is, one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, {{making it hard to}} recognise the design for what it is. Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the series capacitor, which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm. This is the only series capacitor in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a low-pass prototype. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the [...] "turning round the L" [...] impedance transform to achieve this.|$|E
500|$|Cantor's {{first ten}} papers were on number theory, his thesis topic. At the {{suggestion}} of Eduard Heine, the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to analysis. Heine proposed that Cantor solve an open problem that had eluded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Rudolf Lipschitz, Bernhard Riemann, and Heine himself: {{the uniqueness of the}} representation of a function by trigonometric series. Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869. It was while working <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices n in the nth derived set S'n of a set S of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with S as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had S1 as its set of zeros, where S1 is the set of limit points of S. If S'k+1 is the set of limit points of S'k, then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are S'k+1. Because the sets S'k were closed, they contained their Limit points, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets S, S1, S2, S3,... formed a limit set, which we would now call S'ω, and then he noticed that Sω would also have to have a set of limit points Sω+1, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers ω, ω+1, ω+2, ...|$|E
