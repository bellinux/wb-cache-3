25|$|Degree of {{acetylation}} (DA) for soluble chitosan {{ranges from}} 0% to 60%, depending on processing conditions. A {{study was conducted}} to characterize how varying DA affects the properties of chitosan. Varying DA was obtained using acetic anhydride or alkaline hydrolysis. It was found that decreasing acetylation created an increase in compressive strength. Biodegradation was examined by use <b>of</b> <b>lysozyme,</b> which is known to be mainly responsible for degrading chitosan in vivo by hydrolyzing its glycosidic bonds and is released by phagocytic cells after nerve injury. The results reveal that there was an accelerated mass loss with intermediate DAs, compared with high and low DAs over the time period studied. When DRG cells were grown on the N-acetylated chitosan, cell viability decreased with increasing DA. Also, chitosan has an increasing charge density with decreasing DA, which is responsible for greater cell adhesion. Thus, controlling the DA of chitosan is important for regulating the degradation time. This knowledge could help {{in the development of a}} nerve guidance conduit from chitosan.|$|E

40|$|Lysozyme was {{extracted}} from the feces of rabbit (Japanese White) with 2. 5 % acetic acid and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Subsequent ion-exchange HPLC at pH 4. 0 revealed the presence of two isozymes, namely rabbit colonic lysozymes 1 and 2. The amino acid sequences <b>of</b> these <b>lysozymes</b> were determined. The colonic lysozymes 1 and 2 showed 98 % identity {{with each other and}} 94 and 95 % identities with rabbit kidney lysozyme, respectively. The very high identities between kidney and colonic lysozymes indicate that the colonic isozymes diverged from the conventional kidney lysozyme very recently, probably after the divergence of rabbit from other rodents, accompanying the gene duplication. Despite the small changes in the sequences, the enzymatic properties <b>of</b> colonic <b>lysozyme</b> differ from those <b>of</b> the kidney <b>lysozyme.</b> The activity <b>of</b> the colonic <b>lysozyme</b> against Micrococcus luteus cells showed a narrow and acidic pH optimum, in contrast to the wide and high pH optimum <b>of</b> the kidney <b>lysozyme.</b> Changes in the enzymatic properties are analogous to those of the ruminant stomach lysozymes and may implicate adaptive evolution in the functional conversion <b>of</b> rabbit colonic <b>lysozymes</b> in gut.

40|$|<b>Lysozyme</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{abundant}} antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung.

Unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces <b>of</b> uninfected <b>lysozyme</b> M-/- mice, amounting to 25 % of the activity in wild-type mice.
