5|$|In the mid-1970s, {{during times}} of {{economic}} prosperity, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor put aside their differences and joined forces to thwart Nigeria, which, {{in an attempt to}} establish itself in West Africa, had created the Economic Community <b>of</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> States (ECOWAS). The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA), which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French-speaking regions. However, after assurances from Nigeria that ECOWAS would function {{in the same manner as}} the earlier Francophone organisations, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor decided to merge their organization into ECOWAS in May 1975.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Sierra Leone {{formally}} {{became a}} one-party {{state and the}} All People's Congress (APC) became the only legal political party. Stevens retired in 1985 and appointed Joseph Momoh as his successor. Momoh was accused of corruption and abuse of power, and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) was formed later in the decade {{with the aim of}} overthrowing him. Sponsored by Liberia, the RUF began attacking settlements along the border in 1991 and quickly took control of the diamond mines, whose products they smuggled through Liberia and traded for weapons. The following years saw a series of coups and interventions by private military companies, Nigeria, the Economic Community <b>of</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> States, and the United Nations (UN), while a bloody civil war devastated the country.|$|E

By the time ECOMOG arrived, Prince Johnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL were fighting on the outside bounds of the port. A series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June–October 1991. The first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes and the Carter Center negotiation leading to the Cotonou Accords, failed {{due to lack of}} agreement between the warring factions. The NPFL launched an assault on Monrovia in 1992, which they named 'Operation Octopus.' The civil war lasted until the Abuja Accords of August 1996.|$|E

5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number <b>of</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, {{and skin}} of {{manatees}} are valuable items. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, and online as pets, sometimes being shipped internationally. Though illegal, lack {{of law enforcement}} in these areas induce poaching. Some residents <b>of</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> countries, such as Mali and Chad, depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions. Hunting is the largest source of mortality in Amazonian manatees, {{and there are no}} management plans except for in Colombia. Amazonian manatees, especially calves, are sometimes illegally sold as pets, but there are several institutions that care for and rescue these orphans, with the possibility of their releasing into the wild.

5|$|Nigeria Airways Ltd., more {{commonly}} known as Nigeria Airways, was a Nigerian airline. The company was founded in 1958 after the dissolution <b>of</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> Airways Corporation (WAAC). It held the name WAAC Nigeria until 1971, when it was rebranded to the name it had until it ceased operations in 2003. The government of Nigeria owned {{a majority of the}} airline (51%) until 1961, when it boosted its participation in the company to 100% and made it the country's flag carrier. At the time of dissolution, the airline's headquarters were at Airways House in Abuja. Operations were concentrated at Murtala Muhammed International Airport and served both domestic and international destinations mainly concentrated in West Africa; the network also had points in Europe, North America and Saudi Arabia. The airline was managed by a number of foreign companies, including British Airways, the Dutch company KLM and South African Airways.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{is often}} {{said to be a}} {{cultural}} melting pot, taking in influences from across the world and creating distinctively new methods of cultural expression. Though aspects of American music {{can be traced back to}} specific origins, claiming any particular original culture for a musical element is inherently problematic, due to the constant evolution of American music through transplanting and hybridizing techniques, instruments and genres. Elements of foreign musics arrived in the United States both through the formal sponsorship of educational and outreach events by individuals and groups, and through informal processes, as in the incidental transplantation <b>of</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> music through slavery, and Irish music through immigration. The most distinctly American musics are a result of cross-cultural hybridization through close contact. Slavery, for example, mixed persons from numerous tribes in tight living quarters, resulting in a shared musical tradition that was enriched through further hybridizing with elements of indigenous, Latin, and European music. American ethnic, religious, and racial diversity has also produced such intermingled genres as the French-African music of the Louisiana Creoles, the Native, Mexican and European fusion Tejano music, and the thoroughly hybridized slack-key guitar and other styles of modern Hawaiian music.|$|E

The Niominka adopted some cultural and economic elements from both, e.g. cultivation of millet from Serer, rice from Mandinka, but also possess elements quite distinctive in their own right, most notably riverine fishing.

5|$|The {{intervention}} in May 2000 {{was the first}} major deployment of British forces to Sierra Leone during the civil war, but {{was not the first time}} British personnel had served there. In May 1997, a two-man training team from the British Army was sent to train SLA officers but discovered that the SLA's strength was much lower than it had reported. The government was overthrown in a coup before any training could take place. Following the restoration of the elected government by the Economic Community <b>of</b> <b>West</b> <b>African</b> States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in February 1998, HMS Cornwall sailed to Freetown with food and medical supplies. Her crew assisted with infrastructure repairs and her helicopter was used to move people and supplies around Sierra Leone until she left in mid-April. As the security situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated later in the year, the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Spartic over Christmas 1998. Approximately 80 people—predominantly British citizens, many of them staff or dependants from the British High Commission—were evacuated over two days.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{and compare}} the spectrum of scrotal abnormalities in fertile and sub-fertile <b>west</b> <b>African</b> men using scrotal US. Subjects and methodsThe study examined 249 subjects {{over a period of}} 13 months. The subjects comprised 149 patients with diagnosis of male infertility, as well as 100 healthy individuals for comparison. The relevant clinical history of each patient was extracted from their case notes. All the subjects had their testes examined using a high frequency (7. 5 MHz) linear transducer of an ultrasound scanner. Images in B-mode ultrasound scan and color Doppler were acquired in the supine and upright position. The results were expressed as percentages and tests of significance were done using the chi-square and Fisher's t-test. A P-value 0. 05), while testicular tumor was confirmed in one sub-fertile patient. With the exclusion of varicocele, there was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of the other abnormalities between the sub-fertile and fertile groups. ConclusionMale sub-fertility was associated with a higher prevalence of scrotal abnormalities. Apart from the diagnoses of the possible causes of the sub-fertility, routine scrotal US was able to diagnose other abnormalities of clinical relevance in the sub-fertile male. Scrotal US is a valuable tool in the evaluation <b>of</b> the sub-fertile <b>west</b> <b>African</b> man and should be considered in the routine evaluation <b>of</b> the sub-fertile <b>west</b> <b>African</b> man...|$|R
