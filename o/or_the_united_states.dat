5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized {{country by}} the {{standards}} of Britain, Germany <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Even so, his political and philosophical views have often been analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses targeting women. Funding is another issue impacting the game in Africa, where most financial assistance comes from FIFA and not national football associations. Another challenge is the retention of football players. Many women footballers leave the continent to seek greater opportunity in Europe <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} in Africa {{as a whole}} faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental gender inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. Another problem with the development for the national team, one faced throughout the continent, is if quality female football players are found, many leave the country seeking greater opportunity in Northern Europe <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E

5|$|MEPs in Parliament are {{organised}} into seven different parliamentary groups, including thirty non-attached members known as non-inscrits. The two largest groups are the European People's Party (EPP) and the Socialists & Democrats (S). These two groups {{have dominated the}} Parliament for much of its life, continuously holding between 50 and 70 percent of the seats between them. No single group has ever held a majority in Parliament. As {{a result of being}} broad alliances of national parties, European group parties are very decentralised and hence {{have more in common with}} parties in federal states like Germany <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> than unitary states like the majority of the EU states. Nevertheless, the European groups were actually more cohesive than their US counterparts between 2004 and 2009.|$|E

In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is a loose concept {{album with}} topics ranging from espionage to the Chinese Communist revolution.

5|$|The 1974 Davis Cup {{marked the}} first time that neither Australia <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> won the final since 1936, as South Africa and India were the finalists. However, the final was not contested as the Indian team refused to travel to South Africa in protest at the South African government's {{apartheid}} policies. South Africa were awarded the Davis Cup on walkover. Sweden beat Czechoslovakia 3–2 the following year to become the first European nation since 1936 to win the Davis Cup. The Davis Cup underwent further reorganisation in 1981 when a 16 team World Group was introduced. The remaining nations were split into regional groups with promotion and relegation to and from the World Group.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} these changes were the Lowland Clearances, by which {{hundreds}} of thousands of cottars and tenant farmers from central and southern Scotland were forcibly moved from the farms and small holdings their families had occupied for hundreds of years. Many small settlements were dismantled, their occupants forced either to the new purpose-built villages built by the landowners such as John Cockburn of Ormiston to house the displaced cottars {{on the outskirts of the}} new ranch-style farms, or to the new industrial centres of Glasgow, Edinburgh, or northern England. Tens of thousands of others emigrated to Canada <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> finding opportunities there to own and farm their own land.|$|E
