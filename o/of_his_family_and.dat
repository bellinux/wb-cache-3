5|$|The book {{begins as}} a chronological {{narrative}} of Suzuki's life with photographs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends. The first five chapters cover {{the same time period}} as the first autobiography, from childhood to age fifty. Later chapters use a memoir style with personal thoughts developed around themes. Suzuki recounts his experiences with indigenous groups and his personal relationships with individual members. A travelogue of his journeys in Brazil, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and some places in Canada is presented. Scientific concepts and explanations occur throughout the book.|$|E

He also agreed to be godfather to Lennon's son Julian.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} months in office, Patton drew {{criticism}} for abusing his patronage power. Critics charged {{that he had}} appointed several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends who were in non-merit system jobs to merit system positions, increasing their chances of being retained when a new administration took over. These charges were particularly damaging because, earlier in the year, the General Assembly had ordered Patton to cut 800 non-merit positions to help balance the budget. The Lexington Herald-Leader opined that these charges were more serious {{than those of the}} Conner affair. Patton maintained that his friends had followed proper personnel protocol in applying for and securing merit positions.|$|E
5|$|In 1203 Norreis, {{secure in}} his {{alliance}} {{with his own}} monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit and that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain {{the actions of the}} monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions and abuse of his monks.|$|E

5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding house {{that had been used}} as a safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the war, Stephen began to focus on the issue <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> the succession. Stephen's eldest son was Eustace and the King wanted to confirm him as his successor, {{although}} chroniclers recorded that Eustace was infamous for levying heavy taxes and extorting money from those on his lands. Stephen's second son, William, was married to the extremely wealthy heiress Isabel de Warenne. In 1148, Stephen built the Cluniac Faversham Abbey as a resting place for his family. Both Stephen's wife, Queen Matilda, and his older brother Theobald died in 1152.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{was anxious}} {{to learn about the}} {{condition}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> property at Wappocomo; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket. Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish, he traveled west along the Northwestern Turnpike to around Pleasant Dale, then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime, when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney. Parsons stayed behind in the hollow, while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes. Knowing that the Union Army kept a 24-hour guard at the main house, Blue circled around {{to the rear of the}} mansion and knocked on the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with the Parsons family. Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front porch, and he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter, Kate, who provided Lt. Blue with a parcel for her father.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing {{the ball in the}} seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E

5|$|While still {{involved}} in the disputes over Legislative Council attributions, Filitti was a member, and later President, of the state's Heraldry and Genealogy Commission. The appointment again brought him into disagreement with the Romanian monarch, this time involving the heraldic symbols of Greater Romania. Filitti and Kirileanu suggested redesigned coats of arms of the Romanian counties, each bearing the Steel Crown, as a show of national unity; Ferdinand disagreed, and the counties were only allowed their simple escutcheons. He was turning {{his attention to the}} Slătineanu branch <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> completed a biographical study on Ion Slătineanu, governor of Brăila in the 1830s (hosted by the magazine Analele Brăilei, 1/1929).|$|E

5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With the help <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing {{the value of his}} family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E
5|$|Although Alexander {{was known}} for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle, he founded a number of {{religious}} houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron. He also attended church councils and reorganised his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up prebends to support his cathedral clergy. Under Henry's successor, King Stephen, Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139. He subsequently briefly supported Stephen's rival, Matilda, but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen. He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome, but died in England in early 1148. During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral, which had been destroyed by fire. Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit Christina of Markyate and Gilbert of Sempringham, founder of the Gilbertines.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group made up <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> a pupil. This {{ensemble}} {{was sponsored by}} the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris to perform for Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E
