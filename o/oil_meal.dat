The symptoms and post-mortem lesions suggest that the causal agent was probabl 7 a toxin(s from Aspergillus flavus. Soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> and the two sources of peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> wer supplemented with lysine, methionine and glyoine. Lysine was the first limiting amino acid in the peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal.</b> Supplementat 1 oi,. of the peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> with the three amino acids resulted in growth rate almost as good as that of chicks on the soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> diet. Addition of amino acids to the toxic peanut 011 meal did not improve its quality nor decrease the high mortality. In the soybean <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> diet, methionine was found to be the first limiting amino acid. Growth rate due to lysine, glycine or combinations of the three amino acids was lower than that due to methionine supplementation alone. In the last experiment, the peanut <b>oil</b> <b>meal</b> was supplemented with fish meal. Supplementation above 50 percent may probably not be economical under the conditions of this experiment.
