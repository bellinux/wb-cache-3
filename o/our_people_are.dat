500|$|On 1 January 1964, a Council of Notables, {{comprising}} sixty leading citizens, met for {{the first}} time, having been selected by Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo. Its job was to advise the military and civilian wings of the government with a view towards reforming human rights, the constitution and the legal system. Thơ publicly stated that he expected a [...] "rational attitude" [...] coupled with [...] "impartial and realistic judgments" [...] and said that {{it was part of the}} provisional government's quest to [...] "clear the way for a permanent regime, which <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> longing for". The council consisted almost entirely of professionals and academic leaders, with no representatives from the agricultural or labour movements. It soon became engaged in endless debate and never achieved its initial task of drafting a new constitution. Thơ later admitted that the Council was unrepresentative of South Vietnamese society and had been a failure. He claimed that the council's desire to move away from the rubber stamp model of Diệm's National Assembly had caused it to degenerate into a debating society.|$|E

Two, there's {{never been a}} draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people {{are the ones that}} serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And the other thing is that, because you know from here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult." ...|$|E

The significance of these gods is as follows: Thor, they say, presides over the air, which governs the thunder and lightning, the winds and rains, fair weather and crops. The other, Wotanthat is, the Furiouscarries on war and imparts to man strength against his enemies. The third is Frikko, who bestows peace and pleasure on mortals. His likeness, too, they fashion with an immense phallus. But Wotan they chisel armed, as <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> wont to represent Mars.

If plague and famine threaten, a libation is poured to the idol Thor; if war, to Wotan, if marriages are to be celebrated, to Frikko.|$|E
