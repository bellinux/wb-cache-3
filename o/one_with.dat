5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random walk {{is known as the}} simple random walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by <b>one</b> <b>with</b> probability, say, , or decreases by negative <b>one</b> <b>with</b> probability , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to public view in 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including <b>one</b> <b>with</b> a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; <b>one</b> <b>with</b> a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E

5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included <b>one</b> <b>with</b> tentacles, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience with the lights. They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E

Philip Pickett's 1995 recording of the E-flat major version appeared on L'Oiseau Lyre.

5|$|Each of the {{proposed}} mechanisms for Sedna's extreme orbit would leave a distinct mark on the structure and dynamics of any wider population. If a trans-Neptunian planet was responsible, all such objects would share roughly the same perihelion (about 80AU). If Sedna were captured from another planetary system that rotated {{in the same direction}} as the Solar System, then all of its population would have orbits on relatively low inclinations and have semi-major axes ranging from 100–500AU. If it rotated in the opposite direction, then two populations would form, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> low and <b>one</b> <b>with</b> high inclinations. The perturbations from passing stars would produce a wide variety of perihelia and inclinations, each dependent on the number and angle of such encounters.|$|E
5|$|El Salvador {{returned}} {{to participate in}} the 1961 CCCF Championship, hosted in Costa Rica, alongside nine other national teams. Due to the larger number of teams the CCCF Championship shifted to a two-round format with two round-robin group stages. In the first round, there were two groups, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> five teams and <b>one</b> <b>with</b> four. The top two teams from both groups advanced to the second stage. El Salvador was placed in the four team group Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, and Nicaragua, which they topped with two wins and one draw. In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica, who won their seventh CCCF Championship. Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the CONCACAF Championship.|$|E

5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two solutions, <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the cation and <b>one</b> <b>with</b> the anion in it.

If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an acid–base reaction or a neutralization reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions.|$|E
