5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke {{after they had}} a conversation about things they had done while drunk. Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years <b>old,</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months.|$|E

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years <b>old</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|In 1750 Rückerschöld married Jonas Jakobsson Dahl, an {{accountant}} {{employed by the}} high court in Stockholm. Dahl was educated at Uppsala University and {{was the son of}} a factory owner. Rückerschöld kept her maiden name throughout her life, changing it only after her father was knighted in 1751 and -schöld ("shield") was added to his last name. Rückerschöld was 25 years <b>old</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> married and Dahl 33, eight years her senior. The couple had their first child, Emerentia, in 1751, and moved to Sätra gård in modern-day Upplands Väsby, north of Stockholm in 1760. Rückerschöld gave birth to three more children between 1759 and 1765, Maria, Fredrica and Christopher. A fourth child, Chierstin, died only seven hours after her birth. The other three children reached adulthood. Emerentia married a lawspeaker in Småland while her sister Maria Fredrica remained a spinster. Christopher went to sea, but was never heard from after that. The family moved from Sätra gård to Stockholm. The earliest record of their residence in Stockholm is from 1775, and the couple remained there the rest of their lives. Both parents survived their children; Dahl died in 1796 and Rückerschöld nine years later, in 1805, at the age of 80.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1374, Louis granted various {{concessions}} to the Polish nobility by the Privilege of Koszyce, {{in exchange for their}} promise that a daughter of his would succeed him and that he, Elizabeth or his mother could indicate which one. In Hungary, he focused on the centralization of power as means of ensuring that his daughters' rights would be respected. Securing marriage to one of the princesses was a priority in European royal courts. Mary was scarcely one year <b>old</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was promised to Sigismund of Luxembourg. In 1374, Catherine was betrothed to Louis of France, but died towards the end of 1378. The same year, Hedwig, promised to William of Austria in a sponsalia de futuro, left her mother's court and moved to Vienna, where she spent the next two years. The Polish lords swore to uphold Mary's rights in 1379, while Sigismund received this recognition three years later. Elizabeth was present, along with her husband and mother-in-law, at a meeting in Zólyom on 12 February 1380, whereby Hungarian lords confirmed Hedwig's Austrian match; this indicates that Louis may have intended to leave Hungary to Hedwig and William.|$|E
