5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with <b>organophosphate</b> or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E

25|$|In {{any part}} of the world that uses organophosphates, C. megacephala could prove to be beneficial. <b>Organophosphate</b> {{compounds}} are used in agriculture and are highly toxic. <b>Organophosphate</b> poisoning often causes death, and in many cases, by evaluating the body tissue and fluids, the toxin can be identified as the source of the poisoning. However, it is somewhat difficult to evaluate the body tissue in a body that is exceedingly decomposed. Nevertheless, a medical examiner in Hawaii worked on a case in which poisoning by malathion, an <b>organophosphate</b> insecticide, was thought to be the cause of death. The victim’s stomach contents and body fat were examined and found to have contained malathion. The fly larvae of Chrysomya megacephala and Chrysomya rufifacies were also present at the scene on the body and were tested for malathion. Both of these species did contain malathion, but there had been no previous record of organophosphates in their larvae. Studying larvae from decomposed remains may provide an effective method of determining the presence of these toxins in a body that is extremely decayed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Organophosphates</b> are anticholinesterase {{agents and}} {{are among the}} most used {{neurotoxic}} pesticides. Released into the environment, they can represent a major ecotoxicological and hygienic-toxicological hazard. If humans or animals are exposed to <b>organophosphates,</b> their nervous system will always be affected more or less seriously, but the mechanisms of neurotoxicity are, in numerous cases, not yet well known. In the present study, we investigated the effect of acute treatment with two <b>organophosphates,</b> dichlorvos and dimethoate, with physostigmine as reference anticholinesterase drug, and the influence of pretreatment with atropine on the hippocampal population spikes of rats in vivo under urethane anesthesia. It was found that the <b>organophosphates</b> and physostigmine exerted very similar effects on the population Spikes (a phenomenon with well-described cholinergic modulation) : each drug induced a significant amplitude increase. Atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, had the opposite effect alone and abolished the existing effect of the <b>organophosphates</b> or of physostigmine. It was concluded that the effect of the tested anticholinesterase agents on the hippocampal population spike includes a cholinergic mechanism...|$|R
25|$|<b>Organophosphates</b> {{affect the}} nervous system by disrupting {{acetylcholinesterase}} activity, the enzyme that regulates acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Most <b>organophosphates</b> are insecticides. They were developed during the early 19th century, but their effects on insects, which are similar to their effects on humans, were discovered in 1932. Some are very poisonous. However, they usually are not persistent in the environment.|$|R

25|$|<b>Organophosphate</b> and {{carbamate}} insecticides, e.g. malathion and bendiocarb, respectively, {{are more}} expensive than DDT per kilogram and are applied {{at roughly the same}} dosage. Pyrethroids such as deltamethrin are also more expensive than DDT, but are applied more sparingly (0.02–0.3g/m2 vs 1–2g/m2), so the net cost per house is about the same.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, the EPA banned most uses of methyl {{parathion}} and azinphos methyl, citing the risks they pose to children. Both {{methyl parathion}} and azinphos methyl are organophosphates. Organophosphates are pesticides that kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these pesticides {{have the same}} effect on humans. In 2000, the EPA banned another <b>organophosphate,</b> (chlorpyrifos), that was common in the agriculture industry, household cleaners and commercial pest control products, due to a study showing that chlorpyrifos caused weakness, vomiting and diarrhea in baby rats.|$|E
40|$|The {{threshold}} of toxicological concern (TTC) concept {{is a risk}} assessment tool for substances present at low oral exposure and lacking hazard data. In the past, several thresholds were elaborated by Munro et al. (1996) and Kroes et al. (2004). For these TTC thresholds, the Cramer class III threshold {{is based on a}} broad spectrum of substances, including <b>organophosphates.</b> For <b>organophosphates</b> a separate threshold was elaborated by Kroes et al. (2004), however without adjustment of the Cramer class III threshold. Moreover, reference was made by Munro et al. (2008) that for organohalogens a separate threshold also may apply whereas the EFSA (2012) considers that carbamate substances with anti-choline esterase activity can be included in the threshold for <b>organophosphates.</b> In this paper, a reevaluation of the Munro dataset (original TTC database) was performed, focused on the thresholds for <b>organophosphates</b> including carbamates, organohalogens and remaining Cramer class III substances. This way thresholds for each of these groups are elaborated. As a results of the current reevaluation of the Munro dataset, thresholds for life-time exposure are elaborated for the group of <b>organophosphates</b> including carbamates, the group of organohalogens and the remaining Cramer class III substances, being 0. 30, 1. 5 and 4. 0. μg/kg bodyweight/day, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

25|$|Fenitrothion {{is a kind}} of <b>organophosphate</b> and it {{can affect}} the {{development}} of reproductive system of male rats. Treatment with fenitrothion to male rats causes regression of androgen-dependent organ weights because fenitrothion is a potent competitive androgen receptor antagonist. Its effect on SDN-POA is different between male rats and female rats. In male rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly increase of the volume of SDN-POA; whereas, in female rats, prenatal exposure to fenitrothion causes significantly decrease of the volume of SDN-POA. One possible explanation is that fenitrothion can alter the activity of aromatase, which then alters the level of estrogens converted by it from androgens and finally alters the volume of SDN-POA.|$|E

25|$|Many {{pesticides}} can {{be grouped}} into chemical families. Prominent insecticide families include organochlorines, organophosphates, and carbamates. Organochlorine hydrocarbons (e.g., DDT) could be separated into dichlorodiphenylethanes, cyclodiene compounds, {{and other related}} compounds. They operate by disrupting the sodium/potassium balance of the nerve fiber, forcing the nerve to transmit continuously. Their toxicities vary greatly, {{but they have been}} phased out because of their persistence and potential to bioaccumulate. <b>Organophosphate</b> and carbamates largely replaced organochlorines. Both operate through inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to transfer nerve impulses indefinitely and causing a variety of symptoms such as weakness or paralysis. Organophosphates are quite toxic to vertebrates and have in some cases been replaced by less toxic carbamates. Thiocarbamate and dithiocarbamates are subclasses of carbamates. Prominent families of herbicides include phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides (e.g. 2,4-D), triazines (e.g., atrazine), ureas (e.g., diuron), and Chloroacetanilides (e.g., alachlor). Phenoxy compounds tend to selectively kill broad-leaf weeds rather than grasses. The phenoxy and benzoic acid herbicides function similar to plant growth hormones, and grow cells without normal cell division, crushing the plant's nutrient transport system. Triazines interfere with photosynthesis. Many commonly used pesticides are not included in these families, including glyphosate.|$|E
500|$|Many {{pesticides}} are enzyme inhibitors. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is {{an enzyme}} found in animals from insects to humans. [...] It {{is essential to}} nerve cell function through its mechanism of breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into its constituents, acetate and choline. [...] This is somewhat unusual among neurotransmitters as most, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, are absorbed from the synaptic cleft rather than cleaved. [...] A large number of AChE inhibitors are used in both medicine and agriculture. [...] Reversible competitive inhibitors, such as edrophonium, physostigmine, and neostigmine, {{are used in the}} treatment of myasthenia gravis and in anaesthesia. [...] The carbamate pesticides are also examples of reversible AChE inhibitors. [...] The <b>organophosphate</b> pesticides such as malathion, parathion, and chlorpyrifos irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase.|$|E
500|$|Sodium forms {{flammable}} {{hydrogen and}} caustic sodium hydroxide on contact with water; ingestion and contact with moisture on skin, eyes or mucous membranes can cause severe burns. Sodium spontaneously explodes {{in the presence}} of an oxidizer such as water. Fire extinguishers based on water accelerate sodium fires; those based on carbon dioxide and bromochlorodifluoromethane should not be used on sodium fire. Metal fires are Class D, but not all Class D extinguishers are workable with sodium. [...] An effective extinguishing agent for sodium fires is Met-L-X. Other effective agents include Lith-X, which has graphite powder and an <b>organophosphate</b> flame retardant, and dry sand. Sodium fires are prevented in nuclear reactors by isolating sodium from oxygen by surrounding sodium pipes with inert gas. Pool-type sodium fires are prevented using different design measures called catch pan systems. They collect leaking sodium into a leak-recovery tank where it is isolated from oxygen.|$|E
