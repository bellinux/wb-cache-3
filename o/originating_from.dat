5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings <b>originating</b> <b>from</b> clay outgrew those <b>originating</b> <b>from</b> the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings <b>originating</b> <b>from</b> white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E
