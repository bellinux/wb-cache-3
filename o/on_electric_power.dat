5|$|Despite being a much weaker storm upon {{impacting}} Russia, Saomai's rains flooded coal retrieval sites, {{cutting down}} <b>on</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> supplies in Primorsky Krai. Due to the shortages, electric power was transferred there from other surrounding areas. Furthermore, a 50percent decrease in electricity output was documented {{at the local}} power station in Luchegorsk. To the south, an overflowing of the Kazachka River prompted the evacuation of over 60people. Overall, 55automobile accidents occurred in eastern Russia, leading to nine fatalities and 76people injured.|$|E

25|$|Honda's early hybrids {{including}} the first generation Insight used this design, leveraging their reputation for design of small, efficient gasoline engines; their system is dubbed Integrated Motor Assist (IMA). Starting with the 2006 Civic Hybrid, the IMA system now can propel the vehicle solely <b>on</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> during medium speed cruising. Another example is the 2005–2007 Chevrolet Silverado Hybrid, a full-size pickup truck. Chevrolet {{was able to get}} a 10% improvement on the Silverado's fuel efficiency by shutting down and restarting the engine on demand and using regenerative braking. General Motors has also used its mild BAS Hybrid technology in other models such as the Saturn Vue Green Line, the Saturn Aura Greenline and the Malibu Hybrid.|$|E
25|$|Peugeot {{presented}} {{a new concept}} hybrid electric sports sedan at the 2008 Paris Motor Show called the Peugeot RC HYmotion4. Similar to the drivetrain model used in the upcoming Chevrolet Volt, the RC concept promises the ability to run solely <b>on</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> for extended periods, with a hybrid electric powertrain filling in the gaps when extra range is needed. The RC HYmotion4 includes a 70-kW electric motor at the front wheels. The Peugeot Prologue HYmotion4 was also shown at the 2008 Paris show and {{is in many ways}} the opposite of the RC HYmotion4 concept. The Prologue puts the internal combustion engine up front and runs on diesel instead of gasoline, with the electric motor going at the back.|$|E
25|$|North Korea lost an {{estimated}} 85% {{of its power}} generation capacity due to flood damage to infrastructures such as hydropower plants, coal mines, and supply and transport facilities. UN officials reported that the power shortage from 1995 to 1997 was not due to a shortage of oil, because only two {{out of a total}} of two dozen power stations were dependent on heavy fuel oil for power generation... and these were supplied by KEDO (the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization).... About 70% of power generated in the DPRK came from hydropower sources, and the serious winter-spring droughts of 1996 and 1997 (and a breakdown on one of the Yalu River's large hydro turbines) created major shortages throughout the country at that time, severely cutting back railway transportation (which was almost entirely dependent <b>on</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power),</b> which in turn resulted in coal supply shortages to the coal-fueled power stations which supplied the remaining 20% of power in the country.|$|E

500|$|A {{lawyer from}} Ephrata, Washington, named William M. Clapp {{proposed}} in 1917 that the Columbia be dammed immediately below the Grand Coulee. He suggested a concrete dam could flood the plateau, just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago. Clapp {{was joined by}} James O'Sullivan, another lawyer, and by Rufus Woods, publisher of The Wenatchee World newspaper in the nearby agricultural centre of Wenatchee. Together, they {{became known as the}} [...] "Dam College". Woods began promoting the Grand Coulee Dam in his newspaper, often with articles written by O'Sullivan. The dam idea gained popularity with the public in 1918. [...] Backers of reclamation in Central Washington split into two camps. [...] One side, known as the [...] "pumpers", favored a dam with pumps to elevate water from the river into the Grand Coulee from which canals and pipes could be used to irrigate farmland. [...] The other side, known as the [...] "ditchers", favored diverting water from northeast Washington's Pend Oreille River via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington. [...] Many locals such as Woods, O'Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers, while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the Washington Water and Power Company (WWPC) were staunch ditchers. The pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from the dam could be used to cover costs and claimed the ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly <b>on</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

The Krymsk is a remotely controlled platform and can be equipped with weapon systems, including future laser or electromagnetic weapons.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} {{electrical}} generation was all dispatchable and consumer demand led {{how much and}} when to dispatch power. The trend in adding intermittent sources such as wind, water, solar, means the grid is beginning to be led by the intermittent supply instead. Effective use of intermittent sources relies <b>on</b> <b>electric</b> <b>power</b> grids that are carfully managed, for instance using highly dispatchable generation that is able to shut itself down whenever an intermittent source starts to generate power, and to successfully startup without warning when the intermittents stop generating. [...] Ideally {{the capacity of the}} intermittents would grow to be larger than consumer demand for periods of time, creating excess low price electricity to displace heating fuels or be converted to mechanical or chemical storage for later use.|$|E
