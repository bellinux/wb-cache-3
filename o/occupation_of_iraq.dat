5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{consider that}} the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> due to its leadership of the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003–2004. But this is not {{borne out by the}} minutes of OPEC meetings, as no US representative attended in an official capacity.|$|E
5|$|First {{activated}} in 1959, {{the brigade}} {{was a part}} of the reserves for the first 40 years of its existence, and never participated in any conflicts or wars of the 20th century. Its headquarters moved around several places until coming to Gaithersburg in 1970, where it has remained ever since. The brigade was activated into the active duty force for one year from early 2003 until early 2004 to participate in the initial invasion and <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> Operation Iraqi Freedom. After this deployment, the brigade was again placed in reserve and has since commanded units in readiness exercises for other large U.S. combat formations preparing to deploy in support of U.S. operations worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E

40|$|The recent US <b>occupations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan have renewed {{the debate}} over whether {{military}} interventions intended to impose democracy in a foreign state are consistent with liberal principles. The liberal political tradition within the United States has often been divided over this question. At issue is what place, if any, military force should have in a foreign policy dedicated to promoting goals such as the spread of electoral democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law...|$|R

5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq.</b> None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very {{volatile}} part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi {{military}} quickly proved {{no match}} for coalition military power, and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn. While Australia did not initially {{take part in the}} post-war <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq,</b> an Australian Army light armoured battlegroup—designated the Al Muthanna Task Group and including 40 ASLAV light armoured vehicles and infantry—was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation Catalyst. The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units. The AMTG later became the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)), following the hand back of Al Muthanna province to Iraqi control. Force levels peaked at 1,400 personnel in May 2007 including the OBG(W) in Southern Iraq, the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team—Iraq. A RAN frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf, while RAAF assets included C-130H Hercules and AP-3C elements. Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid-2009, while RAAF and RAN operations were redirected {{to other parts of the}} Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation Slipper.|$|E

A handful of Albanian troops have participated in the US-led invasions and <b>occupations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan.

5000|$|Milne argued {{after the}} London bombings {{that it was}} [...] "an insult to the dead" [...] and a [...] "piece of {{disinformation}} long peddled by champions <b>of</b> the <b>occupations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan" [...] to claim that al-Qaeda and its followers were motivated by [...] "a hatred of western freedoms and way of life" [...] and [...] "that their Islamist ideology aims at global domination", rather than [...] "the withdrawal of US and other western forces from the Arab and Muslim world" [...] {{and an end to}} support for Israeli <b>occupation</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian land and despotic regimes in the region. Victor J. Seidler, a Professor of Social Theory from the University of London, argued in relation to Milne's article {{that we have to be}} careful [...] "not to dismiss an Islamist rejection of the freedoms of Western urban cultures, in relation to consumerism and sexualities". Seidler argued that, contrary to Milne's claims, they were at least partly motivated by [...] "Islamist religious doctrine".|$|R

50|$|Imperialism has had {{numerous}} effects on people. Imperialism {{has often been}} the impetus for colonialism. Transnational feminism examines not only colonial history, but how imperialism {{may have contributed to}} that history. Imperialism is not an issue of only the past, but one of modern-day concern. For example, the United States <b>occupations</b> <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and Afghanistan can be seen as imperialistic in nature. The United States has also had a substantial military presence in Pakistan. Some transnational feminists argue this kind of imperialistic nature has led to the increased fundamentalism and extremism in Pakistan, which {{can be seen in the}} Zina laws. The Zina Laws are strict religious laws that regulate extramarital and premarital sex. These laws have very negative effects on women’s livelihoods. Transnational feminism looks at the reasons behind the oppression of women. Some feminists might simply look at the oppressive nature of such policies, while many transnational feminists look to how these oppressive policies came to be.|$|R
