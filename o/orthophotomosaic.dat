50|$|An {{image map}} or {{orthophotomap}} {{is a similar}} document, but is mostly regarded as an <b>orthophotomosaic</b> with some points, lines or polygon layers of a traditional map drawn over the orthophoto. An image map resembles a standard general purpose map but adds {{the use of an}} <b>orthophotomosaic</b> as a background.|$|E
50|$|The {{document}} (digital or paper) representing an <b>orthophotomosaic</b> {{with additional}} marginal information like a title, north arrow, scale bar and cartographical information is called an orthophotomap or image map. Often these maps show additional point, line or polygon layers (like a traditional map) {{on top of}} the <b>orthophotomosaic.</b> A similar document, mostly used for disaster relief, is called a spatiomap.|$|E

40|$|Ancient slope {{directions}} in the Martian Tharsis region are compared with new earth-based radar observations {{in an effort}} to detect tectonic deformations. Data were taken from 20 - 150 pixel/m Viking Orbiter images and from 200 m <b>orthophotomosaics</b> prepared by the U. S. Geological Survey. The positions of 475 lava flows were determined, covering widths between 5 - 10 km on higher slopes and 15 - 35 km on lower slopes. Most of the flows originated from four volcanos, although none issued from Olympus Mons, which makes up the central portion of the Plateau. Further radar-derived topography was made of, Arsia Mons and Syria Planum in latitudes 14 - 21 deg S to find differences in regional gradients and the lava flow directions, to determine if deformations occurred after the lava flows. A lithospheric stability is concluded, indicating no tectonic upheavals since the days of Tharsis Plateau volcanic activity...|$|R
40|$|With {{ecosystem}} services of intertidal habitats under rising pressure of human disturbance and climate change, monitoring habitat diversity is increasingly required. However, field-based surveys are time and resourceintensive and {{often do not}} provide spatially explicit information. While airborne (multi-spectral) photography and LIDA (Laser Imaging Detecting And Ranging) offer an efficient, very high resolution and high-quality solution, the costs for skilled crew and equipment often preclude their use in remote areas, for small reserves and in developing countries. We present a simple yet robust, low-cost, low-altitude aerial photography solution using a kite and off-the shelf camera equipment, resulting in photos covering the near-infrared part of the spectrum for vegetation monitoring. Photos can be mosaiced to generate 3 D models, <b>orthophotomosaics,</b> vegetation indices and supervised classifications using low-cost computer vision and remote sensing software. We demonstrate the utility of kite aerial photography for intertidal monitoring in {{a case study in}} Northern France and discuss strengths and weaknesses of kite aerial photography...|$|R
40|$|The {{indirect}} {{estimation of}} {{leaf area index}} (LAI) in large spatial scales is crucial for several environmental and agricultural applications. To this end, in this paper, we compare and evaluate LAI estimation in vineyards from different UAV imaging datasets. In particular, canopy levels were estimated from i. e., (i) hyperspectral data, (ii) 2 D RGB <b>orthophotomosaics</b> and (iii) 3 D crop surface models. The computed canopy levels {{have been used to}} establish relationships with the measured LAI (ground truth) from several vines in Nemea, Greece. The overall evaluation indicated that the estimated canopy levels were correlated (r 2 > 73 %) with the in-situ, ground truth LAI measurements. As expected the lowest correlations were derived from the calculated greenness levels from the 2 D RGB orthomosaics. The highest correlation rates were established with the hyperspectral canopy greenness and the 3 D canopy surface models. For the later the accurate detection of canopy, soil and other materials in between the vine rows is required. All approaches tend to overestimate LAI in cases with sparse, weak, unhealthy plants and canopy...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of wall {{paintings}} studies different imaging techniques are commonly used for the documentation and the decision making in term of conservation and restoration. There is nowadays some challenging issues to merge scientific imaging techniques in a multimodal context (i. e. multi-sensors, multi-dimensions, multi-spectral and multi-temporal approaches). For decades those CH objects has been widely documented with Technical Photography (TP) which gives precious information to understand or retrieve the painting layouts and history. More recently there is an increasing demand {{of the use of}} digital photogrammetry in order to provide, as one of the possible output, an <b>orthophotomosaic</b> which brings a possibility for metrical quantification of conservators/restorators observations and actions planning. This paper presents some ongoing experimentations of the LabCom MAP-CICRP relying on the assumption that those techniques can be merged through a common pipeline to share their own benefits and create a more complete documentation...|$|E
40|$|Great changes {{took place}} in {{stereophotogrammetry}} during the previous century – along with analog technology, also digital installations are now used, specifically aerial cameras and photogrammetric systems. A multitude of photogrammetric digital systems on the market allow the end product to be created from initial images recorded, in a single photogrammetric workstation. Usage of these systems depends on input data, skills, financial capacity etc. It is impossible to detect the best system, but {{the quality of the}} end-production may be assessed. Therefore, the main aim of the current research work was the quality/accuracy assessment of an <b>orthophotomosaic</b> about Estonian city Tartu produced in PHOTOMOD. The software is currently used in more than 40 countries, in Estonia it had not been used before. The investigation was conducted using ground control points, measured in the field and interactively on screen. After the measurements, the results were compared.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} a {{description}} of the techniques, both photogrammetric and geodetic, used for the data acquisition and processing concerning the project “Development of Geographic Information Systems at the Acropolis of Athens”. Aiming at the development of a Geographic Information System which will incorporate large-scale orthophotomosaics for the walls, an <b>orthophotomosaic</b> of the top view of the site, as well as a dense textured 3 D surface model of the walls along with the rock, the project is divided into three basic tasks: the geodetic, involving field measurements for the generation of a polygonometric network and terrestrial laser scanning of the walls along with the Erechtheion monument, the photogrammetric one involving image acquisition, orientation, DSM generation and orthorectification, and finally the development of the GIS. This contribution underlines particularly the methodologies applied highlighting simultaneously the potential of combining photogrammetry and state-of-the-art geodetic techniques (laser scanning) for an accurate 3 D modeling of cultural heritage sites. 1...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{advances}} can revolutionize Precision Forestry {{by providing}} accurate and fine forest information at tree level. This paper addresses {{the question of}} how and particularly when Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) should be used in order to efficiently discriminate deciduous tree species. A time series of high resolution UAS imagery was collected to cover the growing season from leaf flush to leaf fall. Full benefit was taken of the temporal resolution of UAS acquisition, {{one of the most promising}} features of small drones. The disparity in forest tree phenology is at the maximum during early spring and late autumn. But the phenology state that optimized the classification result is the one that minimizes the spectral variation within tree species groups and, at the same time, maximizes the phenologic differences between species. Sunlit tree crowns (5 deciduous species groups) were classified using a Random Forest approach for monotemporal, two-date and three-date combinations. The end of leaf flushing was the most efficient single-date time window. Multitemporal datasets definitely improve the overall classification accuracy. But single-date high resolution <b>orthophotomosaics,</b> acquired on optimal time-windows, result in a very good classification accuracy (overall out of bag error of 16 %). Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The complex {{monitoring}} of rock slides {{with the size}} of 16 ha in order to predict the development of other slides and prevent possible human and material losses. Methods: Precise geodetic point measurement, terrestrial laser and image scanning and aerial photogrammetry were used to obtain detailed knowledge about the geometry and behaviour of the rock slide. Except for terrestrial images, the images were taken using an SLR camera (set on a motor paraglide) and a compact camera (set on a remotely piloted system). The state and condition of the locality before the rock slide was taken from archive images taken by a digital large format camera. Results: Vectors and velocities of the displacements of discrete points were determined with high precision; the changes in quarry wall surfaces were determined by laser and photogrammetry scanning. Finally, high resolution <b>orthophotomosaics</b> of the site were generated using aerial photogrammetry at each observation point. Practical implications: The termination of mining and the design of the remediation works were determined according to the results of the measurements. Also, monitoring was carried out in order to observe any changes due to the implementation of a highway project based in the localisation.

40|$|We {{compiled}} a geomorphological map and a reconstruction map of glacier extension and ice-free {{areas in the}} Martel Inlet, located in King George Island, South Shetlands, Antarctica. Glacier extension data were derived of the digitized over a <b>orthophotomosaic</b> (2003), SPOT (February, 1988; March, 1995 and 2000), Quickbird (October, 2006) and Cosmo-Skymed (February, 2011) images. This mapping was supported by fieldworks {{carried out in the}} summers of 2007, 2010 and 2011, and by topographic surveys and geomorphic map in the proglacial area. Several types of glacial deposits were identified in the study area, such as frontal and lateral moraines, flutes, meltwater channels and erosional features like rock moutonnés, striations and U-shaped valleys. These features allowed reconstructing the evolution of the deglaciation environment in the Martel Inlet ice-free areas, which has been affected by a regional climate warming trend. The mapped data indicated the glaciers in study area lost about 0. 71 km² of their ice masses (13. 2 % of the 50. 3 km² total area), without any advances during 1979 - 2011. Since those years these glaciers receded by an average of 25. 9 m a - 1. These ice-free areas were susceptible to rapid post-depositional changes. </span...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{study on the}} rate of {{variations}} in Zagros central region, LANDSAT satellite data from years 1976 - 2008 were used to prepare a map comprising five classes (of land use) including agriculture, urban, forest, rocks and ranch. Accordingly, the satellite imageries relating to the given period were prepared, interpreted and mapped and variations trend was quantitatively computed, and obtained data were compared to each other while this task was done at three levels i. e. Macro-level (Central Zagros), Meso-level (Dena Protected Area) and Micro-level (Western Dena). On the other hand, measurement of canopy has been introduced as an appropriate factor in forest management and classification at micro level (11). To prepare the given map, distribution of canopy was classified by means of arithmetic interpretation of aerial photographs so that scanned aerial photos 1 : 20000 (1968) and 1 : 40000 (2001) were prepared by application of PCI Geometrica orthographically at first step and mosaic pattern was arranged from them. In the next step, the arithmetic <b>orthophotomosaic</b> was classified in three classes (dense canopy, semi-open canopy and open canopy forests) and the resulting map from this classification was prepared using ArcGIS System. To calculate canopy, dotted network with 0. 5 mm intervals was used as arithmetic layer. Statistical analyses have been adopted for a 30 -year period by means of Maximum Likelihood Supervise...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of MMS and LiDAR {{technology is a}} comprehensive solution for generating and managing geometrical and thematic information of roads. The FLI-MAP 400 airborne LiDAR system has extensively been used for surveying and mapping tasks throughout the world. The FLI-MAP system shows advanced capabilities: a pulse frequency of 150, 000 Hz, a multiple (4) return measurement possibility and {{a standard deviation of}} 1. 5 cm. Final products that are extracted from the LiDAR point cloud include 3 D object oriented maps, DTMs, DEMs and <b>orthophotomosaics.</b> The FLI-MAP system allows to accurately map the roads and all the signals, lampposts and other assets along the roads. DAVIDE (Data Acquisition Vehicle and Inertial DGPS Equipment) is a Mobile Mapping System used for generating road databases. The data is collected by integrated and synchronized sensors. The standard configuration includes 3 modules: localization module, video module and road surface module. All data is geo-referenced and is useful for tasks such as maintenance, monitoring, management, analysis and testing of roads resources. DAVIDE has surveyed more than of 20. 000 Km of road in Italy. Further to this, a DAVIDE survey can be adopted in order to capture a wide range of attribute information, referenced still photos and referenced video of the roads and along standing assets. The FLI-MAP products and DAVIDE data are geo-referenced, in Italy to the Gauss-Boaga projection. Both data sources can be combined into a detailed road cadastral system. The integrated data sets can be stored, analyzed, manipulated and visualized in Geographic Information Systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the steps for the {{production}} of a complete 3 D digital rendering and 3 D virtual tour in the exterior and the interior of the church of the Dafni Monastery is presented and described in detail. During a strong earthquake three years ago, the Byzantine Monastery of Dafni in Athens suffered severe damages. This particular monument {{is considered one of the}} most important specimens of Byzantine art and architecture worldwide and has been included in the World Heritage by UNESCO. For this effort it was necessary to create a wireframe model, a surface model and, finally, a textured model on which the final rendering and animation were based. Special considerations were made as to the use of such models and their accuracy requirements. All textural material required for the rendering was extracted from photogrammetric products, like accurate <b>orthophotomosaics</b> and rectifications, using digital image processing techniques, while keeping the high quality of the final digital model. Special decision making on technical issues was required, for the final product to be easy to use, aesthetically correct and demanding the least possible storage volume. Attention was given to the appropriate selection of the camera moving path for the creation of the video and the resolution of the images. Also, special care was given to the internal side of the church where there are large, unique and very detailed colourful mosaics, which are considered to be the masterpieces of the Byzantine art. In order to achieve an easier and cost effective way for the whole process, two broadly used commercial software programms, AutoCAD ® and 3 DStudioMax ®, were used. The final virtual tour was constructed using suitable specialized commercial video editing software. 1...|$|R
40|$|Vermetid {{gastropods}} are {{coastal habitat}} engineers which build biogenic platforms typical of intertidal rocky shores {{of central and}} south -east of the Mediterranean. These bioconstructions create a secondary habitat which increases resource availability and space for organisms, locally transforming the environment and modifying coastal geomorphology. Biological characteristics and physical structure of these bioconstructions are commonly studied by field-based sampling. Nevertheless, {{a lot of time}} is required to collect data over large areas of reef, field conditions can impair data collection and direct reef image interpretation may be a challenge due to their intertidal position. In this study, a small RPAS is used to describe the macrostructure of two vermetid reefs in different areas: Capo Gallo (NW Sicily) and Favignana Island (W Sicily). 800 m of each reef have been surveyed by using high-resolution aerial <b>orthophotomosaics</b> (2 cm/px). Detailed 3 D maps have been realized for both reefs and the following measures of ecological relevance have been estimated: external rim length, internal rim length, surface of external rim (mq), cuvette surface (mq) and reef surface (mq). Index of external rim development and Index of internal rim development have been calculated as a relationship between a standardized linear length and the length of the external and internal rim respectively. Total area for Capo Gallo reef is 2563, 26 mq; indexes of external and internal rim development are respectively 3, 40 and 1, 90. For Favignana, reef area is 1263, 15 mq and indexes of external and internal rim development are respectively 2, 56 and 1, 80. These results reveal RPAS as a powerful tool for physical description of vermetid reefs and to calculate how this biogenic habitat shapes the coast and increases habitat complexity on rocky shores. This study, moreover, shows the high potential for RPAS technique to be applied for mapping vermetid reefs and to aid the management and conservation of natural systems, as required by the EU Strategy on Biodiversity which declares the necessity of mapping habitats and the ecosystem services they provide...|$|R
