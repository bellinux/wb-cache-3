40|$|Most of the {{research}} on contextual interference effects have found that non-repetitive practice (random) as compared to repetitive practice (blocked) facilitates learning. However, when the classification of the task (open/closed) and the entry level of the subjects (beginner/advanced) are considered, the results are not consistent with previous findings. Apparently, a beginner in learning an open skill does not benefit from random practice as in a closed skill. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the contextual interference effect of differing practice schedules on the learning of an <b>open</b> <b>motor</b> skill by beginners. Six groups were used in the study: random, blocked, random-blocked, blocked-random, random-blocked-random and blocked-random-blocked. The task required the subjects to push a telegraph key to coincide with the arrival of lights with different speeds to the end of the runway of a Bassin anticipation timer. Results revealed that a low contextual interference (block practice schedule) is an indispensible prerequisite of gaining benefits from a high contextual interference effect (random practice schedule) for beginners learning <b>open</b> <b>motor</b> skills. Neither pure block or random practice schedule seemed to benefit the novice learning an <b>open</b> <b>motor</b> skill. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{a study of}} the differences in the use of cognitive strategies amongst athletes in sports with or without motor interaction. 345 subjects were asked to complete the Cognitive Strategies Questionnaire (CECD, Mora et al, 2001). Four additional items related specifically to individual and raquet/combat sports were included in the Questionnaire. These additional questions were also subject to the same criteria as those in the original CECD, 2001. The sample was also classified according to the following criteria; closed vs. <b>open</b> <b>motor</b> skills, the use of motor tasks with or without opponents, motor interaction with teammates and with teammates and opponents and the athletes' age group. In summary, the results showed significant differences between non- motor interaction and motor interaction groups, with the latter group achieving higher scores in the sport maturity variable and lower scores in the cognitive disorientation variable. Further differences related to motor skills specific to the sport as well as the athlete's age group were also noted...|$|E
40|$|Tourette's {{syndrome}} (TS) is {{a developmental}} neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics {{as well as}} psychiatric comorbidities. Disturbances of the fronto-striatal-thalamic pathways responsible for motor control and impulse inhibition have been previously described in other studies. Although differences in motor performance are well recognized, imaging data elucidating the neuronal correlates are scarce. Here, we examined 19 adult TS patients (13 men, aged 22 - 52 years, mean = 34. 3 years) and 18 age- and sex-matched controls (13 men, aged 24 - 57 years, mean = 37. 6 years) in a {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} study at 1. 5 T. We corrected for possible confounds introduced by tics, motion, and brain-structural differences as well as age, sex, comorbidities, and medication. Patients and controls were asked to perform a sequential finger-tapping task using their right, left, and both hands, respectively. Task performance was monitored by simultaneous MR-compatible video recording. Although behavioral data obtained during scanning did not show significant differences across groups, we observed differential neuronal activation patterns depending on both handedness (dominant vs. nondominant) and tapping frequency in frontal, parietal, and subcortical areas. When controlling for <b>open</b> <b>motor</b> performance, a failure of deactivation in easier task conditions was found in the subgenual cingulate cortex in the TS patients. In addition, performance-related functional connectivity of lower- and higher-order motor networks differed between patients and controls. In summary, although open performance was comparable, patients showed different neuronal networks and connectivity patterns when performing increasingly demanding tasks, further illustrating the impact of the disease on the motor system...|$|E

50|$|A Totally Enclosed, Fan-Cooled (TEFC) {{electric}} motor {{is a type}} of industrial {{electric motor}} with an enclosure that does not permit outside air to freely circulate through the interior of the motor. An external fan blows outside air over the frame of the motor to cool it. This motor is arguably the most commonly used motor in ordinary industrial environments. TEFC enclosed motors usually cost more than <b>open</b> <b>motors,</b> but offers increased protection against weather, dirt, and moisture.|$|R

50|$|Another {{negative}} {{aspect is}} that these motors may only be used where mostly-clean air is present at all times. Due to the dramatically increased risk of overheating, totally-enclosed fan cooled universal motors would be impractical, though some have been made. Such a motor would need a large fan to circulate enough air, decreasing efficiency since the motor must use more energy to cool itself. The impracticality comes from the resulting size, weight, and thermal management issues which <b>open</b> <b>motors</b> have none of.|$|R
