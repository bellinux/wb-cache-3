Luburić, the <b>organizer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second massacre, escaped Yugoslavia {{after the war and}} moved to fascist Spain, where he was assassinated by a person generally assumed to have been an agent of the Yugoslav State Security Service (UDBA). Pavelić survived the war and died in Spain in 1959. Stepinac, who failed to publicly condemn the atrocities in Glina, was accused of collaborating with the Ustaše by Yugoslavia's new Communist government and was tried in 1946, where Jednak testified against him. He was subsequently sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment and died while under house arrest in 1960. In 1986, Jednak testified against the Ustaše government's Minister of the Interior, Andrija Artuković, at his trial in Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an <b>organizer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, {{and he realized that}} the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea was to keep the Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gordon {{became an}} editor and {{reporter}} for the Stockton Narrow Gauge. In 1874, she bought the Stockton Weekly Leader and converted into a daily newspaper, becoming the first female publisher of a paper in the United States.

5|$|The revolting nobility had thus chosen Uroš {{as their}} {{candidate}} for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a {{war for the}} throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced {{to give up the}} crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš quickly captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav's wife, Beloslava. Beloslava spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The fact that she was the <b>organizer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resistance against Uroš is known from an edict dated to the summer of 1243, in which the Ragusans swore to King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava's resistance work. Since Vladislav is not mentioned anywhere, it means that he was likely imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|Retaining an {{interest}} in class and race-based radicalism, she established contacts with various far right activists in the neighboring United States, including Willis Carto and James K. Warner, the latter being the New York <b>organizer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American Nazi Party. Warner had earlier attempted to establish Odinism as a religious wing of the American Nazi movement, but having believed {{this to be a}} failure he gave Christensen all of his leftover material on Odinism. It was in this material that Christensen came across the Call of Our Ancient Nordic Religion, a pamphlet authored by the Australian Odinist Alexander Rud Mills. Although Christensen believed that many of Mills' ideas were too heavily influenced by Freemasonry for her liking, she was profoundly influenced by his ideas about reviving the worship of ancient Norse deities. Her approach to the understanding of such deities would be heavily influenced by Jungian psychology, believing that the Norse deities were encoded in a collective unconscious of the white race.|$|E
5|$|The communists {{consolidated}} {{power by}} gradually whittling away {{the rights of}} their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party – Mikołajczyk's PSL. In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were being sentenced to death on trumped up charges — among them Witold Pilecki, the <b>organizer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Auschwitz resistance, and numerous leaders of Armia Krajowa and the Council of National Unity. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially, or forced to exile. The opposition members were also persecuted by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and right-wing organizations by state security kept some partisans in the forests, {{the actions of the}} Ministry of Public Security of Poland (UB, Polish secret police), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The right-wing insurgency radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945 and faded after the amnesty of February 1947.|$|E
5|$|The king sent St-Calais on {{diplomatic}} {{missions to}} the French royal court and to Rome. After the king's imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was {{also concerned about}} the king's refusal to allow the delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal permission was secured. To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, to explain to the pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo. St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands. Some historians, including David Bates, have argued that St-Calais was {{the driving force behind the}} organization of the entire Domesday survey, although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop. Pierre Chaplais, who argues for St-Calais being the main <b>organizer</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survey, argues the bishop's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the Little Domesday Book, a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted.|$|E
