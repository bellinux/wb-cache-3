Cyber Security Act (hereinafter {{referred}} to as "CSA") {{and its impact on}} <b>obliged</b> <b>entities</b> with focus on the regional authorities of the Czech Republic. The thesis starts with introduction into the issue of the CSA and cybersecurity {{from the point of view}} of the state, subsequently it refocuses on the level of regulated organizations. The main pillar and contribution of the thesis is the CSA analysis with the aim to identify impact of the CSA in the <b>obliged</b> <b>entities.</b> Based on this analysis author designed the questionnaire survey of the CSA impact on the regional authorities. The survey relates to information security management system, kinds of burden stemmed from the CSA implementation, willingness to use funding from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to implement the CSA, a possibility to outsource the cybersecurity and also opinions of the county council staff about the CSA. The survey shows that in spite of a pressure on standardization stemming from legal framework, county councils differs significantly in regard to information security management systems. On the other hand, respondents agreed on positive impact of the CSA on improvement of information and the cyber security although the CSA brings significant financial and organizational load to the organization. The survey also shows that some regional authorities only start to implement cybersecurity currently. The cybersecurity evolves in the researched organization quite dynamically and it would be beneficial to repeat the impact analyses again, after first wave of the CSA implementation will be finished...|$|R

Therefore, this kind of conduct can be punished as a crime, including the active involvement of banks in money laundering. However, the diploma thesis focuses mainly on preventive measures introduced by the provisions of administrative law. The role of a well-functioning banking system is essential for the effective suppression of money laundering and financing of terrorism. Banks are the most frequent reporters of suspicious transactions and the bank services are used by wide range of persons. The role of banks is mainly determined by their designation as <b>obliged</b> <b>entities</b> by the Act no. 253 / 2008 Coll., on certain measures against the legalization of proceeds of crime and terrorist financing. The obligations arising out of this act are put into context with the Czech Banking Act and with regulations governing payments and implementation of international sanctions, including directly applicable laws of the European Union. The importance of the bank services is also caused by the regulation of cash payments.

Another topic that will be addressed is the evolution, during the same period, of the amount and quality of the reports made by <b>obliged</b> <b>entities.</b> In order to complete these goals, state-of-the-art literature on the topic was reviewed and relevant reports of each country were analyzed. With this information in hand, it was possible to compare both countries in the evolution of: the number of reports filled in, with both a data and a graphical analysis; the quality level of the same reports, by using a quality report ratio, which represents the number of reports per investigation started; and the compared level of compliance between Portugal and the USA, with a descriptive analysis of the main changes performed. The main conclusions taken in this dissertation include the fact that Portuguese reports have been increasing in terms of quality, although the situation in terms of quantity is not improving. The USA has had a high and constant number of reports throughout the whole period in study, maintaining, however, a low but constant level of quality. Finally, in terms of the level of compliance evolution, both countries show a trend of convergence, with Portugal having a very positive evolution in the latest years despite its late start in regulating against the crimes in analysis...|$|R

The constitutional procedure is not a part o f tax procedure but there is possibility to use it in Poland by means o f a constitutional complaint (skarga konstytucyjna). The essence o f that complaint to Trybunał Konstytucyjny (Polish Constitutional Tribunal) is to eliminate any tax law which fails to secure the freedoms and rights.

40|$|Purpose: The {{focus of}} this study is the {{implementation}} and adoption of international accounting standards in Australia in the period 2002 - 2005. The adoption of international standards came into play when the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) with the persuasion of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) launched its harmonisation program in 1996. The aim of the harmonisation program was {{to improve the quality of}} Australia’s standards and to improve the international comparability of the existing standards for cross border listing. ASX funded the harmonisation program to ensure that ultimately AASB would adopt the international accounting standards. Also, the Liberal government introduced the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) as a body to oversee the AASB standard setting process to ensure the move towards international harmonisation in Australia. The FRC was proposed by the government as part of the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (CLERP) in 1997. Theoretical framework: This study applies a critical approach to analyse and explain the political environment that existed at the time the AASB was directed by FRC, in 2002, to work towards the wholesale adoption of international accounting standards by 1 January 2005. Discourse Analysis has been used as the method to identify the key players involved in the adoption of international accounting standards during 2002. The literary devices and wordy flourishes that have been used by the key players to promote action have been taken into account. In particular, this study investigates the ASX activities that took place around 2002 in relation to the push towards wholesale adoption of international standards as an important factor for ASX to increase its possible and existing listings. The theoretical framework adopted for the purpose of explaining the key players actions, is based on the Actor Network Theory (ANT) and in particular Callon’s translation model. In ANT, translation is the mechanism by which the networks progressively take form, resulting in a situation where certain actors control others. According to Callon (1986 a, p. 26) “translation is a definition of roles, a distribution of roles and the delineation of a scenario” the actors try “to <b>oblige</b> an <b>entity</b> to consent to detour”. Translation, when an actor network is created, consists of four moments, problematisation, interessement, enrolment, and mobilisation. Every moment of the translation process requires rhetorical devices to be successful and lead to one another. Findings: By closely looking at the procedures that led to adoption of the international accounting standards, as well as the history of standard setting in Australia. It can be argued that Australia has been always influenced by the UK and US accountancy. This behaviour has been justified by different persuasive reasoning in different period of time, for example when early professional accountancy bodies in Australia adopted their English counterpart’s guidelines and objectives, it was on the premise that it had widespread application in Britain over several years as the “proof of their soundness and acceptance” (ICAA 1966, p. 3) ...|$|R

On the other hand, allocating FiP through a tender mechanism can be very cost-effective. These mechanisms, however, grant producers a favorable bargaining position {{that may lead to}} above-normal profit margins, reducing policy efficiency. Instead, the bargaining power retained by consumers in TGC markets reduces the profit margin of producers when more competition is introduced. The role of regulatory uncertainty in green certiﬁcate markets The first part of this dissertation presents some simulation analyses aiming to predict the performance of renewable energy policy ex-ante. Chapter 6 and 7 take a different approach, instead, developing two ex-post econometric analyses of European TGC markets. Chapter 6 introduces the first analysis which takes the Swedish/Norwegian market as a case study. Price volatility in TGC markets reflects uncertainty over future prices, representing a major source of risk for renewable energy generators. Price risk is considered the principal deficiency of renewable quota obligations since it causes investors to require higher returns. Moreover, investors are exposed to regulatory risk; namely, the risk that a change in the regulation will materially impact the TGC price. Regulatory uncertainty is reflected in market volatility exacerbating TGC price risk. Using an econometric approach, this study investigates the role of regulatory changes on price volatility. As a case study it focuses on the Swedish TGC market which was introduced in 2003 and has become the first multi-national market of this kind in January 2012, when Norway joined the mechanism. A bigger market is expected to guarantee a diversification of natural resources, reducing fluctuations in TGC supply and thus the volatility of market price. An endogenous structural break test is applied to the residuals of a GARCH model to detect changes in the unconditional variance of the TGC price. The test finds two breaks corresponding to regulatory changes occurred in the Swedish TGC market, indicating that the market entered a regime of higher volatility between 2010 and 2011. Volatility was caused by the ambiguity surrounding an increased quota regulation {{and the creation of a}} multi-national market. Interestingly, the joint market has not led to a significant decline in volatility compared to past levels, yet. Overall, this study provides evidence for the negative impact of regulatory changes in TGC markets, indicating that regulatory uncertainty leads to increased volatility, exacerbating price risk and restraining investors. For this reason, policy makers should be very careful in changing the regulatory framework of TGC markets. The price drivers of green certiﬁcate markets Chapter 7 presents the second econometric analysis which studies the pricing behavior of market participants in the Swedish/Norwegian and the UK certificate markets. This study analyzes the link between TGC prices and the macroeconomic environment, comparing the two countries in the light of their regulatory frameworks. Results indicate that the TGC price in the UK is positively affected by the level of industrial production but unaffected by energy prices which influence the electricity price. On the other hand, the Swedish/Norwegian market follows a long-run equilibrium with energy prices such that rising fuel prices, which lead to higher electricity prices, are accompanied by lower TGC prices. The differences found in the pricing behavior of the two markets are related to the characteristics of the two systems. TGC supply is less flexible in the UK market where wind contributes to more than half of the supply and strict limits are imposed on certificate banking. This leads to a market in which the TGC price is affected by the fluctuations of TGC demand caused by variations in economic activity. In this case, price volatility can be reduced by increasing certificate validity to more than one year. In the Swedish market instead, an important part of TGC supply is obtained from biofuel-fired generators. This, together with no limitation on certificate banking, has led to a more flexible supply of TGCs. The TGC price so reflects the increased cost of producing electricity from biomass as an alternative to conventional fossil fuels, being less dependent on economic activity. Policy makers could create more favourable conditions for investing in low marginal-cost technologies, such as wind generators, by introducing a floor price which reduces project risk. Green certiﬁcate options After investigating the impact of renewable energy policy on investments and studying the drivers of TGC market prices, it is clear that the main drawback of a TGC market derives from the uncertainty faced by investors about future project revenues. The European Commission has recently proposed to auction FiPs to provide predictable revenues for investors while preventing an over-compensation for producers, thus limiting the cost to the public. An auction for FiPs combines the best of both price-based and quantity-based instruments and corresponds to a TGC market in which TGCs are traded through long-term contracts. Nonetheless, while this mechanism combines investor certainty with the economic efficiency of a competitive market, it effectively eliminates the short-term market for TGCs. This would reduce allocative efficiency and cost-reduction incentives for generators. Chapter 8 presents a novel approach which allows the regulator to reduce investors’ exposure to price risk, although without completely removing it, maintaining the central role of the TGC market. The proposed mechanism consists in the regulator auctioning call option contracts instead of FiPs. Generators receive a fixed premium in exchange for giving the regulator the right to buy TGCs at a determined price. This premium partially covers the cost of renewable energy producers, reducing revenue volatility and thus lowering project risk. At the same time, option contracts do not affect market liquidity since the regulator maintains the obligation for <b>obliged</b> <b>entities</b> to buy TGCs. In the proposed mechanism, market participants optimize their operational planning according to the electricity and the TGC prices. The TGC market thus maintains a central role, stimulating participants to make efficient use of resources and incentivizing producers to reduce generation costs. The option premium paid to generators also functions as a long-term price indicator to the market, facilitating the strategic planning of investors. This combines short-term operational efficiency with long-term market stability, dampening investment cycles and minimizing the cost of renewable energy subsidies. Conclusions This dissertation focuses on market-based mechanisms and how they can promote renewable energy development in the most effective and efficient way for society. Together with the EU ETS, supporting renewable energy is necessary to achieve a sustainable electricity sector efficiently. Open-ended feed-in mechanisms led to boom and bust investment cycles in many European countries, where national governments were forced to retroactively reduce the subsidy levels and in some cases to suspend the support program in order to limit unsustainable subsidy costs after years of boom in the renewable energy sector. Chapters 3 and 4 indicate that an annual quantity target is necessary to obtain a stable development of the renewable sector and that quantity-based mechanisms should be preferred. Due to the flat marginal cost curve of many RES, price-based mechanisms cause high uncertainty in quantities. Unexpected high volumes of renewable electricity generation may also alter the well-functioning of the EU ETS, causing low carbon prices to attract investments in coal-fired generators which could lock the power sector into a pathway of higher future emissions. Two alternative quantity-based mechanisms have been implemented by policy makers in Europe so far: TGC markets and tendering mechanisms. Chapters 4 and 5 indicates that a renewable quota obligation based on a system of TGCs is risky for investors and its performance strongly depends on investors’ risk aversion. Regulators may introduce a floor price to reduce project risk in a TGC system. The result of this hybrid policy, however, strongly depends on the regulator setting the right price level, similarly to a feed-in mechanism. On the other hand, a tender mechanism is very cost-effective. This mechanism, however, eliminates the short-term market for TGCs, reducing allocative efficiency and cost-reduction incentives for generators. Efficiency is also slightly reduced by the bargaining power retained by investors in the auction that may cause above-normal profit margins for generators. This dissertation proposes an innovative market-based policy, instead. The proposed approach consists in combining a traditional TGC market with a system of certificate call options auctioned by the regulator on behalf of <b>obliged</b> <b>entities.</b> This mechanism represents a hybrid between a TGC market and a tendering system, combining the best characteristics of the two. This system is fair to both consumers and producers, allowing consumers to bargain for a reasonable price in the market while protecting investors with reduced revenue uncertainty. Nonetheless, the European experience indicates that the performance of a TGC market depends on its regulatory framework and policy stability. Flexible TGC supply is necessary for the market to function efficiently, since demand is administratively set and price-inelastic. The green certificate option mechanism is easily combined with technology banding, allowing policy makers to allocate a certain percentage of options to flexible biomass-fired generators. In addition, regulators should permit certificate banking and intertemporal trading. In conclusion, an efficient policy for supporting renewable energy should let the interplay between demand and supply establish a fair subsidy level for renewables. Policy makers should limit their role to defining an annual RES target and the contribution of each technology to it. A third design variable consists of deciding the proportion of fixed and volatile subsidy. The cost structure of some renewable energy technologies, in fact, requires a certain degree of revenue predictability to make these projects easier to finance. So far, policy makers have always opted for either fixed or volatile subsidies. This thesis demonstrates that it is possible to allocate the subsidy level of each technology between a fixed and a variable part, providing regulators with a wide range of options. By tuning the three design variables correctly, policy makers can achieve renewable energy targets efficiently and effectively...|$|R
