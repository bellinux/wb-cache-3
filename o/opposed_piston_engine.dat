50|$|Opposed {{piston engines}} have been {{manufactured}} using one, {{two and three}} crankshafts. However, the first <b>opposed</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> produced was by the French company Gobron-Brillié in 1900. The engine had one crankshaft and is very similar in concept to the EcoMotors OPOC engine design, except using a camshaft and valves. In 1903 a Gobron-Brillié car powered by the <b>opposed</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engine</b> was the first car ever to reach 100 mph.|$|E

50|$|Direct-injection {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engines}} {{tend to use}} exhaust valves actuated either by camshafts or electronic control, rather than exhaust ports. This system is called uniflow scavenging. <b>Opposed</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> are inherently uniflow-scavenged, but these do use piston-controlled cylinder ports. Two-stroke <b>opposed</b> <b>piston</b> <b>engines</b> such as the Napier Deltic and Junkers Jumo 204 <b>engines</b> use one <b>piston</b> to control the inlet port and the other the exhaust, allowing more flexibility in timing. A variation {{of this approach is}} taken by the split-single engine, in which two cylinders share one combustion chamber, with the piston in one cylinder controlling the transfer port and the other the exhaust port.|$|R
