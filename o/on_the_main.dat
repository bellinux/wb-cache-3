5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> deck further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E
