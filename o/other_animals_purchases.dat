40|$|What {{calls for}} justice? Are we called {{to do justice}} to <b>other</b> <b>animals?</b> How ought we to {{understand}} and relate to the <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> around us? The work of Jacques Derrida offers a strong foundation from which to consider these questions, and I build on his work by developing a set of clear conceptual tools to understand justice and animality (or animal alterity) through the demands they make on us. I argue that this interrelation between justice and animality can be addressed in a profound way by considering the figure of 2 ̆ 2 the call 2 ̆ 2 —including the calls of <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> and the call of justice. I use the 2 ̆ 2 the call 2 ̆ 2 to offer the reader a tool for opening up their own relations to <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> their responsibilities to them, and the richly differentiated lives of those <b>other</b> <b>animals,</b> all of which can be addressed by carefully listening to the call...|$|R
