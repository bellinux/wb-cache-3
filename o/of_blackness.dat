25|$|If {{one uses}} the blood quantum {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>blackness,</b> then blacks came to Honduras {{early in the}} colonial period. One of the mercenaries who aided Pedro de Alvarado in his conquest of Honduras in 1536 was a black slave working as a mercenary to earn his freedom. Alvarado sent his own slaves from Guatemala to work the placer gold deposits in western Honduras as early as 1534. The earliest black slaves consigned to Honduras {{were part of a}} license granted to the Bishop Cristóbal de Pedraza in 1547 to bring 300 slaves into Honduras.|$|E

In autumn 1811, Wellington placed Hill in independent command of 16,000 men watching Badajoz. On 28 October {{he led a}} successful raid on the French at the Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos. On 21 January 1812 he {{was appointed to the}} honorary position of Governor <b>of</b> <b>Blackness</b> Castle and on 22 February 1812 he was appointed a KB. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword on 4 May 1812.|$|E

25|$|Prince fired Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis from The Time in 1983 {{because their}} {{production}} career began overtaking {{their roles in}} the band. Their Flyte Tyme Productions began to gain national attention, and excelled at mainstream urban contemporary music, which had often been shunned by critics. The pair's first mainstream breakthrough was Janet Jackson's Control in 1986, which propelled her career and spawned numerous projects seeing the writing/production team work with artists as varied as Twin Cities acts Mint Condition, and Sounds <b>of</b> <b>Blackness,</b> to internationally-established acts Michael Jackson, New Edition, Boyz II Men, Patti LaBelle, and Human League.|$|E
25|$|During the Marian {{civil war}} which {{followed}} the forced abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1567, the garrison <b>of</b> <b>Blackness</b> remained loyal to her. However, the Keeper, Alexander Stewart later changed sides {{to join the}} Regent Moray's party. In 1572, Lord Claud Hamilton recaptured the castle for Mary, harrying shipping in the Forth until the following year, despite being blockaded. On 27 January 1573, James Kirkcaldy, the brother of William Kirkcaldy of Grange who held Edinburgh Castle for Queen Mary, arrived at Blackness from France with arms and money for the Queen's side. His ship was captured {{the next day and}} Regent Morton laid siege. James Kirkcaldy and the castle surrendered within a week.|$|E
25|$|During her marriage, Mary {{became known}} for her {{literary}} endeavours and also for her performances in several masques. In 1605 she danced at the Whitehall Banqueting House in The Masque <b>of</b> <b>Blackness,</b> which was designed by Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones. Mary Wroth joined the Queen and her friends in the production; all of whom painted their skin black to portray Ethiopian nymphs who called themselves the 'twelve daughters of Niger'. The masque was very successful {{and was the first}} in a long series of similar court entertainments. The ‘twelve daughters of Niger’ also appeared in The Masque of Beauty in 1608, also designed by Jonson and Jones. However, despite the success there were some less than favorable reviews, some referring to the women's portrayal of the daughters of Niger as ugly and unconvincing.|$|E

25|$|In 1870, {{the role}} <b>of</b> <b>Blackness</b> changed again, {{and it became}} the central {{ammunition}} depot for Scotland. Numerous works were carried out, including the roofing-over of the entire courtyard, and the {{levelling of the ground}} to the east. The defensive ditch was filled in and barracks built to the south. The cast-iron pier was constructed in 1868, with a gate and a drawbridge, one of the last to be built in Britain. The depot closed in 1912, although it was briefly reoccupied during World War I, and the castle passed into the care of the Office of Works. A restoration programme was undertaken between 1926 and 1935, which entailed the removal of almost all the 19th-century works, and the rebuilding of medieval-style features, which may not fully reflect the original features of the castle.|$|E
25|$|Racoon {{captured}} another privateer on 20 October, but it sank {{shortly after}} capture. Racoon {{was about three}} leagues NW by W <b>of</b> <b>Blackness</b> at 6 a.m. {{in the morning when}} she sighted three luggers ahead. She immediately sailed towards them and after a two-hour running fight was able to capture one. The captive was the Vigilante, of twelve 4-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. She had a crew of some 50 men on board, all under the command of Citizen Muirbassse. When the prize crew went on board Vigilante they found that he was taking on water rapidly due to shot holes in her hull. Racoon tried to stop the leaks, which took up so much time that the other two privateers were able to make their escape. Lloyd was able to get all his prisoners aboard Racoon, leaving only the dead behind, and watched Valiante sink at 9 a.m. Valiante was new and had been out only once before and had not captured anything. One of the luggers that escaped had taken a prize that another British warship recaptured two hours later.|$|E
500|$|Anne's masques were {{responsible}} for almost all the courtly female performance {{in the first two}} decades of the seventeenth century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women's performance. Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses of 1604, she played Pallas Athena, wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in The Masque <b>of</b> <b>Blackness</b> of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as [...] "blackamores". Letter writer Dudley Carleton reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, he kissed her hand [...] "though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips". Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones.|$|E

500|$|Postmodern {{cultural}} critic bell hooks {{cited the}} interaction in the Memphis train station between Thomas and the Japanese couple {{as one of}} the few examples of nuanced, deconstructive and subversive treatment <b>of</b> <b>blackness</b> in American film. In his original review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert proclaimed that [...] "he best thing about Mystery Train is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself, if you only knew where to look." [...] He later included the movie in his Great Movies collection, comparing the movie favorably to Jarmusch's later efforts like Dead Man and The Limits of Control. In an April 2000 retrospective of Jarmusch's work for Sight & Sound, Shawn Levy concluded that the film was [...] "as much a valentine to the allure of the American way of pop culture as it is a cheeky bit of structural legerdemain without terribly much resonating significance".|$|E
500|$|As {{a college}} junior, {{he opened his}} first show at the Schneider Gallery. By 2000, he had earned a {{reputation}} for his unique photo-printing process and his medium and large scale works were priced at up to US$3,000. In 2000, some of his early black-and-white photography work was described as [...] "spectacularly rich" [...] by The New York Times; the Chicago Sun-Times referred to his 2000 collection of portraits of homeless men [...] "stunning", and he was noted {{for a series of}} large-scale photos of feet that serve as his interpretation of human migration in 2001. [...] Then, he exhibited in the notable 2001 Freestyle show, a show that is credited with having launched Johnson's career. The curator of the show, Thelma Golden, is credited with coining the term post-black art in relation to that exhibit, although some suggest the term is attributable to the 1995 book The End <b>of</b> <b>Blackness</b> by Debra Dickerson, who is a favorite of Johnson. [...] The term post-black now refers to art where race and racism are prominent, but where the importance of the interaction of the two is diminished.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) {{is upset}} that Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{cross-dressing}} on TGS {{because it is}} demeaning to African-Americans. After a bit of objection, Toofer convinces Tracy to stop, handing the female character over to Josh Girard (Lonny Ross). Once Josh's character is successful, Tracy is upset with Toofer. Liz convinces Toofer to work with Tracy. As they work together, Tracy gets upset with Toofer's supposed lack <b>of</b> <b>blackness,</b> and endearingly calls Toofer a racial slur. The next morning, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), Liz, Toofer, and Tracy {{sit down for a}} meeting about Tracy's vocabulary from the previous night. Tracy and Jack point out that the African-American community has adopted the word to deprive it of its meaning. In trying to reach out to Tracy, Toofer says the word again but because of his perceived cultural whiteness, everyone, including Tracy, is offended in a way they weren't when Tracy used the term. Tracy and Toofer attend sensitivity training, start arguing, and in the process develop a new sketch for TGS. When show starts running short on time, Liz offers Tracy the option to either air the sketch or one from the Star Jones cooking show, Tracy chooses the latter. Toofer is initially upset, but agrees with Tracy's decision when he finds the sketch funny.|$|E

500|$|Rampersad {{suggests}} that Haley understood autobiographies as [...] "almost fiction". In [...] "The Color of His Eyes: Bruce Perry's Malcolm and Malcolm's Malcolm", Rampersad criticizes Perry's biography, Malcolm: The Life of a Man Who Changed Black America, {{and makes the}} general point that {{the writing of the}} Autobiography is part of the narrative <b>of</b> <b>blackness</b> in the 20th century and consequently should [...] "not be held utterly beyond inquiry". To Rampersad, the Autobiography is about psychology, ideology, a conversion narrative, and the myth-making process. [...] "Malcolm inscribed in it the terms of his understanding of the form even as the unstable, even treacherous form concealed and distorted particular aspects of his quest. But there is no Malcolm untouched by doubt or fiction. Malcolm's Malcolm is in itself a fabrication; the 'truth' about him is impossible to know." [...] Rampersad {{suggests that}} since his 1965 assassination, MalcolmX has [...] "become the desires of his admirers, who have reshaped memory, historical record and the autobiography according to their wishes, which is to say, according to their needs as they perceive them." [...] Further, Rampersad says, many admirers of MalcolmX perceive [...] "accomplished and admirable" [...] figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and W. E. B. DuBois inadequate to fully express black humanity as it struggles with oppression, [...] "while Malcolm is seen as the apotheosis of black individual greatness ... he is a perfect hero—his wisdom is surpassing, his courage definitive, his sacrifice messianic". Rampersad suggests that devotees have helped shape the myth of MalcolmX.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing House of Music in Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker found Tony! Toni!

Sonia Murray of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution hailed it as the band's most effectual and multifaceted record yet, while Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot said [...] "they find rapture that is steeped in reality rather than in the upwardly mobile fantasy concocted by many of today's less tradition-conscious R crooners." [...] "The Tonies serve as a sort of stylistic missing link", J. D. Considine wrote in The Baltimore Sun, [...] "suggesting what would have happened had the soul styles of the '70s continued to evolve, instead of being tossed aside by the synth-driven sound of the '80s". Michael A. Gonzales from Vibe said the album [...] "glows a vision <b>of</b> <b>blackness</b> that is superbad, mad smooth, and crazy sexy". He described it as [...] "a wonderland of harmonic delights, softcore jollies, and slow-jam fever floating on the tip of Cupid's arrow", showing the group [...] "exploring the sensuality of black pop without sounding like boulevard bullies stalking their objects of desire". House of Music finished 30th in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop poll, which ranked the year's best albums as voted on by 236 American critics nationwide. Robert Christgau, the poll's supervisor, named it the tenth best album of 1996 in his own year-end list.
