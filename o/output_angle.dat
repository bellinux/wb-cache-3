30|$|With the {{assistance}} of PLL, current and voltage variables can be transformed from the abc stationary frame to the dq synchronous rotational frame and vice versa. The real and imaginary components of the current are regulated by a proportional-integral (PI) controller in the synchronous reference frame. In Fig.  1, two dq domains are defined respectively [20]. One is the system dq domain utilizing the actual phase-angle of the phasor Ũ_PCC. The variables of the system dq domain are all marked by the superscript s. The other one is the converter dq domain which applies the <b>output</b> <b>angle</b> of the PLL for dq transformation. The variables of the converter dq domain are all marked by the superscript c.

One such device is a nematic liquid-crystal optical-phased-array (LCOPA). An LCOPA can implement a blazed phase-grating to steer the incident light. However, when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system, two adverse effects can occur. First, dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different <b>output</b> <b>angles,</b> causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane. Secondly, the device will steer energy {{not only to the}} first diffraction order, but to others as well.
