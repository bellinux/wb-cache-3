40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{are widely used}} in marine engineering applications and chemical plants as a substitute <b>of</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> steels for many advantages <b>of</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> steels. Duplex {{stainless steels}} such as UNS S 81921 and S 32205 have higher strength and corrosion resistance than austenitic stainless steel UNS S 31603, resulting in weight reduction of the component. Besides, duplex stainless steels are very cost-effective due to their low Ni content. It {{is well known that}} higher Cr and N contents <b>of</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> steels than those <b>of</b> austenitic <b>stainless</b> steels increase the corrosion resistance to localized corrosion in chloride environments significantly [1, 2]. However, due to the lowe...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal aging on tensile {{properties}} <b>of</b> cast <b>stainless</b> steels during service in light water reactors has been evaluated. Tensile data for several experimental and commercial heats <b>of</b> cast <b>stainless</b> steels are presented. Thermal aging increases the tensile strength of these steels. The high–C Mo–bearing CF– 8 M steels {{are more susceptible}} to thermal aging than the Mo–free CF– 3 or CF– 8 steels. A procedure and correlations are presented for predicting the change in tensile flow and yield stresses and engineering stress–vs. –strain curve <b>of</b> cast <b>stainless</b> steel as a function of time and temperature of service. The tensile properties <b>of</b> aged cast <b>stainless</b> steel are estimated from known material information, i. e., chemical composition and the initial tensile strength of the steel.

5|$|Ferrite (α-iron) is {{a fairly}} soft metal that can {{dissolve}} only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910°C). Austenite (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146°C).

40|$|Key words: 434 {{stainless}} steel fibres; the corrosion rates; weight loss method Abstract. The effects of concentration and temperature of hydrochloric acid and etching {{time on the}} corrosion rates <b>of</b> 434 <b>stainless</b> steel fibres are investigated by using weight loss method. The results show that with the concentration of hydrochloric acid increase, the temperature of hydrochloric acid rise, etching time prolonging, the corrosion rate <b>of</b> 434 <b>stainless</b> steel fibres is increased, and the corrosion rate of small dimension <b>of</b> 434 <b>stainless</b> steel fibres faster. Though Cl of hydrochloric acid doesn’t take direct part in the reaction, the corrosion rate is significantly accelerated. ...|$|R

BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> steel plates to express abstraction.|$|E

5|$|The Pioneer Zephyr is a {{diesel-powered}} railroad train formed {{of railroad}} cars permanently articulated together with Jacobs bogies, {{built by the}} Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB), {{commonly known as the}} Burlington. The train featured extensive use <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included innovations such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, and stress corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E
5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied to all of the same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding <b>of</b> <b>stainless</b> steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E
