500|$|Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>In</b> response, Tedder {{commented that}} he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her {{criticism}} was [...] "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] are completely different. Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." [...] Clarkson later told James Montgomery of MTV News that it was unfortunate [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.|$|E

During a phone conversation, Ryan said he wants an iPod music player that also serves as a phone, but not an iPhone, which is essentially that very product; both items are Apple products. Michael listens to [...] "Just Dance", a Lady Gaga song, while driving his convertible to work, which he mistakes for a Britney Spears song.

[...] Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed.

40|$|Abstract—Mobile phones play {{a pivotal}} role in {{supporting}} ubiquitous and unobtrusive sensing of human activities. However, maintaining a highly accurate record of a user’s behavior throughout the day imposes significant energy demands <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone’s</b> battery. <b>In</b> this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of METIS: an adaptive mobile sensing platform that efficiently supports social sensing applications. The platform implements a novel sensor task distribution scheme that dynamically decides whether to perform sensing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrastructure, considering the energy consumption, accuracy, and mobility patterns of the user. By comparing the sensing distribution scheme with sensing performed solely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> or exclusively <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fixed remote sensors, we show, through benchmarks using real traces, that the opportunistic sensing distribution achieves over 60 % and 40 % energy savings, respectively. This is confirmed through a real world deployment in an office environment for over a month: we developed a social application over our frameworks, that is able to infer the collaborations and meetings of the users. In this setting the system preserves over 35 % more battery life over pure phone sensing. I...|$|R
