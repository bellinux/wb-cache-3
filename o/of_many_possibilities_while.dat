Heterogeneity in tastes for private vs. public goods produces a tendency to positive assortment and partnerships of couples with similar tastes; heterogeneity in tastes for different public goods brings about partnerships of couples with similar tastes only if there is a significant overlap in the distribution of tastes of the two groups to be matched. We show that with two public goods we may get negative assortment, pure positive assortment being only one <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>possibilities...</b>|$|R

A subsequent flyby of Pluto was impossible, because the close approach of Titan meant it was also on a trajectory that slingshotted it upwards out of the ecliptic. Because no mission to Pluto was planned by any space agency at the time, it would be left unexplored by interplanetary spacecraft for years to come.|$|R

50|$|The {{statistical}} {{interpretation is}} related to quantum mechanics in describing the way that energy is distributed (quantized) amongst molecules on specific energy levels, with all {{the energy of the}} macrostate always in only one microstate at one instant. Entropy is described as measuring the energy dispersal for a system by the number of accessible microstates, the number of different arrangements of all its energy at the next instant. Thus, an increase in entropy means a greater number of microstates for the final state than for the initial state, and hence more possible arrangements of a system's total energy at any one instant. Here, the greater 'dispersal of the total energy of a system' means the existence <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>possibilities.</b>|$|R

30|$|Our chosen {{boundary}} between quantum and classical is one <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>possibilities.</b> Indeed, defining the quantumness of the simulation entirely {{in terms of}} the device is not common. Many others [49, 50] take the quantum in quantum simulator to relate to the model being simulated {{as well as to the}} simulating device. In common with definitions of quantum computation, our assignment of the quantum in quantum simulator based only on the device avoids the assumption that only simulating quantum models is hard enough to potentially benefit from a quantum device. This is not so: finding the ground state of even a classical Ising model is NP-hard and thus thought to be inefficient on both a classical and quantum device [75, 76].|$|R

Describing the risks, families express apprehension about adolescents’ safety and indicate fi elds of concerns which need to be covered in parental intervention and prevention strategies.

Researches show that even though increasing numbers of adults use the Internet, they perceive their skills as less advanced than adolescents’. Under these circumstances, the main subjects of analysis in this article were as follows: differences in Internet usage among adults and adolescents, current intervention and prevention strategies developed by families, areas of parental education provided by organizations involved in disseminating information about online safety...|$|R
