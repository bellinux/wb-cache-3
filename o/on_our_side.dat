25|$|Me & Charles were at {{war from}} 1979 until 1999. He even {{threatened}} having bouncers {{on the doors}} of Medway Poet’s readings to keep me out. There were two camps in the Medway Poets from day one - me & Sexton versus everyone else. Bill came down <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> in the end. Rob Earl would have been with me & Sexton, but he wasn’t on the scene so much.|$|E

60|$|War, war! It {{is terrible}} certainly. But {{there are worse}} plagues, deeper griefs, dreader wounds than the physical. What of the forty {{thousand}} wretched women in this city? The silent writhing of them is to me more appalling than {{the roar of the}} cannons. Then this war is necessary <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>sides.</b> Is that wrong necessary? It is not so clear to me.|$|R

25|$|As the Earl of Listowel, {{speaking}} in the House of Lords on 28 November 1933, stated, ‘‘the Assyrians fought <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> during the war,’’ and made ‘‘enormous sacrifices,’’ having ‘‘lost altogether {{by the end of}} the War about two-thirds of their total number.’'.... About half of the Assyrian nation died of murder, disease, or exposure as refugees during the war, according to the head of the Anglican Church, which had a mission to the Assyrians.|$|E
500|$|Our strategy, as usual, was {{to force}} the U.S. {{government}} to intervene in case there were arrests—and {{if they did not}} intervene, that inaction would once again prove the government was not <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> and thus intensify the development of a mass consciousness among blacks. Our slogan for this drive was [...] "One Man, One Vote." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Cantelupe {{wrote in}} his diary that [...] "the number of killed & wounded <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> amount to one hundred & twenty, one officer killed. Cantelupe's figure agrees {{approximately}} with Howe's official casualty return for “the different skirmishes from 4thto 8thDecember”, which gives 19 killed, 60 wounded and 33 missing. David Martin gives the total British loss, including deserters, as 350, which would suggest that 238 men deserted.|$|E
60|$|On {{that part}} of the sand which lay <b>on</b> <b>our</b> east <b>side,</b> this misguided {{multitude}} extended themselves; and being, most of them, not above their knees, or most of them not above ankle-deep in the water, they as it were surrounded us on that side, and {{on the side of the}} mainland, and a little way on the other side of the sand, standing in a half-circle, or rather three-fifths of a circle, for about six miles in length. The other horn, or point of the sand, which lay <b>on</b> <b>our</b> west <b>side,</b> being not quite so shallow, they could not extend themselves upon it so far.|$|R
6000|$|He {{attempted}} no excuse, but strode on--I {{had to run}} {{to keep up with}} him--and {{they drove}} <b>on</b> by <b>our</b> <b>side,</b> and Nessy Horsman said, [...] "A prior engagement, eh? And Miss Alison will not release you? Ladies' claims are sacred, we all know." ...|$|R
5000|$|... <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> no appreciable {{change in}} the {{position}} of the U-boats was introduced between the 15th and 16th. A decrease in U-boat numbers was not introduced; on the contrary, group Habicht was increased from 6 to 9 ...|$|R
500|$|The {{dialogue}} that the Beast says while {{negotiating with the}} Axe Gang for killing the Landlady and Landlord – [...] "...then young friend, I will make an offer you cannot refuse", is a reference of the dialogue from the movie The Godfather. Also, the Landlady's comment to Brother Sum – [...] "We brought a gift you cannot refuse" [...] is an obvious parody of the same, to which Sum replies (in the dubbed version of the film), [...] "Ha! With the Beast <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side,</b> we shall see for whom the bell tolls", {{a reference to the}} 1943 film.|$|E
500|$|Kinsler was {{mentioned}} as an MVP candidate before his injury by writers at ESPN, the Dallas News, the Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post. He could have conceivably rivaled Pedroia for MVP, {{if not for}} the sports hernia that cut his 2008 campaign short a month and a half. [...] "I think he just missed having an MVP year", manager Ron Washington said. [...] "If luck [...] <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> and he [...] healthy, he would have run away with it." [...] In the end, he received a single 10th-place vote from Jeff Wilson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.|$|E
500|$|... 3 September 1917: [...] "With {{reference}} to a suggestion that the matter might be postponed, [...] pointed out {{that this was a}} question on which the Foreign Office had been very strongly pressed for a long time past. There was a very strong and enthusiastic organisation, more particularly in the United States, who were zealous in this matter, and his belief was that it would be of most substantial assistance to the Allies to have the earnestness and enthusiasm of these people enlisted <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> To do nothing was to risk a direct breach with them, and it was necessary to face this situation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{all this}} doesn't {{tell me how}} you came to hang <b>on</b> to <b>our</b> <b>side</b> ladder," [...] I inquired, in the hardly audible murmurs we used, after he had told me {{something}} more of the proceedings on board the Sephora once the bad weather was over.|$|R
5000|$|If we {{mean to be}} a {{commercial}} people, or even to be secure <b>on</b> <b>our</b> Atlantic <b>side,</b> we must endeavor, as soon as possible, to have a navy.

5000|$|The group {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} young Italian American males that hailed from predominantly ethnic neighborhoods of East New York, Bensonhurst, and Bay Ridge in Brooklyn. When queried about {{the irony of}} a group of Italian males being led by an Irish-American, one SPONGE member simply explained [...] "because Irish, Polish, and Jewish guys are <b>on</b> <b>our</b> Italian <b>side,</b> that's why." ...|$|R
500|$|Lord Hawke, {{writing a}} {{foreword}} to {{his history of}} Yorkshire, referred to Pullin as the non-playing member of the county team: [...] "His criticisms <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> form an invaluable guide to the captain, his enthusiasm is contagious, but never allows his judgement to become unbalanced, whilst his eloquent writings on cricket have gone to {{every part of the}} world in which there are lovers of the game... I feel bound to say to the esteemed author of this book—'Well done, thou faithful friend. Hawke later said that Pullin's judgement of young cricketers was very good, and that [...] "through his writing he did much to assist the Yorkshire club in encouraging the game and its players".|$|E
500|$|On 18 November 1956, while {{addressing}} Western ambassadors at {{a reception}} at the Polish embassy in Moscow, Khrushchev used his famous [...] "Whether {{you like it or}} not, history is <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> We will bury you" [...] expression, shocking everyone present. He later claimed that he had not been talking about nuclear war, but rather about the historically determined victory of communism over capitalism. In 1961, Khrushchev declared that even if the USSR was behind the West, within a decade its housing shortage would disappear, consumer goods would be abundant, and within two decades, the [...] "construction of a communist society" [...] in the USSR would be completed [...] "in the main".|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 2009, it was {{reported}} that Bosh's former girlfriend, Allison Mathis, was seeking child support and sole custody of their daughter, Trinity (born November 2, 2008). Mathis alleged that when she was seven months pregnant, Bosh stopped supporting her financially and tried to remove her from their home. Three days later, it {{was reported}} that the dispute was only over the amount Bosh paid. Mathis' lawyer also told the press, [...] "My client very much wanted this dispute to remain private. Certainly this thing did not get started by anything <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side...</b> She is very distressed that somehow this thing got into the newspapers. She wants Trinity to have a good relationship with her dad, Chris Bosh, and adverse publicity makes that more difficult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Free love, so bound, were freest,' {{said the}} King. [...] 'Let love be free; free love {{is for the}} best: [...] And, after heaven, <b>on</b> <b>our</b> dull <b>side</b> of death, [...] What should be best, if not so pure a love [...] Clothed in so pure a loveliness? yet thee [...] She failed to bind, though being, as I think, [...] Unbound as yet, and gentle, as I know.' ...|$|R
60|$|We set sail, I say, from hence {{in seven}} days, and, finding the coast lie fairly <b>on</b> <b>our</b> {{starboard}} <b>side,</b> kept the land on board all the way, distance about three leagues; and it held us thus, {{about a hundred}} and twenty leagues due east, when on a sudden we {{lost sight of the}} land; whether it broke off, or whether it only drew off farther south, we could not tell.|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{historic}} east-west {{dynamics of}} the Canadian economy, {{as well as our}} small and scattered population, created structural inefficiencies in everything we did. And so, in response to free trade, we had to become competitive <b>on</b> <b>our</b> manufacturing <b>side,</b> which meant staying with fewer product categories and only those that could succeed on the North American scale. We restructured, we consolidated, and we did {{what had to be done}} for our long-term survival.” ...|$|R
500|$|Finally, on 14 December 1976, British Foreign Minister Anthony Crosland {{announced}} that the conference was to be adjourned. It was never reconvened—the Patriotic Front now {{said that it would}} not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule was made the only subject for discussion. Apparently believing that the British and Rhodesians were secretly working together to prevent this, Nkomo laid down pre-conditions for any new conference. [...] "The Rhodesian situation is a war situation... <b>On</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> it is the Patriotic Front, and on the British... side it is the British government with the Rhodesian régime as [...] extension.... The agenda must have only one item... the transfer of power from the minority to the majority. This means a constitution based on universal adult suffrage.... This item should take four to five days." ...|$|E
500|$|British war {{correspondent}} Philip Gibbs noted Amiens' {{effect on}} the war's tempo, saying on 27 August that, [...] "the enemy...is on the defensive" [...] and, [...] "the initiative of attack is so completely in our hands {{that we are able}} to strike him at many different places." [...] Gibbs also credits Amiens with a shift in troop morale, saying, [...] "the change has been greater in the minds of men than in the taking of territory. <b>On</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> the army seems to be buoyed up with the enormous hope of getting on with this business quickly" [...] and that, [...] "there is a change also in the enemy's mind. They no longer have even a dim hope of victory on this western front. All they hope for now is to defend themselves long enough to gain peace by negotiation." ...|$|E
500|$|Thietmar's near-contemporary account {{offered the}} following: The Poles {{provoked}} the enemy into fighting and, with unexpected success, drove {{them from the}} river bank which they [...] were supposed to defend. Elated by this news, Boleslav hastily notified his companions and quickly cross the river although not without effort. In contrast, the hostile army, drawn up in battle formation, vainly attempted to defend its homeland. It collapsed at the first attack, however, and failed to mount any effective resistance. Among those who fled, many were killed, {{but only a few}} of the victors were lost. <b>On</b> <b>our</b> <b>side,</b> the dead included Erich, an illustrious knight whom our emperor had long held in chains. From that day on, with every success, Boleslav drove the scattered enemies before him; and the whole populace received and honoured him with many gifts.|$|E
6000|$|May 6.—The {{underground}} {{tone of the}} House most unsatisfactory. [...] May 9.—Spoke earnestly {{and long}} for compound householders, in [...] vain. Beaten by 322-256. Much fatigued by heat and work. May [...] 28.—Spoke (perforce) on Disraeli’s astonishing declaration of [...] consistency. July 15.—Third reading of Reform bill. A remarkable [...] night. Determined {{at the last moment}} not {{to take part in the}} [...] debate, for fear of doing mischief <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own <b>side.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Russell and Marina Myers {{married in}} 1964 {{and lived in}} the Kansas City area until moving near Medford, Oregon. The Myers family {{includes}} son Stewart and daughter Rosie. As Russell Myers noted, [...] "We live in Oregon with seven dogs, three horses, and a pond full of koi and grow moss <b>on</b> <b>our</b> north <b>sides.</b> His hobbies include reading, collecting old cars, and hanging out at our local Saturday night dirt track, where I sponsor a car and wish I was brave enough to drive." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is true {{that our}} guide, with that sense of {{responsibility}} which seems to weigh heavy on guides even when asleep, had awakened at the usual hour of starting--daybreak--and, from the mere force of habit, had given forth his accustomed and sonorous [...] "Leve! leve!"--rise, rise. From the mere force of habit, too, we all turned round {{to have a few}} seconds repose <b>on</b> <b>our</b> other <b>sides</b> before obeying the order, but suddenly light flashed into our minds, and various growls in varied keys saluted our guide.|$|R
500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side.</b> But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E
500|$|So William of Champlitte and Geoffry of Villehardouin [...] {{departed}} from the host, and took with them about a hundred knights, and {{a great number of}} mounted sergeants, and entered into the land of Morea, and rode onwards till they came to the city of Modon. Michael heard that they were in the land with so few people, and he collected together a great number of people, a number that was marvellous, and he rode after them as one thinking they were all no better than prisoners, and in his hand. And when they heard tell that he was coming, they refortified Modon, where the defences had long since been pulled down, and there left their baggage, and the lesser folk. Then they rode out a day's march, and ordered their array with as many people as they had. But the odds seemed too great, for they had no more than five hundred men mounted, whereas on the other part there were well over five thousand. But events happen as God pleases; for our people fought with the Greeks and discomfited and conquered them. And the Greeks lost very heavily, while those <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>side</b> gained horses and arms enough, and other goods in very great plenty, and so returned very happy, and very joyously, to the city of Modon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, the British {{rock band}} The Jam {{released}} the album This Is the Modern World, {{which includes the}} track [...] "Standards" [...] by Paul Weller.

60|$|YALLOBALLY RECORD.--"That incompetent shuffler, General Osbourne, {{has again}} put his foot into it.

The whole command was crushed by that wide-awake fellow, Potty, and a lot of guns and ammunition lie ignominiously deserted <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> of the river. All this through mere chuckle-headed incompetence and the neglect of the most elementary precautions, within a day's march of two magnificent armies, either of which, under any sane, soldierly man, is capable of marching right through to Glendarule.|$|R
6000|$|... "A wash'us," [...] {{repeated}} the captain, with contempt. [...] "No; that's {{a passage from}} one house to the other, so as you an' I can visit comfortably in wet weather.

The trouble with these talented girls is that they're all woman. If they weren't, there wouldn't be much chance for the men, Beaton. But we've got Providence <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own <b>side</b> from the start. I'm able to watch all their inspirations with perfect composure.
