Meeting Captain Kirk”] Pausch explained that he realized {{that there were some}} things he just could not do, {{and that was one of}} them. He eventually changed the goal into meeting William Shatner, the actor who played Captain Kirk. Shatner had written a book on the science of Star Trek, and had gone to Pausch for help with the virtual reality section of the book. Pausch met and worked with Shatner for this purpose.

In a 1995 interview, he discussed the influence that musician Prince had on his approach to recording the album, stating [...] "I was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> read the album credits and I realized that Prince was a true artist. He wrote, produced, and performed, and that's the way I wanted to do it." [...] For the album, D'Angelo and the production personnel utilized antiquated, vintage equipment, including Wurlitzer musical instruments and dated effects boxes, as well as modern electronic devices such as drum machines and computers. Notable instruments used by D'Angelo were the Fender Rhodes electric piano and the Hammond organ. The album was later mastered by engineer Herb Powers Jr. at The Hit Factory mastering studio in New York City.|$|E

[...] Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman's death, and Steve Martin said he was [...] "a deeply funny and very happy person." [...] Matt Groening called him [...] "a master", and director Joe Dante said, [...] "He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> was a dream to work with.

500|$|Other {{times on}} the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous {{experience}} that [...] "cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist" [...] and a [...] "300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane". Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in.

500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see what I can do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".|$|E

Despite his menial job, Gary is actually a graduate of Cornell University, having majored in hotel management. In {{the fourth and fifth}} seasons, Gary is portrayed as having issues adapting to Selina's presidency, since he can no longer be as close to her as previously, due to lack of security clearance. When Selina fails to win reelection, he remains on as her {{personal aide}}. Hale describes Gary's loyalty to Selina stemming from the idea that the character [...] "is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> never really had an identity.

2500|$|Born in Akron, Alabama, Stephenson {{originally}} {{played baseball}} and football at the University of Alabama {{before he started}} his professional baseball career. A natural athlete who excelled in both sports, Stephenson had a good reputation at the university. Former University of Alabama president George H. Denny described Riggs as [...] "the embodiment of cleanliness, manliness, and courage." [...] He was an All-Southern fullback in 1919 and 1920. He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team. Stephenson sustained a shoulder injury in a football game in 1920 when he dropped back and was tackled {{by a pair of}} linebackers. His injury to his right shoulder was so bad that he had to end his football career as a quarterback, and as a result it greatly affected his throwing abilities. His throwing problems made it difficult for him to turn double plays, but his hitting compensated for those fielding woes. Stephenson quit school at Alabama and immediately made the jump to professional baseball, where he signed with the defending World Series champions Cleveland Indians at the age of 23.. Riggs was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> went straight from college to the big leagues.|$|E
