5000|$|Visna - Maedi is {{a chronic}} viral disease {{prevalent}} in adult sheep. The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat. Maedi Visna virus is {{also referred to}} as <b>ovine</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>pneumonia</b> (OPP). This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same Maedi is a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. Visna refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis in adult sheep. This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems. Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved. Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests. Transmission of the disease occurs most commonly via the oral route caused by ingestion of colostrum or milk that contains the virus or inhalation of infected aerosol droplets. Due to variation of the strains of MVV, some of the association clinical symptoms may be more pre-dominant in a flock relative to others along with differences in genetic susceptibility patterns.|$|E

MethodsThis was a prospective study which involved the pediatric departments of seven medical centers in Taiwan. Children aged from 6 weeks to 18 years old, hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from January 2010 to August 2011, were enrolled. <b>Progressive</b> <b>pneumonia</b> was defined by the deterioration of discharge diagnosis as compared to admission.

ResultsFour hundred and two children were included and 57 (14. 2 %) had <b>progressive</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> Independent associated factors identified for the development of progressive disease, by multivariate logistic regression analysis, included the following, age  17, 500 /μL, tachypnea, and duration to defervescence > 3 days.

40|$|Because {{relatively}} few caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) -infected animals exhibit clinical signs of illness, {{efforts to control}} and eradicate this virus will depend heavily on a sensitive diagnostic test {{that can be easily}} carried out.

Studies on their replication indicated that ovine lentiviruses and caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (CAEV) recently isolated in the United States establish persistent infection in ovine and caprine fibroblasts, whereas older prototype ovine lentiviruses such as Icelandic visna virus or American <b>progressive</b> <b>pneumonia</b> virus irreversibly lyse fibroblast cultures. Since all of the recent isolates were found to be persistent, Narayan et al. (J. Gen. Virol. 59 : 345 - 356, 1982) concluded that the highly lytic viruses were only tissue-culture-adapted strains. In the present report, we isolated new ovine lentiviruses from French sheep with naturally occurring <b>progressive</b> <b>pneumonia</b> which are either highly lytic (five isolates), as are the Icelandic strains of visna virus, or persistent (one isolate), as are CAEV or American persistent ovine lentiviruses. Protein and nucleic acid content analyses of these new highly lytic (type I) and persistent (type II) isolates indicated that type I and type II ovine lentiviruses were genetically distinct, type I and type II viruses being closely related to the Icelandic strains of visna virus and to CAEV, respectively. We conclude that (i) highly lytic ovine lentiviruses, such as the Icelandic prototype strains of visna virus and persistent lentiviruses more related to CAEV, are naturally present in the ovine species, and (ii) irreversible cell lysis induced by highly lytic viruses does not result from a tissue culture adaptation of field isolates that were originally persistent but is instead the consequence of a genetic content distinct from that of persistent viruses...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of a gene associated with a persistent viral infection that causes an incurable disease—ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP) —in sheep {{has led to the}} development of a genetic test that can be used to help reduce the impact of the disease. A slow-acting, wasting disease, OPP affects millions of sheep worldwide and is one of the most costly diseases to producers in North America. Previous research revealed that 36 percent of sheep operations and 24 percent of sheep tested in the United States were infected with <b>ovine</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>pneumonia</b> virus (OPPV) —lentivirus strains that target the immune system and cause OPP. Once infected, sheep are infected for life. Infected ewes are about 20 percent less productive, having fewer lambs and that also weigh less than lambs born to uninfected ewes. In addition to pneumonia, they show signs of wasting, lameness, and “hard bag” syndrome, in which udders become hard and contain barely any milk. Infected ewes are often culled—removed from the flock. Scientists at the Agricultural Research Service Roman L. Hruska U. S.

40|$|Although ovine lentiviruses {{have been}} {{described}} in the United States since {{the early part of}} this century, North American strains of sheep lentiviruses remain relatively uncharacterized at the molecular level. The LTR of a North American ovine lentivirus, OLV-CUl, was found to be closely related at the molecular and functional levels to visna virus, the Icelandic ovine lentivirus. Sequence analysis of the LTR revealed high identity to other ovine and ¢aprine lentiviruses in key regulatory elements of the upstream promoter region (- 25 to- 1 15). However, the R region of the LTR was much less homologous. Transcriptional control of OLV-CU 1 in transient transcriptional assays required a con-served putative AP- 4 region and possibly an AP- 1 like element in the upstream promoter region for moderate to high levels of transcription, much like visna virus. In contrast to visna virusy the down-stream region beyond the transcriptional start site was required for virus-specific transactivation. Ovine lentiviruses comprise a small group of the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses and cause slowly progressive multi-organ diseases with incubation periods of months to years (Narayan & Clements, 1989).
