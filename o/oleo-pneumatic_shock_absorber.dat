The semi-active suspension system can provide good performance of both landing impact and taxi, and has the ability for adapting to various ground and operational conditions. This current paper designs Proportional Integral Derivative controller based on Bees Intelligent Algorithm as the optimization technique for nonlinear model of semi-active landing gear system that chooses damping performance of system at touchdown as object function. Optimal setting of controller parameters to achieve favorable time response using numerical software method based on Bees Algorithm is more simple and more effective than other traditional methods such as Ziegler-Nichols and experimental because it does not need high experience and complex calculations and leads to better results.

40|$|Every {{traditional}} aircraft has a {{shock absorber}} in its main landing gear. A shock absorber takes {{the brunt of}} the shock imparted to the landing gear, absorbs it and dissipates the kinetic energy. This thesis is based on the construction of a realistic analytical model of an <b>oleo-pneumatic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> for a combat aircraft. The governing equations presented here include the effects of friction, gas spring and damping, among other things. The model was validated {{with a wide range of}} reference data, which revealed exceptionally high friction levels detected during the validation process. The reference data consists of measurements from a static test bench, a dynamic test system and an actual aircraft landing, and the corresponding simulations are presented in this thesis. The results of the simulations closely match the measured data. The effects of variations in the gas-liquid ratio and temperature on the pressure behaviour inside the shock absorber were simulated. If the gas-liquid ratio is distorted, the damping ability of the shock absorber is diminished, which may lead to faulty operation of the landing gear. Temperature variation was examined in two ways, firstly by varying the initial temperature and secondly, by heating and cooling the shock absorber. Filling the shock absorber in conditions which differ from the environment in which the aircraft will operate causes the pressure to decrease or increase, depending on whether the shock absorber is cooled or heated. The utilization of simulations as a tool in condition monitoring and fault detection is discussed, and as a result of that a new measuring instrument is proposed, whose design can be facilitated with this simulation model. Although the model presented in this thesis is not complete, it adequately mirrors the behaviour of the gas spring and the metering bin. However, the model does not include the deformations caused by high pressures. A number of possible improvements to the model are presented and discussed. In its present form, the load-stroke behaviour of the model is close to the real shock absorber, and the model can be used to analyse the forces and pressures generated by different shocks. Future work will involve improving the model and incorporation of the model into a larger main landing gear model so that a comprehensive investigation of the dynamics of an aircraft landing can be performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the landing gear {{is one of the}} prime aspects of {{aircraft}} design. Literature describes the design process thoroughly, however the integration of these design methods within an automated design framework has had little focus in literature. Landing gear design includes different engineering disciplines including structures, weights, kinematics, economics and runway design. Interaction between these different disciplines makes the landing gear a complex system. Automating the design process has shown to have the advantage of increased productivity, better support for design decisions and can provide the capability of collaborative and distributed design. The automation tools improve performance of current designs and simplify the development of new aircraft configurations. In this thesis a systematic and automated landing gear design procedure is proposed. Positioning the landing gear on the aircraft is limited by several requirements. Requirements include take-off stability, touchdown stability, wing-tip and engine clearance, ground handling and stability while taxiing. Evaluation of all these limits results in a feasible design space from which the shortest possible landing gear is found. From the resulting landing gear position, loads on the landing gear struts are calculated. Tyres and wheels are selected and brakes and shock absorbers are designed. The assembly of landing gear components can then be used to make an analytical weight estimation. This analytical weight estimation is based on maximum stresses occurring within the structure due to extreme load cases prescribed in certification specifications. Preventing yielding and buckling within the structure then results in required component thicknesses. A multi-body model is then made, where structural parts are seen as rigid bodies. The multi-body model evaluates and visualises the system dynamics. The <b>oleo-pneumatic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> forces and motion are modelled using an analytical relation. An empirical tyre model models tyre motion and forces at the contact point. These two models can accurately describe forces within the tyres and shocks due to externally applied forces, which then allows for the evaluation of extreme landing load cases. This is done to verify empirically estimated dynamic landing loads used in the weight estimation. And this is done to identify loading peaks that could occur during a landing. In addition to the landing simulation a simulation of the landing gear retraction mechanism is done to check the kinematic feasibility and compliance to certification requirements. Verification of results of the implemented landing gear with reference aircraft shows that landing gear positions closely match with actual landing gear positions. The analytical weight estimation of the landing gear assembly estimates the total gear weight with an error of 15 percent. This is comparable to the result of an empirical weight estimation that has an error of 17 percent. Multi-body simulation results show that dynamic loads during an extreme landing are similar to empirically estimated dynamic loads. For landing gears with multiple rows of tyres it is especially important to look at landing loads, since a hard landing then creates peaks at high frequency in the shock loads. These peaks originate from the interaction between front and rear axle tyres hitting the ground at different times. A kinematic simulation of retraction and extension then verifies the kinematic feasibility. This simulation also shows that the retraction and locking mechanisms work and that it can be stowed within the available space. The resulting landing gear design and analysis tools complete the existing aircraft design tools, which then forms the basis for the future improvement of automated transport aircraft design.

This was the result of a decision taken by the War Office in early 1940 on how military gliders would be used; the idea was for the glider to be released at a low altitude close to the landing zone and conduct a steep descent to reduce time in the air and exposure to enemy fire. The glider also possessed large flaps which assisted in a steep and rapid descent, and through adjustments of their angle during landing a precise control over descent rate and point of landing could be achieved; they also allowed a slower touchdown speed to be attained. They were operated through a small bottle of compressed air large enough only for a single landing; a small bottle not only saved weight, but gave a smaller chance of it being hit by enemy fire, thereby exploding and damaging the glider.

However, this was eventually replaced with a fixed undercarriage – the same as had been designed for ferrying operations – as pilots found that they preferred to land on wheels because of the extra control it gave them and the ability to avoid other gliders and potential collisions in the landing area. The wheeled undercarriage was not fitted until after the glider had been loaded; two 15-ton jacks were used to lift the aircraft for the fitting.|$|R
40|$|Landing is {{the most}} {{critical}} operational phase of an aircraft since it directly affects the passenger safety and comfort. The {{factors such as the}} undesirable wind and ground effects, runway unevenness, excessive sink speeds and approach speeds and pilot errors can deteriorate the landing performance of an aircraft several times during its entire lifetime. When an aircraft lands, large amplitude vibrations get transmitted to the fuselage from the runway thereby causing safety and comfort problems and hence need to be suppressed quickly. Landing gear is an essential assembly that prevents the aircraft fuselage from the ground loads. A <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> which is considered as the heart of the landing gear assembly {{plays an important role in}} this process by absorbing the vibrations during landing. The existing <b>Oleo-pneumatic</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> are the most efficient in absorbing the vibrations during each aircraft operation. However, they are unable to provide the continuously variable damping required during the landing phase which might reduce their efficiency. Moreover, to account for the uncertainties during landing, a damper capable of providing the variable damping effect can play a vital role in increasing the passenger safety. A semi-active control system of a landing gear suspension can solve the problem of excessive vibrations effectively by providing a variable damping during each operational phase. Magnetorheological (MR) dampers are one of the most efficient and attractive solutions that can provide the continuously variable damping required depending on a control command. This thesis focuses on the concept of the semi-active aircraft suspension system using the MR damper with the implementation of robust control strategy. Initially, the dynamic behavior of the MR damper is studied using the parametric modeling approach. Spencer dynamic model is adopted for simulating the dynamic behavior of the MR damper. This is followed by the analysis of the energy dissipation patterns of the MR damper for different excitation inputs. A semi-active suspension system is developed for a three degree-of-freedom (3 DOF) aircraft model considering a tri-cycle landing gear configuration. A switching technique is developed in the simulation of the landing procedure which enables the system to switch from the single degree of freedom to three degrees of freedom system in order to simulate the sequential touching of the two wheels of the main landing gears and the nose landing gear wheel with the ground. For developing the semi-active MR suspension system, two different controller approaches, namely, the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and the H∞ control are adopted. The results of the designed controllers are compared for a particular landing scenario for studying the performance of the controllers in reducing the overshoot of the bounce response as well as the bounce rate response. The simulation results confirmed the improved performance of the robust controller compared to the optimal control strategy when the aircraft is subjected to the disturbances during landing. Finally, implementing the robust control approach, the landing performance of an aircraft embedded with the semi-active suspension system is simulated and analyzed for different sink velocities considering the disturbances. ...|$|R

50|$|The Hamilcar was {{constructed}} primarily from wood, mainly birch and spruce, with fabric-covered plywood forming the skin, and {{high grade steel}} reinforcement beams in critical areas. It had a wingspan of 110 ft, a length of 68 ft and a height of 20 ft {{to the top of}} the fin with the tail down. It weighed 18400 lb when empty, and could transport a military load of 17600 lb to give a total weight of 36000 lb. The whole aircraft was broken down into smaller sections for transport. It was so large and heavy that it required the largest and most powerful aircraft to pull it off the airfield and subsequently tow it; four-engined bombers were used, most frequently the Handley Page Halifax. Both wing and cockpit were set above the fuselage to provide the greatest amount of room for the cargo compartment, and to ensure that they did not interfere with the loading of vehicles; the compartment measured approximately 32 ft, 7 ft inches wide and between 6 ft and 7 ft inches in height. The nose of the glider was hinged and opened to the side for ease of loading vehicles and cargo, and the crew of two pilots were seated in tandem in a cockpit on the top of the fuselage, which was accessed via an internal ladder and was fifteen feet above ground; they were eventually protected by a bullet-proof windscreen and a plate of armour behind the second pilot. An intercom was also added to provide communication between the pilots and the personnel below them. An initial design feature, which was eventually removed prior to full-scale production, was the installation of an under-fuselage hatch which would allow the prone firing of a Bren light machine gun as the glider approached the landing zone.The ratio between length and wingspan was practically the same as that of an Avro Lancaster bomber, which had a wingspan of 102 ft and a length of 69 ft, in contrast to modern sport gliders which possess a particularly large wingspan to enhance gliding performance.
