At elevated temperatures, PP thickened lubricating grease exhibits excessive <b>oil</b> <b>bleeding,</b> which limits its use at high temperatures. Excessive oil bleed adversely affects the lubricating performance of the PP thickened grease. The present work is focused on the study of the oil bleed tendency of PP and Maleated Polypropylene (mPP) thickened greases at various temperatures by incorporating virgin and recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE) into the thickener system. Grease containing various percentages of PP and mPP thickeners were prepared and modified with different percentages of virgin and recycled HDPE. Polymers were characterized through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. The oil bleed performance of these greases was evaluated by the conical sieve method (ASTM D 6184) at various temperatures. Storage (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of greases was determined by rheometry at 25 °C.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} better understand the dynamics of the refrigerant and oil migration during transient events such as cycling and start-up. To measure the refrigerant mass and oil distribution of an automotive R 134 a FOT breadboard system, two ball valves around each component are added. By simultaneously closing the valves, the refrigerant and oil is trapped in different sections of the system and can be measured. The transient refrigerant migration during a stop-start transient as well as the refrigerant mass distribution as a function of system charge at steady state operation is presented. A transparent accumulator and transparent tubes at the inlet and outlet of the accumulator are used to visualize the flow of the refrigerant. High speed video snapshots are presented for the first seconds after the start-up. The oil distribution at steady state as a function of total refrigerant charge is presented.

40|$|Grease is a semisolid {{lubricant}} {{which helps}} {{in reducing the}} friction between two surfaces. Lubricating grease {{can be applied to}} mechanical parts which runs intermittently or being stored for a long period or in contact with the moisture that will cause corrosion to happen. The growing demand on lubricating grease has increased the attention on quality of the grease. A better performance and more environmental friendly bio-grease is preferable. Mixture of Spent Bleaching Earth and Waste Cooking Oil are the base grease for the research. To enhance the rheological properties of the grease, three types of cellulose are added to the grease which are Methyl Cellulose (MC), Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) and Hydroxyethyl Cellulose (HEC). Three types of test were carried out to test the consistency, contamination and also the oil bleed of the formulated grease. The test method for consistency of grease is accordance to ISO 2137 and NLGI (National Lubricating Grease Institute) Number was obtained. The result showed that 75 % to 80 % of SBE and 20 % to 25 % of WCO were needed to produce grease with NLGI Number 2 and 3. Addition of less than 10 % of additive decreased the amount of SBE needed to about 25 %.

However, water does have an effect on the film thickness under starved conditions where the differences are related to the change in <b>oil</b> <b>bleed.</b> In the presence of water, an increase in <b>oil</b> <b>bleed</b> was found for lithium, lithium complex and polyurea grease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{literature}} investigating {{the use of}} fish oil in preventing restenosis postangioplasty (RPA). DATA SOURCES: An Index Medicus and bibliographic search of the English-language literature pertaining {{to the use of}} fish oil in preventing RPA. The key terms used were fish oil, angioplasty, and eicosapentaenoic acid. STIlDY SELECTION A:'D DATA EXTRACTIO N: The results of all trials, including abstracts, that were obtained are reviewed and critiqued. DATA SThTHESIS: Restenosis of a coronary vessel at the site of angiopl asty occurs 30 - 40 percent of the time. Because fish oil has been theorized to prevent atherosclerosis and because atherosclerotic-like proce sses are theorized to be involved in RPA restenosis, fish oil has been studied to determine whether it can prevent RPA. Results of such trials have been mixed. Some have observed a {{reduction in the number of}} patients with angiographic or clinical evidence of restenosis. Two trials have failed to observe such an effect. Reason s for the differences are unknown. Possible explanations include differences in study design, endpoint parameters, definition of restenosis, and dosing methods of the fish <b>oil.</b> <b>Bleeding</b> was not of significant concern in any of the trials, even when fish oil was combined with antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Fish oil may be considered for use in patients to prevent RPA. It probably should be cont inued for only six months following the procedure. Current data sugge st that at least 3 g/d of eicosapentaenoic acid and I g/d of docosahexaenoic acid should be used. If possible, therapy should be started as soon as it is known that angioplasty will be performed or at least as soon as possible following the procedure. Many patients may not be able to tolerate fish oil because of its gastrointestinal effects. Ann Pharmacother 1992; 26 : 1541 - 5...|$|E
40|$|Lubricants are {{subjected}} to high pressures in many mechanical devices - notably gears, cams, piston rings and rolling element bearings. The contact pressure between the ball and the race in a ball bearing can {{be as high as}} 5 GPa. At such high pressures, it is necessary to be able to measure the rheological behaviour of the lubricant in order to obtain input data for computer simulations of rolling and sliding contacts. Lubricant manufacturers are often unable to provide information about the rheology of the lubricant at high pressures, temperatures, shear stresses and shear rates. In paper A, a new Couette rheometer was developed to measure the rheological properties of fluids at pressures up to 500 MPa. The shearrate range covers 0. 5 to 20000 1 /s and the instrument can operate up to 1 O 0 °C at maximum pressure. The results from the apparatus show excellent agreement with measurements made with a failing ball viscometer on a Newtonian fluid. Criteria for non-laminar flow and viscous heating have been developed for the apparatus to verify that these effects do not significantly influence the measurements. In grease lubricated machine elements the supply of grease to the contact region is very important for long life and maintenance-free operation. For example, in a bearing application the grease is often applied within the housing but outside the bearing. For good lubrication the grease has to move from the storage space into the bearing in order to separate the moving surfaces. One important part of this grease movement is the transport from near the contact region into the rolling track. This transportation mechanism may depend on different phenomena such as: capillary forces, vibrations, drop formation, <b>oil</b> <b>bleeding</b> etc. The papers B-G in this thesis describe investigations of these various phenomena. Papers B-D deal with the drop formation of oils and greases in the outlet of an elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact and how different surface energies can affect the distribution of lubricant between the surfaces. Paper E describes the elongation of grease filaments formed when two surfaces are separating from each other, as a function of time. Measurements of the lift off (adhesion) force acting between the two solid surfaces as a function of time were also made. In paper F a ball and disc apparatus was used to study the replenishment of grease due to side slip. The inlet distance and the 'butterfly' shaped meniscus that surrounds the contact point was studied {{as a function of the}} side slip motion of the ball. The filament formation equations from paper E were extended to include the geometry of the butterfly and the inlet distance. Finally, in paper G, four deep groove ball bearings were tested in a SKF R 2 F test rig to evaluate how lift-off-speed and breakthrough-speed are affected by ball spin. The results are compared to film thickness calculations. The lubricants used were greases, oil bled from the greases and the base oil used for manufacturing the greases.

40|$|Rolling element {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contamination outside the bearing system. These bearings {{are more often}} lubricated with grease rather than oil. Much knowledge is available on oil lubricated seals but {{a good understanding of}} grease lubricated seals is lacking. In this thesis, first the lubrication, pumping and sealing mechanisms of oil and grease lubricated radial lip seals have been discussed. The first paper reviews the public literature. This review has shown that very little is known on grease lubrication in radial lip seals. The primary lubrication, sealing and pumping mechanisms found for oil lubricated seals are micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication between the seal and shaft roughness and tangential deformations of the seal surface for a pumping action. These mechanisms are important but it is felt that other effects have to be included for explaining differences seen in grease lubricated radial lip seals. One effect in grease lubrication is the normal stress effect which is described in the second paper. It is shown that the grease rheology and especially the normal stress effect {{play a significant role in}} film formation in grease lubricated seals. The model predicts that 50 to 60 % of the load carrying capacity can be generated by the normal stress effect for a low contact pressure bearing seal depending on the operating conditions. The <b>oil</b> <b>bleed</b> model presented in the third paper describes the release of oil from the grease. This model is based on viscous flow through the porous soap microstructure and the driving force is the pressure gradient resulting from centripetal forces. It is shown that the soap fibre distribution has to become anisotropic during <b>oil</b> <b>bleed</b> and the model has been validated with experiments at different temperatures and rotating speeds. The model can be used with good confidence for longer periods of time and can be used as input for replenishment models.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{is presented to}} predict the oil film thickness in an axial sealing contact based on grease properties and operating conditions. It is assumed that {{a small amount of}} grease will form an oil reservoir on the rotating part and slowly supply oil to the sealing contact. The <b>oil</b> <b>bleed</b> model from a previous study is implemented and oil loss due to centrifugal forces and the seal pumping action are taken into account. The results show that, depending on the operating conditions, an oil film is present in the sealing contact for a certain period of time. The oil film thickness decreases in time due to the decreasing oil supply from the grease reservoir and oil loss from the contact due to centrifugal forces. Seal pumping has only a small effect and the seal material and geometry are therefore not important for the predicted time until the mixed lubrication regime is reached. This time depends on the oil viscosity, rotational speed, and seal contact radius and scales with the η /(n 2 ·ds) parameter. The volumetric size of the grease reservoir also has a large impact on maintaining the film thickness in time...|$|R
40|$|Rolling {{bearings}} contain seals to keep lubricant {{inside and}} contaminants outside the bearing system. These systems are often lubricated with grease; the grease {{acts as a}} lubricant for the bearing and seal and improves the sealing efficiency. In this thesis, the influence of lubricating grease on bearing seal performance is studied. Rheological properties of the grease, i. e. shear stress and normal stress difference, are evaluated and related to the lubricating and sealing performance of the sealing system. This includes the seal, grease and counterface. The grease velocity profile in the seal pocket in-between two sealing lips {{is dependent on the}} rheological properties of the grease. The velocity profile in a wide pocket is evaluated using a 1 -dimensional model based on the Herschel-Bulkley model. The velocity profile in a narrow pocket, where the influence of the side walls on the velocity profile is significant, is measured using micro particle image velocimetry. Subsequently, the radial migration of contaminants into the seal pocket is modelled and related to the sealing function of the grease. Additionally, also migration in the axial direction is found {{in the vicinity of the}} sealing contact. Experimental results show that contaminant particles in different greases consistently migrate either away from the sealing contact or towards the sealing contact, also when the pumping rate of the seal can be neglected. Lubrication of the seal lip contact is dependent on several grease properties. A lubricant film in the sealing contact may be built up as in oil lubricated seals but normal stress differences in the grease within the vicinity of the contact may result in an additional lift force. The grease, which is being sheared in the vicinity of the contact, will also contribute to the frictional torque. It is important to maintain a lubricant film in the sealing contact to minimize friction and wear. Here the replenishment of oil separated from the grease, also referred to as <b>oil</b> <b>bleed,</b> is of crucial importance. A model is presented to predict this <b>oil</b> <b>bleed</b> based on <b>oil</b> flow through the porous grease thickener microstructure. The model is applied to an axial sealing contact and a prediction of the film thickness as a function of time is made. The work presented in the thesis gives a significant contribution to a better understanding of the influence of lubricating grease on the sealing system performance and seal lubrication conditions.

40|$|Background: Patients who undergo surgery {{appear to}} use dietary {{supplements}} significantly {{more frequently than}} the general population. Because they contain pharmacologically active compounds, dietary supplements may affect coagulation and platelet function during the perioperative period through direct effects, pharmacodynamic interactions, and pharmacokinetic interactions. However, in this regard, limited {{studies have been conducted}} that address the pharmacological interactions of dietary supplements. To avoid possible bleeding risks during surgery, information about the potential complications of dietary supplements during perioperative management is important for physicians. Methods: Through a systematic database search of all available years, articles were identified in this review if they included dietary supplements and coagulation/platelet function, while special attention was paid to studies published after 1990. Results: Safety concerns are reported in commercially available dietary supplements. Effects of the most commonly used natural products on blood coagulation and platelet function are systematically reviewed, including 11 herbal medicines (echinacea, ephedra, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng, green tea, kava, saw palmetto, St John’s wort, and valerian) and four other dietary supplements (coenzyme Q 10, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, fish <b>oil,</b> and vitamins). <b>Bleeding</b> risks of garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, green tea, saw palmetto, St John’s wort, and fish oil are reported.
