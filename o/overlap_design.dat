The design includes handover <b>overlap</b> <b>design,</b> base station connectivity, signal reticulation using splitters, couplers, bi-directional amplifiers, attenuators, discrete antennas, radiating cables and opto-electric couplers etc. It is found that signal strength, noise, intermodulation calculated for the up and down links are in compliance with the given specifications and satisfy the required system margin. Our system specifications based on TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) ensures that the received signal is at least 5 dB higher than the TETRA dynamic sensitivity level and yields 95 % coverage of all the used areas...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{decomposition}} of large scale systems into subsystems or agents {{has been a}} method of simplifying decision making for the complex systems. In most complex system designs the overlap {{decomposition of}} the systems is employed, which leads to <b>overlap</b> <b>design</b> tasks between design teams and more synchronous information transfer between them. A method for measuring the overall complexity of a system after being overlap decomposition is presented. It is shown that this measure is useful in deciding on an appropriate decomposition strategy which influences the design process efficiency. A combination of random {{or in some cases}} exhaustive search with spectral graph partitioning is proposed for extracting the decompositions with the dual objective of low overall complexity with maximized overlapping parts. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} the <b>overlapping</b> <b>design</b> consensus {{for the construction}} of models in design and the related value judgments. The <b>overlapping</b> <b>design</b> consensus is inspired by Rawls’ overlapping consensus. The <b>overlapping</b> <b>design</b> consensus is a well-informed, mutual agreement among all stakeholders based on fairness. Fairness is respected if all stakeholders’ interests are given due and equal attention. For reaching such fair agreement, we apply Rawls’ original position and reflective equilibrium to modeling. We argue that by striving for the original position, stakeholders expel invalid arguments, hierarchies, unwarranted beliefs, and bargaining effects from influencing the consensus. The reflective equilibrium requires that stakeholders’ beliefs cohere with the final agreement and its justification. Therefore, the <b>overlapping</b> <b>design</b> consensus is not only an agreement to decisions, as most other stakeholder approaches, it is also an agreement to their justification and that this justification is consistent with each stakeholders’ beliefs. For supporting fairness, we argue that fairness qualifies as a maxim in modeling. We furthermore distinguish values embedded in a model from values that are implied by its context of application. Finally, we conclude that for reaching an <b>overlapping</b> <b>design</b> consensus communication about properties of and values related to a model is required...|$|R

Dual frame (landline and cell phone) samples are increasingly used in telephone surveys to address this issue. However, {{there is no consensus}} on the best design for dual frame surveys: segmented designs which screen out respondents with landlines from the cell phone (wireless) sampling frame, or <b>overlapping</b> <b>designs</b> which include dual users from both wireless and landline samples. A national telephone survey of 2, 501 adults was conducted in May 2009 using an <b>overlapping</b> dual frame <b>design.</b> The two designs can be compared by including (<b>overlapping</b> <b>design)</b> or excluding (segmented design) the dual users from the wireless sample. A comparison of the sample characteristics of this survey to Census population estimates finds the <b>overlapping</b> <b>design</b> generally yields results closer to population parameters than the segmented design. The study also finds significant differences in the characteristics of dual users from the two samples, explaining why the segmented design yields different and potentially less accurate population estimates...|$|R

Recently, Zhang et al. [8] studied on gain properties of high Al-content AlGaN-delta-GaN quantum wells (QWs) for mid- and deep-UV lasers. Zhao et al. [9] investigated the QW structures with large <b>overlap</b> <b>design</b> {{to enhance the}} internal quantum efficiency for InGaN QW-based LEDs. Shukla [10] studied a p-n junction LED employing ZnO/MgZnO QW active layer on a c-plane sapphire by the pulsed-laser deposition technique. Ahn et al. [11] showed p-n heterojunction LEDs that were formed from a p-Si thin film/nanostructured n-ZnO by a dielectrophoresis method.

40|$|This {{literature}} review investigates and evaluates different strategies to improve InGaN-based {{light emitting diodes}} (LED) by analyzing published theoretical and experimental studies. The issues of non-uniform carrier distribution, piezoelectric polarization fields and poor wave function overlap can be mitigated {{by the use of}} InGaN barriers and substrates as well as staircase designs for quantum wells (QW). It is found that QWs made for long emission wavelengths suffer from Auger recombination due to high carrier concentrations in the QWs. Lower barriers will enhance the injection of holes and thus increase the radiative recombination rate in all QWs. Piezoelectric polarization fields due to lattice mismatch can be suppressed by using InGaN barriers and substrates with decreased lattice mismatch. The radiative recombination rate is found to increase as the barriers and substrates contain higher Indium content. A large <b>overlap</b> <b>design</b> called “staggered QW ” is evaluated and shown to increase wave function overlap and thus the recombination rate for InGaN LEDs. The concept of nanowire LED...|$|E

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise amplification in accelerated imaging were simulated and quantitatively evaluated in phantoms and in vivo mouse images. Comparison between the 20 -channel mouse array and a length-matched quadrature driven small animal birdcage coil showed an SNR increase at the periphery {{and in the}} center of the phantom of 3 - and 1. 3 -fold, respectively.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} infrared safe jet observables, which we refer to as template <b>overlaps,</b> <b>designed</b> to filter targeted highly boosted particle decays from QCD jets and other background. Template overlaps are functional measures that quantify how well the energy flow of a physical jet matches the flow of a boosted partonic decay. Any region of the partonic phase space for the boosted decays defines a template. We will refer to the maximum functional overlap found this way as the template overlap. To illustrate the method, we test lowest-order templates designed to distinguish highly-boosted top and Higgs decays from backgrounds produced by event generators. For the functional overlap, we find good results with a simple construction based on a Gaussian in energy differences within angular regions surrounding the template partons. Although different event generators give different averages for our template overlaps, we find in each case excellent rejection power, especially when combined with cuts based on jet shapes. The template overlaps are capable of systematic improvement by including higher order corrections in the template phase space. Comment: 24 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} the failure of porcelain laminate veneers with factors related to the patient, material, and operator. Methods: This clinical survey involved 29 patients (19 women and 10 men) and their dentists, including undergraduate and postgraduate dental students and dental interns. Two questionnaires were distributed to collect information from participants. All patients were clinically examined. Criteria for failure of the porcelain laminate veneers included color change, cracking, fracture, and/or debonding. Results: A total of 205 porcelain laminate veneers were evaluated. All of the restorations were fabricated from IPS e. max Press and cemented with Variolink Veneer (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Principality of Liechtenstein) or RelyX veneer cement (3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). The preparations were generally located in enamel (58. 6 %), and most veneers had an <b>overlapped</b> <b>design</b> (89. 7 %).

40|$|Testing is an {{important}} activity in product development. Past studies, which are developed to determine the optimal scheduling of tests, often focused on single-stage testing of sequential design process. This paper presents an analytical model for the scheduling of tests in <b>overlapped</b> <b>design</b> process, where a downstream stage starts before the completion of upstream testing. We derive optimal stopping rules for upstream and downstream stages' testing, together with the optimal time elapsed between beginning the upstream tests and beginning the downstream development. We find that the cost function is first convex then concave increasing with respect to upstream testing duration. A one-dimensional search algorithm is then proposed for finding the unique optimum that minimizes the overall cost. Moreover, the impact of different model parameters, such as the problem-solving capacity and opportunity cost, on the optimal solution is discussed. Finally, we compare the testing strategies in overlapped process with those in sequential process, and get some additional results. The methodology is illustrated with a case study at a handset design company. Product development Multi-stage tests Problem-solving Concurrent engineering Overlapping...|$|R
40|$|Requirements such as {{distribution}} or tracing have {{an impact}} on multiple classes in a system. They are cross-cutting requirements, or aspects. Their support is, by necessity, scattered across those multiple classes. A look at an individual class may also show support for cross-cutting requirements tangled up with the core responsibilities of that class. Scattering and tangling make object-oriented software difficult to understand, extend and reuse. Though design is an important activity within the software lifecycle with well-documented benefits, those benefits are reduced when cross-cutting requirements are present. This paper presents a means to mitigate these problems by separating the design of cross-cutting requirements into composition patterns. Composition patterns require extensions to the UML, and are based on a combination of the subjectoriented model for composing separate, <b>overlapping</b> <b>designs,</b> and UML templates. This paper also demonstrates how composition patterns map to one programming model that provides a solution for separation of cross-cutting requirements in code [...] -aspect-oriented programming. This mapping serves to illustrate that separation of aspects may be maintained throughout the software lifecycle...|$|R

The {{study was conducted in}} two creeks, one natural and one mad-made, located in the Pamlico River estuary. Defaunated sediment was exposed 4 times in a temporally <b>overlapping</b> <b>design</b> and sampled after 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 210 days. Both site and exposure time and the interactions between these two factors caused highly significant differences in the densities of colonists. With the exception of Hydrobia and chronomid insect larvae, common colonists were more abundant in the natural than in the man-made creek. Differences in patterns of colonization between natural and man-made wetlands may be one factor causing differences in the structure of their invertebrate fauna. The community structure of the disturbed community quickly resembled the ambient community and thereafter temporal patterns of specie’s densities in the ambient and disturbed communities were similar. Gross sediment characteristics had little or no effect on recolonization patterns. These results are preliminary and based on the analyses of only one set of recolonization experiments.
