5|$|Joseph Needham noted a Chinese text {{dating from}} 304 AD, Records of the Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions, by Hsi Han, which {{describes}} mandarin oranges protected by large reddish-yellow citrus ants which attack and kill insect pests {{of the orange}} trees.

5|$|Biological {{control is}} first {{recorded}} around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, <b>Oecophylla</b> smaragdina, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also in China, ducks {{were used in}} paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although {{a renewed interest in}} traditional and biological pest control developed {{towards the end of the}} 20th century and continues to this day.|$|E
500|$|In {{areas of}} India, and {{throughout}} Burma and Thailand, a paste {{of the green}} weaver ant (<b>Oecophylla</b> smaragdina) is served as a condiment with curry. Weaver ant eggs and larvae, {{as well as the}} ants, may be used in a Thai salad, yam (...) , in a dish called yam khai mot daeng (...) or red ant egg salad, a dish that comes from the Issan or north-eastern region of Thailand. Saville-Kent, in the Naturalist in Australia wrote [...] "Beauty, {{in the case of the}} green ant, is more than skin-deep. Their attractive, almost sweetmeat-like translucency possibly invited the first essays at their consumption by the human species". Mashed up in water, after the manner of lemon squash, [...] "these ants form a pleasant acid drink which is held in high favor by the natives of North Queensland, and is even appreciated by many European palates".|$|E
500|$|Biological pest control: [...] The {{first report}} {{of the use of}} an insect species to control an insect pest comes from [...] "Nan Fang Cao Mu Zhuang" [...] (南方草木狀 Plants of the Southern Regions) (ca. 304 AD), {{attributed}} to Western Jin dynasty botanist Ji Han (嵇含, 263–307), in which it is mentioned that [...] "Jiaozhi people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes, the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal. Without such ants, southern citrus fruits will be severely insect-damaged". The ants used are known as huang gan (huang = yellow, gan = citrus) ants (<b>Oecophylla</b> smaragdina). The practice was later reported by Ling Biao Lu Yi (late Tang Dynasty or Early Five Dynasties), in Ji Le Pian by Zhuang Jisu (Southern Song Dynasty), in the Book of Tree Planting by Yu Zhen Mu (Ming Dynasty), in the book Guangdong Xing Yu (17th century), Lingnan by Wu Zhen Fang (Qing Dynasty), in Nanyue Miscellanies by Li Diao Yuan, and others.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "biological control" [...] {{was first}} used by Harry Scott Smith at the 1919 meeting of the Pacific Slope Branch of the American Association of Economic Entomologists, in Riverside, California. It was brought into more {{widespread}} use by the entomologist Paul H. DeBach (1914–1993) who worked on citrus crop pests throughout his life. However, the practice has previously been used for centuries. The first report {{of the use of}} an insect species to control an insect pest comes from [...] "Nan Fang Cao Mu Zhuang" [...] (南方草木狀 Plants of the Southern Regions) (ca. 304 AD), attributed to Western Jin dynasty botanist Ji Han (嵇含, 263–307), in which it is mentioned that [...] "Jiaozhi people sell ants and their nests attached to twigs looking like thin cotton envelopes, the reddish-yellow ant being larger than normal.

500|$|Ant-mimicking spiders face several challenges: they {{generally}} develop slimmer abdomens and false [...] "waists" [...] in the cephalothorax {{to mimic the}} three distinct regions (tagmata) of an ant's body; they wave the first pair of legs {{in front of their}} heads to mimic antennae, which spiders lack, and to conceal {{the fact that they have}} eight legs rather than six; they develop large color patches round one pair of eyes to disguise the fact that {{they generally}} have eight simple eyes, while ants have two compound eyes; they cover their bodies with reflective hairs to resemble the shiny bodies of ants. In some spider species, males and females mimic different ant species, as female spiders are usually much larger than males. Ant-mimicking spiders also modify their behavior to resemble that of the target species of ant; for example, many adopt a zig-zag pattern of movement, ant-mimicking jumping spiders avoid jumping, and spiders of the genus Synemosyna walk on the outer edges of leaves in the same way as Pseudomyrmex. Ant-mimicry in many spiders and other arthropods may be for protection from predators that hunt by sight, including birds, lizards and spiders. However, several ant-mimicking spiders prey either on ants or on the ants' [...] "livestock", such as aphids. When at rest, the ant-mimicking crab spider Amyciaea does not closely resemble <b>Oecophylla,</b> but while hunting it imitates the behavior of a dying ant to attract worker ants. After a kill, some ant-mimicking spiders hold their victims between themselves and large groups of ants to avoid being attacked.|$|E
500|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the green-head ant {{and other species}} related to it (forming the R.metallica species group) were a source of confusion due to the high geographic variations in the green-head ant and similar-looking species having been treated as forms (occurrence of multiple morphs). These forms have been described under different names through inadequate characterisations. In 1958 American entomologist William Brown, Jr., synonymised Rhytidoponera caeciliae, Rhytidoponera pulchra, Rhytidoponera purpurascens and Rhytidoponera varians with the green-head ant after reviewing the ants in a 1958 journal article. The taxon R.purpurascens was named after its dark-purple appearance by William Morton Wheeler, but R.metallica tends to appear purple around the regions where Wheeler originally collected R.purpurascens. After examining collected specimens, Brown also noted no morphological differences between R.pulchra and R.caeciliae. The species R.varians was described from specimens collected in Darlington, Western Australia. American entomologist Walter Cecil Crawley stated that the subspecies differs from R.metallica by its smaller size and faded metallic colour, varying from yellow-brown in most specimens to a metallic green on the head, thorax and gaster with no evidence of purple colouring. An examination of R.varians showed that the superficial punctures of the gastric dorsum are coarser than usual, but these variants are found not only around the original collection site, but also throughout the southern regions of Australia. Such feature may occur naturally, which disallows R.varians to {{be considered as a}} separate population from R.metallica. Under the present classification, the green-head ant {{is a member of the}} genus Rhytidoponera in the tribe Ectatommini, subfamily Ectatomminae. It is a member of the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera, an order of insects containing ants, bees, and wasps. Other than its name [...] "green-head ant", it is commonly known as the [...] "metallic pony ant" [...] or [...] "green ant" [...] in Queensland. However, this may be confusing, as residents living in northern Queensland call the green-tree ant (<b>Oecophylla</b> smaragdina) [...] "green ants".|$|E

2500|$|Colonies of {{the weaver}} ant (<b>Oecophylla</b> smaragdina) {{are able to}} {{recognize}} {{a greater proportion of}} workers from neighbouring colonies as non-colony members. [...] When recognized as non-colony members, more aggression is exhibited toward neighbours than non-neighbours. [...] Banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) groups vocalize more and inspect more scent samples in response to olfactory cues of neighbours than strangers. [...] It has been suggested that increased aggression towards neighbours is more common in social species with intense competition between neighbours, as opposed to reduced aggression towards neighbours typical for most solitary species. [...] Furthermore, animals may respond in this way when encounters with intruders from non-neighbouring colonies are rare and of little consequence.|$|E
50|$|The weaver ants {{belong to}} the ant genus <b>Oecophylla</b> (subfamily Formicinae) which {{contains}} two closely related living species: O. longinoda and O. smaragdina. They are provisionally placed in a tribe of their own, Oecophyllini. The weaver ant genus <b>Oecophylla</b> is relatively old, and 15 fossil species have been found from the Eocene to Miocene deposits. Two other genera of weaving ants, Polyrhachis and Dendromyrmex, also use larval silk in nest construction, but the construction and architecture of their nests are simpler than those of <b>Oecophylla.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Oecophylla</b> weaver ants vary {{in color}} from reddish to {{yellowish}} brown {{dependent on the}} species. <b>Oecophylla</b> smaragdina found in Australia often have bright green gasters. These ants are highly territorial and workers aggressively defend their territories against intruders. Because of their aggressive behaviour, weaver ants are sometime used by indigenous farmers, particularly in southeast Asia, as natural biocontrol agents against agricultural pests. Although <b>Oecophylla</b> weaver ants lack a functional sting they can inflict painful bites and often spray formic acid directly at the bite wound resulting in intense discomfort.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oecophylla</b> longinoda (common name weaver ant) is {{a species}} of {{arboreal}} ant found in the forested regions of tropical Africa.

By protecting these insects from predators they increase their population and increase the damage they cause to trees.|$|E
