50|$|Generally speaking, risk-neutral pricing in {{structural}} {{models of}} financial interconnectedness requires unique equilibrium prices at maturity in {{dependence of the}} exogenous asset price vector, which can be random.While financially interconnected systems with debt and equity cross-ownership without derivatives are fairly well understood {{in the sense that}} relatively weak conditions on the ownership structures in the form of ownership matrices are required to warrant uniquely determined price equilibria, the Fischer (2014) model needs very strong conditions on derivatives - which are defined in dependence on any <b>other</b> <b>liability</b> of the considered financial system - to be able to guarantee uniquely determined prices of all system-endogenous liabilities. Furthermore, it is known that there exist examples with no solutions at all, finitely many solutions (more than one), and infinitely many solutions. At present, it is unclear how weak conditions on derivatives can be chosen to still be able to apply risk-neutral pricing in financial networks with systemic risk. It is noteworthy, that the price indeterminacy that evolves from multiple price equilibria is fundamentally different from price indeterminacy that stems from market incompleteness.|$|E

30|$|Specifically, Johnson and Stulz [3] {{think that}} the option is the writer’s sole liability. When the {{counterparty}} defaults, the option holder will receive all {{the assets of the}} option writer. Hull and White [5] extend the model, assume that the counterparty has <b>other</b> <b>liabilities,</b> the payout rate is exogenous, and the option holder will obtain part of the option’s intrinsic value when the counterparty defaults, thereby deriving the vulnerable option’s pricing formula. Jarrow and Turnbull [6] propose a risk neutral evaluating mechanism of derivative securities exposed to default risk. Klein [7] provides an analytical solution of the European vulnerable option’s price, taking into account the interrelationship between the option writer’s asset and the underlying asset. They also assume that the option writers have <b>other</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and when the counterparty defaults, some of the nominal claims will be paid.|$|R
50|$|Directors {{and parties}} {{related to the}} {{bankrupt}} may still be held personally liable for certain tax debts, and, if a clearance certificate is not obtained from the tax authorities prior to discharge, directors' liability will subsequently resume.

30|$|Default happens {{only at the}} {{maturity}} of the option T when the threshold value D^*+c_T {{is more than the}} value of the option writer’s asset V_T, where D^* denotes the value of the option writer’s <b>other</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and c_T=(S_T-K)^+.

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of risk capital and of how tax and other costs of risk capital should be {{allocated}} in a financial firm. Risk capital is equity investment that backs obligations to creditors and <b>other</b> <b>liability</b> holders and maintains the firm’s credit quality. Credit quality {{is measured by the}} ratio {{of the value of the}} firm’s option to default to the default-free value of its liabilities. Marginal default values provide a full and unique allocation of risk capital. Efficient capital allocations maintain credit quality and preclude risk shifting. Our theory leads to an adjusted present value (APV) criterion for making investment and contracting decisions. We relate our results to capital budgeting procedures used in corporate finance. We also set out practical and policy applications, including implications for risk-based regulatory capital requirements...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{contract}} innovation in liability insurance during the liability crisis of the early 1980 s was the introduction of claims-made and reported insurance contracts. Typical insurance contracts are based on loss occurrence (i. e., occurrence-based contracts), which means that a loss incurred {{in a given year}} is covered by the insurance contract for that year, no matter when the claims is actually reported. In a claims-made contract, losses are covered in the year in which they are reported. The major difference between the two types of contract is thus that occurrence contracts are forward looking whereas claimsmade contracts are retrospective. The goal {{of this paper is to}} analyze the efficiency of both forms of insurance contract and the reasons why policyholders would prefer one contract over the <b>other.</b> <b>Liability</b> insurance, Claims-made and reported, Loss development, Income smoothing. ...|$|E

30|$|This {{paper will}} extend {{the results of}} [10] and [11] for valuing {{vulnerable}} options when the option writer suffers the financial crisis. As in [11], the asset prices are driven by jump-diffusion processes. The jump {{is divided into two}} parts: the trait part of each asset price and the part of the system that affects the price of all assets. Following Klein and Inglis [10], we assume that there are interrelations between the option’s underlying asset and the option writer’s assets, and the option writers have <b>other</b> <b>liabilities.</b> The value growth of the option itself may also give rise to financial distress. The default barrier is divided into a stochastic part that measures the option’s potential payoff and the fixed part that represents the option writer’s <b>other</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Furthermore, we make the assumption that only variations {{in the value of the}} asset underlying the option or the writer’s assets can cause financial distress. By the Taylor expansion, we derive an approximate explicit valuation for vulnerable options.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} pricing {{behavior}} of both debts and call options in a unified context, where the issuer can possibly default. Its contribution {{is to show}} that both the securities' priority status and the correlation between the firm value and the option's underlying stock value have significant impacts on the valuation of the securities. It is likely that a security with priority status junior to <b>other</b> <b>liabilities</b> is worth more than a security with priority status ranking equally with <b>other</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Such a situation occurs when the issuer's firm value is low and the dynamics of the firm value is positively correlated with that of the option's underlying stock value. If the market participants ignore this feature, an astute investor can make arbitrage in such a speculative security. These findings are derived via Monte Carlo simulations employing both antithetic and control variate techniques. Analytical explanations are also provided. JEL classification: G 1...|$|R
50|$|A typical {{example for}} {{this would be}} when a {{promoter}} of a company invests money {{in the form of}} debt rather than in the form of stock.
