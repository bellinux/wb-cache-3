40|$|Anthropologists are {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} assess trauma to the skeleton and contextualising {{the nature of this}} trauma. <b>Blast</b> <b>injury</b> is a type of trauma which is increasingly seen in a variety of contexts, such as terrorism, human rights violations, combat and accidents. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> in the human skeleton and apply robust multivariate statistical methods, alongside morphological methods, to identify blast trauma based on the distribution of injury in the skeleton. The objectives of the study were to identify patterns in a sample of cases from mass graves in Bosnia and to determine differences between the <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> cases and gunshot wound cases which can identify indicators of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> for future use. This was done using Pearson‘s χ 2, cluster analysis and multiple correspondence analysis. Secondly, the identified indicators were applied to two methods of binary logistic regression model to test prediction of the presence or absence of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> in the sample, as well as assessing the results of the two methods. Lastly, the results of these analyses were subsequently compared with clinical literature to identify similarities and differences which can aid anthropologists in determining presence of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> in large assemblages. This also served to address the specific argument that the injuries seen in the Bosnia sample are combat related, as claimed in court proceedings in ongoing cases at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It was found that cluster analysis was not useful for the sample examined in the research, however multiple correspondence analysis permitted graphical differentiation between the <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> and gunshot cases, identifying variables which contributed to the variance and could be used as indicators of <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> Binary logistic regression was employed to test the significant contribution of these variables to a model predicting the presence of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> in a sample. It was found that presence of trauma to the right shoulder girdle, left forearm, vertebrae, right pelvis and left femur could indicate the presence of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> in an assemblage, with correct average classification in 74. 86 % of cases. The prevalence of trauma in the Bosnia sample was compared with examples from terrorist incidents and combat situations to identify similarities and differences between these and found that there significant differences in the prevalence of trauma in the Bosnia sample. This highlights that this sample does not resemble any combat patterns of injury, answering the question posed in ICTY court proceedings. This work contributes new knowledge to anthropology on the identification and differentiation of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> in assemblages as well as demonstrating the use of multivariate statistical methods for trauma analysis.

During the past decade, it has become apparent that even <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> {{as a form of}} mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) may lead to multiple different adverse outcomes, such as neuropsychiatric symptoms and long-term cognitive disability. <b>Blast</b> <b>injury</b> is characterized by blast overpressure (BOP), blast duration, and blast impulse. While the <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> of a victim close to the explosion will be severe, majority of victims are usually at a distance leading to milder form described as mild blast TBI (mbTBI). A major feature of mbTBI is its complex manifestation occurring in concert at different organ levels involving systemic, cerebral, neuronal and neuropsychiatric responses; some of which are shared with other forms of brain trauma such as acute brain injury and other neuropsychiatric disorders such as PTSD. The pathophysiology of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> exposure involves complex cascades of chronic psychological stress, autonomic dysfunction and neuro/systemic inflammation. These factors render <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> as an arduous challenge in terms of diagnosis and treatment as well as identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers distinguishing mTBI from other non-TBI pathologies and from neuropsychiatric disorders with similar symptoms. This is due to the distinct but shared and partially identified biochemical pathways and neuro-histopathological changes that might be linked to behavioral deficits observed. Taken together, this article aims to provide an overview of the current status of the cellular and pathological mechanisms involved in <b>blast</b> overpressure <b>injury</b> and argues for the urgent need to identify potential biomarkers that can hint at the different mechanisms involved...|$|R

40|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>injuries</b> {{represent}} {{a problem for}} civilian and military populations. The response to thoracic <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> involves a reflex bradycardia, hypotension and apnoea. Casualties who have suffered a <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> are likely to receive morphine as an early treatment, and may go on to suffer a haemorrhage, thus requiring fluid resuscitation. Aims of this thesis included determination {{of the effect of}} <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> on the response to haemorrhage and whether these responses or their interaction are modified by morphine, and to compare the cardiovascular effects of early and late resuscitation with different solutions following <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> and haemorrhage. Early cessation of the blast-induced apnoea is important if the patient is to adequately maintain arterial oxygen tensions and thus prevent the development of tissue hypoxia and a subsequent secondary inflammatory response. Therefore, the final aim of this thesis was to determine whether doxapram could shorten the duration of apnoea induced by thoracic blast. Results confirmed that the response to thoracic <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> involves a bradycardia, hypotension and apnoea, and also a vasodilation and a reduction in blood flow in the femoral vascular bed. New findings from this thesis show that thoracic blast augments the bradycardia and hypotension seen during haemorrhage and that morphine attenuates this effect. The hypovolaemic blast-injured patient may be resuscitated early or late after haemorrhage with blood, 0. 9 % saline, colloids (modified gelatin and hydroxyethyl starch) hypertonic saline or hypertonic/hydroxyethyl starch. These fluids restored blood pressure and femoral blood flow to pre-haemorrhage levels for at least 30 minutes. However, resuscitation with hypertonic saline/de>ttran was shown to be deleterious following <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> and haemorrhage as blood pressure and femoral blood flow was not maintained for longer than 5 minutes following resuscitation with this fluid. The blast-induced apnoea and hypotension can be significantly attenuated by doxapram immediately following <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> This respiratory stimulant may also result in an improvement in venfilation/perfusion matching in the lungs and thus better fissue oxygenation, as administration of doxapram resulted in an improvement in the indices of metabolic acidosis.

30|$|The {{victims of}} primary <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> almost always have {{other types of}} injury, such as {{penetrating}} wounds from flying debris or blunt trauma from impact on immovable objects (Cernak et al., 1999).

In fact, victims located between the blast and a building generally suffers 2 – 3 times the degree of injury that an individual in an open environment would receive (Boffard & MacFarlane, 1993).

40|$|Background. In our {{previous}} experimental studies, we found {{evidence for the}} increase of nitric oxide (NO) formation immediately after <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> In the present study we investigated whether NO overproduction was a trait for the period immediately after <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> in humans. Concomitant metabolic disturbances were also studied, and compared to the alterations in other traumatized patients. Methods. Blast casualties (group B, n = 13), surgical patients with the hip replacement or fractures, not exposed to blast effects (group S, n = 7) and healthy volunteers as controls (group C, n = 10), were examined. Both arterial and venous blood samples were taken within 6 hours, and 24 hours after <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> or surgical procedures, respectively. Plasma levels of nitrite/nitrate (NOx), superoxyde anion (O 2. -), sulfhydrils (SH), malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as acid-base status and other biochemical parameters (glucose, urea, creatinine, total proteins, albumin) were measured. Results. Significant, but transient increase in plasma NOx levels occurred only in group B. It {{was associated with the}} significant increase of hemoglobin oxygen (sO 2) saturation of the venous blood and the concomitant decrease of its arterial - venous difference. In group S the venous sO 2 decreased, its arterial - venous difference increased, while NOx levels were within the control limits. In both groups, other parameters of arterial acid-base status were kept within the control limits throughout the examined period. The decrease of SH levels were similar in the examined groups, while the increase of O 2. - was greater in group B. Conclusion. Early NO overproduction was a trait of <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> in humans, contributing to the reduction of tissue the oxygenation and intensifying the oxidative cell damage that had to be considered in the therapy of casualties with <b>blast</b> <b>injuries.</b> These alterations were different from those observed in other surgical patients without <b>blast</b> <b>injuries...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Blast</b> <b>injury</b> is a {{dominant}} and increasing mode of battlefield injuries. The resulting complex injury pattern may include hypoxia due to primary <b>blast</b> lung <b>injury</b> and haemorrhage due to severe secondary and tertiary <b>blast</b> <b>injuries.</b> It {{has been previously}} shown that hypotensive resuscitation, as recommended by NICE for pre-hospital trauma resuscitation, is not compatible with survival over extended evacuation times following combined <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> and haemorrhage, due to underlying inadequacy of systemic tissue oxygen delivery. This thesis investigates a hybrid resuscitation strategy, utilising a novel target blood pressure profile of hypotension (SBP 80 mmHg) for one hour followed by normotension (SBP 110 mmHg). This strategy, termed novel hybrid resuscitation (NH), was investigated with an in vivo model of terminally anesthetised pigs exposed to either a blast shock wave or sham blast, followed by severe controlled haemorrhage plus uncontrolled haemorrhage from a grade IV liver injury. In this model of survivable battlefield injury, NH resuscitation using 0. 9 % saline demonstrated superiority over hypotensive resuscitation for extended evacuation times (up to 8 hours), with significantly improved survival time after combined <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> and haemorrhage (from 258 to 452 minutes, mean, p= 0. 0169) and a clinically significant improvement in physiological state after haemorrhage {{in the absence of}} blast. There was no evidence of increased re- bleeding associated with NH. The use of hypertonic saline dextran (HSD) as the initial resuscitation fluid in an NH strategy was also assessed. Although HSD did show some physiological benefit after haemorrhage in the absence of <b>blast</b> <b>injury,</b> survival time was Significantly shorter when animals were initially resuscitated with HSD after combined blast and haemorrhage (208 minutes, mean, p= 0. 04). The reason remains unclear. In conclusion, NH should be considered as an emergency measure when delayed casualty evacuation is enforced. However HSD should be contraindicated when significant primary <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> complicates haemorrhage. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, civilians and peacekeepers are exposed to {{potentially}} serious <b>injury</b> from <b>blasts</b> and explosions. Providing insight into the trauma thresholds for <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> is necessary for the development of blast protection equipment and identification and subsequent treatment of <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> [Phillips, 1988] <b>Blast</b> <b>injury</b> can be categorized as primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary and quinernary, corresponding to different aspects of the <b>blast</b> loading and <b>injury</b> mechanisms. Primary <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> occurring in the lungs is of importance, since lung injury results in one of the highest rate of blast mortality. Much of the existing <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> data was obtained from animal testing with sheep and subsequently extrapolated to humans using scaling techniques. More recently, mathematical, experimental and numerical models have been developed and employed to investigate <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> In this study, a detailed finite element model of a sheep thorax and human thorax (developed at the University of Waterloo) was used to predict primary <b>blast</b> lung <b>injury</b> based on a range of blast loading conditions. The models were developed based on available anatomical data and material properties to model the organs and tissues, and were evaluated using the LS-Dyna explicit finite element code. The models were previously validated for the prediction of lung PBI using Friedlander-type blast waves. All results were compared to existing literature to further verify and validate the numerical models as wells as to provide insight on the effect of loading conditions on <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> The <b>blast</b> loading input for these simulations used idealized blast waves, based on a blast physics approach. Blast loads were verified using the Chinook CFD software. The effects of idealized blast waves on predicted lung injury were investigated to determine the importance of peak pressure, blast wave duration and impulse. The duration and peak pressures for the waves were selected based on the Bowen and UVa curves, and included a right angle triangular shape and a square wave to allow for the different parameters to be considered. These results were compared to the Bowen and revised Bowen injury models. The results show that the peak overpressure is dominant in predicting <b>injury</b> for <b>blast</b> loads with long durations (> 8 ms). The impulse was dominant in predicting <b>injury</b> for <b>blast</b> loads with short durations (< 1 ms). For blasts loads with intermediate durations (1 ms < 8 ms) both the shape of the blast load wave and peak overpressure play a role in primary <b>blast</b> lung <b>injury.</b> The effect of orientation of the body position on primary <b>blast</b> lung <b>injury</b> was investigated. Simulations were performed using the sheep and human numerical models along with a model of a commonly used experimental device, the Blast Test Device (BTD) cylinder. These models were oriented in different positions by rotating the body relative to the <b>blast</b> flow. <b>Injury</b> results for the BTD were calculated using the Injury 8. 1 injury prediction software. The BTD simulations served several purposes; it was used as a reference for the human and sheep simulations and its effectiveness as a tool to predict body orientation was evaluated. In general, all of the models predicted appropriate and similar levels of injury for the body in its default orientation, and these predictions were comparable to the accepted injury levels for this insult. For other orientations the BTD was not able to predict the appropriate <b>blast</b> <b>injury.</b> This highlighted the importance of proper placement and orientation of the BTD when used in simulations or physical experiments. The overall injury (based on the results from the right and left lung) predicted by the sheep and human thorax was similar for all orientations. However, very different results were obtained when the predicted injury for the right and left lungs was compared. The differences between the sheep and the human were examined and the differences in injury between the right and left lung {{is a result of the}} differences in anatomy between the two species. This study has evaluated the importance of blast wave parameters in predicting primary <b>blast</b> <b>injury,</b> an important consideration for the improvement of blast protection, and the effect of body orientation on primary <b>blast</b> <b>injury,</b> an important consideration for experimental testing and a starting point for the evaluation of complex blast loading.

40|$|Blast-induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) {{has been a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. How the primary blast wave affects the brain is not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether blast injures the brain through mechanisms similar to those found in non-blast closed impact injuries (nbTBI). The β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide associated with the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is elevated acutely following TBI in humans as well as in experimental animal models of nbTBI. We examined levels of brain Aβ following experimental <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Aβ 40 and 42. In both rat and mouse models of <b>blast</b> <b>injury,</b> rather than being increased, endogenous rodent brain Aβ levels were decreased acutely following injury. Levels of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) were increased following blast exposure although {{there was no evidence of}} axonal pathology based on APP immunohistochemical staining. Unlike the findings in nbTBI animal models, levels of the β-secretase, BACE- 1, and the γ-secretase component presenilin- 1 were unchanged following blast exposure. These studies have implications for understanding the nature of <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> to the brain. They also suggest that strategies aimed at lowering Aβ production may not be effective for treating acute <b>blast</b> <b>injury</b> to the brain...|$|R

50|$|In general, primary <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> are {{characterized}} {{by the absence of}} external injuries; thus internal injuries are frequently unrecognized and their severity underestimated. According to the latest experimental results, the extent and types of primary blast-induced injuries depend not only on the peak of the overpressure, but also other parameters such as number of overpressure peaks, time-lag between overpressure peaks, characteristics of the shear fronts between overpressure peaks, frequency resonance, and electromagnetic pulse, among others. There is general agreement that spalling, implosion, inertia, and pressure differentials are the main mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of primary <b>blast</b> <b>injuries.</b> Thus, the majority of prior research focused on the mechanisms of <b>blast</b> <b>injuries</b> within gas-containing organs and organ systems such as the lungs, while primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury has remained underestimated. Blast lung refers to severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding or swelling with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. It is {{the most common cause of}} death among people who initially survive an explosion.|$|R
