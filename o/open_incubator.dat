40|$|Uganda’s {{economy is}} agro-based; {{although}} {{the country is}} land locked it has great potential for industrial development. It is well endowed with natural resources and salubrious climate, but with little success in transforming its agricultural and mineral wealth into processed commodities for local, regional and international markets. The Uganda’s National Development Plan 2010 - 2014 and Uganda Vision 2040 call for a transformed Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years. To achieve this goal, Ugandan economy needs to be industrialized. This need {{is one of the}} identified strategic bottlenecks. Various strategies and action plans have been developed to steer the country’s economy towards sustainable development and increased competitiveness but with little success. It has been recognized globally that economic development depends heavily on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are the prime source of new jobs and {{play a crucial role in}} income generation as well as in industrialization processes. However, most small businesses fail within their early stages of operation mainly due to under-capitalization and / or lack of proper management and business skills. Globally, through business incubators, start-ups and SMEs have been significantly enhanced to overcome their initial and critical stages of development. Business incubators have been tried in Uganda but not in a successful way. An <b>Open</b> Innovation Business <b>Incubator</b> is a physical or virtual environment that combines the attributes of open innovation and business incubation concepts in creating and supporting new start-ups. This research aimed at understanding more of the situation in Uganda, how the innovation systems and incubators are managed in other countries and to design a model for how to create better conditions for incubators in Uganda and similar low-income countries and stimulate industrial development. The proposed model has adopted an open innovation approach and a list of suggestions and recommendations has been made. Different methodological tools and participatory approaches were utilized in the process of undertaking the study to achieve the objectives. Data were collected through literature review, analysis of relevant theories such as industrialization, entrepreneurship, science, technology and innovation, business incubation, triple helix and clusters theory, open innovation, and public private partnerships. Review of Government reports and policy documents, discussions with industrial and incubation experts, surveys, focus group discussions and case studies were done. Useful ideas were obtained from seminars and conferences. Research findings indicated that: • There are hardly any graduate incubatees in Uganda, thus there is a need to foster partnerships and synergies between government, private sector/non-government organizations and academia for open incubation, • All incubators in Uganda focus on incubatees developing technologies and products but not on business models, • <b>Open</b> innovation <b>incubators</b> combined with entrepreneurial oriented strategies can effectively support start-ups and SMEs but requires strong mutual trust amongst actors, • Through public-private partnerships and <b>open</b> innovation <b>incubators,</b> industrial transformation can be stimulated...|$|R
5000|$|Martin Arthur Couney (1870-March 1, 1950) was a {{physician}} and pioneer in neonatology. Though {{he claimed to have}} been a student of Pierre-Constant Budin, this claim cannot be verified. There is good reason to believe that he was not a trained medical doctor at all. [...] He is best known for helping parents of premature infants by placing them in [...] neonatal incubators when they were not allowed in most hospitals. He operated exhibits of premature infants at the Berlin Exposition of 1896, at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London, at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha, Nebraska in 1898, at the World's Fair in Paris in 1900, at the World's Fair in Buffalo, New York in 1901, and most famously, for many years at Coney Island, New York, where he charged 25 cents to view the babies so parents would not have to pay for their children's medical care. His exhibition at Luna Park <b>opened</b> in 1903. <b>Incubators</b> were included in hospitals shortly before his death in 1950.|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{fertilization}} of mammalian eggs in vitro, the gametes {{are often}} mixed and incubated in a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere, e. g. rabbit (Brackett & Williams, 1968), mouse (Cross & Brinster, 1970), human (Edwards, Steptoe & Purdy, 1970). Since the various media are usually buffered with relatively {{high levels of}} bicarbonate, the CO 2 is needed to maintain a pH which will allow sperm penetration. Bicarbonate has a stimulatory effect on sperm metabolism (Mur-doch & White, 1971) and may facilitate capacitation of hamster spermatozoa in vitro (Bavister, 1969). Furthermore, replacement of bicarbonate with tris or phosphate in a defined medium for ovum culture resulted in cessation of development (Brinster, 1969). Using the technique of Brackett & Williams (1968) in which eggs and spermatozoa are cultured for 4 hr {{in an atmosphere of}} 5 % CO 2 : 95 % air, it has been possible to achieve a high rate of fertilization of rabbit eggs in vitro (Fraser, Dandekar & Vaidya, 1971).

40|$|Background: A {{previous}} study in 1987 showed that neonatal care facilities in major {{hospitals in the}} country were of a very poor standard. The present study was done to reassess their status-Design: A survey. Methods: A pretested structured questionnaire was sent to 48 centers in 1994 - 95. The responses were analyzed. Results: A total of 37 centers returned the questionnaire duly filled. Of them, 22 belonged to the government sector, the rest 15 to the private sector. A nursery bed: nurse ratio of less than 1. 0 was reported by only 4 centers. Majority of the centers cited inadequate nursing strength and frequent transferring out of nurses as a major problem. Twenty nine (78 %) centers had ventilation facilities. Most of them had 1 or 2 ventilators. Blood gas facility was available with 29 centers and parenteral nutrition was undertaken at 20 (54 %) centers. Resuscitation bag(s) were available at all the centers and incubators at all except one. In quantitative terms, the following equipment was available in satisfactory numbers: resuscitation bags, resuscitation bassinet, incubators/open care systems, vital sign monitors, infusion pumps and pulse oximeters in 78. 3 %, 43. 2 %, 72. 9 %, 56. 7 %, 64. 8 % and 43. 5 % centers, respectively.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{existing}} programs and initiatives in Uganda supporting small businesses, but tend {{to suffer from}} a number of weaknesses. In particular typically small businesses find it difficult to do research and development; commercialize their results in markets (innovation) as fast as they should. For micro, small & medium enterprises to be dully competitive in a competitive economic environment requires that they develop internal capabilities to effectively assimilate, use and adapt product and process technologies for their businesses to survive on an ongoing basis. To overcome this drawback, the concept of Business Incubation has been proposed. This concept has gained large interest in the research community. The key idea is to create and nurture new businesses for growth by providing services and infrastructure required by utilizing the external knowledge sources (open innovation) and triple-helix model which assist formation of business and industrial clusters. A business incubator is an organization that supports the creation and growth of new businesses by providing services and infrastructure that is required by the targeted clients. Given that most firms in developing countries start too small to compete especially in international markets, a pre-requisite to industrial development, governments and policy makers should give particular attention to the constraints and needs of MSMEs. This can be done by adopting a mix of policies and framework conditions to reduce on the obstacles that hamper technological innovation, collaboration and business growth. In particular is access to finance and enhancing technology and business capacity development through training, linkages and networks. This Licentiate thesis discusses and reviews the initiatives and programs aimed at supporting the development of MSMEs with a view to stimulate industrial development in Uganda. The main aim of this research is to examine the process of business incubation and explain the contribution of <b>open</b> innovation business <b>incubators</b> to entrepreneurs/ start-up firms within the broader context of developing entrepreneurship, promoting science, technology and innovation and creating employment. This research focuses on the roles and relationships of government, university and research institutions and the private sector as sources of knowledge for technological innovations. Literature review, theory understanding, and participatory methods including group discussions with questionnaires, meetings and interviews, were used to achieve the objectives. From the findings, it was revealed among MSMEs that due to their sizes, limited managerial and technological skills, and inadequate functional business support services have had adverse effects on their upgrading and growth. There was little linkage and follow up between industry and other public research sectors i. e. government agencies and higher institutions although there are quite a number of support institutions with poor coordination. The research analyzed {{a wide range of issues}} that are related to the desired structural transformation of the Ugandan economy towards industrialization process. Finally it will propose strategies for the most appropriate model for Uganda...|$|R
