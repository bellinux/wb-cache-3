Word had just arrived of {{the passage of the}} Intolerable Acts, as Americans dubbed the {{legislative}} response to the Boston Tea Party, and a group of lawmakers including Lee, Henry, and Jefferson asked Mason to join them in formulating a course of action. The Burgesses passed a resolution for a day of fasting and prayer to obtain divine intervention against [...] "destruction of <b>our</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights", but the governor, Lord Dunmore, dissolved the legislature rather than accept it. Mason may have helped write the resolution, and likely joined the members after the dissolution when they met at the Raleigh Tavern.|$|E
500|$|After {{the passage}} of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, the Supreme Court dealt with a series of cases {{regarding}} the scope of that amendment's Due Process Clause. This Clause says that [...] "Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law". The Court initially rejected an argument that the Due Process Clause applied to the state governments in Hurtado v. California (1884), a case concerning the right to a grand jury hearing. Justice Matthews, writing {{for the majority of the}} Court, reasoned that [...] "the Amendment prescribing due process of law is too vague and indefinite to operate as a practical restraint." [...] While this decision rejected an expanded reach of the Due Process Clause, the Court stated that the Clause did protect against state encroachment of [...] "fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all <b>our</b> <b>civil</b> and political institutions".|$|E
500|$|Instead {{she offered}} five {{recommendations}} for the Commission, recommending (1) that [...] "the Justice Department instruct law-enforcement agencies to keep records {{of the use of}} pornography in violent crimes", (2) a ban on the possession and distribution of pornography in prisons, (3) that prosecutors [...] "enforce laws against pimping and pandering against pornographers", (4) that the administration [...] "make it a Justice Department priority to enforce RICO (the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) against the pornography industry", and (5) that Congress adopt federal anti-pornography civil rights legislation which would provide for civil damages for harm inflicted on women. She suggested that the Commission consider [...] "creating a criminal conspiracy provision under the civil rights law, such that conspiring to deprive a person of their civil rights by coercing them into pornography is a crime, and that conspiring to traffic in pornography is conspiring to deprive women of <b>our</b> <b>civil</b> rights". Dworkin compared her proposal to the Southern Poverty Law Center's use of civil rights litigation against the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E

2500|$|In 1844 the Methodist Church became {{divided over}} the {{ownership}} of slaves by its ministers. A line was drawn west from Lynchburg, north of which slave ownership was forbidden. This would have included most of West Virginia. However, many Methodist churches in West Virginia refused to follow this decision. The Western Virginia Conference of the Methodist church at their meeting in March, 1861, resolved to [...] "utterly condemn any attempt {{to interfere with the}} legal relation of master and servant...". In Marion county a congregation urged the church to [...] "send among us only such ministers as have wisdom and grace enough to enable them to preach the gospel without meddling with <b>our</b> <b>civil</b> institutions."

2500|$|Canada's first francophone prime minister, Laurier {{is often}} {{considered}} one of the country's greatest statesmen. He is well known for his policies of conciliation, expanding Confederation, and compromise between French and English Canada. His vision for Canada was a land of individual liberty and decentralized federalism. [...] He also argued for an English-French partnership in Canada. [...] "I have had before me as a pillar of fire," [...] he said, [...] "a policy of true Canadianism, of moderation, of [...]" [...] He passionately defended individual liberty, [...] "Canada is free and freedom is its nationality," [...] and [...] "Nothing will prevent me from continuing my task of preserving at all cost <b>our</b> <b>civil</b> liberty." [...] Laurier was also well-regarded for his efforts to establish Canada as an autonomous country within the British Empire, and he supported the continuation of the Empire if it was based on [...] "absolute liberty political and commercial". A 2011 Maclean's historical ranking of the Prime Ministers placed Laurier first.|$|E

As told by Carol Hoffecker in Democracy in Delaware, [...] "'In these portentous times,' remarked Governor Thomas in 1824, 'it seems rather a hazardous experiment to permit one generation to sleep in ignorance.' He advocated a special school tax, which he promised 'would be a blessing to the people...for it would...relieve them of the most intolerable of all burdens, the burdens of immorality and ignorance. 'In vain,' he said, 'do we boast of our elective franchise, and <b>our</b> <b>civil</b> rights, if {{a large portion of}} our citizens are unable to read the tickets which they annually present at the polls.

2500|$|Under the Constitution, {{due process}} gives {{criminal}} defendants two interdependent procedural safeguards {{with respect to}} {{the manner in which the}} sentence is determined. [...] The first of these is the jury trial, a [...] "guard against a spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of the rulers" [...] and [...] "the great bulwark of <b>our</b> <b>civil</b> and political liberties," [...] whereby [...] "the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of the defendant's equals and neighbors." [...] The second is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the historical [...] "measure of persuasion by which the prosecution must convince the trier of all the essential elements of guilt." [...] There was historically no distinction between an [...] "element" [...] of a crime and a [...] "sentencing factor" [...] because the trial judge had very little discretion at sentencing, because most crimes had a specific sentence attached to them.|$|E

Forrest fought by simple rules: he maintained that [...] "war means fighting and fighting means killing" [...] and that the way to win was [...] "to get there first with the most men". His cavalry, which Sherman reported in disgust [...] "could travel one hundred miles in less time it takes ours to travel ten", secured more Union guns, horses, and supplies than any other single Confederate unit. He played pivotal roles at Fort Donelson, Shiloh, the capture of Murfreesboro, the Franklin-Nashville campaign, Brice's Cross Roads, and in pursuit and capture of Colonel Streight's Raiders.|$|E

[...] In the decision, Ex parte Levitt, the Court found that Levitt's standing, as a citizen {{and member of the}} Supreme Court Bar, was not sufficient to allow him to challenge the seating of Black. [...] When he heard of the decision, Levitt quoted from the Book of Job: [...] "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him; but I will maintain my own ways before Him."

2500|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{noted in}} his {{autobiography}} that his first encounter {{with the idea of}} nonviolent resistance was reading [...] "On Civil Disobedience" [...] in 1944 while attending Morehouse College. He wrote in his autobiography that it was, Here, in this courageous New Englander's refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slavery's territory into Mexico, I made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance. Fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system, I was so deeply moved that I reread the work several times. I became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good. No other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than Henry David Thoreau. As a result of his writings and personal witness, we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest. The teachings of Thoreau came alive in <b>our</b> <b>civil</b> rights movement; indeed, they are more alive than ever before. Whether expressed in a sit-in at lunch counters, a freedom ride into Mississippi, a peaceful protest in Albany, Georgia, a bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, these are outgrowths of Thoreau's insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice.|$|E
