The philosophical belief that mental and physical events exist as a series of durationless moments that lie between the physical past and the physical future is known as presentism, and is a form of belief in Galilean relativity.|$|E

25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} of {{ourselves}} as having free will.

25|$|According to Shusterman our culture’s growing {{preoccupation with}} the body has not yet found an {{appropriate}} response {{in the realm of}} philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the negative aspects of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> of the varieties of bodily charms”).|$|E
25|$|Harris {{rejects the}} {{dichotomy}} between religious spirituality {{on the one}} hand and scientific rationality on the other, and favors a middle path that preserves spirituality and science but does not involve religion. He writes that spirituality should be understood in light of scientific disciplines like neuroscience and psychology. Science, he contends, can show how to maximize human well-being but may fail to answer certain questions about the nature of being, answers to some of which he says are discoverable directly through <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> His conception of spirituality does not involve a belief in God.|$|E
40|$|Modifiability is an {{important}} quality for software systems, because {{a large part of}} the costs associated with these systems is spent on modifications. The effort, and therefore cost, that is required for these modifications is largely determined by a system's software architecture. Analysis of software architectures is therefore {{an important}} technique to achieve modifiability and reduce maintenance costs. However, few techniques for software architecture analysis currently exist. Based on <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> with software architecture analysis of modifiability, we have developed ALMA, an architecture-level modifiability analysis method consisting of five steps. In this paper we report on <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> with ALMA. We illustrate <b>our</b> <b>experiences</b> with examples from two case studies of software architecture analysis of modifiability. These case studies concern a system for mobile positioning at Ericsson Software Technology AB and a system for freight handling at DFDS Fraktarna. <b>Our</b> <b>experiences</b> are related to each step of the analysis process. In addition, we made some observations on software architecture analysis of modifiability in general...|$|R

25|$|Like {{a number}} of other theories, the Multiple Drafts model understands {{conscious}} experience as taking time to occur, such that percepts do not instantaneously arise in the mind in their full richness. The distinction is that Dennett's theory denies any clear and unambiguous boundary separating conscious experiences from all other processing. According to Dennett, consciousness {{is to be found in}} the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing <b>our</b> <b>experience.</b> There is no central experiencer who confers a durable stamp of approval on any particular draft.|$|E
25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of <b>our</b> <b>experience,</b> e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E
25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message {{in one ear}} {{is supposed to be}} shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{truth is}} that Cousin's {{doctrine}} of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts {{to little more than}} a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and how we are to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond <b>our</b> <b>experience,</b> or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.|$|E
25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice is predicated on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> {{that we have a}} false ideal of choice predicated upon this.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that <b>our</b> <b>experience</b> of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E
