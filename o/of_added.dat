The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute <b>of</b> <b>added</b> time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. That {{was to be the}} final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
5|$|Crab dip, {{sometimes}} referred to as Maryland crab dip, is a thick, creamy dip that is typically prepared from cream cheese and lump crab meat. Other primary ingredients such as mayonnaise may be used. Various types of crab preparations, species and superfamilies are used, as are a variety <b>of</b> <b>added</b> ingredients. It is typically served hot, although cold versions also exist. Hot versions are typically baked or broiled. It is sometimes served as an appetizer. Accompaniments may include crackers and various breads. Some U.S. restaurants offer crab dip, commercially produced varieties exist, and some stadiums offer it as a part of their concessions.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-final, Chelsea faced local rivals Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley. The {{first half}} was even, {{with both sides}} enjoying long spells of possession, until Didier Drogba put Chelsea ahead just before the break. Chelsea scored {{at the start of}} the second half. However, Juan Mata's goal that did not appear to cross the line, but referee Martin Atkinson awarded the goal. Gareth Bale put Tottenham back in it with a goal shortly after a Petr Čech {{challenge}} on Emmanuel Adebayor. Despite the goal, Tottenham never took control of the game and Ramires scored in the 77th minute, followed minutes later by a Frank Lampard free kick, and a Florent Malouda strike in the fourth minute <b>of</b> <b>added</b> time. This secured Chelsea's place in their first FA Cup Final since their 2010 triumph over Portsmouth.|$|E

In the 56th minute, Cesc Fàbregas – who had {{a bicycle}} kick saved by Lloris – set up Diego Costa, whose shot from {{the left of the}} area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions – Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Dembélé, Érik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively – but could not change the score. In the 74th minute, Dier's knee caught César Azpilicueta, drawing blood; the Chelsea left-back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes later. There were four minutes <b>of</b> <b>added</b> time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.|$|E

5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is called}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake, {{named after the}} United States President {{who presided over the}} authorization and completion of the dam. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including Native Americans whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish-ladders, neither does the next down-stream dam, Chief Joseph Dam. This means that no salmon ever reach the Grand Coulee Dam, rendering the possibility <b>of</b> <b>added</b> fish-ladders superfluous. Despite this, the second large dam down-stream, Rocky Reach Dam, does contains an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning. Being itself 473 miles upstream of the mouth of the Columbia River, there is currently no issue with salmon spawning that Grand Coulee or Chief Joseph dams are at fault for.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} anterior disc displacement (ADD) degree and other temporomandibular joint (TMJ) soft tissues and osseous abnormalities in symptomatic TMJ dysfunction based on magnetic resonance imaging findings. Patients and methods: MR images of 106 TMJs in 53 patients, presented with symptomatic TMJ dysfunction were included. Degree <b>of</b> <b>ADD</b> was detected {{and its relationship to}} joint effusion, retrodiscal layer integrity, thickness of lateral pterygoid muscle (LPM) attachments, degenerative changes and condylar position and translation as well as clinical manifestations was studied. Results: Compared with normal disc position, risk of joint effusion and degenerative changes were significantly increased with increased degree <b>of</b> <b>ADD</b> (p <  0. 05). LPM attachment thickening and retrodiscal layer abnormalities are significantly associated with an advanced degree <b>of</b> <b>ADD</b> (p <  0. 05). Risk <b>of</b> <b>ADD</b> is significantly increased with posterior position of the condyle within the fossa. Conclusion: There is a direct relationship between the ADD degree and other TMJ soft tissues and bone abnormalities as well as the severity of clinical manifestations, so early MRI detection and reporting <b>of</b> <b>ADD</b> degree and other MRI findings might help clinicians in full assessment and determining strategy of management of TMJ dysfunction...|$|R
