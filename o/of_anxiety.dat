5|$|Alprazolam {{is mostly}} {{used to treat}} anxiety disorders, panic disorders, and nausea due to chemotherapy. Alprazolam may also be {{indicated}} {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder, {{as well as for the}} treatment <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> conditions with co-morbid depression.

5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms <b>of</b> <b>anxiety.</b> In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer. It {{is commonly used}} for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorders, especially of panic disorder, {{but also in the}} treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder. It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> and agitation.|$|E

Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations <b>of</b> <b>anxiety,</b> curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E

The learning model compared were Teams Games Tournament of cooperative learning model, Fan-N-Pick of coopeartive learning model, and direct instruction model The method which was applied in this research was quasi-experimental with 3 × 3 factorial design done in class VIII second semester of Junior High School (SMP) In Magelang Regency Academic Year 2012 / 2013. Sampling technique using stratified cluster random sampling. The research concludes as follows. 1) Fan-N-Pick of cooperative learning model gave better mathematics learning achievement than TGT of cooperative learning model and direct instructional model. While, TGT of cooperative learning model gave better mathematics learning achievement than direct instructional model. 2) The students with low levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety</b> had mathematics learning achievement is better than students with medium and high <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety.</b> While students with medium levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety</b> had mathematics learning achievement is better than students with high levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety.</b> 3) In the TGT of cooperative learning model, students with high and medium levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety</b> had similar good mathematics achievement. So also students with medium and low levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety</b> had similar good mathematics achievement. However, the TGT of cooperative learning model, students with low levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety</b> had mathematics learning achievement is better than students with high levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety.</b> In the Fan-N-Pick of cooperative learning model, students with low, medium and high levels <b>of</b> mathematics <b>anxiety</b> had similar good mathematics achievement.

5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety.

Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms <b>of</b> <b>anxiety,</b> ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by clinical guidelines. Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E

According to traditional accounts, during initiation when the guru whispered the mantra to him, Ramprasad became consumed by intense longing for the goddess Kali. One year after the initiation he lost his guru. Ramprasad later became the disciple of Krishnananda Agamavagisha, a Tantric yogi and scholar.

The research question not yet answered considers the developmental trend <b>of</b> social <b>anxiety</b> in various periods of adolescence. In the study we proposed that at least social anxiety in its cognitive form (i. e., worries and fear of negative social evaluation) would decrease from early to late adolescence.

The initial sample consisted of 325 early, middle and late adolescents to whom measures <b>of</b> social <b>anxiety,</b> self-consciousness and self-perceptions were administered.
