That same year, the company delivered the largest single furniture shipment to the then-new Sears Tower. The delivery included 43,565 pieces of furniture and furnished 44 floors.|$|E

2500|$|The Lisa {{operating}} system featured preemptive multitasking and protected memory, then extremely advanced features {{for a personal}} computer. Based in part on advanced elements from the failed Apple III SOS {{operating system}} released three years earlier, the Lisa also organized its files in hierarchal directories, making the use of large hard drives practical. The Macintosh would eventually adopt this disk organizational design as well for its HFS filing system. Conceptually, the Lisa resembles the Xerox Star {{in the sense that}} it was envisioned as an office computing system; consequently, Lisa has two main user modes: the Lisa <b>Office</b> <b>System</b> and the Workshop. The Lisa <b>Office</b> <b>System</b> is the GUI environment for end users. The Workshop was a program development environment, and was almost entirely text-based, though it used a GUI text editor. The Lisa <b>Office</b> <b>System</b> was eventually renamed [...] "7/7", in reference to the seven supplied application programs: LisaWrite, LisaCalc, LisaDraw, LisaGraph, LisaProject, LisaList, and LisaTerminal.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances have {{made possible the}} automation of traditional office functions such as document preparation, storage, retrieval, inter-personal communication, etc. With the increased pervasiveness of <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> technology, selection of the appropriate technology components can be a complex and difficult task. There {{is a need for}} a methodology to aid in selecting <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> components based on the needs of the particular operating environment. In this paper, we propose to structure the selection problem in a hierarchical fashion, with the top level representing the single overall objective, the intermediate level(s) representing the users' needs, and the lowest level representing the viable candidate set of alternative <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> to be evaluated. A recently developed technique termed analytical hierarchies is employed, and a case study is presented to illustrate how the technique can be used in the selection of <b>office</b> <b>systems</b> components. ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{significant}} {{impediment to}} third-party software on the Lisa {{was the fact}} that, when first launched, the Lisa <b>Office</b> <b>System</b> {{could not be used}} to write programs for itself: a separate development OS, called Lisa Workshop, was required. During this development process, engineers would alternate between the two OSes at startup, writing and compiling code on one OS and testing it on the other. Later, the same Lisa Workshop was used to develop software for the Macintosh. After a few years, a Macintosh-native development system was developed. For most of its lifetime, the Lisa never went beyond the original seven applications that Apple had deemed enough to [...] "do everything", although UniPress Software did offer Unix for $495.|$|E

For visual design, a new Windows Presentation Foundation visual designer and a new HTML/CSS editor influenced by Microsoft Expression Web are included. J# is not included. Visual Studio 2008 requires [...]NET 3.5 Framework and by default configures compiled assemblies to run on [...]NET Framework 3.5, but it also supports multi-targeting which lets the developers choose which version of the [...]NET Framework (out of 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, Silverlight CoreCLR or [...]NET Compact Framework) the assembly runs on. Visual Studio 2008 also includes new code analysis tools, including the new Code Metrics tool (only in Team Edition and Team Suite Edition). For Visual C++, Visual Studio adds {{a new version of}} Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC 9.0) that adds support for the visual styles and UI controls introduced with Windows Vista. For native and managed code interoperability, Visual C++ introduces the STL/CLR, which is a port of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers and algorithms to managed code. STL/CLR defines STL-like containers, iterators and algorithms that work on C++/CLI managed objects.|$|E

There was no let-up; she couldn't shirk for a day or two, as she had done at the {{commercial college}}. It was not so much that she was afraid of losing her job as that she came to see herself as part of a chain. The others, beyond, were waiting for her; she mustn't hold them up. That was her first impression of the <b>office</b> <b>system,</b> that and the insignificance of herself {{in the presence of the}} office-hierarchy--manager above manager and the Mysterious Owner beyond all. She was alone; once she transgressed they would crush her. They had no personal interest in her, none of them, except her classmate, Miss Moynihan, who smiled at her and went out to lunch with her.|$|E
60|$|Then in {{the autumn}} of that year, 1858, I was asked to go to the West Indies, and cleanse the Augean stables of our Post <b>Office</b> <b>system</b> there. Up to that time, and at that time, our Colonial Post Offices {{generally}} were managed from home, and were subject to the British Postmaster-General. Gentlemen were sent out from England to be postmasters, surveyors, and what not; and as our West Indian islands have never been regarded as being of themselves happily situated for residence, the gentlemen so sent were sometimes more conspicuous for want of income than for official zeal and ability. Hence the stables had become Augean. I was also instructed to carry out in some of the islands a plan for giving up this postal authority to the island Governor, and in others to propose some such plan. I was then to go on to Cuba, to make a postal treaty with the Spanish authorities, and to Panama for the same purpose with the Government of New Grenada. All this work I performed to my satisfaction, and I hope to that of my masters in St. Martin's le Grand.|$|E

But, of course, I admit the very fact that there can be and are such schools and offices is a terrible indictment of the slatternly schools and bad-tempered offices we usually do have, and if you can show up this system of shutting people up in treadmills, why go to it, and good luck. The longer people are stupidly optimistic, the longer we'll have to wait for improvements. But, believe me, my dear girl, for every ardent radical who says the whole thing is rotten there's ten clever advertising-men who think it's virtue to sell new brands of soap-powder that are no better than the old brands, and a hundred old codgers who are so broken into the <b>office</b> <b>system</b> that they think they are perfectly happy--don't know how much fun in life they miss. Still, they're no worse than the adherents to any other paralyzed system. Look at the comparatively intelligent people who fall for any freak religious system and let it make their lives miserable. I suppose that when the world has no more war or tuberculosis, then offices will be exciting places to work in--but not till then. And meantime, if the typical business man with a taste for fishing heard even so mild a radical as I am, he'd sniff, 'The fellow don't know what he's talking about; everybody in all the offices I know is perfectly satisfied.'" ...|$|E
