40|$|AbstractBackground: Tobacco smokers {{have lower}} serum levels of {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) G, mainly due to {{lower levels of}} IgG 2, than non-smokers. The component(s) in tobacco smoke responsible for this effect is unknown, but animal studies have implicated nicotine as {{a major contributor to}} the immunologic effects of smoking. Does nicotine exposure due to use of smokeless tobacco (<b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff)</b> or nicotine replacement therapy influence serum Ig levels in humans?Methods: Serum content of Ig classes and IgG subclasses was analysed in 77 non-smoking nicotine consumers, including 48 users of <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> (smokeless tobacco users) and 29 ex-smokers on nicotine replacement therapy, and compared with 44 healthy controls. Former smokers in any group had quit smoking at least 6 months prior to study entry. Ig class and IgG subclass levels were determined by radial immunodiffusion. Systemic nicotine exposure was excluded and confirmed by measuring urine content of cotinine using a quantitative radioimmunoassay. Results: Ig class and IgG subclass levels did not differ significantly between the groups, with the sole exception of IgG 4, which was significantly lower in nicotine consumers than in healthy subjects (0. 4 ± 0. 3 vs. 0. 6 ± 0. 4 g/l, mean±sd, 95 % confidence interval {− 0. 3;− 0. 05 }). There was no correlation between any Ig variable and cotinine concentration. Conclusions: The decreased levels of IgG and IgG 2 seen in tobacco smokers {{do not seem to be}} an effect of systemic exposure to nicotine...|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{water and}} soft drinks with a {{perceptible}} off-odour were analysed to identify contaminants originating from previous misuse of the refillable polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle. Consumers detected the off-odour after opening {{the bottle and}} duly returned it with the remaining content to the producers. The contaminants in question had thus been undetected by the in-line detection devices (so-called 'sniffers') {{that are supposed to}} reject misused bottles. GC-MS analysis was carried out on the headspace of 31 returned products and their corresponding reference products, and chromatograms were compared to find the possible off-odour compounds. Substances believed to be responsible for the organoleptic change were 2 -methoxynaphthalene (10 bottles), dimethyl disulfide (4), anethole (3), petroleum products (4), ethanol with isoamyl alcohol (1) and a series of ethers (1). The mouldy/musty odour (5 bottles) was caused by trichloroanisole in one instance. In some cases, the origins of the off-odours are believed to be previous consumer misuse of food products (liquorice-flavoured alcohol, home-made alcohol containing fusel oil) or non-food products (cleaning products, petroleum products, <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> and others). The results also apply to 1. 5 -litre recyclable PET bottles, since {{the nature and extent of}} consumer misuse can be expected to be similar for the two bottle types...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{development}} of ultrasonographic arterial imaging, high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography, {{has created a}} technical basis for a new diagnostic approach to atherosclerotic disease by offering the possibility of accurate and reproducible quantification of the structural and functional changes in the arterial wall. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) {{have been shown to}} be good surrogate markers of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic lesions detected in the thoracic aorta by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are markers of diffuse atherosclerotic disease, often associated with coronary, carotid and peripheral vascular disease. Aims: The aims of this thesis were to study whether intake of <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> causes acute endothelial dysfunction in the brachial artery of long-term snuff users. to assess the strength of any relation between walls changes in the thoracic aorta and carotid arteries and the angiographic severity and extent of coronary artery lesions in patients with angiographically verified CAD. to examine the relationship between morphological and functional parameters of the brachial and carotid arteries and the angiographic extent and severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with severe CAD. to determine the influence of low-dose prednisolone on atherosclerosis, endothelial function, and risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: The acute effect of 1 g oral snuff on endothelial function in 20 healthy, long-term snuff users was measured by FMD. The effect on heart rate and blood pressure was also measured. The strength of any relation between the angiographic severity and extent of coronary artery lesions on the one hand and ultrasonographically measured walls changes in the thoracic aorta (n= 37), carotid arteries and brachial artery and endothelial function in the brachial artery on the other hand was investigated by TEE, carotid and brachial B-mode scanning and FMD in 58 patients who had undergone coronary angiography. In a randomized study 67 patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were randomized to either 7. 5 mg prednisolone daily (n= 34) or no prednisolone (n= 33). The effects of the low-dose treatment with prednisolone on the brachial endothelial function and the carotid wall thickness were studied by FMD and B-mode ultrasonography, respectively, after a mean of 5 years treatment. The relation between risk factors for atherosclerosis and the above mentioned ultrasonographic parameters was investigated. Results: FMD values declined significantly after the administration of <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff.</b> Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased significantly after snuff administration. All parameters remained unchanged after placebo. A significant correlation was seen between the extent of coronary artery stenosis and aortic plaques score. Mean carotid IMT was also significantly correlated with coronary artery stenosis extent score. Moreover, a significant correlation was seen between the aortic plaque score and the mean carotid IMT. A significant correlation was seen between the extent of coronary artery stenosis defined as the coronary angiographic score and both the mean brachial artery IMT and intima media area (IMa). There was no significant correlation between FMD and the extent of coronary artery stenosis. A significant correlation was seen between the mean carotid artery IMT and the mean brachial artery IMT. However, there was no significant correlation between FMD and the mean carotid artery IMT or IMa. Carotid IMT and IMa, prevalence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques and FMD in brachial artery did not differ between RA patients treated with and those not treated with prednisolone. Carotid IMT and IMa, but not brachial FMD, were significantly associated with traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Conclusions: Intake of <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> significantly impaired endothelial function, measured as FMD of the brachial artery, in long-term snuffers. As endothelial dysfunction predicts cardiovascular morbidity, use of oral snuff should be discouraged. Morphological parameters of the carotid arteries and the thoracic aorta were related to severity and extent of coronary artery stenosis in patients with severe CAD. B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid arteries and transesophageal echocardiography of the aorta therefore have a potential for diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected CAD. Morphological but not functional parameters of the brachial artery were associated with the extent of coronary artery stenosis and atherosclerotic wall changes in the carotid arteries in patients with severe CAD. These findings indicate a potential of B-mode ultrasonography of morphological parameters in the brachial artery in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected CAD. Low-dose prednisolone did not influence endothelial function or subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with RA. The study verifies the relation between risk factors for atherosclerosis and carotid IMT and IMa...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{follow the}} {{development}} of a class of pupils' tobacco habits for seven years, and to study differences in tobacco use between girls and boys. Setting. Kronoberg County in southern Sweden. Subjects. All the approximately 2000 pupils were followed from approximately age 12 to approximately age 18. Design. Yearly cross-sectional surveys from 1994 to 2000. Each year, the pupils filled in an established tobacco questionnaire. They did it anonymously in the classroom. Main outcome measures. Percentage of smokers, number of cigarettes smoked per day, and percentage of pupils using "snus", the Swedish variety of <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff.</b> Results. From grade 6 of compulsory school to grade 12 of upper secondary school, the proportion of daily smokers rose, from 0. 2 % to 22 % for girls and from 0. 5 % to 14 % for boys. Among both genders, the increase occurred mainly between grades 7 and 10, and from grade 10 onwards the daily smokers were the largest group of smokers. Starting from grade 9, boys had higher total tobacco consumption than girls, {{as a result of their}} increased use of "snus", and at the end of the study 39 % of the boys used tobacco compared with 34 % of the girls. Conclusion. Studying young people's tobacco habits over time gives an understanding of when preventive measures should be implemented.

40|$|The use of Swedish <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> is a {{widespread}} habit in Sweden. In 1999, 25 % of the adult male population and 3. 1 % of the female population were users of snuff. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate how variations in pH and nicotine concentrations of snuff affect the oral mucosa, clinically and histologically, salivary pH and daily nicotine intake in 20 habitual users of loose snuff. The subjects were studied during use of their usual brand, after 12 weeks use of a snuff with lower pH and after another 12 weeks use of a snuff with both lower pH and lower nicotine concentration. Consumption data, oral soft tissue changes, salivary pH and nicotine intake were meas-ured. Further, biopsies were taken from the central part of the clinically observed lesions and histological changes were analysed. The subjects maintained their snuff consumption during the observation periods. The average salivary pH was higher during snuff use than in the morning. Further, it was higher shortly after the snuff was removed than during snuff use. After having switched to the snuff with both lower pH and lower nicotine concentrations, they showed a significant reduction in daily nicotine intake and developed significantly less pronounced clinical and histological changes. These results indicate that nicotine is one of the substances in snuff that has a biological effect on the oral mucosa. However, there also seems to be a synergistic effect between the pH and nicotine concentration in the snuff...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decades Non-Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (NHL) has demonstrated an immense increase in incidence globally, among almost all age and race {{groups as well}} as in both genders. In the search for causes, none of the known risk factors can alone or together entirely explain this trend. This thesis aims to answer a number of research inquiries with regard to NHL but also other hematolymphoproliferative malignancies. Firstly, we sought to estimate the influence of various forms of tobacco use and body mass index on the risk of NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), leukemia and multiple myeloma. Secondly, we aimed to disentangle the relative importance of putative determinants of NHL risk in the organ transplant setting, including characteristics of donor and recipient, immunosuppressive medications and infectious complications. Thirdly, our objective was to explore the role of genetic variation in translocation breakpoint genes (BCL 2, CCND 1), the protooncogene MYC and immunoregulatory genes (TNF, IL- 10) in the etiology of NHL. In a large cohort of more than 330, 000 construction workers attending regular health check-ups we employed prospectively gathered exposure information on tobacco use and BMI to analyze the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of NHL and HL in a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Tobacco smoking, <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> use and BMI were all unrelated to NHL. However, among long term users of <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> (> 30 years), an indication of an excess risk of HL was observed (IRR 3. 78, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 23 - 11. 6). In a subsequent study of the construction workers cohort we computed IRR for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) and multiple myeloma (MM) in relation to tobacco use and BMI, applying essentially the same methods. In this investigation, the study population was restricted to male workers and attained age was used as the time scale in the Cox model. Current smoking was associated with a 50 % increased risk of AML (95 % CI 1. 06 - 2. 11). Within a cohort (n= 5391) of organ transplant recipients (1970 - 1997) we designed a nested case control study comprising 37 cases of NHL and 97 controls. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated in a conditional logistic regression model. Treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) conferred a five-fold elevated risk of NHL (95 % CI 2. 17 - 14. 3). The excess risk was more pronounced for a high average daily dose of ATG. Further, having a herpes virus group infection was associated with a five-fold excess risk of NHL (OR 4. 89, 95 % CI 1. 88 - 12. 7), most likely to be driven by Epstein Barr virus. In a case-control study of 2410 incident cases of NHL and 1963 matched controls selected from the Swedish and Danish population registers, subjects took part in a telephone interview and provided blood specimens for genotyping. OR and 95 % CI were computed in multivariate logistic regression analyses. No relationship between investigated polymorphisms in BCL 2, CCND 1 or MYC and NHL could be discerned. TNF rs 1800629 minor allele homozygocity was associated with a 50 % greater risk of NHL (OR 1. 52, 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 2. 18) as well as a two-fold increased risk of T-cell lymphoma and Mantle cell lymphoma, respectively. IL 10 rs 1800890 minor allele homozygocity conferred a higher risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR 1. 45, CI 1. 10 - 1. 90) and Mantle cell lymphoma (OR 1. 83, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 3. 12) ...|$|E

40|$|Smokeless tobacco, which {{includes}} both <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> and chewing tobacco, imbues substantial health risks, {{not limited to}} increased chances of oral and pancreatic cancer, gum disease, nicotine addiction, and, among adolescents, increased likelihood of smoking initiation. There {{is little evidence that}} use of smokeless tobacco enhances athletic performance; yet, sporting events and athletic participation are consistently identified as key contexts associated with smokeless tobacco use. The tobacco industry has long marketed smokeless tobacco products at sporting events and targeted elite athletes for product endorsements in order to integrate smokeless tobacco into the sporting culture. Young males, whether striving to gain the acceptance of admired peers or to emulate respected athletes and coaches, often engage in smokeless tobacco experimentation and continued use during sports participation or attendance at sporting events. In the United States, male high school athletes are significantly more likely to use smokeless tobacco than their non-athlete counterparts. The same holds true for female high school athletes, although smokeless tobacco use is much less common among females overall. In contrast, cigarette smoking is less prevalent among high school athletes than non-athletes. Baseball, in particular, is one of several sports, including rodeo, wrestling, ice hockey, and football, that are associated with high levels of smokeless tobacco use among its participants, extending across the high school, college, and professional ranks. Smokeless tobacco use is prohibited on the field of play in college baseball and in the minor leagues. Major League Baseball bars its players from carrying smokeless tobacco products in their uniforms but does not ban use during play, which results in the broadcast of implicit product endorsements to millions of viewers worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Background In Sweden, {{the smoking}} {{prevalence}} has declined. In 2007, it {{was among the}} lowest in the industrialized world. A steady increase in the use of Swedish <b>oral</b> <b>moist</b> <b>snuff,</b> snus, has occurred in parallel. This development is neither solicited by authorities nor the medical establishment, but rather has occurred along with increased awareness of the dangers of smoking, and has been promoted by product development and marketing of snus. Objective To evaluate time trends in patterns of tobacco use in northern Sweden during 1990 – 2007. Design Cross-sectional (99, 381 subjects) and longitudinal (26, 867 subjects) data from the Västerbotten Intervention Programme (VIP) 1990 – 2007 were analyzed. All adults in Västerbotten County are invited to a VIP health examination at ages 40, 50, and 60 years, and until 1995 also 30 years. Smoking and use of snus were evaluated by gender, age and educational groups. Intermittent smoking was categorized as smoking. Results From the period 1990 – 1995 to the period 2002 – 2007, smoking prevalence decreased from 26 to 16 % among men and from 27 to 18 % among women. The differences in prevalence increased between educational groups. The decline in smoking was less and the increase of snus use was greater among those with basic education. The use of snus among basic-educated 40 -year-olds reached 35 % among men and 14 % among women during 2002 – 2007. Dual smoking and snus use increased among men and women with basic education. Smoking without snus use was more prevalent among women. Gender differences in total smoking prevalence (smoking only plus dual use) were small in all age groups, but increased among those with basic education reaching 7. 3 % during 2002 – 2007, with women being more frequent smokers. Smoking prevalences were similar among never, former and current snus users. Among the 30, 000 former smokers, 38 % of men and 64 % of women had never used snus. Longitudinal data showed a decline in total tobacco use from baseline until follow-up and this was mainly due to a smoking cessation rate of< 1 % a year. Snus use was started by 6. 2 % of the 30 -year-old women (age at baseline), and this contributed to a stable prevalence of total tobacco use in this group. Seventy percent of baseline snus users still used snus at follow-up. Among smokers, 55 % continued smoking, 12 % of men and 7 % of women switched to snus. Among those with dual tobacco use at baseline, a third of men and a fourth of women remained dual users 10 years later. Conclusion There are increasing differences in tobacco use between educational groups. Higher smoking and snus use prevalence are found among those with basic education, and this is most pronounced in the younger group of this middle-aged population. In spite of a higher prevalence of smoking without snus use among women, total smoking prevalence is similar in men and women due to a higher prevalence of dual tobacco use, i. e. snus and cigarettes, among men. The increase in snus use is being paralleled by a slight increase in dual use and the smoking prevalence {{does not seem to be}} influenced by snus.

40|$|Background: <b>Moist</b> <b>snuff</b> and snus are {{smokeless}} tobacco {{products that are}} marketed toward smokers for use at times smoking is prohibited. Little information is available about the nicotine content and design features of these products, particularly snus. Methods: Data on free nicotine levels and design features (pH, total nicotine content, tobacco leaf cut and flavor) of {{smokeless tobacco}} products were obtained from manufactures’ annual reports to Massachusetts Department of Public Health between 1997 and 2010. Descriptive statistics were provided overall, and by manufacturer and product type. Results: Mean level of free nicotine in <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> remained relatively constant {{within the range of}} 3 to 5 mg/g between 1997 and 2010, although this varies by manufacturer, brand, and design characteristics. Mean free nicotine was higher in snus than in <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> and increased over time. Average free nicotine content of Swedish Match snus increased sharply since 2003 and reached 3 ̆e 6 mg/g in 2010 while that of American brands of snus decreased from 2. 9 mg/g in 2001 to 1. 7 mg/g in 2010. Swedish Match snus had significantly higher pH than American brands of snus and <b>moist</b> <b>snuff,</b> and experienced a sharp increase from 7. 3 in 2003 to 8. 3 in 2010. Wide variations in nicotine and pH levels were present among manufacturers. Free nicotine level was associated with pH level of both snus and <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> products, and with tobacco leaf-cut for <b>moist</b> <b>snuff.</b> The number of sub-brands of both snus and <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> products increased during the study period. Conclusion: There was notable increasing trend in free nicotine concentration in Swedish Match snus that are marketed to US consumers.

(It {{should also be noted that}} the term smokeless tobacco itself is a broad one which, while generally referring to all tobacco products which do not require smoking (e.g. nasal snuff, chewing tobacco, snus, etc.), is popularly used to refer specifically to dipping tobacco.)

Methods: We identified individuals with biopsy-verified CD (villous atrophy, histopathology stage Marsh III) through biopsy-reports from Sweden's 28 pathology departments. Data on smoking and <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> were collected from the Swedish construction worker database "Bygghalsan" that includes preventive health care check-up data. Through poisson regression we calculated relative risks (RRs) for later CD according to smoking status (n = 305, 722), and <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> status (n = 199, 200) adjusting for age, sex and decade. Results: During follow-up 488 individuals with smoking data, and 310 with <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> data had a diagnosis of CD. The risk of CD was independent of smoking status with all RRs being statistically insignificant and ranging between 0. 9 and 1. 0. Compared to non-smokers, neither current smokers (RR = 0. 93; 95 % CI = 0. 76 - 1. 14) nor ex-smokers (RR = 0. 98; 95 % CI = 0. 75 - 1. 28) were at increased or decreased risk of CD.

The use of <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> had no effect on the risk of OOSCC, probably due to the low levels of tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines in Swedish <b>moist</b> <b>snuff.</b> OBJECTIVE: The aims of this population-based case-control study in southern Sweden were to establish risk estimates for cigarette and alcohol consumption and to evaluate whether Swedish <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> is a risk factor for OOSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September 2000 and January 2004, 132 / 165 consecutive cases (80 %) diagnosed with OOSCC and 320 / 396 matched controls (81 %) were investigated. All subjects were interviewed and examined according to a standardized protocol. RESULTS: Individuals who drank > or = 350 g of alcohol/week showed an increased risk of OOSCC (OR 2. 6; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 5. 4). Total lifetime consumption of tobacco for smoking (> 250 kg) had a dose-response effect on the risk of OOSCC (OR 4. 7; 95 % CI 2. 4 - 9. 1). We found no increased risk of OOSCC {{associated with the use of}} Swedish <b>moist</b> <b>snuff</b> (OR 1. 1; 95 % CI 0. 5 - 2. 5) ...|$|R
