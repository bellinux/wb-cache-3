5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
25|$|Tiger Woods had a {{dramatic}} return to competitive play after a scandal-ridden 20-week absence; {{he was in}} close contention throughout for the lead and finished tied with Choi for 4th at −11. Mickelson and others showed exciting play <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend,</b> <b>and</b> the 2010 Masters had strong television ratings in the United States, ranking third all-time to Woods's historic wins in 1997 and 2001. Mickelson's win left him second only to Woods in major championships among his competitive contemporaries, moving him ahead of Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Pádraig Harrington, with three major championships each and each, like Mickelson, with dozens of worldwide wins.|$|E

As of October 10, 2008, the film's domestic total stands at $102,491,776, with a much stronger international intake of $298,636,863. This brings its worldwide total to $401,128,639. It is the lowest-grossing film in The Mummy trilogy.|$|E
25|$|The protest was {{set into}} motion, however, {{by a group}} of four AWOL {{soldiers}} who turned themselves in the next day {{at the end of a}} large anti-war march in San Francisco, where the Presidio is located. The military had made attempts to prevent service members from participating in the march, ordering up mandatory formations and special maneuvers which would keep men on base. Nevertheless, a large contingent of several hundred active duty and reserve servicemen marched at the front of the parade. The four AWOL soldiers (Linden Blake, Keith Mather, Walter Pawlowski, and Randy Rowland), having been put in the stockade, met with prisoners <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> convinced them to participate in a protest over prisoner conditions and against the war.|$|E
25|$|On 6 September 2004, {{the names}} and identities of seven of the assailants became known, after {{forensic}} work <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> interviews with surviving hostages and a captured assailant. The forensic tests also established that 21 of the hostage-takers took heroin, Methamphetamine as well as morphine in a normally lethal amount; the investigation cited {{the use of drugs}} as a reason for the militants' ability to continue fighting despite being badly wounded and presumably in great pain. In November 2004, Russian officials announced that 27 of the 32 hostage-takers had been identified. However, in September 2005, the lead prosecutor against Nur-Pashi Kulayev stated that only 22 of the 32 bodies of the captors had been identified, leading to further confusion over which identities have been confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Each New Girl episode {{starts out}} as a pitch page, goes through stages of an outline and a final draft before being filmed and edited, a process which may take weeks. Each stage is {{approved}} by Meriwether and her co-showrunners, by the production company Chernin, the Fox studio and the Fox network. One group of writers works on alternate punchlines ("alts"), while another group rebreaks a draft until they find the funniest and most emotionally resonant version. All characters are tried to be tied into the story, and determining their motivation is the major goal so that people will laugh. Before taking the script to the table read with the whole cast on Tuesday, the main writers of an episode continue working on the draft <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> the executive producers polish it. During the first season, Meriwether usually made a final pass at the draft alone because of her film and theater background. The actors' performance influences new story ideas; the actors may also hand in story ideas.|$|E

500|$|Months later, {{starting}} on September 16, 1985, Rajneesh, {{who had recently}} emerged from a four-year period of public silence and self-imposed isolation (although he had continued to meet with his assistant) at the commune, convened press conferences: he stated that Sheela and 19 other commune leaders, including Puja, had left Rajneeshpuram <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> gone to Europe. He {{said that he had}} received information from commune residents that Sheela and her team had committed a number of serious crimes. Calling them a [...] "gang of fascists", he said they had tried to poison his doctor and Rajneesh's female companion, as well as the Jefferson County district attorney and the water system in The Dalles. He said that he believed they had poisoned a county commissioner and Judge William Hulse, and that they may have been responsible for the salmonellosis outbreak in The Dalles. He invited state and federal law enforcement officials to the Ranch to investigate. His allegations were initially greeted with skepticism by outside observers.|$|E

[...] William Goodman of Spin magazine was more critical and dismissive of the song, saying [...] "Wait Your Turn'...leaked online <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend,</b> <b>and</b> like the album's lead track, 'Russian Roulette,' it's a total let down: clunky, Auto-Tuned vocals repeat The wait is ova / The wait is ova ad nauseam, over dark atmospherics and a spare dub beat that fails to connect...it's certainly not worth the wait." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{founders of}} id Software {{met in the}} offices of Softdisk {{developing}} multiple games for Softdisk's monthly publishing. These included Dangerous Dave and other titles. In September 1990, John Carmack developed an efficient way that would perform rapid side-scrolling graphics on the PC. Upon making this breakthrough, Carmack and Hall stayed up late into the night making a replica of the first level of the popular 1988 NES game Super Mario Bros. 3, inserting stock graphics of Romero's Dangerous Dave character in lieu of Mario. When Romero saw the demo, entitled [...] "Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement", he realized that Carmack's breakthrough could have potential.

2500|$|Wisden {{suggested}} {{the vagaries of}} the English weather as the deciding factor in this match which, contrary to expectations, was won by England. Cool, damp conditions on the first three days favoured the seam bowlers who were able to make the ball [...] "swing freely". The main exponents were Basil D'Oliveira and Tony Greig (on debut) for England and Eddie Barlow for the World XI. Key innings were played by Clive Lloyd for the World and Ray Illingworth for England which left the match finely poised after completion of first innings, England having a slender lead of three runs. Barlow dominated proceedings on the Saturday and his defiant 142 accounted for virtually half his team's second innings total. D'Oliveira and Greig were again the best of the bowlers. The World innings ended on Monday morning and England had seven sessions in which to score 284. The weather had improved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> Monday was a bright day which produced a slow-paced pitch. Even so, England were still without Geoff Boycott and their batsmen proceeded with caution, especially Brian Luckhurst who batted for seven hours and played a [...] "dogged innings" [...] of 113 not out to see England home with four hours to spare on Tuesday.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{agreement}} signed on between on March 9 Afghanistan and the United States began a six-month transition from American to Afghan {{control of the}} Parwan Detention Facility north of Kabul and just outside Bagram, the largest US military base in the country. The US military handed control of the prison housing more than 3,000 Taliban fighters and terrorism suspects to the Afghan authorities in small ceremony on September 10, 2012, at which 16 prisoners, all wearing matching gray sweaters, were released. Army Col. Robert M. Taradash, who has overseen the prison, represented coalition forces. [...] "We transferred more than 3,000 Afghan detainees into your custody... and ensured that those who would threaten the partnership of Afghanistan and coalition forces will {{not return to the}} battlefield," [...] said Col Robert Taradash, the only US official at the ceremony. [...] "Our Afghan security forces are well trained and we are happy that today they are exercising their capability in taking the responsibility of prisoners independently and guarding the prisoners," [...] said acting Defence Minister Enayatullah Nazari. [...] "We are taking the responsibility from foreign forces." [...] "Now, the Bagram prison is converted to one of Afghanistan's regular prisons where the innocents will be freed {{and the rest of the}} prisoners will be sentenced according to the laws of Afghanistan," [...] a statement by Afghan President Hamid Karzai said, who didn't attend the ceremony. No one from the American Embassy or the State Department was present. Also top American commanders were absent on the ceremony. American officials say the transfer agreement calls for the Afghan government to continue to hold some detainees even if there is not a formal legal case against them, reviewing their cases administratively rather than judicially. The Americans say it is impossible to build legal cases against all prisoners arrested in battlefield conditions. Afghan news media reported that a dispute over this practice led to a falling-out between Karzai and General John R. Allen, the American military commander in Afghanistan, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> apparently prompted the downgraded American presence at the ceremony.|$|E

Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about.
