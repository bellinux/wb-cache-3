This made the currency less stable and, coupled with the emergence of the dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves, led the government to slash the Bretton Woods <b>official</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> from $4.03 to $2.80. This was a major event in Britain's decline from superpower status. With the country struggling to feed its people at home and those it was responsible for in war-torn Europe, it also caused the US to take a greater interest in Europe and push through the Marshall Plan for assistance to Britain and the continent. In addition, the winter is cited as the reason for the emigration of thousands of British people, particularly to Australia. The winter as a whole was less cold than the winter of 1963 but more snow was recorded.|$|E

Third, it also analyses the short-run dynamic responses of both markets to shocks. Finally, it tries to shed some light on the determinants of the market premium. Evidence of slow reversion to the long-run equilibrium is found. Further, it appears that capital controls and expected currency devaluation are the two main factors affecting the size of the premium and determining the breakdown in the proportionality relationship. black market and <b>official</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> panel cointegration, impulse response functions...|$|R
50|$|For example, if {{the value}} of the Mexican peso falls by half {{compared}} to the US dollar, the Mexican Gross Domestic Product measured in dollars will also halve. However, this <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> results from international trade and financial markets. It {{does not necessarily mean that}} Mexicans are poorer by a half; if incomes and prices measured in pesos stay the same, they will be no worse off assuming that imported goods are not essential to the quality of life of individuals. Measuring income in different countries using PPP <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> helps to avoid this problem. PPP <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> are especially useful when <b>official</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> are artificially manipulated by governments. Countries with strong government control of the economy sometimes enforce <b>official</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> that make their own currency artificially strong. By contrast, the currency's black market <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is artificially weak. In such cases, a PPP <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is likely the most realistic basis for economic comparison. Similarly, when <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> deviate significantly from their long term equilibrium due to speculative attacks or carry trade, a PPP <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> offers a better alternative for comparison.|$|R

Inflation in 1965 was 635%. In late 1965, the 'new rupiah' was brought in, at 1 new rupiah to 1,000 old rupiah.

25|$|Between 1970 and 1989, the <b>official</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{was fixed}} by the {{government}} through law. This exchange rate was used {{by the government}} to calculate the value of foreign trade, but foreign currency was not available to be bought and sold by private individuals. Owning or attempting to buy or sell foreign currency was a criminal offence, punishable with a prison sentence that could go up to 10 years (depending on the amount of foreign currency found under one's possession). International trade was therefore considered as part of another economic circuit than domestic trade, and given greater priority.|$|E

25|$|Until 2005, {{the value}} of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar. As China pursued its {{transition}} from central planning to a market economy, and increased its participation in foreign trade, the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry. It has previously been claimed that the renminbi's <b>official</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity. More recently, however, appreciation actions by the Chinese government, as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks, have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012. Since 2006, the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed base rate determined with reference to a basket of world currencies. The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the world's 8th most traded currency in 2013, and 5th by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Except during World War I Afghanistan's foreign {{exchange}} rate has been freely determined by market forces. However, for some periods, a dual exchange rate regime existed in Afghanistan: an <b>official</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> which was fixed by the Afghan Central Bank, and a free market exchange rate which {{was determined by the}} supply and demand forces in Kabul's money bazaar called Saraye Shahzada. For example, {{in order to avoid the}} seasonal fluctuations in the exchange rate, a fixed exchange rate was adopted in 1935 by the Bank-e Milli, which was then responsible for the country's exchange rate system and official reserves. Bank-e Milli agreed to exchange afghanis at 4 Afs against 1 Indian rupee in 1935. After the establishment of Da Afghanistan Bank as the Central Bank of Afghanistan, such a preferential official fixed exchange rate continued to be practiced. Although Da Afghanistan Bank tried to keep its official rate close to the Saraye Shahzada's exchange rate, the gap between the official and free-market exchange rates widened in the 1980s and during the civil war.|$|E
