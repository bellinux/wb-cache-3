5|$|The most {{important}} breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway {{has expanded to}} the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands. Although the small populations in these countries are of limited overall significance, the decline {{is a continuation of}} trend towards range contraction that has <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> last two centuries. The drop in numbers in Europe has been attributed to drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of formerly mown or grazed breeding sites and over-hunting.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{assigned}} {{in the early}} 1940s, replacing New York State Route17D, a route established {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It originally began in downtown Elmira and ended at the Pennsylvania state line in Chemung. NY427 was realigned on its east end in 1967 to meet the newly constructed exit59 on NY17 and on its west end in 1978 to follow what had been New York State Route379 through the town of Southport.

5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|With unity as an {{essential}} teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an administration they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> succession of authority, but any Bahá'í divisions have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following. The followers of such divisions are regarded as Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially excommunicated.|$|E

Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{favorable}} environment, Cindy remained disorganized, featuring an asymmetric -wide eye; {{little further}} strengthening <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{course of the}} night. Upon Cindy's landfall at High Island the following morning, its atmospheric pressure was measured at 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg), and winds reached 75mph (120km/h). Soon after moving ashore, Cindy became nearly stationary for 18hours, maintaining Category1 intensity before weakening to first to a tropical storm at 0600UTC on 18September then a tropical depression six hours later. The remnants of Cindy gradually turned westward-to-southwestward and decreased in strength during 18 and 19September. As {{a result of its}} abnormally slow movement and deterioration, extremely heavy rains were recorded over Texas and Louisiana, especially in the storm's northeastern quadrant. Cindy finally dissipated on 20September while situated west of Corpus Christi. It was the first hurricane to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1960.|$|E
5|$|Due to Nicole's {{atypical}} structure, {{the strongest}} thundershowers were well {{removed from the}} center; most of the weather activity <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> north-central Caribbean. In Jamaica, the storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288,000residences. Extreme precipitation of up to 37.42inches (940mm) caused disastrous flooding in several parishes, severely damaging or destroying 528 houses. The devastation extended to the island's farmland and environment, which suffered from expansive water pollution. In all, Nicole wrought an estimated $240million (2010USD) in damage throughout Jamaica, and there were sixteenfatalities. Elsewhere, minor flooding occurred in Cuba, Florida, and the Cayman Islands. The remnants of the storm contributed to a large disturbance along the East Coast of the United States, causing additional damage and deaths.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Doreen was {{considered}} the worst tropical cyclone to affect California in 32 years. The tenth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and second hurricane of the otherwise inactive 1977 Pacific hurricane season, it developed on August13. The depression tracked northwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Doreen later that day. Further strengthening <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> subsequent days, and Doreen attained its peak as a minimal hurricane early on August15. Executing a turn towards the north-northwest, Doreen made its first landfall as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale near Puerto San Carlos. Drifting offshore, Doreen made a second and final landfall near the northern portion of the Baja California as a tropical storm before rapidly weakening to a tropical depression. The tropical depression dissipated south of southern California on August18.|$|E

5|$|The British attack <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{night of}} 12/13 June 1944, when Major-General Richard Nelson Gale {{committed}} his only reserves, the 12th (Yorkshire) Parachute Battalion, a company from the 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment and the 22nd Independent Parachute Company. To support the attack, a tank squadron from the 13th/18th Royal Hussars and five regiments of artillery {{were assigned to}} the division. The assault had to negotiate both the British and German artillery fire, which killed or wounded several men, including some senior officers. The attackers eventually reached and secured the village. However, every officer or sergeant major {{who took part in the}} attack was killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|When {{there are}} few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, {{vigorous}} debates <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> relative importance of natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{followed}} his debut with Requiem for a Dream, a film based on Hubert Selby, Jr.'s {{novel of the}} same name. He was paid $50,000, and worked for three years with nearly the same production team as his previous film. Following the financial breakout of Pi, {{he was capable of}} hiring established actors, including Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, and received a budget of $3,500,000 to produce the film. Production of the film <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> period of one year, with the film being released in October 2000. The film went on to gross $7,390,108 worldwide. Aronofsky received acclaim for his stylish direction, and was nominated for another Independent Spirit Award, this time for Best Director. The film itself was nominated for five awards in total, winning two, for Best Actress and Cinematography. Clint Mansell's soundtrack for the film was also well-regarded, and since their first collaboration in 1996, Mansell has composed the music to every Aronofsky film. Ellen Burstyn was nominated for numerous awards, including for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the Independent Spirit Award. Aronofsky was awarded the PRISM Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the film's depiction of drug abuse.|$|E
