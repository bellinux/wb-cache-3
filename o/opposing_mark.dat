40|$|Chromatin is broadly {{compartmentalized}} in two defined states: euchromatin and heterochromatin. Generally, euchromatin is trimethylated on histone H 3 lysine 4 (H 3 K 4 me 3) while heterochromatin {{contains the}} H 3 K 9 me 3 mark. The H 3 K 9 me 3 modification is added by lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) such as SETDB 1. Herein, {{we show that}} SETDB 1 interacts with its substrate H 3, {{but only in the}} absence of the euchromatic mark H 3 K 4 me 3. In addition, we show that SETDB 1 fails to methylate substrates containing the H 3 K 4 me 3 mark. Likewise, the functionally related H 3 K 9 KMTs G 9 A, GLP and SUV 39 H 1 also fail to bind and to methylate H 3 K 4 me 3 substrates. Accordingly, we provide in vivo evidence that H 3 K 9 me 2 -enriched histones are devoid of H 3 K 4 me 2 / 3 and that histones depleted of H 3 K 4 me 2 / 3 have elevated H 3 K 9 me 2 / 3. The correlation between the loss of interaction of these KMTs with H 3 K 4 me 3 and concomitant methylation impairment leads to the postulate that at least these four KMTs require stable interaction with their respective substrates for optimal activity. Thus, novel substrates could be discovered via the identification of KMT interacting proteins. Indeed, we find that SETDB 1 binds to and methylates a novel substrate, the inhibitor of growth protein ING 2, while SUV 39 H 1 binds to and methylates the heterochromatin protein HP 1 α. Thus, our observations suggest a mechanism of post-translational regulation of lysine methylation and propose a potential mechanism for the segregation of the biologically <b>opposing</b> <b>marks,</b> H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 9 me 3. Furthermore, the correlation between H 3 -KMTs interaction and substrate methylation highlights that the identification of novel KMT substrates may be facilitated by the identification of interaction partners...|$|R

5|$|Ford often <b>opposed</b> {{governor}} <b>Mark</b> Sanford's political goals, arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly. He also opposed Sanford's goal {{to increase the number of}} roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford, stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety. The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members. Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} give an outline of the key events in the {{unfolding}} struggle in Mandela Park, Cape Town, South Africa, against evictions and disconnections from water and elec-tricity. It also seeks to situate this sketch of the emergence and trajectory of these struggles in a broader narrative about the Post-Apartheid State’s turn to neo-liberalism. We argue that, in certain instances, the increased political legitimacy of the State, consequent to the elite transition from apartheid to neo-liberalism, has enabled it to step-up attacks on the poor. Furthermore, we also argue {{that some of the}} new movements that have emerged to <b>oppose</b> neo-liberalism <b>mark</b> a new stage in the South African struggles: against the elitism of the ANC tradition, they believe that, in Fanon’s famous phrase, ‘the only magic hands are the hands of the people’.

Results showed no change in quadriceps cross-sectional area {{over the course of}} the study, however, significant improvements in force production for both limbs were achieved, accompanied by alteration in motor unit activity patterns to suggest that neural efficiency of motor unit activation (synchronization) may account for the improvements, as <b>opposed</b> to a <b>marked</b> morphological contribution...|$|R
40|$|Constitutive {{heterochromatin}} is a compact, transcriptionally inert structure {{formed in}} gene-poor and repeat- and transposon-rich regions. In Arabidopsis, constitutive heterochromatin {{is characterized by}} hypermethylated DNA and histone H 3 dimethylated at lysine (K) 9 (H 3 K 9 me 2) together with depletion of histone H 3 dimethylated at lysine 4 (H 3 K 4 me 2). Here, we describe loci with intermediate properties of heterochromatin in which transcription downregulation is inherited {{in a manner similar}} to constitutive heterochromatin, although the loci are associated with <b>opposing</b> histone <b>marks</b> [...] H 3 K 4 me 2 and H 3 K 9 me 2. In the ddm 1 (decrease in DNA methylation 1) mutants, their transcriptional activation is accompanied by the expected shift in the H 3 modifications [...] depletion of H 3 K 9 me 2 and enrichment in H 3 K 4 me 2. In mom 1 (Morpheus' molecule 1) mutants, however, a marked increase in transcription is not accompanied by detectable changes in the levels of H 3 K 4 me 2 and H 3 K 9 me 2. Therefore, transcriptional regulation in the intermediate heterochromatin involves two distinct epigenetic mechanisms. Interestingly, silent transgenic inserts seem to acquire properties characteristic of the intermediate heterochromatin...|$|R
50|$|Joining Parramatta Eels {{along with}} his defecting {{teammates}} in 1996 following year {{in order to remain}} with the ARL competition, Smith's representative career continued for Queensland and Australia (against Papua New Guinea) but his 1997 season was ruined by injury. At Parramatta, Smith's commitment never wavered despite a succession of injuries. In three successive preliminary finals (1998-00), the Eels faltered at the last hurdle to making the grand final and too often the young club's fortunes rested on his shoulders. In 1998, with rugby league re-united, Smith played in the final two Tests of the Trans-Tasman series, alongside his brother Darren, and was chosen as lock in the first international the following year, Australia's 20-14 win over New Zealand. In Game III of the 1999 State of Origin series, Smith was cleared of a controversial high tackle on <b>opposing</b> forward <b>Mark</b> Carroll that left the Blues' prop heavily concussed. (Later it was revealed that Carroll's own hand, which he raised in a reflex action to protect himself in Smith's ball and all tackle, had struck him and done most of the damage). Smith's 1999 NRL season concluded with three Test appearances in Australia's victorious 1999 Tri-nations series win against New Zealand and Great Britain in Auckland.|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{began their}} League Cup {{campaign}} in the third round, drawn at home to Newcastle United. They made nine changes from the previous starting XI – Eduardo paired up with Bendtner in the front two. Bendtner scored the opening goal seven minutes {{from the end of}} normal time; Denílson added a second goal to ensure Arsenal's progression. Fourth-round opponents Sheffield United were easier to defeat, with Eduardo scoring a brace (two goals). The quarter-final pitted Arsenal away to Blackburn Rovers, in a match played on 18 December 2007. Diaby gave Arsenal the lead with a volley after six minutes and Eduardo extended the lead, before Roque Santa Cruz pulled a goal back for Blackburn, three minutes {{from the end of the}} first half. Santa Cruz scored the equaliser and his second of the match, heading in a cross by David Bentley. In stoppage time, Denílson was sent off for a two-footed challenge on Dunn. In spite of playing with one less player, Arsenal regained the lead. Alex Song passed the ball to Eduardo, who held off his opponent Ryan Nelsen and with minimal effort placed it past Brad Friedel. The performance prompted Wenger to assert that his team could win the cup, while <b>opposing</b> manager <b>Mark</b> Hughes commented that Arsenal's blend of young players were capable of following in the footsteps of Manchester United's fledglings, managed by Alex Ferguson.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnrestricted somatic {{stem cells}} (USSC) from human cord blood display a broad {{differentiation}} potential for ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal cell types. The molecular basis for these stem cell properties is unclear and unlike {{embryonic stem cells}} (ESC) none of the major stem cell factors OCT 4, SOX 2, and NANOG exhibits significant expression in USSC. Here, we report that these key stem cell genes hold an epigenetic state in between that of an ESC and a terminally differentiated cell type. DNA methylation analysis exhibits partial demethylation of the regulatory region of OCT 4 and a demethylated state of the NANOG and SOX 2 promoter/enhancer regions. Further genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identified a partially demethylated state of the telomerase gene hTERT. Moreover, none of the pluripotency factors exhibited a repressive histone signature. Notably, SOX 2 exhibits a bivalent histone signature consisting of the <b>opposing</b> histone <b>marks</b> dimeH 3 K 4 and trimeH 3 K 27, which is typically found on genes that are "poised" for transcription. Consequently, ectopic expression of OCT 4 in USSC led to rapid induction of expression of its known target gene SOX 2. Our data suggest that incomplete epigenetic repression and a "poised" epigenetic status of pluripotency genes preserves the USSC potential {{to be able to}} react adequately to distinct differentiation and reprogramming cues...|$|R
