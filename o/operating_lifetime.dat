2500|$|The engine <b>operating</b> <b>lifetime</b> of 50 hours was {{severely}} decreased {{due to the}} shortages of strategic material especially in metals for ferritic heat-resistant steel with addition of silicon or aluminium, that could resist high temperature up to 1700° Celsius.

While BMW's and Junkers' axial compressor turbojet engines were characterised by a sophisticated design that could offer considerable advantage - also used in a generalized form for the contemporary American Westinghouse J30 turbojet - the lack of rare materials for the Jumo 004 design put it at a severe disadvantage compared to the [...] "partly axial-flow" [...] Power Jets W.2/700 turbojet engine which, despite its own largely centrifugal compressor-influenced design (unlike either production German axial-flow jet engine), provided an operational life span of 125 hours.

2500|$|Through the 1970s the {{hand-held}} electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green vacuum fluorescent displays consumed a lot {{of power}} and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) were in their infancy and {{there was a great deal}} of concern that they only had a short <b>operating</b> <b>lifetime.</b> Busicom introduced the Busicom LE-120A [...] "HANDY" [...] calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an LED display, and announced the Busicom LC with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by Rockwell International and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking LC-800, Harden DT/12, Ibico 086, Lloyds 40, Lloyds 100, Prismatic 500 (a.k.a. P500), Rapid Data Rapidman 1208LC. The LCDs were an early form using the Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.|$|E
