40|$|Reproductive {{competition}} in social insects is generally mediated through specific fertility pheromones. By analysing Dufour's gland secretion in queens and workers of Bombus terrestris under varying social conditions, we demonstrate {{here that the}} volatile constituents of the secretion exhibit a context-dependent composition. The secretion of egg-laying queens is composed {{of a series of}} aliphatic hydrocarbons (alkanes and alkenes), while that of sterile workers contains in addition <b>octyl</b> <b>esters,</b> dominated by <b>octyl</b> hexadecanoate and <b>octyl</b> oleate. These <b>esters</b> disappear in workers with developed ovaries, whether queenright (QR) or queenless (QL), rendering their secretion queen-like. This constitutes an unusual case in which the sterile caste, rather than the fertile one, possesses extra components. Individually isolated (socially deprived) workers developed ovaries successfully, but failed to oviposit, and still possessed the <b>octyl</b> <b>esters.</b> Thus, whereas social interactions are not needed in order to develop ovaries, they appear essential for oviposition and compositional changes in Dufour's gland secretion (ester disappearance). The apparent link between high ester levels and an inability to lay eggs lends credence to the hypothesis that these esters signal functional sterility. We hypothesize that by producing a sterility-specific secretion, workers signal that ‘I am out of the competition’, and therefore are not attacked, either by the queen or by the reproductive workers. This enables proper colony function and brood care, in particular sexual brood, even under the chaotic conditions of the competition phase...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{aliphatic}} esters of the NSAID naproxen (NAP) were synthesised and encapsulated in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) {{to evaluate the}} influence of lipophilicity on drug loading and release, as well as physicochemical properties and stability of SLN. The lipophilicity of esters mainly showed to influence their affinity for the solid lipid matrix, modifying the drug release profile compared to the parent drug, whereas drug encapsulation efficiency and the technological properties and stability of SLN were not affected. After storage at room temperature the in vitro release profiles of esters changed with respect to freshly prepared systems, depending on the lipophilicity of the dispersed derivative. In particular, the SLN containing the medium-chain hexyl and <b>octyl</b> <b>esters</b> showed a 70 - 80 % increase of drug release after storage; SLN loaded with NAP or the lower ethyl and butyl esters did not show {{significant changes in the}} drug release rate. Such findings reveal that the affinity of NAP esters for the lipid network of the nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their lipophilicity and an excessive increase of the latter negatively influences the allocation and retention on these com-pounds in the nanoparticles...|$|R

Octyl glucuronate adsorbs the fastest at the air-water interface whereas glucose octanoate reduces the dynamic surface tension at the lowest value and exhibits the highest film viscoelasticity.

40|$|Objectives Phenolic {{antioxidants}} {{are currently}} attracting a growing interest as potential therapeutic agents to counteract diseases associated with oxidative stress. However, their high hydrophilicity {{results in a}} poor bioavailability hindering the development of efficient antioxidant strategies. A promising way to overcome this is to increase their hydrophobicity by lipophilic moiety grafting to form the newly coined 'phenolipids'. Although hydrophobicity is generally considered as advantageous regarding antioxidant properties, it is nevertheless worth investigating whether increasing hydrophobicity necessarily leads to a more efficient antioxidant drug. Methods To answer this question, the antioxidant capacity of a homologous series of phenolics (chlorogenic acid and its methyl, butyl, octyl, dodecyl and hexadecyl esters) toward mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in a ROS-overexpressing fibroblast cell line was investigated using 2, 7 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein. Key findings Overall, the long chain esters (dodecyl and hexadecyl esters) were more active than the short ones (methyl, butyl, and <b>octyl</b> <b>esters),</b> with an optimal activity for dodecyl chlorogenate. Moreover, dodecyl chlorogenate exerted a strong antioxidant capacity, for concentration and incubation time below the cytotoxicity threshold, making it a promising candidate for further in-vivo studies. More importantly, {{we found that the}} elongation of the chain length from 12 to 16 carbons led unexpectedly to a 45 % decrease of antioxidant capacity. Conclusion The understanding of this sudden collapse of the antioxidant capacity through the cut-off theory will be discussed in this article, and may contribute towards development of a rational approach to design novel amphiphilic antioxidant drugs, especially phenolipids with medium fatty chain.

40|$|Benzotriazole (BTAH) {{has been}} used as a {{corrosion}} inhibitor for copper and copper-, based alloys for more than 40 years. It has been successfully employed for the, prevention of both atmospheric corrosion and particularly for the protection of, copper under immersed conditions. Whilst BTAH is an excellent inhibitor in alkaline, solution its efficiency drops off markedly as the pH decreases. It was hypothesized, that a possible way to increase surface adsorption and subsequent better inhibition, over a wide pH range might be through the preparation of derivatives, particularly, carboxybenzotriazoles and alkyl esters of these compounds. In this work the following techniques: weight loss measurements, potentiodynamic, polarisation, SERS spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and, coulometry were employed to investigate the inhibition efficiency of 4 - and 5 -, carboxybenzotriazole and their alkyl ester for copper corrosion. Molecular modelling, was also investigated as a tool for inhibitor design. Studies on 4 - and 5 - carboxybenzotriazole (CBT) showed that the inhibition, efficiency for copper corrosion in aerated acidic sulphate solution of each isomer was, pH, concentration and time dependant. At lower pH the 5 -isomer is the better, inhibitor and this behaviour continues at higher pH. The anti-tarnishing test showed, that whilst both isomers exhibited these properties, 5 -CBT was once again the, superior inhibitor. It was found that a commercial mixture of the <b>octyl</b> <b>esters</b> of 4 - and 5 -, carboxybenzotriazole inhibits copper corrosion in sulphate environments open to air., The inhibition efficiency of the ester mixture at the lx 10 - 4 M level (pH - 0) is 98...|$|R

40|$|Fundamental {{analytical}} pyrolysis {{studies of}} biomass from Polar seaweeds, which exhibit a different biomass composition than terrestrial and micro-algae biomass were performed via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass-spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The {{main reason for}} {{this study is the}} adaptation of these species to very harsh environments making them an interesting source for thermo-chemical processing for bioenergy generation and production of biochemicals via intermediate pyrolysis. Several macroalgal species from the Arctic region Kongsfjorden, Spitsbergen/Norway (Prasiola crispa, Monostroma arcticum, Polysiphonia arctica, Devaleraea ramentacea, Odonthalia dentata, Phycodrys rubens, Sphacelaria plumosa) and from the Antarctic peninsula, Potter Cove King George Island (Gigartina skottsbergii, Plocamium cartilagineum, Myriogramme manginii, Hymencladiopsis crustigena, Kallymenia antarctica) were investigated under intermediate pyrolysis conditions. TGA of the Polar seaweeds revealed three stages of degradation representing dehydration, devolatilization and decomposition of carbonaceous solids. The maximum degradation temperatures Prasiola crispa were observed within the range of 220 - 320 C and are lower than typically obtained by terrestrial biomass, due to divergent polysaccharide compositions. Biochar residues accounted for 33 - 46 % and ash contents of 27 - 45 % were obtained. Identification of volatile products by Py-GC/MS revealed a complexity of generated chemical compounds and significant differences between the species.

40|$|Phosphocitrate is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of hydroxyapatite formation with demonstrated efficacy in preventing the progression of calcific pathologies in animal models. In the present studies, the oral bioavailability of phosphocitrate was investigated following administration of the compound by gavage in rats. Using a calcergic model, inhibitory action by phosphocitrate was evaluated. Accordingly, the formation of small subcutaneous calcific plaques was chemically induced. Parameters measured included plaque weight, calcium, and phosphorus content. The oral and intraperitoneal routes of administration were compared and dose-response relationships established. Phosphocitrate was found capable of reducing calcific plaque formation when delivered by either route. However reduced bioavailability was apparent following administration by gavage revealing the oral route to be approximately 45 times less effective on a dose-weight basis than the intraperitoneal route. The possibility that poor absorption from the small intestine {{was responsible for the}} observed differences was explored. Transport studies using everted sacs and in situ ligated loops confirmed phosphocitrate absorption. The data revealed concentration-dependance and the absence of in vitro intestinal transfer at the lowest concentration (1 mM) trialled. Further studies were necessary to evaluate the extent of phosphocitrate absorption from the small intestine. Experiments with radiolabelled phosphocitrate and using an in situ perfusion technique with hepatic portal vein cannulation yielded additional information. The studies provided conclusive evidence that limited amounts of intact phosphocitrate were being absorbed. First pass metabolism to citric acid was observed but this metabolism was not commensurate with the poor rate of absorption. Studies utilising tricarballylate, a known inhibitor of tricarboxylic acid transport in the intestine, indicated that the disappearance of phosphocitrate from the intestinal lumen was not affected by the presence of this transport inhibitor. Consideration of this and everted sac data gave credence to the suggestion that phosphocitrate transport did not involve an established tricarboxylic acid transporter. A preliminary investigation was made into the possibility of improving the oral bioavailability of phosphocitrate with aliphatic ester prodrugs of phosphocitrate. Initially the approach was to investigate the synthesis and ultimate benefit of short (ethyl) and medium chain (<b>octyl)</b> <b>esters.</b> The triethyl ester of phosphocitrate was synthesised and trialled but the isolation and purification of the trioctyl ester was not possible within the time frame of these studies.

Triethyl phosphocitrate was prepared in an attempt to improve the transport characteristics of phosphocitrate. Plaque calcification was not reduced following the administration of this ester.

40|$|AbstractFor {{environmental}} reasons, {{as well as}} {{the dwindling}} source of petroleum, a new class of environmentally acceptable and renewable biolubricants based on plant oils is available. Even though plant oils possess excellent lubricant-related properties, there are some concerns about using it as biolubricant base oil. In this study we present a series of structures derived from oleic acid to be used as synthetic biolubricant basestocks. Measuring of pour point (PP), flash point, viscosity index (VI), oxidation onset temperature (OT) and signal maximum temperature (SMT) was carried out for each compound. Furthermore, the friction and wear properties were measured using a high-frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR). The resulting product structures were confirmed by NMR and FTIR spectroscopic analysis. The results showed that ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(behenoxy) octadecanoate with behenyl mid-chain ester exhibited the most favorable low temperature performance (PP − 48 °C) and ethylhexyl 9 -(octanoyloxy) - 10 -(octyloxy) octadecanoate <b>octyl</b> mid-chain <b>ester</b> exhibited higher oxidation stability (OT 142 °C) than the other synthetic ester oils.

40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{activities of}} 5 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid (5 -CQA) and of methyl, butyl, <b>octyl,</b> and dodecyl <b>esters</b> or 5 -CQA, were tested on five toxigenic moulds from the Aspergillus genus (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus nomius, Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus westerdijkiae). These mycotoxin producers' moulds may contaminate {{many types of}} food crops throughout the food chain posing serious health hazard to animals and humans. The use of chemical methods to decrease mycotoxin producer moulds contamination on food crops in the field, during storage, and/or during processing, has been proved to be efficient. In this work, the antifungal effect of 5 -CQA and a homologous series of 5 -CQA <b>esters</b> (methyl, butyl, <b>octyl,</b> dodecyl), was investigated using the microdilution method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC 50 and MIC 80). All molecules presented antifungal activity, and two esters showed a MIC for all fungi: octyl (MIC 50 _ 0. 5 e 0. 75 mg/mL, MIC 80 ¼ 1. 0 e 1. 5 mg/mL) and dodecyl (MIC 50 ¼ 0. 75 e 1. 25 mg/mL) chlorogenates. Dodecyl chlorogenate showed a MIC 80 (1. 5 mg/mL) only for A. parasiticus. The maximum percent of growth inhibition on aspergillii was observed with octyl (78. 4 e 92. 7 %) and dodecyl (54. 5 e 83. 7 %) chlorogenates, being octyl chlorogenate the most potent antifungal agent. It was thus concluded that lipophilization improved the antifungal properties of 5 -CQA, which increased with the ester alkyl chain length, exhibiting a cut-off effect at 8 carbons. As far as we know, {{it is the first}} report demonstrating that lipophilization may improve the antifungal activity of 5 -CQA on five toxigenic moulds from the Aspergillus genus. Lipophilization would be a novel way to synthesize a new kind of antifungal agents with a good therapeutic value or a potential use as preservative in food or cosmetics. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

However, {{there is a}} need for combinatorial and high-throughput screening methods to systematically screen cell-biomaterial interactions in three-dimensional (3 D) tissue scaffolds for tissue engineering. Previously, we developed a two-syringe pump approach for making 3 D scaffold gradients for use in combinatorial screening of salt-leached scaffolds. Herein, we demonstrate that the two-syringe pump approach can also be used to create scaffold gradients using a gas-foaming approach. Macroporous foams prepared by a gas-foaming technique are commonly used for fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds due to their high interconnectivity and good mechanical properties. Gas-foamed scaffold gradient libraries were fabricated from two biodegradable tyrosine-derived polycarbonates: poly(desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine ethyl ester carbonate) (pDTEc) and poly(desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine <b>octyl</b> <b>ester</b> carbonate) (pDTOc).

40|$|The {{structure}} of the carbohydrate chain of kangshuanmei, a thrombin-like serine protease isolated from Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus stejneger snake venom, was determined. The carbohydrate content of the kangshuanmei was 18 %. The sugar composition was analyzed by the acid hydrolysis followed by aminobenzoic ethyl ester labeling. Galactose, N-acetylglucosamin, mannose, and fucose were detected, indicating that the binding carbohydrate chain is asparagine-linked type oligosaccharides. N-Acetylneuraminic acid located at non-reduced terminal of the carbohydrate chain was identified by neuraminidase digestion. The carbohydrate chain moiety was separated from kangshuanmei by hydrazynolysis treatment followed by aminobenzoic <b>octyl</b> <b>ester</b> (ABOE) labeling. The isolated ABOEmodified carbohydrate chain was compared to the asparagine-linked type standard oligosaccharides. The carbohydrate chains were consisted of sialylated bi(39. 4 %) -, tri(50. 4 %) - and tetra(10. 2 %) - antennary lactosamins complex containing fucose.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Malaria {{is caused}} by the Plasmodium sp. {{parasite}} that infects the red blood cells. Of the four types of malaria, the most serious type is transmitted by Plasmodium falciparum species. It can be life threatening. The other types of malaria (P. vivale, P. ovale and P. malariae) are generally less serious and are not life threatening. The existence of malaria as an enemy of humankind certainly predates written history. For thousands of years malaria has been a deadly scourge, and it remains one today. From American president John Adams who nearly succumbed to malaria in Amsterdam while on a diplomatic mission, back down to the timeline to the early Chinese, Indians, Greeks and Romans, malaria has not spared its victims, rich or poor. It wasn’t until the 19 th Century that information about the true cause of malaria became known. Yet despite this knowledge, malaria still ravages Sub–Saharan Africa, South–East Asia and Latin America, taking as its victim’s mainly young children and pregnant women. However, without certain discoveries leading {{to a better understanding of}} malaria, new groundbreaking work wouldn’t be possible. Artemisinin and its derivatives are developing into a very important new class of antimalarial and their usage is becoming more common in the fight against malaria. The most commonly used and applied of these derivatives are artesunate, artemether, arteether and dihydroartemisinin. The discovery of artemisinin as the pharmacological active ingredient in an age old Chinese herb, Artemisia annua, was a major breakthrough in malaria chemotherapy. Discovery of qinghaosu in the 1970 s sparked a new age for chemotherapy of malaria, and greatly inspired further research on organic peroxides. This generated widespread interest and led to the design and synthesis of organic peroxides into a highly active area of organic chemistry. The artemisinin derivatives act quickly and are eliminated quickly. Their rapid onset makes them especially effective against severe malaria. Their rapid disappearance may be a key reason why artemisinin resistance has been so slow to develop, and may be the reason why recrudences are so common when these drugs are used in monotherapy. Since their isolation, artemisinins have had a substantial impact on the treatment of malaria. Although very potent, the use of artemisinins as prophylactic antimalarials is not recommended. The aim of this study was to synthesise ester derivatives of artemisinin, determine certain physicochemical properties such as aqueous solubility and partition coefficient, and to evaluate their antimalarial activity in comparison to dihydroartemisinin and chloroquine. In this study eight esters of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) were synthesised by substitution at C– 10. The structures of the prepared derivatives were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). The new artemisinin esters were tested in vitro against the chloroquine sensitive strain of Plasmodium falciparum (D 10). All the compounds tested showed activity against the D 10 strain. All of the esters showed potency significantly better than chloroquine, except the <b>octyl</b> and decyl <b>esters</b> which were less active. The reason for the low activity could be ascribed to the fact that these two esters are both water immiscible oils, leading to solubility problems. The ethyl, butyl, phenyl and p–nitrophenyl esters all had similar IC 50 values making their activity similar. The lowest IC 50 value was displayed by the butyl ester with a value of 3. 2 x 10 – 3 uM. The poorest activity was recorded by the two oils, the <b>octyl</b> and decyl <b>esters,</b> with IC 50 values of 38 x 10 – 3 uM and 90. 2 x 10 – 3 uM respectively. All other compounds showed less antimalarial potency against the D 10 strain compared with the other reference drug dihydroartemisinin, except the butyl ester. The butyl ester 12 displayed activity comparable to that of DHA (IC 50; 3. 2 x 10 – 3 uM versus 3. 8 x 10 – 3 uM), and is thus worthwhile being further investigated in terms of pharmacokinetics in order to determine its half–life. Statistically it is impossible to make structure–activity relationship (SAR) deductions from the data received as the number of compounds in the series is too small. The butyl (12) (IC 50 = 3. 2 uM), 4 –nitrobenzyl (16) (IC 50 = 15 uM), 2 –(acetyloxy) acetyl (17) (IC 50 = 8. 6 uM), and 2 –phenylacetyl (18) (IC 50 = 12. 4 uM) esters showed on a 0. 05 level statistically significantly better activity against the chloroquine sensitive D 10 strain of Plasmodium falciparum than chloroquine itself while the decyl ester (14) (IC 50 = 90. 2 uM) was statistically significantly less potent. The activity of the octyl (13) (IC 50 = 38. 0 uM) and benzyl (15) (IC 50 = 25. 7 uM) esters did not differ from that of chloroquine. In comparison to dihydroartemisinin the propyl (11) (IC 50 = 24. 1 uM), octyl (13) (IC 50 = 38. 0 uM), decyl (14) (IC 50 = 90. 0 uM), and benzyl (15) (IC 50 = 25. 7 uM) esters proved to be statistically significantly less potent than DHA while the activity of the butyl (12) (IC 50 = 3. 2 uM), 4 – nitrobenzyl (16) (IC 50 = 15. 3 uM), 2 –(acetyloxy) acetyl (17) (IC 50 = 8. 6 uM), and 2 –phenylacetyl (18) (IC 50 = 12. 4 uM) esters did not differ from that of DHA.

Multivariate data treatments were applied to a matrix including sorption values and herbicide parameters calculated with molecular mechanics software. The sorption patterns depended on the herbicide structure and form, {{as well as on}} humic acid concentration in the soil. In general, application rates higher than 5 g kg- 1 were required for systematic enhancement of herbicide sorption compared to untreated soil. Whereas solvation energies and energies due to van der Waals, bond stretching and dipole interactions were molecular descriptors useful to forecast the sorption of phenoxy-carboxylics on the soil, we found that herbicide sorption was chiefly governed by molecular parameters such as the molecular volume, the alkylation degree, the O/C atomic ratio, the polar surface area and the heat formation of the herbicide molecule.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the pharmacological effect of Bupi Yichang (BPYX) pill on colonic contraction of rats and explore its underlying mechanism. Methods: The experiments {{were performed on}} colonic longitudinal smooth muscle strips (CLSMs) under isometric conditions. CLSMs suspended in tissue chambers were stimulated by KCl (80  mM) or acetylcholine (ACh, 0. 1  mM), or exhausting intracellular Ca 2 + and internal flow of extracellular Ca 2 + to induce muscle contraction and their responses to different doses of BPYX pill were observed. After that, incubation with different inhibitors was conducted to verify its underlying mechanism. Results: Bupi Yichang pill dose-dependently and reversibly inhibited colonic contraction.

There is particular interest in treating cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic illness caused by deficient anion transport. Previous work has found that anionophore designs featuring axial ureas on steroid and trans-decalin scaffolds can be especially effective. Here we show that replacement of ureas by thioureas yields substantial further enhancements. Six new bis-thioureas have been prepared and tested for Cl(-) /NO 3 (-) exchange in 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoylphosphatidylcholine/cholesterol large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). The bis-thioureas are typically > 10 times {{more effective than the}} corresponding ureas and are sufficiently active that transport by molecules acting singly in LUVs is readily detected. The highest activity is shown by decalin 9, which features N-(3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) thioureido and <b>octyl</b> <b>ester</b> substituents. A single molecule of transporter 9 in a 200 nm vesicle promotes Cl(-) /NO 3 (-) exchange with a half-life of 45 s and an absolute rate of 850 chloride anions per second.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} of a membrane-bound tryptophan derivative (tryptophan <b>octyl</b> <b>ester,</b> TOE) {{has been}} examined {{as a model}} for tryptophan fluorescence from proteins in membrane environments. The depth-dependent fluorescence quenching of TOE by brominated lipids was found to proceed via a dynamic mechanism with vertical fluctuations playing {{a central role in the}} process. The activation energy for the quenching was estimated to be 1. 3 kcal/mole. The data were analyzed using the distribution analysis (DA) method, which extends the conventional parallax method to account more realistically for the transbilayer distributions of both probe and quencher and for possible variations in the probe's accessibility. DA provides a better fit than the parallax method to data collected with TOE in membranes formed of lipids brominated at either the 4, 5, the 6, 7, the 9, 10, or the 11, 12 positions of the sn- 2 acyl chain. DA yields information on the fluorophore's most probable depth in the membrane, its conformational heterogeneity, and its accessibility to the lipid phase.

Responses affected include superoxide generation and release of lysozyme. The degree {{and type of}} inhibition was dependent on the individual receptor and the cellular response studied. Measurement of intracellular calcium levels with quin- 2 showed that both fMet-Leu-Phe- and platelet-activating factor-mediated increases in quin- 2 fluorescence were diminished {{as a result of}} pertussis toxin treatment. fMet-Leu-Phe-mediated calcium uptake was also inhibited. However, under conditions where fMet-Leu-Phe-mediated effects on cell function were completely abolished, only a partial inhibition of 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxybenzoic acid 8 -(diethylamino) <b>octyl</b> <b>ester</b> (TMB- 8) sensitive calcium uptake was observed. A study of the linked reactions of chemotaxis, capping, and shape change revealed that chemotaxis was inhibited regardless of the chemoattractant utilized (zymosan-treated serum, fMet-Leu-Phe, and platelet-activating factor) and the associated reactions of Con A capping and fMet-Leu-Phe- or Con A-mediated shape change were reduced in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Our results suggest that multiple mediators of inflammation act through a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein that regulates the mobilization of internal calcium as well as calcium uptake and is, in addition, a key control element of shape change, capping, and chemotaxis...|$|E

To further examine the interaction of TMB- 8 with the AChR, the compound was tested as a competitor for the binding of two NCAs of the Torpedo californica AChR, phencyclidine and 3 -trifluoromethyl- 3 -(m[125 I]iodophenyl) diazirine, for which the binding to the AChR has been pharmacologically well character-ized and a channel binding loci has been established. TMB- 8 fully inhibited specific photoincorporation of 3 -trifluoromethyl- 3 -(m[125 I]iodophenyl) diazirine into the resting AChR channel (IC 50 5 3. 1 mM) and inhibited high-affinity [3 H]phencyclidine binding to the desensitized AChR (IC 50 5 2. 4 mM). We conclude that TMB- 8 is a potent NCA of the nicotinic AChR, interacting with the resting, open-channel, and desensitized channel conformations.

The present results revealed that lysosomal destabilization was involved in the early stage of cell apoptosis in HepG 2 cells induced by Rh 2 -O. Rh 2 -O could induce an early lysosomal membrane permeabilization with the release of lysosomal protease cathepsins to the cytosol in HepG 2 cells. The Cat B inhibitor (leu) and Cat D inhibitor (pepA) inhibited Rh 2 -O-induced HepG 2 apoptosis as well as tBid production and Δφm depolarization, indicating that lysosomal permeabilization occurred upstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, Rh 2 -O induced {{a significant increase in the}} protein levels of DRAM 1 and Bax (p < 0. 05) in lysosomes of HepG 2 cells.
