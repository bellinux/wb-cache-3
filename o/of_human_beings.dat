40|$|Aristotle's virtue {{ethics is}} a teleological ethics, namely, for him, {{the purpose of}} {{achieving}} moral virtues by <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> is to obtain eudaimonia. The best interpretation of eudaimonia in Aristotle is human flourishing that is the main axis of Aristotle's ethics and also contemporary virtue ethics. Aristotle's analysis <b>of</b> <b>human</b> flourishing that is performed in biological context {{is based on the}} concept of ergon or function. Therefore, Aristotle, in description <b>of</b> <b>human</b> flourishing, emphasizes on the exclusive function <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> For Aristotle the proper function <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> is not only nutrition, development, and reproduction because these are common between <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> on the one hand, and animals and planets, on the other hand. Hence, it rests the rational activity that is the exclusive function <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> This activity is to be in conformity with the best and most perfect virtue. Philippa Foot, {{one of the most important}} contemporary philosophers of virtue ethics, presents an analysis <b>of</b> <b>human</b> flourishing through achieving moral values that in despite of its similarities has important differences to Aristotle's analysis. In description <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> Foot emphasizes extremely on the biological aspect <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> in relation to Aristotle. Thus, he neglects of the other proper characteristics <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> This problem brings about some difficulties and ambiguities in Foot's analysis <b>of</b> <b>human</b> flourishing and makes her view encounter with serious criticism...|$|R

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on {{what can be done}} to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E

40|$|The article {{looks at}} {{different}} understandings <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and their {{implications for the}} understanding of sport. One of the fundamental shifts in the understanding <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being</b> occurs in {{the transition from the}} ancient to modern times. The main characteristic of the ‘classical’ view <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> is its teleological character: we know fully what something is only when we know what it is like in its final perfection. This is diametrically opposed to the axiom which dominates our modern scientific culture: we understand what something is when we know what it is made of and how it came to be. Therefore, the final aim of the ‘classical’ view is perfection <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> and final aim of the ‘modern’ view is preservation of oneself. This distinction can be used to differentiate two different understandings of contemporary sport. ‘Classical’ sport may be estimated as idealistic and the ‘modern’ as realistic or even pragmatic. The first is based on a teleological understanding <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and accordingly sport is also understood as a means to fulfill <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and help him to attain perfection. The basic idea is the same as idea in theories which see sport as an important mean for human education. On the other hand the modern understanding of sport does not see the final aim of sport in perfection <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> but in self-preservation. This can be recognized in those sport activities which see the aim of sport in the preservation of health, regulation of body weight or anti stress re-creation...|$|R

5|$|The Augustinian theodicy {{supports}} {{the notion of}} original sin. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the Genesis creation narrative, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil {{is believed to be}} a just punishment for the fall of man: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the Garden of Eden. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for moral evil: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.|$|E

5|$|Great auks {{walked slowly}} and {{sometimes}} used their wings {{to help them}} traverse rough terrain. When they did run, it was awkwardly and with short steps in a straight line. They had few natural predators, mainly large marine mammals, such as the orca and white-tailed eagles. Polar bears preyed on nesting colonies of the great auk. Reportedly, this species had no innate fear <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> and their flightlessness and awkwardness on land compounded their vulnerability. Humans preyed upon them as food, for feathers, and as specimens for museums and private collections. Great auks reacted to noises, but were rarely frightened {{by the sight of}} something. They used their bills aggressively both in the dense nesting sites and when threatened or captured by humans. These birds are believed to have had a life span of approximately 20 to 25 years. During the winter, the great auk migrated south, either in pairs or in small groups, but never with the entire nesting colony.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned with feeling than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E

By {{that time it was}} generally thought {{that the end of the}} last glacial period marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings in his Antiquity of Man to put the origin <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell wrote that it remained a profound mystery how the huge gulf between man and beast could be bridged. Lyell's vivid writing fired the public imagination, inspiring Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and Louis Figuier's 1867 second edition of La Terre avant le déluge ("Earth before the Flood"), which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the Garden of Eden shown in the 1863 edition.|$|E
