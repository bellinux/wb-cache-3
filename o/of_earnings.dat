A large proportion of the increased share of females among top earners is accounted for by the mending of, what we refer to as, the paper floor — the phenomenon whereby female top earners were much more likely than male top earners {{to drop out of the}} top percentiles.

40|$|This study {{provides}} further evidence regarding the predictive value <b>of</b> quarterly <b>earnings</b> {{for improving the}} forecasts <b>of</b> annual <b>earnings.</b> Using an analytical model, it is shown that for a specific class of time-series models, the predictive values {{are determined by the}} time-series properties, as measured by parameter value, <b>of</b> quarterly <b>earnings.</b> In particular, the model demonstrates that the accuracy <b>of</b> annual <b>earnings</b> forecasts increases as additional quarterly reports become available, and that the time-series model parameter value is positively related to both total improvement and the first quarter's relative improvement in annual earnings forecasts. These theoretical predictions are empirically tested using a sample of 235 firms over a five year period from 1980 to 1984. Empirical results are consistent with the theoretical predictions. First, annual earnings forecasts become increasingly accurate as additional quarterly reports are available, suggesting that quarterly earnings are useful for improving the forecasts <b>of</b> annual <b>earnings.</b> Second, there are cross-sectional variations in the degree of the improved accuracy in forecasts. More importantly, time-series properties (parameter value) <b>of</b> quarterly <b>earnings</b> are an important determinant of the variations in both total and relative predictive values.
