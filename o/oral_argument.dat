The court on October 14 granted the request for <b>oral</b> <b>arguments.</b> The court heard <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> on November 20.|$|R

5|$|During <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> {{before the}} Court, Scalia asked more {{questions}} and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did. His goal during oral arguments was to get across his position to the other justices.|$|E
5|$|Scalia doesn't {{come into}} <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> all secretive and sphinxlike, feigning indecision on {{the nuances of}} the case before him. He comes in like a medieval knight, girded for battle. He knows what the law is. He knows what the opinion should say. And he uses the hour {{allocated}} for argument to bludgeon his brethren into agreement.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear <b>oral</b> <b>argument.</b> On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.|$|E

5|$|WCSP-FM is {{the first}} radio station to {{broadcast}} audiotape of historical U.S. Supreme Court <b>oral</b> <b>arguments,</b> with announcers explaining the court decision {{at the end of}} the recording. The broadcasts of the Supreme Court arguments have provided listeners in the U.S. and Canada with the opportunity to hear spoken words during <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> for several of the Court's most influential cases, including the Texas v. Johnson argument over flag-burning in 1989, and the Miranda v. Arizona argument in 1966. In September 2010 the Supreme Court began releasing audio recordings of the week's <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> each Friday, thereby allowing C-SPAN Radio to broadcast a selection of current arguments. Prior to this arrangement, recordings of <b>oral</b> <b>arguments</b> were occasionally made available on a same-day basis, which C-SPAN would request in cases of high public interest.|$|R

5|$|During <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court, {{agreed to}} hear the state's appeal in 2006, {{bypassing}} the intermediate court. To the surprise of spectators, there were almost no questions from the judges during <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> which took place on December 4, 2006, causing speculation that the court may have taken the appeal just to reverse the Circuit Court ruling. On September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for the plaintiffs in a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the Maryland Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> on May 2 and 3.|$|E

5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the <b>oral</b> <b>argument</b> that the case {{presented}} two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} {{they hear the}} case. After the Court considered both Heffernan's petition and the city's reply, it granted the petition {{on the first day}} of the 2015 term. Both parties consented to the filing of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The National Association of Government Employees, Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, and Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression filed amicus briefs in support of Heffernan, while the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the National Conference of State Legislatures filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson. The United States government also filed an amicus brief in support of Heffernan, as well as a motion to appear at <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> which the Court granted, meaning the Solicitor General's office would be appearing at oral arguments, held on January 19, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at <b>oral</b> <b>argument,</b> he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E
