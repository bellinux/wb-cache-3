5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
2500|$|Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake {{was written}} just before Sylvia was {{released}} and {{is generally considered}} one of the best ballets of the era. However, Tchaikovsky himself preferred Sylvia to his own work, calling his own masterpiece [...] "poor stuff in comparison". Tchaikovsky said to Sergei Taneyev, [...] "I was ashamed. If I had known this music early then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have written Swan Lake".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2010, Kerr {{became the}} subject of global {{headlines}} when David Kiely, a banker at Macquarie Bank in Sydney, was caught viewing explicit photos of her on his computer while in the background of a colleague's live television interview with Channel 7. Within days, a clip of the interview uploaded onto YouTube received over 1.3 million hits. Eventually, Kiely was suspended and an internet campaign launched on his behalf. Kerr herself gave him her backing: [...] "I am told there is a petition to save his job, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sign it." [...] The incident prompted a 100% {{increase in the number of}} Google searches for Kerr's name. A few days after the incident, Macquarie Bank announced that Kiely would keep his job.|$|E
2500|$|She {{started to}} see people that weren't there. She thought I could see them too, but, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> couldn't. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make fun of her like, [...] "I'm {{going to go in}} the other room and you stay here and talk to your friends." ...|$|R

2500|$|In Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass {{explained}} {{his views on}} UFOs: [...] "As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, {{they will be able}} to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled Why Me, ET?. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have time to watch some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like a sail {{back in a}} pilot-boat," [...] said Scott, and Harry Alden {{agreed with}} him. Tom Myers and his brother George {{wanted to go back}} right away.|$|R

6000|$|... "How {{well the}} Juke looked," [...] Mrs. O'Dowd remarked. [...] "The Wellesleys and Malonys are related; but, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> poor <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never dream of introjuicing myself unless his Grace thought proper to {{remember}} our family-tie." ...|$|R
5000|$|Frazer apologised for any offence she caused with {{comments}} in her maiden speech, {{in which she}} jokingly described Oliver Cromwell's sale of Scots into colonial slavery as [...] "an answer to the West Lothian questionbut not one, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> recommend".|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] she retorted. [...] "You'll please yourself, Salome, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> <b>I</b> {{think it}} <b>would</b> be wiser {{to wait until}} you found out {{a little more about}} him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There the Carvel speaks," [...] he cried, [...] "and {{the true}} son of our generous province. You {{can have no}} {{conception}} of the misfortunes come to {{me out of this}} quarrel.

6000|$|... "To what?--Oh no, nothing, <b>of</b> <b>course!</b> And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> trust {{our brother}} Will with untold money, wouldn't I? As much as I'd trust the cat with the cream-pan!

60|$|Dor. A very plain, and pithy declaration. I see, sir, {{you have}} been {{travelling}} in Spain or Italy, {{or some of the}} hot countries, where men come to the point immediately.

40|$|To draw {{students}} to CS, {{we must first}} look to create a curriculum that reflects the exciting opportunities and challenges of IT today versus the 1970 s. Future students and faculty would greatly benefit from a reinvigorated CS curriculum. This letter is based on my position statement for a workshop on the preparation of IT graduates for 2010 and beyond [4]. Whereas in the past we created obstacles {{to reduce the number}} of CS majors, today we must recruit students to have the work force needed to meet the challenges and opportunities of information technology in this century. We should take advantage of the reduced pressures from the dip in enrollments to revamp our curriculum. First, let’s start with the state of the world in 2006 rather than 1976. Second, let’s create courses that we would love to take if we were students, and that we would love to teach if given the chance. Such enthusiasm would be attractive and contagious. Rather than wax on philosophically, I’ll confine my remarks to four concrete suggestions: two technological upgrades and two examples <b>of</b> <b>courses</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> love to take and teach. All these suggestions leverage technology not available when the CS curriculum was first created...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Spenlow {{was as good}} as his word.
