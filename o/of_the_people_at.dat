Performance of the Islamabad {{administration}} attracted the reprimand of the court for its slow pace. The court was informed that 61 students were in custody, of whom 39 were on bailable offences. The Chief Justice of Pakistan ordered immediate release of 20 people considered innocent, as recommended by a joint investigation team. National Crisis Management Cell Director Javed Iqbal Cheema told the court that 28 DNA tests had not been confirmed. The Chief Justice {{also pointed out that}} Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali had stated that 30 bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|Steiger {{made his}} stage debut in a {{production}} of Curse you, Jack Dalton! (1946) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark. Subsequent to this, he received an invitation {{from one of his}} teachers, Daniel Mann, to attend the Actors Studio, established by Elia Kazan in October 1947. It was here, along with Marlon Brando, Karl Malden and Eli Wallach, that he studied method acting, which became deeply engrained in him. Lacking matinée idol looks, much like Malden and Wallach, he began pursuing a career as a character actor rather than as a leading man. Steiger's stage work continued in 1950, with a minor role as a townperson in a stage production of An Enemy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>People</b> <b>at</b> the Music Box Theatre. His first major role on Broadway came in Clifford Odets's production of Night Music (1951), where he played A. L. Rosenberger. The play was held at the ANTA Playhouse. The following year, he played a telegraphist in the play Seagulls Over Sorrento, performed at the John Golden Theatre beginning on September 11, 1952.|$|E

25|$|Vomiting, in particular, transmits {{infection}} effectively, {{and appears}} to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread infection right across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit. In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one woman vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> the same table as the sick woman later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick woman. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table {{on the other side}} of the restaurant, the attack rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.|$|E

25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the Vespers, Peter III {{constructed}} and outfitted a fleet for war. When the pope {{asked why he}} needed such a great war fleet, Peter stated {{that it would be}} used against the followers of Islam along the northern coast of Africa, because he had legitimate trade interests there and needed to protect them. So when Peter received a request for help from the Sicilians he was conveniently on the north coast of Africa in Tunis, just 200 miles across the sea from the island. At first, Peter feigned indifference to the request of the Sicilians and their plight, but after several days to allow a proper showing of deference made for the pope's consumption, he took advantage of the revolt. Peter ordered his fleet to sail for Sicily, landed at Trapani on 30 August 1282. While he marched towards Palermo, his fleet followed close by the coastal road. Peter III of Aragon's involvement changed the character of the uprising from a local revolt into a European War. Peter arrived at Palermo on September 2 and initially he was received by the populace with indifference, as merely one foreign king replacing another. However, after Pope Martin made plain his orders for the populace to accept Charles, Peter promised the islanders that they would enjoy the ancient privileges they had had under the Norman king, William II of Sicily. Thereafter, he was accepted as a satisfactory second choice and was crowned by acclamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> the cathedral in Palermo on September 4, thus becoming also Peter I of Sicily.|$|E

500|$|Pickens {{prepared}} for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> Kersh's level {{had been with the}} Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would [...] "come in each week and just nail his stuff" [...] regardless of what else was going on.

500|$|The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are {{singled out}} by Cox as among the finest {{of this part of}} Wood's career. Among those {{conducting}} their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, [...] "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: [...] "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London." [...] However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: [...] "I must say {{it was the first time}} since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands." ...|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "Mother India" [...] {{has been}} defined as [...] "a common icon for the {{emergent}} Indian nation in the early 20thcentury in both colonialist and nationalist discourse". Many authors, including Gayatri Chatterjee, author of , interpret the film as an allegory signifying patriotism and the changing situation in the newly independent nation, and how India was functioning without British authority. It echoes the tale of a modern India, liberating itself from [...] "feudal and colonial oppression". The film, an archetypal nationalistic picture, is symbolic in that it demonstrated the euphoria of [...] "Mother India" [...] in a nation that had only been independent for 10years, and it had a long-lasting cultural impact upon the Indian people. Film scholar Saibal Chatterjee considers Mother India a [...] "mirror of independent India", highlighting problems of a nascent nation, including rural exploitation of farmers by money-lenders, in a dramatic fashion understandable to the common viewer. It also represents the agrarian poverty and hardship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> the time. The red water that flows from the canal irrigating the green fields {{at the end of the}} film is seen by Chatterjee as a metaphor to represent the blood of Indians in the struggle for independence, flowing to nourish a new free India. The canal is described by Virdi to signal the imminent end of the feudal order. However, despite Radha's struggle against feudal oppression depicted in the film, her action of stopping the rebellious Birju and upholding status quo—the feudal and patriarchal order—is seen as [...] "regressive" [...] by various authors.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Breen began {{keeping a}} diary on November 20. He {{primarily}} concerned {{himself with the}} weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries. Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a [...] "disagreeable" [...] glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay {{in front of their}} fireplace, roasted it in the fire, and ate it. After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the emigrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine. Emigrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>at</b> Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would {{be able to make the}} full-day trek to see the Donners.

George Donner's hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.|$|E
