60|$|The hygrometric {{state of}} the {{atmosphere}} of the valley differs most decidedly from that of <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> In <b>the</b> valley dew is constantly formed, which is owing to the amount of moisture in the air, for nocturnal radiation is more powerful <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills.</b> <b>The</b> sunrise and 9 p.m. observations in the valley, give a mean depression of the dew-point below the air of 12.3 degrees, and those at the upper level of 21.2 degrees, with no dew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> and a copious deposit in the valley. The corresponding {{state of the}} atmosphere as to saturation is 0.480 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> and 0.626 in the valley.|$|R
5|$|The {{battalion}} held Hill 314 for {{the next}} six days and gathered up a large amount of North Korean equipment and ammunition. The North Korean soldiers on Hill 314 wore American uniforms, helmets, and combat boots. Many of them had M1 rifles and carbines. About 200 North Korean dead were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Of the other 500 estimated to have been there, most of them had been wounded or were missing. Several war crimes committed by the North Koreans came to light during the action on Hill 314. On September 12 while the final action <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> was taking place, troops discovered an American officer who had been bound, gasoline poured over him, and burned. Two days later members of the battalion found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> the bodies of four other American soldiers with their hands tied. The bodies bore evidence that the men had been bayoneted and shot while bound.|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} hours, Marines reached and climbed Hill 148.

From {{the top of the}} hill, the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo.

5|$|Before dawn on August 17, {{troops from}} both the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, {{supported}} by A Company of the 70th Tank Battalion, attacked Hill 303, but heavy North Korean mortar fire stopped them {{at the edge of}} Waegwan. During the morning, American artillery heavily bombarded the North Korean positions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Throughout the morning of August 17 the North Korean guards exchanged fire with U.S. troops attempting to rescue the prisoners. Around 12:00 the North Korean unit holding the Americans placed them in a gully <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> with a light company of 50 guards. Several more American prisoners were added to the group during the day, bringing the number of prisoners on Hill 303 to 45.
