5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{the radius}} of {{gyration}} is an interesting property {{is that it can}} be determined experimentally with static light scattering as well as with small angle neutron- and x-ray scattering. This allows theoretical polymer physicists to check their models against reality.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{the ancients}} treated the {{parallel}} postulate as less certain {{than the others}} is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.|$|E

25|$|But then I confess, {{you have}} <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> I {{am unable to}} confute, — which is the {{contrary}} judgment of your neighbour ministers. They may see more than I can, (especially such as judicious and honest Mr. Fisher, who knoweth both places.) And, therefore, I presume not peremptorily to advise you, but to cast in my thoughts; which, if they seem unsatisfactory to you, reject them.|$|E
25|$|The {{trends are}} illustrative for pool management, but whether scaling occurs {{also depends on}} other factors {{including}} interactions with Mg2+, B(OH)4− and other ions in the pool, as well as supersaturation effects. Scaling is commonly observed in electrolytic chlorine generators, {{where there is a}} high pH near the cathode surface and scale deposition further increases temperature. This is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> some pool operators prefer borate over bicarbonate as the primary pH buffer, and avoid the use of pool chemicals containing calcium.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{churches were}} so {{segregated}} within the United States {{was that there}} was little push from African American church leaders to have integrated churches. It was often that White religious leaders pushed for integrated churches, while African American leaders preferred separate congregations. This may be in part due to several factors, including the lack of opportunity to pursue leadership roles in predominantly White or segregated churches, the fact that African American churches allowed a place to build community, and for interests in practicing Christianity differently.|$|E

25|$|The {{period after}} World War II saw another surge in growth. There were 10,000 members by 1947, with {{membership}} tripling in size between 1946 and 1956 as Civitan became the sixth largest service {{club in the}} United States. By 1960, there were 34,000 active Civitans in 998 clubs. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Civitan expanded so quickly was the flexibility that it allowed to clubs in other countries. Compromises over {{issues such as the}} Civitan creed and membership dues allowed the ethnically diverse organization to maintain a strong sense of unity.|$|E
25|$|Blackhawk School District {{officials}} did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant, which would have provided hundreds of thousands in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Pennsylvania was not approved.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{the study}} of inner models is of {{interest}} {{is that it can}} be used to prove consistency results. For example, it can be shown that regardless of whether a model V of ZF satisfies the continuum hypothesis or the axiom of choice, the inner model L constructed inside the original model will satisfy both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. Thus the assumption that ZF is consistent (has at least one model) implies that ZF together with these two principles is consistent.|$|E

25|$|At the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, Leo's representatives {{delivered}} his famous , {{a statement of}} {{the faith of the}} Roman Church {{in the form of a}} letter addressed to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, which repeats, in close adherence to Augustine of Hippo, the formulas of western Christology. The council did not read the letter nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo's legates but deposed Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum, who appealed to Rome. That is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.|$|E

25|$|Since {{its heyday}} {{at the turn}} of the 19th and 20th centuries, many of the large homes built here have been replaced, {{modified}} or abandoned with many lots subdivided. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the colonia declined was the building of Line 2 of the Metro along Ribera de San Cosme Avenue, making this street a main corridor for the city. This bought in crowds of people, which then led to the construction of stores, hotels and nightclubs, which was often unregulated. This, in turn, caused many of the area’s wealthier residents to move out. The Circuito Interior was constructed in 1973. The 1985 Mexico City earthquake did significant damage here, and buildings since then have fallen due to structural damage related to the quake.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California in 2010, Chao expressed his opinions about topics such as the effects of economic globalization on social inequality. He explained how he believes that the global market is causing social inequality, and how issues in education and immigration are connected to this. In this interview he expressed a worry that mafias are the greatest threat to democracy and that this is already evident in certain places, like Russia and Mexico. He stated that this is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> he is for the legalization of drugs such as Marijuana - he explained that mafias are making capital off of the distribution of illegal drugs which gives them more economic power, thus making it easier for them to potentially overthrow governments.|$|E
25|$|This is <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> the {{probability}} of transmitting many infections is far higher from sex than by more casual means of transmission, such as non-sexual contact—touching, hugging, shaking hands—but {{it is not the}} only reason. Although mucous membranes exist in the mouth as in the genitals, many STIs seem to be easier to transmit through oral sex than through deep kissing. According to a safe sex chart, many infections that are easily transmitted from the mouth to the genitals or from the genitals to the mouth are much harder to transmit from one mouth to another. With HIV, genital fluids happen to contain much more of the pathogen than saliva. Some infections labeled as STIs can be transmitted by direct skin contact. Herpes simplex and HPV are both examples. KSHV, on the other hand, may be transmitted by deep-kissing but also when saliva is used as a sexual lubricant.|$|E
50|$|Although Westerland used to {{have the}} status of Stadt (city), the new {{municipality}} so far refrained from applying for this status. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>that</b> the Ortsteile {{do not want to}} advertise their tourism services as simple suburbs (Stadtteile).|$|R

50|$|Historically the Indian {{peoples of}} the North American {{continent}} rarely joined forces across tribal lines, which were divisions related to distinct language and cultural groups. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> was <b>that</b> most tribes were highly decentralized, with their people seldom united around issues.|$|R
25|$|Jindal oversaw one of {{the largest}} {{evacuations}} in U.S. history (nearly two million people) in late August 2008 prior to the Louisiana landfall of Hurricane Davis. He issued mandatory evacuation orders for the state's coastal areas and activated 3,000 National Guardsman to aid in the exodus. He also ordered the state to purchase generators to provide needed power to hospitals and nursing homes without power. Government officials vacated hospitals and nursing homes and put the poor, the ill, and the elderly on buses and trains out of town. The evacuation was credited as <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Gustav resulted in only 16 deaths in the U.S. The state's successful response to Hurricane Gustav was {{in stark contrast to the}} failed hurricane response system for Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Jindal received bipartisan praise for his leadership during Gustav. Jindal had been scheduled to address the Republican National Convention, but cancelled his plans in order to focus on Louisiana's needs during the storm.|$|E
25|$|After {{disagreement}} regarding Stalin's {{demand to}} move Red Army troops through Poland and Romania (which Poland and Romania opposed), on 21 August, the Soviets proposed adjournment of military talks using the pretext {{that the absence}} of the senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces, though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet-German negotiations. That same day, Stalin received assurance that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would grant the Soviets land in Poland, the Baltic states, Finland and Romania, after which Stalin telegrammed Hitler that night that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August. Regarding the larger issue of collective security, some historians state that <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> Stalin decided to abandon the doctrine was the shaping of his views of France (hon hon hon baguette fromage oui oui) and Britain (England is my city) by their entry into the Munich Agreement and the subsequent failure to prevent German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Stalin may also have viewed the pact as gaining time in an eventual war with Hitler in order to reinforce the Soviet military and shifting Soviet borders westwards, which would be militarily beneficial in such a war.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> {{some people}} believe the {{assimilation}} of Hispanics in the U.S. is not {{comparable to that of}} other cultural groups is that Hispanic and Latino Americans have been living in parts of North America for centuries, in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant. For example, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico (1598), Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Puerto Rico have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. existed. (But {{it should be noted that}} the language of the Native Americans existed before this, until the invasion and forced assimilation by the Spanish.) These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and later Mexico (with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848. Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior to the creation of the Thirteen Colonies. For example, San Miguel de Gualdape, Pensacola and St. Augustine, Florida were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. Santa Fe, New Mexico was founded in 1604, and Albuquerque was established in 1660. El Paso was founded in 1659, San Antonio in 1691, Laredo, Texas in 1755, San Diego in 1769, San Francisco in 1776, San Jose, California in 1777, New Iberia, Louisiana in 1779, and Los Angeles in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and Spanish language well before the United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
30|$|Sign-changing {{solutions}} of nonlinear elliptic equations {{have attracted}} much attention in recent years. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>that</b> sign-changing solutions arise naturally from mathematical models in biology and physics. Another <b>reason</b> is <b>that</b> there are richer structures of sign-changing solutions than that of negative and positive solutions for generic nonlinear and linear elliptic equations.|$|R

50|$|Helicopters are {{not built}} to {{withstand}} the severe turbulence encountered in hurricane rainbands and eye walls. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> is <b>that</b> a helicopter receives all of its lift from its rotating blades, and they {{are most likely to}} break off in hurricane conditions.|$|R
