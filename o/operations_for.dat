40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formulate}} three classes of optimization problems: the simple, monotonically-constrained, and bounded CH-programs.

These properties enable a very e#cient polynomial-time algorithm, using di#erenttypes of LR operations to compute tightlower and upper bounds of the exact solution to any CH-program. We show that the algorithm is capable of solving manylayout optimization problems in deep submicron IC and#or high-performance MCM#PCB designs...|$|R
