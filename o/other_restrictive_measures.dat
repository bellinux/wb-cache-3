40|$|This piece {{examines}} how the EU exports and enforce its {{values in the}} countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy by using on the one hand, external financial instruments, in particular, the European Nieghbourhood Policy Instrument (ENPI) but also the Decisions on macro economic assistance based on Art. 212 (or 213) Treaty on Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and on the <b>other,</b> and <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> falling within the scope of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). The author examines to what extent the way the EU promotes its values differs from the instrument of pre-accession assistance (IPA), used {{within the framework of the}} enlargement policy. The conclusion is that the ENPI of 2014 strengthens the importance of EU values compared to the previous one (dating 2006) but does expect that they comply with EU values as the IPA does from acceding countries. Decisions on macro economic assistance are scrutinised to examine to what extent they are based on political conditionality. Does respect of EU values matter to receive the EU’s financial assistance? A further question is whether the EU has specifically used this form of financial support to the benefit of ENP partners or has also extended its assistance to other third countries (i. e. the “neighbours of neighbours”). The chapter highlights that after 2009 macro-economic assistance decisions have been adopted to support the transition of third countries to democracy. However, they are not reserved for ENP countries, and neither is respect for EU values in reality truly important in taking the decision to assist. Turning to <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> the analysis is aimed at examining whether there are distinctive features in the measures adopted against the governmental leadership and/or nationals and entities of ENP countries. The term of comparison is <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> adopted against <b>other</b> third countries and/or legal and natural persons in situation in which human rights or democratic rules were breached. The author concludes that there are categories of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> concerning the ENP countries with distinctive elements. The EU’s judicial assistance to democracies in transition, such as Tunisia and Egypt, in fighting the misappropriation of funds is specific to the ENP. <b>Restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> adopted against the secessionist Ukrainian Republics, in reaction to their breach of the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty, are also unique and worth highlighting. This denotes that the EU is more committed to supporting the establishment of its values in its relations with its neighbours than with other third countries...|$|R

He vetoed the bill on its first passage, but the assembly quickly overrode it, taking the responsibility for appointing all board members in the state, a power the governor had held since the Civil War.

In order to provide quality nursing care and to ensure the patient´s safety even with the application of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> it is necessary to determine the level of professional quality, or the introduction of nursing standards at all wards where <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are used. The aim of this thesis was to verify if the <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> in psychiatric inpatient units and inpatient wards of other medical disciplines are being used in accordance with the standard of nursing care of patients who are restrained in bed, and analyze the current standards of nursing care determining the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> Another objective was to find out nurses´ attitudes to application of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> and to survey their feelings while applying <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> On the base of the objectives hypotheses were formulated with regard to data in literature and my own clinical practice, which also includes the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> The nursing research was conducted through a questionnaire at the wards where <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are applied.

We investigated staff perspectives {{on the use of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> with adolescents with mild ID in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} current Dutch policies on reduction. Method: We surveyed a nationally representative sample of Dutch care professionals. 195 staff members working in settings providing care for people with ID filled out the survey (response 68. 7 %). Results: If there is danger, physical aggression or sexually abusive behavior almost all (87. 8 – 96. 8 %) staff members consider the use of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> The most often mentioned goals of <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> are averting or avoiding danger (90. 4 % and 83. 0 %).

40|$|This Insight {{concerns}} a special category of EU restrictive measures: those freezing funds and economic resources of {{former members of}} the political leadership (and/or their families) of countries falling within the European Neighbourhood Policy. These measures are addressed to persons responsible for the misappropriation of state funds. When individuals are subject to investigation for the crimes mentioned above in their country of origin, the EU freezes their resources, {{at the request of the}} concerned third countries’ authorities. The focus of the paper are <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> enacted in view of the situation in Ukraine and General Court’s judgment in the case of the former prime minister of Ukraine, Azarov, who is subject to an investigation for misappropriation of funds. This case is described and placed in the context of <b>other</b> challenges to <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> against persons identified as responsible for misappropriation of state funds (such as Al Matri and Ezz). Mr Azarov’s action was successful. Few months before the latter judgment was released, the General Court had upheld another annulment action against the same measure; this time it was introduced by another key figure of Yanukovich’s government, Mr Portnov. The judgment in Azarov is interesting since it details the circumstances in which the Council may adopt <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> against persons responsible for misappropriation of public funds. The General Court certainly does not question the Council’s freedom to decide to cooperate with the national authorities of neighbour countries in order to support third countries’ new governments to recoup state funds, misappropriated by the former ruling class. Yet, the Council is required to verify that national authorities, requesting the EU’s assistance, provide details concerning either the facts alleged against the person responsible for misappropriation of funds and its responsibility in that regard. Thus, the General court by contrast with the judgement in Ezz, imposes on the Council to be very cautious when it decides to accept the request of a third country’s authority to freeze the assets of a person who is the subject of an investigation concerning the misappropriation of state funds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{restrictive}} {{measures such}} as quarantine draws into sharp relief the dynamic interplay between the individual rights of the citizen {{on the one hand}} and the collective rights of the community on the other. Concerns regarding infectious disease outbreaks (SARS, pandemic influenza) have intensified the need to understand public perceptions of quarantine and other social distancing measures. Methods We conducted a telephone survey of the general population in the Greater Toronto Area in Ontario, Canada. Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) technology was used. A final sample of 500 individuals was achieved through standard random-digit dialing. Results Our data indicate strong public support for the use of quarantine when required and for serious legal sanctions against those who fail to comply. This support is contingent both on the implementation of legal safeguards to protect against inappropriate use and on the provision of psychosocial supports for those affected. Conclusion To engender strong public support for quarantine and <b>other</b> <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures,</b> government officials and public health policy-makers would do well to implement a comprehensive system of supports and safeguards, to educate and inform frontline public health workers, and to engage the public at large in an open dialogue on the ethical use of restrictive measures during infectious disease outbreaks. </p...|$|E

The model covers 18 economic sectors in each of 22 countries/regions {{and is based on}} Version 5. 4 of the GTAP database for 1997 together with specially constructed estimates of services barriers and other data on sectoral employment and numbers of firms. The distinguishing feature of the model is that it incorporates some aspects of trade with imperfect competition in the manufacturing and services sectors, including monopolistic competition, increasing returns, and product variety. The modeling focus is on the effects of the bilateral removal of tariffs on agriculture and manufactures and services barriers. Rules of origin and <b>other</b> <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> and the non-trade aspects of the FTAA are not taken into account due to data constraints. The computational results indicate that the FTAA would increase the economic welfare of the FTAA member countries by $ 118. 8 billion, with the largest increases accruing to the United States, $ 67. 6 billion, and to South America, $ 31. 0 billion. The FTAA is trade diverting for most of the rest-of-world, with a welfare reduction of $ 9. 3 billion. In comparison, if the FTAA countries were to adopt unilateral free trade, total FTAA member welfare would increase by $ 476. 8 billion and global welfare by $ 812. 7 billion.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the possible consequences that accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) bears for Belarus. Our approach is based on partial equilibrium. We have applied a method of locating specific 'sensitive' points {{in the economy and}} treating them as separate items specific elements in the economic system on which WTO access will have an appreciable impact. Our research focuses on Belarusian manufacturing. We first determine possible changes in access to foreign markets associated with the cancellation of discriminatory non-tariff, antidumping and <b>other</b> <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures</b> introduced by WTO members. Total losses to the Belarusian manufacturers are currently estimated to be of the order of USD 230 - 250 million a year. Lifting those barriers will constitute the immediate short-term benefits to Belarus on accession to the WTO. In order to assess the short-term impact of WTO accession on Belarusian manufacturing, the scenario used assumed a reduction of tariffs, complete removal of discriminatory measures and a lowering of market barriers to Belarusian exports. A quantitative assessment was made of the gains and losses by manufacturing branch, followed by a simple sensitivity analysis. The latter revealed the Belarusian manufacturers' ability to withstand increased import competition up until such time as the requisite restructuring measures have been introduced. Summary conclusions are drawn for each branch in the light of those findings. One section of the paper focuses on the implications for Belarus of the Russian Federation's accession to the WTO. Consideration is given to the possible impact on Belarusian exports to the Russian market. The analysis shows, however, that Russia's joining the WTO does not incur the risk of Belarus losing its share of the Russian market. In the final section, consideration is given to state support for agriculture and the development of service markets, with a discussion on possible forms of, and limits to, liberalization. The final conclusion is that liberalizing the imports of certain items is very much in line with the need to revise the current structure of trade specialization in Belarus. Import liberalization should not be seen simply as a trade-off for the non-discrimination of Belarusian exports. If the economy of Belarus is to benefit, the country must pursue a consistent policy of cutting back or closing down those manufacturing activities that are unlikely to evolve into internationally competitive industries. Liberalization of the domestic market in the wake of WTO accession must be in keeping with (a) the financial viability of specific industries; and (b) the need to provide in a manner compatible with WTO rules and regulations additional protection to those industries with high value-added that are of strategic importance to the country’s future development. international trade, WTO accession, manufacturing, services, agriculture...|$|E

The {{author of}} this paper sets out to provide a {{comparative}} analysis of the relationships within the guild as an organization and within the handicrafts in Slavonski Brod. We identified two levels for comparative analysis: the horizontal level which represents boundaries between the guilds and the vertical level representing the hierarchical structure within the handicraft. At both levels the psychology of power is at work. Power primarily derives from {{the rules and regulations}} imposed by the central state and which, interestingly enough, were labelled Privileges. The guilds protected these privileges on the horizontal plane by proscribing engagement with the handicraft for any individual who is not member of the guild; by limiting the size of guild membership, by banning imports of the goods produced by handicraftsmen from the city and <b>other</b> similar <b>restrictive</b> <b>measures.</b> On the vertical plane one also detects a typical fight for retention of positions gained and a classic desire to move upward on the social ladder. These tendencies were evident in the relationships between master craftsmen, assistants and apprentices – the three pillars of any handicraft. These tensions resulted in the breach of one of the strictest provisions in the Military Border – the provision on limitation of movement. In the area where even the slightest movement, even the shortest trip was conditional on the acquisition of special permits, and in the country in which poor education and ignorance of other cultures was a rule rather than exception – the youth opted for long unpredictable travels throughout the Habsburg Monarchy to gain the skills and knowledge necessary for them to compete for the positions of master handicraftsmen, and thus move one, but an important step higher on the social ladder...|$|R
