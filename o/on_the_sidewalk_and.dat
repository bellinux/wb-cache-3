5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) {{explains}} that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
500|$|Offerman and Mullally {{were allowed}} to improvise a great deal during filming. The episode {{features}} a montage of various clips showing how Ron and Tammy gradually go from fighting {{with each other to}} getting married {{over the course of a}} particularly wild night. Long sequences of footage were shot [...] including Ron and Tammy loudly arguing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> the two making out atop a police car [...] but little more than a few seconds ultimately made the final episode. Offerman said it took about a half hour for the hair department to give him his cornrows haircut. He said he enjoyed the process, saying it [...] "felt like a stiff head massage".|$|E
500|$|When Berlin was {{a divided}} city, the Berlin Wall ran along Bernauer Straße. [...] The street itself {{belonged to the}} French sector of West Berlin and the East German {{authorities}} declared that the windows and doors that led out onto Bernauer Straße should be bricked up. [...] In the early morning of 22 August 1961, Ida Siekmann {{was the first of}} 98 people to die while attempting to escape. [...] She was living on the fourth floor of number 48 (third floor, 3te Stock, by German standards), threw bedding and some possessions down onto the street, and jumped out of the window of her apartment. She fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> was severely injured, dying shortly afterwards {{on her way to the}} Lazarus Hospital. [...] On 8 March 1989, Winfried Freudenberg became the last person to die in an attempt to escape from East Germany to West Berlin across the Berlin Wall by falling from his balloon.|$|E

50|$|On Tripoli’s shop-lined Fashloom Street, Gaddafi effigies were {{suspended}} {{over the road}} {{in full view of}} people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>and</b> in cars. Gaddafi, depicted in his elaborate robes, hung by his neck.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no other}} {{alternative}} but to obey, for the man literally dragged him through <b>the</b> crowds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> <b>and</b> continued <b>on</b> at a rapid pace until the two were {{at the entrance of}} Police Headquarters.|$|R
500|$|Back in {{the present}} day, Peter discovers that his past actions have had drastic effects on the world: he and Molly {{have been married for}} 20 years; Judd Nelson crashes at their house once or twice a week; Lois is married to Quagmire; Al Gore is now the President of the United States; Chris, Meg, and Stewie have Quagmire's chin, nose, and mannerisms; and Chevy Chase is the host of The Tonight Show. Brian {{explains}} to Peter that by missing out on his date with Lois and making out with Molly, he altered the time line. Despite Brian's objections about leaving the [...] "perfect" [...] world (in which there are flying cars that run on vegetable oil and Gore has killed Osama bin Laden by strangling him with his bare hands), Peter wants {{to go back to the}} past so he can undo his mistake. Brian says that this is impossible because Death can only be summoned if someone dies and thanks to Gore's universal health care, people are living much longer along with a strong, well-funded educational system and zero tolerance gun control that has eliminated street crime. However, when Jane Jetson suddenly falls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> dies, Death arrives and again grants Peter's wish to return to the past. Back in the past, Peter is determined to accept Lois' invitation but repeatedly blows his opportunity and ends up repeatedly asking Death for a do-over. When Peter finally gets it right, he forgets a few hours later and parties with Cleveland instead of keeping the date. He asks Death for another chance but Death, fed up with Peter's continued blunders, tells him that he will have to fix the problem on his own.|$|E
2500|$|Huff {{left the}} house and {{returned}} to his large truck, parked nearby. From the truck, he retrieved a 12-gauge pistol-grip Winchester 1300 Defender shotgun and a [...]40-caliber semiautomatic Ruger P944 handgun, and several bandoliers with more than 300 rounds of ammunition for the guns. On {{his way back to the}} after-party, he spray-painted the word [...] "NOW" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> on the steps of a neighboring home.|$|E
2500|$|A Jewish Ghetto {{police force}} {{enforced}} these rules. On {{at least one}} occasion, the police chief, one Pasternak, in early 1942, carried out a hanging, although it was perceived that {{he was reluctant to}} do so. In that case, the body of the executed woman, Mina Gittelson, whose crime was walking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> not in the street, and not wearing the Jewish badge, was left hanging for three days. [...] Another source says that she had resisted the advances of the manager at the hotel where she worked, and he pressed the charges of illegal trading against her in retaliation. Also executed was 48-year-old Chaya Mayerova (other sources give her name as Meyorvich and Mejerow), who was shot before the assembled ghetto inhabitants for exchanging a piece of cloth for two kilograms of flour.|$|E
60|$|They {{had reached}} the main street, a broad avenue which ran north and south across a gentle swell in the prairie. There were {{a great many people}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> <b>and</b> teams were moving in various {{directions}} slowly and in apparent confusion.|$|R
5000|$|Back of the Hill {{is located}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street running {{section of the}} [...] "E" [...] Branch on South Huntington Avenue.

6000|$|... "The {{right to}} the reader's {{undivided}} attention. To deny him this is immoral. To make him share your attention with the rattle of a street car, the moving panorama of <b>the</b> crowds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buildings beyond--with any {{of the thousands of}} distractions which make our customary environment--is to treat him with gross injustice. By God, it is infamous!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Public {{attention}} to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern {{that was to be}} repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police. Clyde Haberman, writing in The New York Times, said that [...] "If the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever choose to recognize a person who gave their cause its biggest boost, they may want to pay tribute to Anthony Bologna," [...] calling the event [...] "vital" [...] for the still nascent movement. On 1 October 2011, protesters set out to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. The New York Times reported that more than 700 arrests were made. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across. Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, [...] "The cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway." [...] A spokesman for the New York Police Department, Paul Browne, said that protesters were given multiple warnings to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> not block the street, and were arrested when they refused.|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, Schmeling himself {{confirmed}} the public's {{reaction to the}} outcome, recounting his ambulance ride to the hospital afterward: [...] "As we drove through Harlem, there were noisy, dancing crowds. Bands had left the nightclubs and bars and were playing <b>and</b> dancing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>and</b> streets. <b>The</b> whole area was filled with celebration, noise, and saxophones, continuously punctuated by the calling of Joe Louis' name." ...|$|R

50|$|Livni was {{inspired}} in 2005 by the British artist Banksy to distribute copies of her serialized novel Between Epiphanies in New York. The book was placed surreptitiously in subway ad spaces {{and other public}} and private places throughout the city. Fellow artist Win stenciled {{the faces of the}} literary and historical figures that appear in Between Epiphanies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>and</b> buildings of Brooklyn.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. I slipped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> {{turned my}} ankle. I could not walk, so I hobbled into a {{restaurant}} and sat there until I was better. That is why I was so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|Although he was {{somewhat}} surprised, Foster {{did as he}} was told, and when they had passed a few blocks Featherstone resumed: [...] "I can send down the prescription to-morrow. That was Daly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> I didn't want to meet him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{footsteps}} {{were heard}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>and</b> Abner jumped up quickly and redusted a book upon the table. There entered two little girls, the elder one {{with her hair}} plaited down her back. They looked in surprise at Abner, who smiled.|$|E

60|$|The tipsy man {{began to}} remonstrate, {{and wanted to}} fight both of them. He grew quite abusive, and {{threatened}} to wreck all the things in the establishment.

6000|$|FITZSIMMONS. Surely you haven't {{forgotten}} that night!

50|$|When I {{went into}} the street, I saw a nightmarish spectacle. Red tracer bullets {{streaked}} through the night air. The four-story Savoy Hotel, illuminated by floodlights, was surrounded by troops, local police and border police in full battle regalia. Military vehicles, armored cars and personnel carriers clogged the surrounding streets. Red Magen David ambulance crews were administering first aid to wounded civilians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> <b>and</b> gutters. Looking out to sea, the blinding light of magnesium flares revealed naval patrol boats cruising just off the beach.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then came}} another shower of snowballs and Dave was hit again. This {{was too much}} for him, {{and despite the fact that}} he was bare-headed and wore a fine party suit, he leaped down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> <b>and</b> started for the corner. Phil and Roger came after him. Ben rushed into the hallway, to catch up two of his father’s canes and his chums’ hats, and then he followed.|$|E
6000|$|So Mr. George stopped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> <b>and,</b> {{taking a}} little London guide book {{out of his}} pocket, {{he looked at the}} index to find Whitehall.
