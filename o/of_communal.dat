5|$|Rhondda had {{a strong}} {{tradition}} <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> activity, exemplified by workmen's halls, miners' institutes and trade unions.

5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
5|$|A common {{justification}} for the need for astronomy {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} the topic of this work is {{determined}} by the high social importance and importance of the sphere <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services {{for the development of the}} domestic economy in the face of sanctions restrictions. As a subject of research, a modern complex <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services, provided to owners and tenants of housing by economic entities in the sphere <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services, was chosen. The main purpose of this work was to substantiate the economic essence <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services in relation to the activities of economic entities in the sphere <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services, aimed at providing them to owners and tenants of housing. The methodology of the work was based on an analysis of the main provisions of the current regulatory and legislative documents, as well as a systematic analysis of the general and specific properties <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services. During the research a number of scientifically significant results were obtained, namely: importance and significance of the sphere <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services at the present stage of the development of the Russian economy have been determined; brief analysis of the changes in the current procedure for providing housing and communal services to owners and tenants of housing; revealed fundamental differences between the general and specific properties <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services; substantiated the economic essence <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services, which is associated with their provision to owners and tenants of housing by economic entities in the sphere <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services. The obtained results can be used in the activities of economic entities in the sphere <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services, directly related to the provision of a complex <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services to owners and tenants of housing. The rationale for the economic essence <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services will allow economic entities in the sphere <b>of</b> housing and <b>communal</b> services to improve the quality of their provision to end users after comprehensive modernization and introduction of innovative technologies for managing the infrastructure of this sphere...|$|R

After the failure of the rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> land resumed in many towns in Sicily.

Other offices {{on the first floor}} were lit via skylights. The stairwells in Mudd were designed with the purpose of discouraging students from passing through lab spaces to get {{from one side of the}} building to the other. In spite of this, Michael J. Crosbie reported in Architecture in 1986 that students had taken to passing through the building as a shortcut instead of going around it. Furnishings and carpeting in the building were deep blue and rust-colored.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{used his}} {{influence}} with the princes {{to push them}} towards accession. He declared that the British Government would not grant dominion status {{to any of the}} princely states, nor would it accept them into the British Commonwealth, which meant that the states would sever all connections with the British crown unless they joined either India or Pakistan. He pointed out that the Indian subcontinent was one economic entity, and that the states would suffer most if the link were broken. He also pointed to the difficulties that princes would face maintaining order in the face of threats such as the rise <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> violence and communist movements.|$|E

5|$|Research at the Asummiut {{excavation}} site {{near the airport}} has uncovered the changing settlement pattern, exhibiting transition from the single-family dwellings to tiny villages of several families. The types of dwelling varied from tent rings made of the hides of hunted mammals, to stone hearths, with no evidence <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> living in larger structures. In contrast, there is evidence for reindeer hunting as a coordinated effort of either villagers or groups of more loosely related individuals, with gathering places in proximity of the hunting grounds being found. Despite recent advances in DNA research based on hair samples from the ancient Saqqaq migrants (which gives insight into their origin), {{the reason for the}} decline and subsequent disappearance of the culture are not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Sitakunda {{is renowned}} for its {{numerous}} Islamic, Hindu and Buddhist shrines. It has 280 mosques, 8 mazars, 49 Hindu temples, 4 ashrams, and 3 Buddhist temples. Among its notable religious sites are the Chandranath Temple (a Shakti Peetha or holy pilgrimage site), Vidarshanaram Vihara (founded by the scholar Prajnalok Mahasthavir), and the Hammadyar Mosque (founded by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah). The attraction of Sitakunda as a tourist destination is elevated by these pilgrimage sites along with the hill range and the eco-park. Despite its diverse population, the area has gone through episodes <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> strife, including attacks on places of worship. There have been reports of activity by the Islamic militant group Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh since the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|The British {{moved the}} capital to New Delhi in 1911. Calcutta {{continued}} to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II. Coinciding with the war, millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors. Demands {{for the creation of a}} Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> violence that killed over 4,000. The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shift—many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has a story to tell, though Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> guilt, {{even if they were}} not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} legislative council, {{introduced in}} 1921 by the British, {{was based on}} principles <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> representation, which led the Tamils {{to realize that they}} were the minority ethnic group and that they should be represented by a member of their own community. It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to the minority communities: Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims and others.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India for him or the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down their terms, which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that {{it would be difficult for}} him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event <b>of</b> <b>communal</b> problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E
