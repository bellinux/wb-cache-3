5|$|Bolckow, Vaughan & Co., Ltd was an English {{ironmaking}} {{and mining}} company founded in 1864, {{based on the}} partnership since 1840 <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> founders, Henry Bolckow and John Vaughan. The firm drove the dramatic growth of Middlesbrough {{and the production of}} coal and iron in the north-east of England in the 19th century. The two founding partners had an exceptionally close working relationship which lasted until Vaughan's death.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{existing}} line had been upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, {{operation of the}} Brill Tramway {{was taken over by}} London's Metropolitan Railway and Brill became one <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> north-western termini. The line was rebuilt in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster. The population of the area remained low, and the primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot: Warped {{was praised}} by critics, who noted {{a high quality}} in many areas, {{including}} gameplay, graphics and audio.

He swam in the 100meters breaststroke, marking the first time he ever competed at an Olympic games.

He completed the event in 1:01.80, placing first in the heat ahead of India's second place finalist Sandeep Sejwal (1:02.19) and Paraguay's third place finalist Genaro Prono (1:02.32).

Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E

In 1945, Gardiner became a charter member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 76 on The Hockey News list of the 100GreatestHockeyPlayers. Gardiner is an Honored Member of Canada's Sports Hall of Fame, Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum, and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Overall, he played 316NHLgames, winning 122, with a goals against average of 2.02goals, and 42shutouts.

5|$|In 1911, civil {{engineer}} Virgil Bogue presented {{a comprehensive plan}} {{for the city of}} Seattle, including an elevated rapid transit line running southeast from King Street Station through Chinatown towards the Rainier Valley. The plan was, however, rejected by voters on March 5, 1912, leaving it unimplemented. In 1957, Seattle City Engineer M. O. Anderberg and the Seattle Transit Commission proposed a rapid transit system utilizing the right-of-way cleared for Interstate 5 between Everett and Tacoma. The rapid transit line would travel through downtown Seattle in a tunnel under 5th Avenue, with one <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> stations at South Jackson Street at the site of Union Station. The proposal included redevelopment of Union Station into a multi-level transportation hub, with a bus terminal for intercity and suburban buses, a public parking garage, and a rooftop heliport. The proposal was rejected by the federal government, not wanting to jeopardize freeway construction, and was ultimately shelved.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Morgan was {{promoted}} to brigadier and assumed command of the 1st Support Group of the 1st Armoured Division. When the 1st Support Group was shipped to France in May 1940, following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, it had already been stripped <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> field artillery regiments and two infantry battalions. As a result, Morgan's command included only a force of Royal Engineers and a Territorial Army (TA) battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, which {{was in the process of}} converting to an anti-aircraft/anti-tank regiment and armed only with anti-tank guns. His group was in no position to fulfil its normal role supporting the division's armoured brigades and so was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division south of the river Somme. During a confused retreat most of the Support Group was captured along with the 51st Division at Saint-Valery-en-Caux but the remainder, including Morgan, got away and were evacuated to England.|$|E
5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) of one <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E

5|$|Most of the UK's Caribbean territories {{achieved}} independence {{after the}} departure in 1961 and 1962 of Jamaica and Trinidad from the West Indies Federation, established in 1958 {{in an attempt}} to unite the British Caribbean colonies under one government, but which collapsed following the loss <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> largest members. Barbados achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands in the 1970s and 1980s, but Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence. The British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and Montserrat opted to retain ties with Britain, while Guyana achieved independence in 1966. Britain's last colony on the American mainland, British Honduras, became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed Belize in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981. A dispute with Guatemala over claims to Belize was left unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the Allies was the German Army Group G (HeeresgruppeG). Although {{nominally}} an army group, Army GroupG had at {{the time}} of the invasion only one army under its command: the 19th Army, under the command of Friedrich Wiese. As southern France had never been important to German planning, their forces there had been stripped of nearly all their valuable units and equipment over the course of the war. Due to the Allied threat in Normandy Army Group G's units were continuously sent north until the Dragoon landings. The remaining 11 divisions were understrength and only one panzer division was left, the 11th Panzer Division. In early August the 11th Panzer Division had sent one <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> panzer battalions to Normandy shortly before the landing.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38.

Strontium has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>two</b> vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive {{and is one of the}} most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E
