5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> of the losses in the battle.|$|E

Of those, 40percent were aboriginal, most of whom came from the nearby Peigan and Kainai nations. Of the remaining 60percent, Japanese, Chinese and Latin American made up the largest portion at over 1,200, 920 and 705 respectively.|$|E

5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, to weed out {{potential}} defectors. <b>One</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate with a range of other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E

5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> cells migrate {{to the top of a}} fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|There are fifteen fraternities {{and seven}} sororities at the University of Chicago, {{as well as}} one co-ed {{community}} service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega. Four of the sororities are members of the National Panhellenic Conference, and ten of the fraternities form the University of Chicago Interfraternity Council. In 2002, the Associate Director of Student Activities estimated that 8–10 percent of undergraduates were members of fraternities or sororities. The student activities office has used similar figures, stating that <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> undergraduates participate in Greek life.|$|E
5|$|Transport links {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance. Survey evidence indicates that a quarter of companies regard access to air services as {{an important factor in}} the decision of where in the UK to locate operations, whilst <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> companies report that the absence of good air transport links has affected their decision to invest in the UK. The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias, though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names {{inscribed on the}} Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, {{and a number of}} women, who had died during the war and these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E

25|$|Nationally we can {{conclude}} with confidence that between {{one in three}} and <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>ten</b> Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families and communities in the period from approximately 1910 until 1970.

Most families have been affected, {{in one or more}} generations, by the forcible removal of one or more children.|$|E
