50|$|The O Level (Ordinary Level; {{official}} title: <b>General</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Education: Ordinary Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred {{as part of}} the <b>General</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Education. It {{was introduced}} as part of British educational reform alongside the more in-depth and academically rigorous A-level (official title of qualification: <b>General</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Education - Advanced Level) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those three jurisdictions replaced O Levels gradually with <b>General</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Secondary Education (GCSE) and International <b>General</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Secondary Education (IGCSE) exams over time. The Scottish equivalent was the O-grade (replaced by the Standard Grade). The O Level qualification is still awarded by CIE Cambridge International Examinations, the international counterpart of the British examination Board OCR (Oxford, Cambridge & Royal Society of Arts), in select locations, instead of or alongside the International <b>General</b> <b>Certificate</b> of Secondary Education qualifications. Both CIE and OCR have Cambridge Assessment as their parent organisation. The Cambridge O Level has already been phased out, however, and is no longer available in certain administrative regions.|$|R
