5|$|Shortly {{after his}} marriage, Carrouges {{revealed}} another {{motive for the}} union. The valuable estate of Arnou-le-Faucon, given to his rival Jacques Le Gris two years earlier, had been formerly owned by Carrouges' father-in-law and had been bought by Count Pierre for 8,000 French livres in 1377. Carrouges immediately began a lawsuit to recover the land based on an assumed prior claim to it. The case dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> months until ultimately Count Pierre was forced to visit his cousin King Charles VI to officially confirm his ownership {{of the land and}} his right to give it to whomever of his followers he chose. Despite losing the case, the lawsuit reflected very poorly on Carrouges at the court in Argentan and resulted in his further estrangement from Count Pierre's circle.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} control {{was not without}} dispute, however, with both Vale Royal Abbey and St Peter's Abbey, Gloucester {{claiming}} the valuable church advowson. Legal action dragged <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> years, before Vale Royal Abbey ultimately prevailed. Control was also challenged by the Crown itself in 1398, and by Strata Florida Abbey in 1435. Vale Royal found keeping the appropriated church difficult, with the locals being at times difficult (for reasons that were not hard to discover).|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time when perched.

Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E

A mix CD containing 18 tracks of Gregson-Williams' work was sent to his office. Flattered by the research put into creating the CD (as some of the tracks were unreleased, and that what tracks he'd worked <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> films were undocumented), he joined the project soon after.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{recorded}} rituals we know of is Niiname-sai, the ceremony in which the Emperor offers newly harvested rice to the kami to secure their blessing for a bountiful harvest. A yearly festival, Niiname-sai is also performed when a new Emperor comes to power, in which case it is called Onamesai. In the ceremony the Emperor offers crops from the new harvest to the kami, including rice, fish, fruits, soup, and stew. The Emperor first feasts with the deities, then the guests. The feast could go <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time; for example, the Showa Emperor's feast spanned two days.|$|E

References to the Sifra {{from the time of the}} early medieval rabbis (and after) are to the text extant today. The core of this text developed in the mid-3rd century as a critique and commentary of the Mishnah, although subsequent additions and editing went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time afterwards.|$|E

According to one estimate, the native population {{in and around the}} missions proper was approximately 80,000 {{at the time of the}} confiscation; others claim that the statewide population had dwindled to approximately 100,000 by the early 1840s, due in no small part to the natives' exposure to European diseases, and from the Franciscan practice of cloistering women in the convento and controlling sexuality during the child-bearing age. (Baja California Territory experienced a similar reduction in native population resulting from Spanish colonization efforts there).|$|E
25|$|Once {{the siege}} began, the Thebans fought desperately, fearing for their homes, wives and children. The battle went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time, {{and it was}} in doubt. However, Alexander sent in his {{reserves}} and the situation started to improve. Despite the Theban's valiant struggle, however, Alexander noticed that a unit of their guard had abandoned one of the gates. It is here that he sent Perdiccas troops to enter and penetrate into the city itself. At this point, realizing that the fight for the city walls was a lost cause, the Thebans retreated and began their final battle within the city itself. It was around this time that Philotas and his garrison broke out of the citadel and began fighting in the battle as well.|$|E
25|$|The battle went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> {{time with}} no clear victor, but the Syracusans {{eventually}} pushed the Athenian ships toward the coast, and the Athenian crews fled to the camp behind their wall. Demosthenes suggested that they man the ships again and attempt to force their way out, as now both fleets had lost about half their ships and Nicias agreed. The men themselves {{did not want to}} board the ship because they were afraid. They then decided to retreat by land. Hermocrates sent some supposed informers to the Athenians to falsely report that there were spies and roadblocks further inland, so the Athenians would be safer if they did not march away. Gylippus used this delay to build the roadblocks that did not yet exist, and the Syracusans burned or towed away the Athenian ships on the beach, so that they had no way off the island.|$|E

Tender goes wandering around, trying {{to meet up with}} Fertility, which he finally does in a men's bathroom where they've taken adjacent stalls. Adam appears then with a gun, and reveals that he's already laid a trap to kill Tender's agent the same way he killed the caseworker, so that Tender would be suspect for both murders. Fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the Super Bowl, and comes up with a plan for Tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape. Adam, intending this all along, plans to escape with Tender and Fertility. Agreed on their course of action, the three part.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{leaders have}} often been {{prominent}} among those who considered smoking immoral or outright blasphemous. In 1634 the Patriarch of Moscow forbade the sale of tobacco, and sentenced {{men and women who}} flouted the ban to have their nostrils slit and their backs flayed. The Western church leader Urban VII likewise condemned smoking on holy places in a papal bull of 1624. Despite some concerted efforts, restrictions and bans were largely ignored. When James I of England, a staunch anti-smoker and the author of A Counterblaste to Tobacco, tried to curb the new trend by enforcing a 4000% tax increase on tobacco in 1604 it was unsuccessful, as suggested by the presence of around 7,000 tobacco outlets in London by the early 17th century. From this point <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> centuries, several administrations withdrew from efforts at discouragement and instead turned tobacco trade and cultivation into sometimes lucrative government monopolies.|$|E
25|$|Chiume later drew {{attention}} to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating {{their opposition to the}} post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them. Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots had been going <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response. The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.|$|E
