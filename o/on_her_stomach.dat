25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E

In one scene in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", {{she appears to}} Michael in the hospital as a nurse with blankets <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> representing the position she was in when she was shot. This {{turns out to be}} a dream. She even follows him in the freighter Kahana, where she tries to trick Michael into not pushing a button, which he pushes anyway.

2500|$|Bands {{would often}} attempt to reappropriate {{derogatory}} phrases like [...] "cunt", [...] "bitch", [...] "dyke", and [...] "slut", writing them proudly on their skin with lipstick or fat markers. Kathleen Hanna was writing [...] "slut" [...] <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> at shows {{as early as}} 1992, intentionally fusing feminist art and activist practices. Riot grrrls making political statements to reclaim phrases is a common theme among third-wave feminists.

Right {{extremity}} rash A 31 -year-old Caucasian female {{presented to}} the emergency department (ED) with chief complaint of a gradually progressive right extremity rash for past two days. The patient described a warm, red area over the dorsum of her forearm. The lesion began as a small spot that overnight came to involve most of the arm. The patient, who had similar episodes in the past <b>on</b> <b>her</b> back, <b>stomach,</b> and legs, had been on multiple topical and systemic steroids and antihistamines for this same presentation and had just finished a prednisone taper.

5000|$|... 17th century: Catherine Monvoisin and {{the priest}} Étienne Guibourg {{performed}} [...] "Black Masses" [...] for Madame de Montespan, the mistress of King Louis XIV of France. Since a criminal investigation — L'affaire des poisons ("Affair of the Poisons") — was launched (resulting in the execution of Monvoisin and the imprisonment of Guibourg) many details of their Black Mass have come down to us. It was a typical Roman Catholic Mass, but modified according to certain formulas (some reminiscent of the Latin Sworn Book of Honorius, or its French version, The Grimoire of Pope Honorius) and featuring the King's mistress (the Marquise de Montespan) as the central altar of worship, lying naked upon the altar with the chalice <b>on</b> <b>her</b> bare <b>stomach,</b> and holding two black candles in each of her outstretched arms. The Host was consecrated <b>on</b> <b>her</b> body, and then used in love potions designed to gain {{the love of the}} King (on account of the magical power believed to be in the consecrated Host). From these images of the Guibourg mass, further developments of the Black Mass derived.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the next}} sejm in May–July 1550, no one {{objected to the}} marriage. Therefore, while neither the sejm nor the senate gave an express permission, Barbara was crowned as Queen of Poland on 7 December 1550 in Wawel Cathedral by Mikołaj III Dzierzgowski, Archbishop of Gniezno. However, her reign lasted only five months. Almost since her wedding in 1547, she complained of poor health, {{particularly}} of stomach pain or [...] "internal stones". After the coronation her health took a turn for worse. She had fever, stomach pain, lost appetite. A lump appeared <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> full of pus. Sigismund Augustus asked to send women healers, including a Jewish woman, from Lithuania.|$|E
2500|$|J.T., {{wounded and}} lying beside his dying brother, stays behind to {{detonate}} explosives {{to eliminate the}} remaining zombies while the others flee. The survivors make plans to escape by stealing helicopters but must fight past the remaining zombies. Abby dies, along with hope for a cure, when a ballistic projectile blows his head up. The survivors use the blade tips of their helicopter to kill the rest. However, while saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. In the epilogue, Cherry, now sporting a minigun leg, leads the group and many more survivors to the Caribbean beach at Tulum, where they start a peaceful new society during a world-wide zombie outbreak. It is also revealed that Cherry has given birth to El Wray's daughter (alluded to earlier during El Wray's final scene when {{he puts his hand}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> and restates his motto [...] "I never miss").|$|E

However, she suffered an injury to her leg just two weeks prior to the event and had to use a high dose of anti-inflammatory drugs. This had an adverse effect <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> hindering food absorption. She ended up withdrawing from the race after [...] Five days later she started in the 10,000 metres but, still suffering from the effects of the marathon, retired with eight laps remaining.

Daniel also died of asphyxiation, without signs of restraint. He had internal injuries to the throat area, but no bruises, indicating he may have been killed by a choke. Chris killed Nancy on Friday, Daniel on Saturday, then asphyxiated himself with the cord of a weight machine in his basement early Sunday morning.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{this really}} {{was not a}} cliffhanger, {{the end of the}} fifth episode of the {{original}} Dallas miniseries saw J.R. go up to the loft of the barn to talk to Pam, who had gone up there to find her cousin Jimmy, after Digger had fallen off the wagon at the Ewing barbecue. J.R., intoxicated, tries to convince her to tell Bobby not to leave the ranch. However, she {{does not want to be}} bothered, and, in trying to escape J.R., she falls from the loft, landing square <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> Pam, who is pregnant, miscarries her unborn child. Later, Sue Ellen questions J.R. as to whether it was really an accident or did he mean for Pam to fall on purpose. J.R. says, [...] "I did not."

2500|$|In April 1976, Ted was {{planting}} {{trees on}} his apple farm {{when one of}} his neighbor's kids mentioned that he and his friends were buying women's magazines to get pictures of a then-unknown blond beauty, Farrah Fawcett.

[...] Ted wanted a bikini shot, but Fawcett instead used a one-piece red swimsuit to hide a large scar <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach.</b> [...] The poster, with Fawcett's right nipple protruding very visibly through the swimsuit material, was released around {{the same time as the}} TV series starring Fawcett Charlie's Angels aired. [...] The swimsuit poster with the visible nipple pointed outward, the first time such a thing occurred in the USA on a poster, went on to sell millions of copies - unheard of in the poster business - and it became known as the [...] "Farrah Phenomenon" [...] which propelled Pro Arts into a multimillion-dollar company.|$|E

5000|$|Also in May 2012 a {{story was}} {{published}} by the New York Daily News under the headline 'Cantor Fitzgerald VP was boss from hell, secretary says in suit' which reported on a lawsuit brought against the company by former employee Crystal Mitchell. Mitchell worked as an executive assistant to Michael Lampert at BGC USA, an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, in March 2011. According to the suit filed by her lawyer David Harrison, her boss once threw {{a cup of tea}} at her because she hadn't removed the teabag. [...] "The boiling hot liquid spilled <b>on</b> Mitchell, burning <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> and upper leg, and staining her clothes.” the suit said, adding that “Almost daily, Lampert humiliated and degraded Mitchell, yelling at her as if she was inferior and calling her: ‘stupid,’ ‘moron,’ ‘the dumbest person I ever met,’ ‘incompetent,’ and ‘idiot,’ ”. Elsewhere in the discrimination suit, she says she complained about the treatment to human resource managers — but her pleas for help were ignored.|$|R

Thus the apple may have looked at Newton before it fell.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} she began to run more slowly, and {{every two or three}} steps she would look ahead. Suddenly her eyes snapped, and she began to creep almost flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> just as she had crept for Peter Rabbit. But it wasn't Peter Rabbit this time. It was--who do you think? Jimmy Skunk! Yes, Sir, it was Jimmy Skunk. He was slowly ambling along, for Jimmy Skunk never hurries. Every big stick or stone that he could move, he would pull over or look under, for Jimmy Skunk was hunting for beetles.|$|E
6000|$|She {{wasted no}} time {{thinking}} about it, but began to steal back {{the way she had}} come. Now, no one is lighter of foot than old Granny Fox, and no one knows better how to keep out of sight. From tree to tree she crawled, sometimes flat <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> until at last she reached the foot of the hill where she had just had such a fright. There was nothing to be seen there, but {{up at the top of}} the hill she saw something that made a fierce, angry gleam come into her yellow eyes. Then she smiled grimly. [...] "The last laugh always is the best laugh, and this time I guess it is going to be mine," [...] she said to herself. Very slowly and carefully, so as not to so much as rustle a leaf, she began to crawl around so as to come up on the back side of the hill.|$|E

Turning over <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> after the manner of babies, she lowered her feet to the ground. Having obtained a foothold, she turned herself about and proceeded, with sturdy steps, to a baby-carriage near by which had attracted her attention. This carriage, which was unattended, contained a baby, somewhat smaller and younger than Corinne, who sat up and gazed with youthful interest at the visitor who stood by the side of her vehicle. Corinne examined, with a critical eye, the carriage and its occupant. She looked at the soft pillow at the baby's back, and regarded with admiration the afghan crocheted in gay colors which was spread over its lap, and the spacious gig-top which shielded it from the sun. She stooped down and looked at the wheels, and stood up and gazed at the blue eyes and canary hair of the little occupant. Then, in quiet but decided tones, Corinne said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Since Amelia's {{introduction}} to the regiment, George began to be rather ashamed {{of some of the}} company to which he had been forced to present her; and determined, as he told Dobbin (with what satisfaction to the latter it need not be said), to exchange into some better regiment soon, and to get his wife away from those damned vulgar women. But this vulgarity of being ashamed of one's society is much more common among men than women (except very great ladies of fashion, who, to be sure, indulge in it); and Mrs. Amelia, a natural and unaffected person, had none of that artificial shamefacedness which her husband mistook for delicacy on his own part. Thus Mrs. O'Dowd had a cock's plume in her hat, and a very large [...] "repayther" [...] <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> which she used to ring on all occasions, narrating how it had been presented to her by her fawther, as she stipt into the car'ge after her mar'ge; and these ornaments, with other outward peculiarities of the Major's wife, gave excruciating agonies to Captain Osborne, when his wife and the Major's came in contact; whereas Amelia was only amused by the honest lady's eccentricities, and not in the least ashamed of her company.|$|E
6000|$|He {{could see}} for himself that Mr. and Mrs. Day had {{not at all}} her grand air. They were fat plain serious people who {{sat side by side}} on the deck for hours and looked {{straight}} before them. Mrs. Day had a white face, large cheeks and small eyes: her forehead was surrounded with a multitude of little tight black curls; her lips moved as if she had always a lozenge in her mouth. She wore entwined about her head an article which Mrs. Dangerfield spoke of as a [...] "nuby," [...] a knitted pink scarf concealing her hair, encircling her neck and having among its convolutions a hole for her perfectly expressionless face. Her hands were folded <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> and in her still, swathed figure her little bead-like eyes, which occasionally changed their direction, alone represented life. Her husband had a stiff grey beard on his chin and a bare spacious upper lip, to which constant shaving had imparted a hard glaze. His eyebrows were thick and his nostrils wide, and when he was uncovered, in the saloon, it was visible that his grizzled hair was dense and perpendicular. He might have looked rather grim and truculent hadn't it been for the mild familiar accommodating gaze with which his large light-coloured pupils--the leisurely eyes of a silent man--appeared to consider surrounding objects. He was evidently more friendly than fierce, but he was more diffident than friendly. He liked to have you in sight, but wouldn't have pretended to understand you much or to classify you, and would have been sorry it should put you under an obligation. He and his wife spoke sometimes, but seldom talked, and there was something vague and patient in them, as if they had become victims of a wrought spell. The spell however was of no sinister cast; it was the fascination of prosperity, the confidence of security, which sometimes makes people arrogant, but which had had such a different effect on this simple satisfied pair, in whom further development of every kind appeared to have been happily arrested.|$|E
