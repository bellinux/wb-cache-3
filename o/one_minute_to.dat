5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> go. But then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E

After {{trailing}} 3–1 to Bolton Wanderers with twenty {{minutes to go}} at Wembley, Matthews inspired a turnaround in fortunes as Blackpool triumphed 4–3, thanks to a hat-trick by Mortensen, the only such feat to have occurred in an FA Cup final. Blackpool equalised with <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> go, and then, courtesy of Bill Perry, scored the winner in stoppage time, lifting the club to {{the high point of}} their 66-year history.

25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems. The questionnaire takes less than <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>to</b> administer, and is often used in primary care or other general settings as a quick screening tool {{rather than as an}} in-depth interview for those who have alcoholism. The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E

Example prompts have included: [...] "It {{has been said about}} our modern times that, 'Invention is the mother of necessity.'

[...] In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges. In the essay event, students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum.|$|E
