40|$|A {{detailed}} optimal parametric {{study is}} performed for a tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) in suppressing the pitching vibration of structures. Due {{to the difficulty}} of finding analytical solutions for the damped structure, a numerical optimization approach is proposed and applied to the system to find the optimum TLCD parameters. The variations of the optimum control parameter with system parameters are determined and discussed. Using various numerical searching data, a set of practical design formulas for the optimum tuning ratio and <b>optimum</b> <b>head</b> loss coefficient of the TLCD are then derived through regression analysis. The comparison between practical design formula and numerical optimization shows a very close agreement between the two results. The practical design formulas provide a convenient tool for designers. In order to account for the possible effects of structural uncertainties, a parametric sensitivity study on the detuning of optimum damper parameters is also carried out. It is found that the detuning effect is more severe for low damped structure with lower ratios of mass moment of inertia, especially for the detuning of tuning ratio.

40|$|Building {{vibration}} {{has become}} one of the major concerns to structural engineers. Being a vibration absorber, a tuned liquid column damper (TLCD) not only suppresses building vibration, but also acts as the water storage facility of a building. In view of this, the application Of Such damper is particularly suited for building structures. However, due to inherent nonlinear liquid damping, it is no doubt that a great deal of computational effort is required to search the optimum parameters of TLCD numerically. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a closed form solution scheme of TLCD-structure systems and the optimum parameters of TLCD that lead to the maximum vibration reduction of building structure, so as to facilitate the design of dampers. The developed closed form solution of TLCD-structure system is verified by comparing results obtained from the conventional iterative method. After having a satisfactory verification, the existence of the invariant points of a TLCD-structure system for the case of undamped primary structure is demonstrated. Explicit design formulas of TLCD for the case of undamped primary structures are obtained by optimizing the response at the two invariant points. The optimum parameters of TLCD for the case of damped primary structures are also investigated numerically. An approach for determining the <b>optimum</b> <b>head</b> loss coefficient of TLCD is proposed. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the design procedures of TLCD for suppressing harmonic type vibrations (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Water {{is central}} to survival, without water human, plant and animal life would be impossible. Therefore supply of water {{has become one of}} the {{fundamental}} requirements of any society and the need to transfer water has generated the design of various forms of mechanical devices, which can be categorized as pumps. Jet pump is a device that performs its pumping action by the transfer of energy from a high velocity supply jet to one of low velocity suction flow. These two flows mix in the mixing tube and the kinetic energy of the combined flow is converted partially into the pressure energy in the diffuser. The optimization of the design of multi hole nozzle jet pump with various pitch circle diameter (PCD) and five different diameter mixing tubes. The area ratios chosen have been modified and the final area ratios used were R = 0. 20, 0. 28, 0. 36, 0. 43 & 0. 50. From the graphs, head ratio at zero discharge ratios (No), discharge ratio at zero head ratio (Mo) and slope of M-N (m) curve were noted along with the extrapolated values of maximum efficiency (�bep), optimum discharge ratio (Mopt), and <b>optimum</b> <b>head</b> ratio (Nopt) and tabulated. In order to distinguish these nozzle plates from these charts one can conclude that efficiency is higher at lower pitch circle diameter, lower mixing tube diameter and higher area ratios. In the range of experiments conducted highest maximum efficiency was obtained for an area ratio of 0. 43 with 2 holes on 13 PCD with 25. 9 mm mixing tube...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{seawater}} inlet with {{a surface}} area of 6 km 2 was assessed for {{the potential to be}} used as a 100 MW, low head, high flow, sea water pumped hydro energy storage system. The capital cost was estimated to be recouped after a number of years and the plant has a predicted energy storage capacity of 320 MWh. National and international policies are driving the increased penetration of solar and wind energy onto the electricity networks, in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Transmissions System Operators depend on ancillary services such as spinning reserve from thermal generators or pumped hydro systems to enhance grid stability. The increased penetration of renewable energy onto the electricity grid is driving a demand for greater capacity in the area of energy storage. This research presents a case study, which is a technical and economical appraisal of using an inland sea water reservoir to store energy. This project involves building a seawater dam around an existing natural inlet, and placing turbines at the mouth of the inlet. As part of the study an evaluation of current pumped hydro, seawater storage, and tidal barrages was carried out. The optimum design of the low head, high flow rate seawater energy storage facility was determined for the seawater inlet and different scenarios for the <b>optimum</b> <b>head</b> and flow rates are presented for analysis. Using low-head, high-flow seawater storage near the coast, greatly reduces the danger of contamination of inland freshwater supplies, thus reducing the environmental impact of pumped seawater energy storage. This research indicates that sea water pumped hydro energy storage with a high flow rate and low head is technically and economically feasible for increasing the ability of national grids to allow high penetration of intermittent renewable energy...|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} {{sensitivity}} of inter-subspecific hybrid rice to climatic conditions, the spikelet fertilized rate (SFR) of four types of rice including indica-japonica hybrid, intermediate hybrid, indica and japonica were analyzed during 2000 – 2004. The inter-subspecific hybrids showed lower SFR, and much higher fluctuation under various climatic conditions than indica and japonica rice, showing the inter-subspecific hybrids were sensitive to ecological conditions. Among 12 climatic factors, the key factor affecting rice SFR was temperature, with the most significant factor being the average temperature of the seven days around panicle flowering (T 7). A regressive equation of SFR-temperature by T 7, and a comprehensive synthetic model by four important temperature indices were put forward. The optimum temperature for inter-subspecific hybrids {{was estimated to be}} 26. 1 – 26. 6 °C, and lower limit of safe temperature to be 22. 5 – 23. 3 °C for panicle flowering, showing higher by averagely 0. 5 °C and 1. 7 °C, respectively, to be compared with indica and japonica rice. This suggested that inter-subspecific hybrids require proper climatic conditions. During panicle flowering, the suitable daily average temperature was 23. 3 – 29. 0 °C, with the fittest one at 26. 1 – 26. 6 °C.

However, pasta 2 ̆ 7 s highest margins {{are derived from}} the sale of speciality items. These items include Stuffing Shells, Lasagna and Manicotti. Because corporate profits are affected by the sales mix ratio of speciality items to other pasta categories, pasta companies strive to increase their market share of speciality items.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are {{becoming}} ubiquitous {{in everyday life}} due to their applications in weather forecasting, surveillance, implantable sensors for health monitoring and other plethora of applications. WSN is equipped with hundreds and thousands of small sensor nodes. As {{the size of a}} sensor node decreases, critical issues such as limited energy, computation time and limited memory become even more highlighted. In such a case, network lifetime mainly depends on efficient use of available resources. Organizing nearby nodes into clusters make it convenient to efficiently manage each cluster as well as the overall network. In this paper, we extend our previous work of grid-based hybrid network deployment approach, in which merge and split technique has been proposed to construct network topology. Constructing topology through our proposed technique, in this paper we have used analytical network process (ANP) model for cluster head selection in WSN. Five distinct parameters: distance from nodes (DistNode), residual energy level (REL), distance from centroid (DistCent), number of times the node has been selected as cluster head (TCH) and merged node (MN) are considered for CH selection. The problem of CH selection based on these parameters is tackled as a multi criteria decision system, for which ANP method is used for <b>optimum</b> cluster <b>head</b> selection. Main contribution of this work is to check the applicability of ANP model for cluster head selection in WSN. In addition, sensitivity analysis is carried out to check the stability of alternatives (available candidate nodes) and their ranking for different scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing energy efficient clustering protocols in terms of optimum CH selection and minimizing CH reselection process that results in extending overall network lifetime.

40|$|The {{results showed}} that the average farm gate price of both milk and meat from buffalo was less than the average {{international}} market, but it was much lesser for milk than meat. Therefore, the development plan should focus upon raising buffalo milk productivity, particularly that milk price projection, as shown in the introduction, would reach 2. 5 folds its current level due to speed demand increase and slow production growth. Among the major targets towards raising milk productivity from the Egyptian buffaloes herd are the annual milk yield per milking head and the herd structure, particularly the proportion of milking herd in the stock. Although milk yield per milking buffalo has raised from 940 kilograms in 1990 to about 1402 in 2006, and at a higher annual growth rate of 2. 5 %, than the world average (2 %), it was less than the comparable milk yield level of the world average. The world aggregate average reached only 1537 kilograms per milking buffalo in 2006, i. e. higher than the same year average of Egypt by 8. 8 %, (Table 10), (Figure 1). Although the proportion of the milking buffaloes in the total herd of Egypt was significantly higher than the world average (Table 11) along the last two decades (Figure 2), it has shown a rate of decrease by about - 0. 6 % a year. In addition, the <b>optimum</b> milking <b>heads</b> proportion in total herd structure should be 50 %, (Mohammed Sharaf, Ibrahim Soliman & Ahmed Seleem, 1987). Accordingly as the percentage of milking buffaloes in the Egyptian stock reached 42 % in the year 2006, such percentage should be raised by 19 % above its current level to approach 50 %. Therefore, if the development plan oriented the credit policies, veterinary care programs and feeding plan of buffaloes towards reaching the target improvement of buffalo milk productivity, the total milk production of Egypt would be raised by about 29 %. ...|$|R
