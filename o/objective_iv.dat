40|$|M. Cur. The {{learning}} accompanists (nurse educator), in the didactic situation {{within the}} context of a nursing college, is midst a process of transformation. This transformation has a direct influence on the learning accompanists didactic role fulfilment. Didactic support systems enables the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. These didactic support systems should be managed during the process of transformation, in such a way that it enables the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. A new creative approach to the management of the didactic situation is necessary. The goal of this study is to describe guidelines for the management of didactic support systems, at a nursing college, to enable the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. An inductive, qualitative, contextual, exploring, descriptive strategy is used to reach the goal of the study. The background and rationale of the study are described, the problem is stated as well as a central theoretical statement. The assumptions of the study are described within the framework of the nursing theory for the whole person. No explicit theoretical assumptions are made, so that the researcher is open to empirical findings and to prevent pre-conceived ideas. The methodological assumptions is based on the Botes research model. No explicit conceptual framework is used as point of departure. Because the participants are midst a process of transformation, their knowledge and experience are used as source of data, as they can express their needs and views the best. The goal of this study is reached by setting four objectives. Objective I is to explore and describe the learning accompanists need for didactic support systems, {{within the context}} of a nursing college. Objective II is to explore and describe the managements views with regard to the way they can give didactic support, {{within the context of}} a nursing college. Objective III is to describe a conceptual framework. <b>Objective</b> <b>IV</b> is derived from objective I, objective II and objective III. <b>Objective</b> <b>IV</b> is the description of guidelines for the management of didactic support systems at a nursing college. To attain objective I, exploring is done by means of interviews with learning accompanist's. One semi-structured question is: "What are your needs for didactic support systems in the college?" To attain objective II, exploring is done by means of individual interviews with role players. One central question is set: "How can you give didactic support to the learning accompanist?" The interviews are conducted by an independent moderator/interviewer and assistant. Data is recorded by means of audio tapes and field notes, whereafter transcription takes place. Data is coded by the researcher and an assistent coder. The data analysis is done through a systematic approach of text analysis, as described by Tesch (in Cresswell, 1995 : 155). Thereafter the empirical findings of objective I and objective II are described. The interpretations are grounded by statements from the empirical data. Statements (n = 57) are formulated from the empirical findings of objective I and objective II. From these statements (n = 57) a list of concepts are generated. These concepts are utilized to attain objective III, the describing of a conceptual framework. The survey list of Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach (1968) is utilized to describe the conceptual framework in a structured manner. Data collection is done through a literature search to correlate the empirical findings with the literature. During the description of the conceptual framework conclusion statements (n = 15) are made. These conclusion statements are utilized to attain <b>objective</b> <b>IV.</b> <b>Objective</b> <b>IV</b> is to describe guidelines for the management of didactic support systems at a nursing college. Through logical inferention 12 guidelines and possible operationalisation of each are described. The uniqueness of the study lies in the relevance within the current time frame context and that it expresses the needs of the learner accompanists and the views of the managers at a nursing college. An abundance of possibilities for further research are created...|$|E

40|$|A {{functional}} ecology {{approach was}} combined with floristic studies to seek increased ecological understanding of forest characteristics and {{processes in the}} Central Highlands of Chiapas State, Mexico. The study had two main aims: 1) to determine the major ecological factors driving the floristic and functional variation of forest ecosystems, with emphasis on the operation of either environmental (niche model) or spatial (dispersal limitation model) factors and 2) to determine the relationship of leaf-litter decomposition rates to both leaf functional traits and forest conditions. For this, the specific objectives were i), characterise both the dominant species and the forest stands they form using functional traits, determining also the trait-trait and species-trait relationships; ii), characterise the floristic and functional variation amongst forest stands, {{and the relationship of}} this variation with spatial and environmental variables; iii) determine the influence of spatial factors, climate variables, anthropogenic disturbance, forest canopy openness and the traits of species on the abundance of saplings and iv), determine the effect of species leaf trait values, forest type, and their interaction, on leaf-litter decomposition. The study area encompassed a narrow altitudinal range from 2100 to 2800 m a. s. l., located on a carboniferous limestone substrate with abrupt topography and a cool and humid climate. For objectives i), ii) and iii), both adult trees and saplings were counted, measured and identified in field plots in four previously-defined forest types –oak forest, pine-oak forest, pine forest and broadleaved forest– at seven study sites. Plots were characterised in terms of spatial location, altitude above sea level and climate variables from Worldclim climate surfaces. Leaf, stem and whole-plant traits, as well as leaf carbon fractions, were measured for dominant species, and saplings were sampled under both closed and open canopies. For <b>objective</b> <b>iv),</b> first, leaf litter decomposition rates of 20 dominant species were measured in a greenhouse experiment for the assessment of trait effects and second, decomposition rates of representative litter from each forest type, plus two standard species, were measured in a field experiment using forest type as the main factor. Forests of the study area are a mosaic in which three main functional groups of species were identified (objective i). Two groups were respectively dominated by Quercus species and Pinus species, which both reach the canopy or sub-canopy layers of the forests and had high wood density, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and other trait values suggesting relatively slow growth. The third group contained a wide taxonomic range of species that generally develop in the forest understorey and had high specific leaf area, leaf nutrient contents and other trait values suggesting relatively high rates of growth and population turnover. These three functional groups of species form a variety of floristic assemblages, ranging from those of simple structure and low floristic diversity (mostly pine forests) to complex and diverse broad-leaved forests. Most oak and pine-oak forests had intermediate characteristics. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the floristic variation of both adults and saplings was related to climate but also to spatial factors, suggesting an important role of dispersal limitation in the shaping of species assemblages (objectives ii and iii). In contrast, variation partitioning also showed that forest functional characteristics –measured using weighted mean trait values– were strongly linked to human disturbance, suggesting that people have had strong effects on the ecological functions of these forests (objective ii). Additionally, floristic variation among forest stands was not always accompanied by functional variation, suggesting that floristics can change across space while forest functional characteristics remain relatively homogeneous. Regarding objective (iii), leaf area was the only species functional trait with a clear relationship to the absolute densities of saplings, suggesting that the abundance of regeneration increases with increasing leaf area, though the effect of canopy openness was small. Finally, for <b>objective</b> <b>iv),</b> the greenhouse experiment showed that Quercus spp. and Pinus spp. with tough leaves had relatively slow decomposition rates and species with lower LDMC and associated tradeoffs in trait values, such as high specific leaf area, had higher decomposition rates. In the field experiment (<b>objective</b> <b>iv),</b> decomposition rates did not vary significantly between the four different forest types, supporting the hypothesis that persistent leaf characteristics of species, rather than forest functional characteristics and environment, are the most important controls on decomposition. Nevertheless, there was evidence that litter mixtures tended to show higher decomposition rates in forest associations where they were collected, than in other forest associations (the “home-field advantage” hypothesis). This result suggests probable variations in leaf-litter substrates determined by forest functional composition. It is believed {{that this is the first}} study to apply a functional traits approach to understanding variation of forest ecological characteristics and processes in Mesoamerican mountains. The study shows that dispersal limitation, as well as environmental and anthropogenic factors, probably influences the characteristics of forest stands, and that the degree of functional variation may be smaller than that of floristic variation. The study demonstrates that leaf trait values of dominant tree species influence litter decomposition rates and therefore, potentially, nutrient cycling. Even though litter decomposition rates in the field were most likely to be affected by leaf and litter characteristics, not forest environment, there was evidence for a home-field advantage effect. In the current era of anthropogenic global change effects on the forests of Chiapas, this work sheds new light on forest function and forest change and has special relevance for the design of conservation strategies for the tropical montane ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Background: Infancy {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} periods of human development, yet developmental delay during this period is a condition largely undiagnosed and uncared for. In addition, the life course importance of infant development to adult socio-economic position has yet to be examined. Aims and objectives: To perform a life course study of infant developmental delay to: further the understanding of the pre- and perinatal factors which influence it (Objective I), evaluate the potential of utilising available information during the pre- and perinatal period to improve identification of infant developmental delay (Objective 11), and evaluate the links between infant developmental delay and socio-economic position in adulthood (Objective Ill) and social mobility (<b>Objective</b> <b>IV).</b> Methods: The study used data from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NFBC 1966) (n= 12, 231 children). Delay was assessed through measures of infant motor and language development. Findings relevant to Objectives I and 11 were validated in a second, UK- based, birth cohort - the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). Results: i) 27 pre- and perinatal factors were available, of which 8 were significantly associated with motor or language delay, ii) The identified factors were significant predictors of delay in both cohorts, particularly in high-risk newborns, iii) Infant developmental delay was associated with indicators of socio-economic position in adulthood, iv) Developmentally delayed infants were more likely to be downward socially mobile and less likely to be upward socially mobile throughout the life course than non- delayed infants. Conclusions: Information on a limited number of pre- and perinatal factors may facilitate identification of developmental delay in high-risk newborns. Infant developmental delay is associated with indicators of socio-economic position in adulthood, highlighting the importance of early life development to human capital formation. Part of the socio- economic inequality observed throughout the life course can be traced back to infancy, where delayed development can set individuals on disadvantageous socio-economic trajectories.

40|$|Background and objectives: Most {{patients}} (70 - 80 %) {{with acute}} ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke exhibit a high systemic blood pressure (BP) on {{admission to hospital}} {{even in the absence}} of a history of hypertension (= 50 %). In matched-control patients admitted to hospital for other acute diseases the proportion of high BP is only 36 %. For most patients this high initial BP falls spontaneously without anti-hypertensive treatments over the next few days. The cause and exact mechanism of high BP during the acute phase of stroke is still unknown and mental stress is often suggested as a main contributing factor. There is conflicting evidence regarding the relationship between high initial BP, lowering of high initial BP and outcome after acute stroke. The objectives of this thesis were (I) to examine the relationship between nimodipine (a calcium channel blocker) induced reduction of BP and outcome, 01) to evaluate the relationship between high initial BP and outcome, (III) to investigate whether heterogeneity exists between stroke subtypes in the response to BP lowering treatment and (IV) to investigate the relationship between BP and stress as evaluated by salivary cortisol and psychological tests in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Subjects & methods: To fulfil objectives I-III, a dataset from a previously performed clinical trial (Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial, INWEST) was analysed and to fulfil <b>objective</b> <b>IV,</b> a prospective study was performed. In both studies, patients with a clinical diagnosis of stroke (within 24 -hours of symptoms onset) were studied after exclusion of haemorrhage by computer tomography scans. In INWEST, patients were consecutively all ocated to placebo (n= 100), 1 mg/hour (low-dose) intravenous (i. v.) nimodipine (n= 101) or 2 mg/hour (high-dose) i. v. nimodipine (n= 94) for 5 days followed by oral treatment for 16 days in a double blind manner. Thirty patients were excluded from the analysis (n= 8 in placebo, 8 and 14 in low-dose and high-dose group respectively). In the prospective study, 58 patients were recruited. BP and pulse rate was recorded by non-invasive automatic monitoring hourly for 24 -hours. Stress was evaluated by testing the level of salivary cortisol (4 -samples within 24 hours after inclusion) and psychological tests at the time of inclusion. Results & conclusion: Nimodipine treatment (i. v.) resulted in a statistically significant reduction of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) compared to placebo. In the high-dose nimodipine group, DBP reduction during the first 48 -hours but not SBP was associated with neurological worsening at 2 1 -days. A DBP reduction of > 20 % by high-dose nimodipine was associated with poor outcome of combined death or dependency (Barthel Index 160 / 90 mm Hg) had a poor functional outcome (combined death or dependency) at 21 -days compared to patients with normal initial BP (120 - 160 / 60 - 90 min Hg). Patients with low initial BP (< 120 / 60) also had a poor functional outcome compared to patients with normal initial BP (paper II). While classifying stroke according to the OCSP (Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project), 106 patients were identified as having Total Anterior Circulation Infarcts (TACI) with hemiparesis, dysphasia and homonymous hemianopia and 62 as non-TACI after exclusion of any of the above symptoms. Nimodipine treatment and BP change had no significant effect on outcome for TACT patients. For non-TACI patients, DBP reduction was associated with poor neurological outcome and high-dose minodipine worsened both neurological and functional outcome (paper III). A biological marker of stress, salivary cortisol, was positively related to 24 -hours SBP and night-time BP, suggesting that stress is a contributing factor for high BP in acute stroke. Psychological stress tests were difficult to perform in acute stroke and those performed did not correlate with BP or cortisol level (paper IV) ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the consulting and enabling function within the role set of communication managers and provides an initial theoretical framework for internal communication consulting in organizations. The idea of communication professionals as consultants and enablers of communication {{has already been}} introduced {{by a number of}} researchers. Nevertheless, the necessity of this task as well as the specific dimensions and practices of internal communication consulting and its various objectives, forms, and specifications have not been elaborated until now. This article takes an initial step towards closing this gap by developing a theoretical framework based on research in business consulting and existing public relations role models. After a short introduction (section I), the necessity of the consulting function will be emphasized by introducing the concept of the communicative organization, in which managing relationships by communication is part of every employee’s job profile (section II). In order to fulfill this requirement, communicative competencies in a much broader sense than traditional business and interpersonal communication have to be developed on a broad scale. This leads to a new challenge for communication professionals: they are asked to advise organizational members regarding communicative topics and to enable them to resolve communication-related issues as well as task-related issues (section III). Based on a review of the relevant streams of research in different disciplines, a framework for internal communication consulting has been constructed by combining the dimensions of consulting 2 forms and <b>objectives</b> (section <b>IV).</b> Qualitative interviews with communication executives of major European organizations have been conducted to verify the breadth and plausibility of this framework (section V). The article closes by outlining implications for the research, education, and practice of public relations (section VI) ...|$|R
40|$|Background and <b>Objective.</b> Using Collagen <b>IV</b> staining, we have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} reticular basement membrane (Rbm) is hypervascular and the lamina propria (LP) is hypovascular in COPD airways. This study compared Collagen IV staining with vessels marked with anti-Factor VIII and examined vessel permeability in bronchial biopsies from COPD and normal subjects using albumin staining. Results. Anti-Collagen IV antibody detected more vessels in the Rbm (P = 0. 002) and larger vessels in both Rbm (P < 0. 001) and LP (P = 0. 003) compared to Factor VIII. COPD airways had more vessels (with greater permeability) in the Rbm (P = 0. 01) and fewer vessels (with normal permeability) in the LP compared to controls with both Collagen IV and Factor VIII antibodies (P = 0. 04 and P = 0. 01). Conclusion. Rbm vessels were increased in number and were hyperpermeable in COPD airways. Anti-Collagen IV and anti-Factor VIII antibodies did not uniformly detect the same vessel populations; the first is likely to reflect larger and older vessels with the latter reflecting smaller, younger vessels...|$|R

40|$|Chromium, an {{important}} alloying element, {{has been added}} in ferrous and nickel based alloy such as stainless steels and Inconel alloy to improve the corrosion resistance. High corrosion resistance of structural materials in extremely high working temperature is one crucial R 2 ̆ 6 D <b>objective</b> of Gen <b>IV</b> nuclear power plants which propose to raise the thermal efficiency via high working temperature. A cellular automaton (CA) model based on the stochastic approach was proposed to simulate the process of oxidation and corrosion of structural material in flowing fluid. The relation of chromium concentration against oxide layer thickness during a specific period was found. The material containing a specific amount of chromium content shows the thinnest oxide layer on its surface, which shows the strongest ability of corrosion resistance The result of simulation is close to that of experiments, which demonstrates that the CA model will have potential to achieve {{the goal of this}} kind of study. Moreover, it not only brings the benefit to save considerably experimental time and resources but also helps researchers to find out the optimized chromium content for the best corrosion resistance...|$|R

From the overall perspective of the role and use of forensic science {{in the criminal justice}} system, the concepts of Forensic Information Value Added (FIVA) and Forensic Information Value Efficiency (FIVE) are introduced. From these concepts the key factors determining the added value of forensic investigations are discussed; Evidential Value, Relevance, Quality, Speed and Cost. By unravelling the added value of forensic science and combining this with the future needs and scientific and technological developments, six forensic grand challenges are introduced: i) Molecular Photo-fitting; ii) chemical imaging, profiling and age estimation of finger marks; iii) Advancing Forensic Medicine; <b>iv)</b> <b>Objective</b> Forensic Evaluation; v) the Digital Forensic Service Centre and vi) Real time In-Situ Chemical Identification. Finally, models for forensic innovation are presented that could lead to major international breakthroughs on all these six themes within a five year time span. This could cause a step change in the added value of forensic science and would make forensic investigative methods even more valuable than they already are today...|$|R
