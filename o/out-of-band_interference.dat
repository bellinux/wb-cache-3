40|$|For several years, the {{possibility}} of using non-iterative high-resolution (HR) spectral estimators instead of Fourier transform (FT) has received considerable attention in the NMR literature. Different approaches have been proposed, including maximum entropy methods, linear prediction (LP) methods, and state space methods. When used in good conditions, all these HR estimators present several advantages over the FT. However, limitations of these methods appear when attempting to process measured signals made of numerous data samples (over 10, 000) and/or containing a lot of resonances. As a reaction, last years, there was a renewed interest for parametric Frequency Selective (FS) approaches, a concept initially proposed in 1988 with the LP-ZOOM approach. Several new FS methods have been proposed which possess two features that make them efficient with high-complexity signals: high robustness against <b>out-of-band</b> <b>interferences</b> and low computational burden.

Since the apparent peakedness for a given transmitter depends {{on the characteristics of}} the receiver, in particular its bandwidth, an effective approach to mitigating the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>interference</b> can be as follows: (i) allow the initial stage of the receiver to have a relatively large bandwidth so that the transients are not excessively broadened and the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>interference</b> remains highly impulsive, then (ii) implement the final reduction of the bandwidth to within the specifications through nonlinear means, such as the analog filters described in [9 – 13]. For instance, the differential over-limiter (DoL) described in Appendix D is effective in mitigation of impulsive noise. Using DoL improves the signal-to-noise ratio and increases the data rates of a communication channel (e.g., GPS or WCDMA) in the presence of interchannel interference, for example, from WiFi transmissions.

Due to high ADC {{sampling rate}}, digital decimation filtering before the correlation processing is mandatory in such receivers from the implementation complexity point of view. Especially, in FFT-based processing, high sampling rate would lead to excessive FFT length [10, 16].

The impulsive nature of this interference provides an opportunity to reduce its power by nonlinear filtering, improving the quality of the receiver channel.

The challenge for the wireless designer is to design a radiator which operates below ground as well as to improve the communication performance of the wireless sensor system. In addition, the wireless sensor network was often limited by <b>out-of-band</b> strong <b>interference.</b> Therefore, adaptability to the electrical environment is the key factor for wireless communication. ^ In the first approach, a conventional cast-iron manhole cover was replaced with a composite manhole cover to create a radiator which is not only mechanically strong but also electrically functional. The utilization of parasitic antennas is explored to demonstrate the effect of limited beam scanning on a real sensor network system. The combination of an electronically steerable beamforming capability and an angular diversity technique in this antenna allowed the antenna to adapt to its radio environment and find an optimal receive characteristics. The sensor measurement result indicates that the intelligence of the antenna significantly improves packet reception rate and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication). In the second approach, the effect of an adaptive front end is investigated to mitigate these nearby interferers. The sensor motes operated at a fixed band, the unlicensed band of 900 MHz, and did not have the frequency adaptability of future cognitive radios. Yet, the effect was demonstrative of the potential benefits of adaptive preselect filtering. The measured result shows substantial improvements over the fixed band system by even slight tuning of the bandwidth and/or the center frequency of the preselect filter. Experimentally and numerically we show that both tuning in the filter bandwidth and/or center frequency can significantly improve the packet reception rate. A guideline for an optimized filtering technique is given to provide broad understanding of how the adaptable preselect filtering can be utilized. The optimal filtering point can be found based on frequency spectrum and filter attenuation response. ...|$|R

In this paper, we introduce a methodology for mitigating technogenic interference in communication channels by analog nonlinear filters, {{with an emphasis on}} the mitigation of <b>out-of-band</b> and adjacent-channel <b>interference.</b> Interference induced in a communications receiver by external transmitters can be viewed as wide-band non-Gaussian noise affecting a narrower-band signal of interest. This noise may contain a strong component within the receiver passband, which may dominate over the thermal noise. While the total wide-band interference seen by the receiver {{may or may not be}} impulsive, we demonstrate that the interfering component due to power emitted by the transmitter into the receiver channel is likely to appear impulsive under a wide range of conditions. We give an example of mechanisms of impulsive interference in digital communication systems resulting from the nonsmooth nature of any physically realizable modulation scheme for transmission of a digital (discontinuous) message. We show that impulsive interference can be effectively mitigated by nonlinear differential limiters (NDLs). An NDL can be configured to behave linearly when the input signal does not contain outliers. When outliers are encountered, the nonlinear response of the NDL limits the magnitude of the respective outliers in the output signal. The signal quality is improved in excess of that achievable by the respective linear filter, increasing the capacity of a communications channel. The behavior of an NDL, and its degree of nonlinearity, is controlled by a single parameter in a manner that enables significantly better overall suppression of the noise-containing impulsive components compared to the respective linear filter. Adaptive configurations of NDLs are similarly controlled by a single parameter and are suitable for improving quality of nonstationary signals under time-varying noise conditions. NDLs are designed to be fully compatible with existing linear devices and systems and to be used as an enhancement, or as a low-cost alternative, to the state-of-art interference mitigation methods.

40|$|The first {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop the interleaved frequency-division multiple-access (IFDMA) receiver with frequency domain equalization, low complexity and possibility to separate users in the frequency domain. Note {{that at the time}} the work on this thesis was started, the efficient IFDMA receiver was not developed and relationship between OFDMA and IFDMA systems were not yet understood. The IFDMA technique is introduced as a special case of the orthogonal frequency-division multipleaccess code division multiplexing (OFDMA-CDM). The proposed IFDMA transmitter does not have the computationally intensive discrete Fourier transform (DFT) operation and, thus, is more preferable than the conventional OFDMA and OFDMA-CDM transmitters. The concept of minimum shift keying (MSK) and Gaussian-shaped offset QPSK (GOQPSK) IFDMA is proposed. As a result of GOQPSK and MSK combination with IFDMA, the MSK/GOQPSKIFDMA transmit signal is generated without phase transitions and has better spectral properties than the conventional OFDMA transmit signal. The peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDMA, IFDMA and newly introduced GOQPSK- and MSK-IFDMA are compared. The cumulative distribution function of PAPR distribution is analyzed for the GSMK/MSK-IFDMA. As a reference, the conventional OFDMA and OFDMA-CDM systems are used. Finally, the circumstances under which PAPR distribution of GOQPSK-IFDMA outperforms the PAPR distribution of the conventional IFDMA are identified. The most valuable results is that IFDMA based systems can achieve the PAPR of single-carrier systems providing any required data rate for data transmission. The effect of frequency offsets on the performance of IFDMA uplink system is investigated using raised cosine (RC) window. It is shown that MAI caused by the frequency offsets can be reduced significantly if the RC window is applied instead of conventional rectangular window. Generally, frequency offset estimation in the uplink of multi-carrier systems is a complicated task, since the received signal at the BS comprises of the received signals from many users and each user can have its own frequency offset. Moreover, received signals from different users are distorted by different transmission channels which makes the problem of channel estimation complicated. A frequency domain algorithm for frequency offset estimation is proposed and its performance is investigated in the mobile radio channel. This algorithm utilizes pilot symbols and provides joint frequency offset and channel estimation. A special construction of pilot symbols with additional spreading in the time domain is proposed which allows reduction of the frequency offset estimation error. A practical time domain (TD) algorithm is evaluated which uses repetitive structure of the IFDMA transmit signal in the time domain. The TD algorithm is independent of the transmission channel and modulation alphabet. Statistical properties of the estimate are analyzed and proven analytically and by Monte-Carlo simulations. As a result, the obtained estimate is unbiased and is able to provide a reliable result at the SNR of practical interest. The proposed algorithm is compared with existing techniques and its superiority is proven. The optimum MMSE equalization technique for OFDM and IFDMA with windowing at the receiver is presented. As shown in literature, the application of the window in the receiver changes the received spectrum of each individual subcarrier. Varying the roll-off factor of the DFT window function and, therefore, changing the length of the prefix and postfix, MAI caused by the frequency offset can be reduced. The minimum mean square error algorithm which utilizes part of the energy invested into prefix and postfix for the equalization is proposed which allows to improve the BER of OFDM system with windowing. For simplicity, the proposed algorithm is presented for OFDM but can also be applied for IFDMA. Additionally, The SI of IFDMA systems is investigated in an independent Rayleigh channel and it is shown that IFDMA has significantly less SI than the conventional OFDMA-CDM. The IFDMA uplink system with non-linear amplifier is investigated and compared with OFDMA and OFDMA-CDM techniques in terms of passband <b>interference,</b> <b>out-of-band</b> radiation and BER performance.

This paper describes techniques to relax blocking and HD/IMD, and make HR robust to mismatch...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} bits {{required}} to accurately represent a received signal in a wireless system changes as the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>interference</b> is removed by an IIR digital filter, if the filtering is done in stages, such as second-order sections. Taking advantage of this fact can {{reduce the size of}} the datapath in a VLSI realization of a digital filter, and hence power and area can be saved without decreasing performance. An effective algorithm for computing this reduced {{number of bits}} to use for quantization after each stage is derived, and a scheme for optimally ordering the second-order sections is presented. Power savings range from 33 % to 50 %, depending on the amount of out-ofband interference. INTRODUCTION In mobile telecommunications systems, power consumption and DSP complexity are extremely important issues due to the desirability of small, lowpower mobile units. Here we introduce a technique for reducing datapath area and power-consumption in the front-end receivers of such systems with [...] ...|$|E
