5|$|Eve {{suffered}} from low viewership {{in spite of}} its high ratings among young Hispanic women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with The WB Television Network (The WB) to launch The CW in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of <b>other</b> <b>black</b> sitcoms, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and the number of roles for African American actors on television. Critical response to Eve was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to <b>other</b> <b>black</b> sitcoms. Despite the negative reception, the show and Eve received several award nominations. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{black college}} students 2 ̆ 7 reported experiences {{of pressure to}} demonstrate their racial connectedness to <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> while living {{away from home and}} attending a predominantly white university. Studies of black students 2 ̆ 7 academic performance reveals that some black students who academically excel are accused by <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> of “trying to act white” and of disassociating themselves from the black community. My sample consists of 48 African-American and Caribbean descent sophomores and seniors who attended the University of Connecticut at Storrs. I assessed these students 2 ̆ 7 levels of espoused loyalty to <b>other</b> <b>blacks,</b> their levels of interactions with <b>other</b> <b>blacks,</b> and their experiences of pressure to demonstrate their connectedness to <b>other</b> <b>blacks.</b> ^ Approximately one-quarter of the sample reported being chastised for “trying to act white” and were encouraged by friends and family from their home communities to “stay black” and “not forget their roots. ” An unexpected outcome of the chastisement was that students who were accused of “acting white” did not increase their levels of interaction with <b>other</b> <b>blacks</b> to reaffirm their connectedness to the black community. Thus, the chastisement resulted in creating the opposite intended effect of severing relations between the black student and his or her network of friends or family from their home communities. ^ Two additional findings emerged from the study. First, some Caribbean students demonstrated an ethnic connectedness to people of Caribbean descent, rather than a racial connectedness to the larger black community. Thus, students in my study faced multiple pressures to demonstrate their connectedness to groups to which they belonged. Second, I discovered that the pressure to demonstrate one 2 ̆ 7 s connectedness can impact all aspects of blacks 2 ̆ 7 lived experience, and is not a function of one 2 ̆ 7 s distance from the local black community. ...|$|R

There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
