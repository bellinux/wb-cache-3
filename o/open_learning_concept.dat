30|$|This {{special issue}} is {{dedicated}} to recent opportunities, trends, and expectations that the emergent number of institutions and governments, exploiting the <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> <b>concept,</b> face in designing and providing open education that is striving to shape the new environment for formal and informal education. The <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> <b>concept</b> embraces not only various definitions but also diverse directions conveying many opportunities for educational arrangements. Facing {{the need for a}} sustainable economy, and higher employability, governments progressively experience the pressure toward ensuring a qualified and retaining competitive workforce. There is a high demand for education settings where learners are not able to formally attend courses but experience the need to enhance their knowledge and skills. The <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> <b>concept</b> reflects not only educational but also business and societal issues, as well as visions and expectations. We address with this special issue innovative solutions and emerging trends in the area of open learning that comprise complex multidisciplinary fields of knowledge drawing a line between the needs of various learners in terms of accrediting current and desired level of skills and knowledge as well as of numerous institutions striving to provide education on a broad and competitive basis.|$|E

We believe to facilitate with our findings, the important experiences, approaches, and recommendations provided in this special issue of the RPTEL Journal, the adaptive implementation of the open education concept to advance the educational landscape and the employability of people and maximize the institutional benefit. We aimed to create awareness and better understanding of the complex interrelationship between institutional and learner’s needs in an challenging open education eco-system that allows more people to gain access to education, regardless of their learning background.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{evolution}} of computing technology {{has led to}} dramatic developments and changes in online learning. Open learning is {{a new form of}} online learning that allows learning materials to be freely available on the Internet and accessible to anyone who is interested. Different initiatives, which are based on the <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> <b>concept,</b> have been initiated by various prestigious institutions. Although all of these initiatives provide courses with free access to content, each has its own approach in terms of teaching, assessment and even their own goals of defining an open learning environment. Massive Open Online Courses is the term for courses provided in these open environments. These courses attract a large number of learners, however their success and efficacy in terms of the learning process has yet to be determined. The authors found that there is no clear model for open learning environments and therein lies our research objective. Many aspects still need to be considered and addressed in order to achieve a reliable and sustainable model. These aspects can be addressed with consideration to the principles of cognitive science so that better learning models can be obtained. This paper presents some learning theories that can be considered and applied to enhance open learning environments. The use of knowledge maps, as an approach to implement schema theory, was selected to present and organize the learning concepts.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the need to}} clarify {{the meaning of the}} <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> <b>concept.</b> It does so from a curriculum perspective and with a particular focus on curriculum control. The {{reason for this is that}} open learning is said to involve control of curriculum by learners. The study draws on curriculum theory to identify three alternative conceptions of curriculum which are used as alternative ways of considering open learning. Thus,open learning is examined as an element of social theory, as an intended curriculum and as a perceived student learning experience. The analysis is facilitated by the development of a suite of analytical tools, comprising curriculum code theory and the concepts of frame and decision-making space. Students are considered as curriculum decision-makers in order to investigate their latitude for curriculum control from their own perspective. By comparing the three conceptions of open learning listed above as they apply to a particular case of open learning provision, by analysing that case in terms of the suite of analytical tools and by considering the relevant historical and socio-cultural context, a new theory of open learning is generated. In the first instance, the three curriculum conceptions of open learning are applied to the Australian Open Learning Initiative. The methodology is based on a research philosophy of realist-coherentism. Theory on open learning, which is generic and inclusive of a wide range of views, is analysed and reviewed. Three major categories of theory on open learning (descriptive, prescriptive and explanatory) are considered. The intended curriculum of the Initiative is then detailed primarily from documentary evidence with support from key informant interviews. Students' curriculum experiences are studied by means of a series of telephone interviews with a targeted sample of 44 students registered for units of study with Open Learning Australia (the Open Learning Agency of Australia) in the first study period of 1993. Comparing theory on open learning with the evidence of the intended curriculum and student experience indicates that a technocratic approach to opening access, rather than learner control of curriculum, is the central feature of this case. Learner-centred features of the curriculum and learner control are not primary aims but rather the byproducts of increasing participation primarily through flexibility in the location and timing of study and an open entry policy. Students are seen to be essentially curriculum-takers with curriculum structures acting as strong frames on their decision-making. In relation to its context, the Initiative is seen as a pragmatic response to economic and political pressures to expand participation in higher education and to have implications for centralising control of higher education. It is proposed that open learning is understandable as a manifestation of educational democratisation. Rather than being a novel post-Fordist or neo-Fordist form of education, it is argued that open learning is a continuation of longer term, progressive educational trends. Open learning is distinctive from earlier progressive educational movements in its adult focus and use of communications technologies. It is suggested that, in the post-industrial era, pressures associated with the attainment of mass higher education are inducing reforms at that level similar to reforms previously enacted in primary and secondary education as these reached mass levels of provision. Evidence for this interpretation extends beyond the Australian case and includes parallels between open learning and the reforms characteristic of democratisation as well as historical data on the expansion of opportunities for adult education. In terms of curriculum code theory, open learning is seen as an expression of the rational curriculum code. This suggests an amendment to curriculum code theory to acknowledge a lag in the implementation of certain codes at post-secondary level in comparison with schooling. If the patterns previously observed in school education continue to be followed, state intervention is likely to involve further technocratic and internalised controls at this level. The new theory implies that a systems wide, rather than a piecemeal, approach to the development of national systems of open learning is needed. In Australia, this means fully integrating the Initiative within the Unified National System of Higher Education and making its funding base and systems of student support more equitable with conventional provision. The study identifies the learners' context as a significant but previously unacknowledged constraint on students' decision-making and learner control of curriculum. It notes that transfer of control over entering a program of study is not automatically conferred by an open admissions policy but is, instead, dependent on providers meeting the information needs of students...|$|E

40|$|In the UK, <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> {{has been}} used in {{industrial}} training for at least the last decade.

For clarity, a new definition of <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> is proposed which challenges the traditional learner-centred approach favoured by educationalists. It introduces the concept that there are benefits afforded to the trainer/employer/teacher as well as to the learner. This enables a focussed view of what quality in <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> really means.
