5|$|Because {{these three}} surface {{energies}} form {{the sides of}} a triangle, they are constrained by the triangle inequalities, γij < γjk + γik meaning that no one of the surface tensions can exceed the sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two.</b> If three fluids with surface energies that do not follow these inequalities are brought into contact, no equilibrium configuration consistent with Figure 3 will exist.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus is {{the first}} Stoic for whom the third of the four Stoic categories, i.e. the {{category}} somehow disposed is attested. In the surviving evidence, Chrysippus frequently makes use of the categories of substance and quality, but makes little use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> Stoic categories (somehow disposed and somehow disposed in relation to something). It {{is not clear whether}} the categories had any special significance for Chrysippus, and a clear doctrine of categories may be the work of later Stoics.|$|E

5|$|M. l. edouardi, like M. l. leucopterus, have {{black-and-white}} coloured males, and {{are found}} only on Barrow Island, also off the western coast of Australia. Birds of this subspecies {{are larger than}} those of M. l. leucopterus but have a shorter tail. The female has a more cinnamon tinge to her plumage than the grey-brown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> subspecies. It was described by A.J. Campbell in 1901.|$|E

With a time of 10.98seconds, she ranked first out of the eight athletes, {{defeating}} Lauryn Williams (11.07seconds) and Belgium's Kim Gevaert (11.10seconds). Of the 40 people who advanced to the quarterfinals, Stewart ranked first ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> Jamaican sprinters in the event. She progressed to the semifinals.|$|E

The episodes are {{directed}} by Yuji Yamaguchi, animated by Studio Deen and produced by the Fate Project, which included Geneon Entertainment, TBS, CREi, Type-Moon and Frontier Works Inc. The plot of the episodes is primarily based on the Fate storyline in the Fate/stay night visual novel, although certain elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> storylines, Unlimited Blade Works and Heaven's Feel, are incorporated into the plot.|$|E
5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of {{a solution to the}} Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with a contact angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E
5|$|The four Buddha statues, which {{depict the}} Dhyana mudra, are also carved from solid rock. Two {{of them are}} more or less intact today, while only parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> remain. The stupa in the middle appears to have been of the Bubbulakara (bubble shaped) design {{commonly}} seen in Sri Lanka. The upper part has been destroyed, and only the dome shaped lower part now remains. However, it has only two Pesavas (the rings found at the base of stupas) rather than the traditional three.|$|E

5|$|When Quatermass and {{his team}} reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they {{discover}} that {{only one of the}} three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the interior of the rocket, and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but there is no sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> crewmen.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the ten gliders {{carrying}} the airborne troops assigned to Group Iron were able to land next to their objective, the bridge at Kanne. Due to a navigation error by the pilots of the transport aircraft towing the gliders, one of the gliders was dropped in the wrong area. The other nine gliders were towed through heavy anti-aircraft fire and released at 05:35. As the gliders began to descend towards their objective, the bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by the Belgian garrison. Unlike the garrisons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> bridges, the Belgian defenders at Kanne had been forewarned, as the German mechanized column heading for the bridge to reinforce Group Iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Its appearance ruined any chance of a surprise assault and gave the defenders sufficient time to destroy the bridge. As the gliders came in to land, one was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the ground killing most of the occupants. The remaining eight landed successfully, and the airborne troops stormed the Belgian positions and eliminated the defenders.|$|E
5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death and those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> women. Witnesses {{had seen him}} leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, {{and he was the}} last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later film showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E

50|$|Hyperion is <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> {{a number}} of fictional {{characters}} appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The original Hyperion made his debut in The Avengers #69 (Oct. 1969), created by writer Roy Thomas and artist Sal Buscema. Subsequently Marvel has introduced various other versions of Hyperion, each originating {{in a different dimension}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marvel Multiverse, with seven distinct versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character to date - three supervillains belonging to the team Squadron Sinister, another villain with greater power levels than all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>two</b> heroes from alternate universes, and a zombified clone.|$|R
5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> crew members, and is slowly mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E
5|$|Chicago-area Latino groups contested the {{legislative}} district {{map of the}} Illinois General Assembly in United States federal court. The panel of judges that decided the case ordered a new map that gave Hispanics a majority in two Illinois House of Representatives districts in Chicago, the 9th, which is predominantly Puerto Rican, and the 20th, which is predominantly Mexican American. In 1982, Nedza sponsored Berrios, at the time chief clerk to Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Harry Semrow, in the 9th district. Berrios {{was one of three}} candidates who filed nominating petitions to run in the Democratic primary, but Berrios ran unopposed when the petitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> candidates were successfully challenged. Republicans fielded no candidate in their primary, so Berrios ran unopposed in the general election, and at the age of 30 became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly. Berrios ran for re-election unopposed in the Fall 1986 general election. He won re-election twice, serving three two-year terms.|$|E
5|$|Families of 45 of the 47 {{passengers}} sued Comair for negligence. (Families <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> victims {{settled with}} the airline before filing litigation.) Three sample cases {{were due to}} be heard on August 4, 2008; but the trial was indefinitely postponed after Comair reached a settlement {{with the majority of}} the families. Cases brought by Comair against the airport authority and the FAA, arguing each should share in the compensation payments, are now resolved. The case against the airport authority was dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds, and this ruling was upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court on October 1, 2009. In Comair's case against the United States, a settlement was reached with the United States agreeing to pay 22% of the liability for the crash, while Comair agreed to pay the remaining 78%.|$|E

Assuming that East Asia pegs its currency to a basket <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two's</b> currencies, <b>the</b> optimal basket weights are derived numerically. It is shown that the weights under a realistic invoicing pattern are drastically different from those in <b>the</b> textbook case <b>of</b> "producer currency pricing. "...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and articulate, two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two.</b> However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E

5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two,</b> Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E
