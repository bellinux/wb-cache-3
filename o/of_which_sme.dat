Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework of this analysis relates to market orientation approach. Marketing management capability was evaluated through a questionnaire using proxies to study the different stages of marketing management. The survey involved 150 firms <b>of</b> <b>which</b> 118 are <b>SMEs</b> producing traditional food products, located in Hungary, Belgium, and Italy. The data were collected by a self-administered internet survey and were analysed using multivariate analyses. Findings - Cluster analysis resulted in four clusters with different marketing management capabilities. Most of the SMEs in the sample lack marketing management capabilities, even if a considerable proportion of the firms considered report good marketing capabilities that lead to a market orientation. The weakest step of market orientation is the dissemination of generated intelligence. Indeed, SMEs lack marketing organisational activities, namely in planning and implementation of marketing strategy. Moreover, SMEs with better performance check that their objectives are reached but do not compare their strategy with that of competitors. Hence, they could miss opportunities to keep up to date with market development. Originality/value - This paper provides interesting insights. about the marketing capabilities <b>of</b> food <b>SMEs,</b> <b>which</b> usually find it difficult to stay in the market beside large firms.

40|$|More {{and more}} <b>SME’s,</b> <b>which</b> create {{entrepreneurial}} spirit and innovation, which are {{primarily responsible for}} wealth and economic growth, are internationalizing. This increases their probability of business closure due to the increased risk they face from operating in foreign markets. Much of the world blames the U. S. financial excesses for these business closures, {{but at the same}} time there are also SME’s withdrawing activities from foreign markets in economic stable times. This indicates that there are more and other reasons for de-internationalization and raises the problem of how do SME’s close their businesses in foreign markets. The purpose of this study is to explore how the drivers and determinants of deinternationalization affect the form and the paths of de-internationalization for SME’s. The aim is to provide and contribute to a better understanding of deinternationalization. This was studied through developing four case studies with Dutch SME’s with a qualitative research approach. For empirical data collection interviews were conducted with the persons closely involved with the de-internationalization of the SME’s. This in combination with the developed theoretical framework, based on a theory discussion and synthesis, provided more insight into the de-internationalization topic. The findings of this study show that a unique combination of drivers and determinants of de-internationalization is present in each case study and the relative influence of them differs. Most of the de-internationalization took place in a voluntary way, due to the nature and predictability of the occurring drivers. Moreover, it was found that the drivers of de-internationalization combined with the determinants influence the form in which de-internationalization can take place. It was also found that the form <b>of</b> deinternationalization, <b>which</b> <b>SME’s</b> have chosen, determines the two paths <b>of</b> deinternationalization, <b>which</b> are partial divestment and full market exit. This study contributes to the better understanding of de-internationalization, by identifying the forms and paths <b>which</b> <b>SME’s</b> can choose when withdrawing activities in foreign markets. Moreover, the main drivers and determinants have been identified and it was analysed how they affect the different forms and paths of de-internationalization and this was conceptualized in a model. The recommendations are, that deinternationalization should be seen as a strategic option SME’s have and should be considered in corporate strategies.

In the proposed method the ultidimensional assessment of indicators of success of SMEs in foreign markets are used, ie. not only the proportion of sales from exports is observed, but also the profi tability of international activities in an absolute and in a relative rate. Other indicators of success are the satisfaction of the company management with international activities and the success of achieving defi ned targets for business activities in foreign markets. Evaluation is made up of both the objective and the subjective indicators of success. Among the objective indicators of success is included the intensity of international activities <b>of</b> <b>SMEs,</b> <b>which</b> is detected as the sum of revenues generated from international activities in relation to total sales company, the profi tability of international activities, (ie. whether the foreign activities are profi table or not), and the relative profi tability of international activities, where it is ascertained whether the foreign activities generate higher profi t than the activities at the domestic market. The next subjective indicator of success is the success of objectives – it was found how many objectives related to operations in foreign markets has been achieved. Another indicator is the subjective satisfaction of the company management with existing activities on foreign markets. Overall performance on foreign markets of the company is quantifi ed using an assessment of objective and subjective indicators of success.
