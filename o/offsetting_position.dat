5000|$|A {{common use}} of the {{calendar}} spread is to [...] "roll over" [...] an expiring position into the future. When a futures contract expires, its seller is nominally obliged to physically deliver some quantity of the underlying commodity to the purchaser. In practice, this is almost never done; {{it is far more}} convenient for both buyers and sellers to settle the trade financially rather than arrange for physical delivery. This is most commonly done by entering into an <b>offsetting</b> <b>position</b> in the market. For example, someone who has sold a futures contract can effectively cancel the position out by purchasing an identical futures contract, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that benchmark securities allow heterogeneously informed investors to create trading {{strategies that are}} perfectly aligned with their signals. Investors who are informed about security-specific risks but uninformed about systematic risks can take an <b>offsetting</b> <b>position</b> in benchmark securities to eliminate exposure to adverse selection in systematic risks, while investors who are informed about systematic risks but uninformed about security-specific risks can trade systematic risks exclusively using benchmark securities. We further show that introduction of benchmark securities encourages more investors to acquire both security-specific and systematic-factor information, which leads to increased liquidity and price informativeness for all individual securities...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} optimal hedging {{decisions for}} a firm whose stock returns {{are affected by}} market returns and an idiosyncratic factor that is orthogonal to the market return. We show {{that the level of}} firm’s cash flows depend on the level of the market and the level of the idiosyncratic factor multiplicatively because of compounding. Minimizing the variance of the cash flow requires a substantial <b>offsetting</b> <b>position</b> in the market index. However, minimizing the costs of financial distress associated with low cash flow realizations is complex and requires only a modest hedge against the market factor. This insight holds even in continuous time and with dynamic hedging policies. We clarify that using return regressions to measure economic exposure to generate optimal hedging deltas is erroneous and that hedging transaction exposure to idiosyncratic risks such as exchange risks is sensible...|$|E

40|$|A {{market is}} {{considered}} whose index has strongly price-dependent local volatility. A tractable parametrization of the volatility is formulated, and option valuation {{of a stock}} with two-factor dynamics is investigated. One factor is the market index; when the second factor is uncorrelated with the first, the option valuation equation can separate. A formal solution is given for a European call. The call value depends on both the stock price and the market index. Even if the prices {{of a set of}} calls were fitted with a one-factor implied volatility, the calls could not be hedged solely with an <b>offsetting</b> <b>position</b> in the stock. For example, delta-hedging involves two deltas, one corresponding to the stock and the other to the market index. In a numerical example, the magnitude of the market delta is found to be significant. The CAPM is used as an example to explore how market-dependent volatilities could be implemented in multifactor models. In the process, the Black-Scholes equation with standard boundary conditions is reduced to quadrature for squared volatilities proportional to (1 +an*sm^n) /(1 +ad*sm^n); sm is the market index, and n, an, and ad are constants. equity options, implied volatility, hedging...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{usefulness}} of sovereign credit default swaps (SCDS) intensified with the outbreak of sovereign debt stress in the euro area. SCDS {{can be used to}} protect investors against losses on sovereign debt arising from so-called credit events such as default or debt restructuring. SCDS have become important tools in the management of credit risk, and the premiums paid for the protection offered by SCDS are commonly used as market indicators of credit risk. Although CDS that reference sovereign credits are {{only a small part of}} the sovereign debt market ($ 3 trillion notional SCDS outstanding at end-June 2012, compared with $ 50 trillion of total government debt outstanding at end- 2011), their importance has been growing rapidly since 2008, especially in advanced economies. With the growing influence of SCDS, questions have arisen about whether speculative use of SCDS contracts could be destabilizing. Such concerns have led European authorities to ban uncovered, or “naked,” purchases of SCDS protection referencing European Economic Area sovereign debt obligations, that is, banning purchases in which there is no <b>offsetting</b> <b>position</b> in the underlying debt. The prohibition is based on the view that, in extreme market conditions, such short selling could push sovereign bond prices into a downward spiral, which would lead to disorderly markets and systemic risks, and hence sharply raise the issuance costs of the underlying sovereigns...|$|E
40|$|A {{moderately}} deep {{survey of}} stellar maser sources toward the Galactic center {{has been made}} in the SiO J= 1 - 0 v= 1 and v= 2 transitions (~ 43 GHz) with the Nobeyama 45 -m telescope of a beam size of about 40 ". At the Galactic center (Sgr A*), 7 (4 new) SiO maser sources were detected in one beam. In order to investigate the spatial distribution of SiO maser sources, we have also observed the <b>offset</b> <b>positions</b> by +- 40 " in Galactic longitude from the Galactic center. In total, 7 (4 new) SiO maser sources were detected at the <b>offset</b> <b>positions.</b> Taking into account the shorter integration time at the <b>offset</b> <b>positions,</b> we find that the surface number density of SiO maser sources is nearly constant at the Galactic center. The number density of SiO maser sources is found to be an order of magnitude higher than the density of OH 1612 MHz objects. A radial-velocity gradient in Galactic longitude was not detected. These facts indicate that the SiO maser sources seen toward the Galactic center are mostly associated with the stellar population of a Galactic stellar nuclear disk of more than a few arc minute radius.

40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the alignment error for each axis. Once alignment error is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> to make the mount adjustment. The star <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the alignment error such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star <b>offset</b> <b>positioning</b> ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis Alignment Error [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar alignment error. If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and azimuth adjustment axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|R
40|$|Information {{received}} from different sensory modalities profoundly influences human perception. For example, {{changes in the}} auditory flutter rate induce changes in the apparent flicker rate of a flashing light (Shipley, 1964). In the present study, we investigated whether auditory information would affect the perceived <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object. In Experiment 1, a visual object moved {{toward the center of}} the computer screen and disappeared abruptly. A transient auditory signal was presented at different times relative to the moment when the object disappeared. The results showed that if the auditory signal was presented before the abrupt offset of the moving object, the perceived final position was shifted backward, implying that the perceived <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> was affected by the transient auditory information. In Experiment 2, we presented the transient auditory signal to either the left or the right ear. The results showed that the perceived offset shifted backward more strongly when the auditory signal was presented to the same side from which the moving object originated. In Experiment 3, we found that the perceived timing of the visual offset was not affected by the spatial relation between the auditory signal and the visual offset. The present results are interpreted as indicating that an auditory signal may influence the <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object through both spatial and temporal processes...|$|R

Here we use applied mathematical modelling exploiting the basic principles of mechanics and the 6 – 12 Lennard-Jones potential function together with the continuum approximation, which assumes that intermolecular interactions can be approximated by average atomic surface densities. We consider the equilibrium <b>offset</b> <b>positions</b> for both single-strand and double-strand DNA molecules inside a single-walled carbon nanotube, and we predict <b>offset</b> <b>positions</b> with reference to the cross-section of the carbon nanotube. For the double-strand DNA, the potential energy is determined for the general case for any helical phase angle ϕ, but we also consider a special case when ϕ = π, which leads to a substantial simplification in the analytical expression for the energy. As might be expected, our results confirm that the global minimum energy positions for a single-strand DNA molecule and a double-strand DNA molecule will lie off axis and they become closer to the tube wall as the radius of the tube increases.

40|$|Factors such as {{environmental}} requirements and fuel efficiency have pushed aerospace industry to develop reduced-weight engine designs and thereby light-weight and thin-walled components. As component wall thickness gets thinner and the mechanical structures weaker, the structure becomes more sensitive for vibrations during milling operations. Demands on cost efficiency increase and {{new ways of}} improving milling operations must follow. Historically, {{there have been two}} “schools” explaining vibrations in milling. One states that the entry angle in which the cutting insert hits the work piece is of greater importance than the exit angle. The other states that the way the cutter leaves the work piece is of greater importance than the cutter entry. In an effort to shed some light over this issue, a substantial amount of experiments were conducted. Evaluations were carried out using different tools, different tool-to-workpiece <b>offset</b> <b>positions,</b> and varying workpiece wall overhang.
