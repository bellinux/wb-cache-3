5|$|Allegations of {{research}} misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became {{embroiled in a}} misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991. Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed. Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.|$|E

5|$|At its {{congress}} {{in the summer of}} 1978, the International Ice Hockey Federation approved proposals to hold the second and third Canada Cup tournaments in 1979 and 1982. However, tensions between Canada's rival governing bodies, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) and Hockey Canada, increased after the latter body accused the CAHA of reneging on promises it had made regarding Hockey Canada's control of international events involving professional players. Hockey Canada's chief negotiator for international events, Alan Eagleson, accused the CAHA <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to sabotage the Canada Cup and threatened to cancel the tournament if the CAHA refused to compromise with his body.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball, deep inside Wake Forest territory. Shortly after the quarter began, Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order to continue its drive. Instead <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to convert the fourth down—Tech had attempted and failed on two fourth-down conversions in the third quarter—Tech instead sent in kicker Travis Bell. Bell's 34-yard attempt sailed through the goalposts, and with 12:53 remaining in the game, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} Schengen Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{felt the}} money from the bonds should not go to the soldiers, but the speculators that had bought the bonds from the soldiers, who had shown little faith in the country's future. The process <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to track down the {{original}} bond holders along with the government showing discrimination among the classes of holders if the war veterans were to be compensated also weighed in as factors for Hamilton. As for the state debts, Hamilton suggested to consolidate it with the national debt and label it as federal debt, for the sake of efficiency on a national scale.|$|E

5|$|In March 2006, OMM {{published}} an article about Allen's success through MySpace, and she received her first major mainstream coverage appearing in the magazine's cover story two months later.

Allen found herself distracted by the publicity, so to focus on finishing the album, she travelled to the United States to work with producers Greg Kurstin and Mark Ronson. There, she was able to complete {{the second half of the}} album in approximately two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish optimise their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E

5|$|One danger <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> {{to consume}} hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, {{especially}} for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility}} of misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Background It {{is unclear}} whether any {{particular}} {{time of the day}} is Vulnerable for suicide attempts. Suicide attempt is a known risk factor for future completed suicide. Aim To investigate the relationship between the time <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempt</b> and the sociodemograpic and illness characteristics of suicide attempters. Method Time <b>of</b> <b>attempt,</b> clinical and demographic data and illness variables of 74 patients presenting to hospital following suicide attempt were analyzed. Results Our results showed 8. a. m. to 11. 59 a. m. is the most preferred time <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> and it is statistically significant. Suicide attempt is significantly more in the day time (between 8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.). The above time period is significantly associated with place <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>of</b> the suicide attempters. This is the time period where more young males (20 – 29 years) from rural back ground, married, illiterates and unemployed (significant no. of house wives also) attempt suicide during this time. Depression is the common psychiatric illness and pesticide is the common mode <b>of</b> <b>attempt.</b> More number <b>of</b> cases <b>attempt</b> during the months of August, September and October. Majority of them have experienced more than 5 life events before the attempt. Therefore we conclude that forenoon (8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.) is the most vulnerable period for attempting suicide. Conclusion The assessment of patients with history <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempt</b> in relation to the time <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> is beneficial in formulating suicide prevention strategies...|$|R

In Attorney General's Reference No. 3 of 1992 (1994), {{on a charge of}} attempted aggravated arson, it was held to be sufficient for the prosecution to establish a specific intent to cause damage by fire and that the defendant was reckless as to whether life would thereby be endangered.|$|E
5|$|The Barry Goldwater presidential {{campaign}} of 1964 began when United States Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona elected {{to seek the}} Republican Party nomination for President of the United States to challenge incumbent Democratic President Lyndon B.

Early on, before officially announcing his candidacy for the presidency, Goldwater was accused by Governor of New York Nelson Rockefeller <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to galvanize Southern and Western Republican support while neglecting the industrial northern states, eventually becoming one of Goldwater's primary opponents {{in the race for}} the Republican Party's nomination in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The rising {{forced a}} change of policy by the regime, which instead <b>of</b> <b>attempting</b> to replace the landholding classes now looked for a {{reconciliation}} with former Royalists and Engagers. This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon, proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654. Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance, it named 24 persons (mainly from the nobility) whose lands would be seized, and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine. Even then most of those names were treated with leniency and fines were remitted for confiscations, or were reduced, and some were abandoned.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{suicide rate}} in Greenland, {{especially}} among men, {{is among the}} highest in the world. Attempted suicide rates may be high also. However, the rates <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide are unknown. Objective. We aimed to estimate the age- and gender-specific incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine in Nuuk in 2008 &#x 2013; 2009. Design. An observational retrospective study of consecutive medical records on patients admitted to Dronning Ingrids Hospital in Nuuk in 2008 &#x 2013; 2009 with possible medicine intoxication. Results. Seventy-four (60 females and 14 men) cases <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine were included. Of those, 43 used paracetamol alone or in combination with other medicine. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine was higher among females than males (p&# 60; 0. 001). The highest incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide with paracetamol was found among women aged 20 &#x 2013; 24 years (0. 84 %). The highest incidence of suicide with medication (1. 31 per 100 inhabitants per year) was among women aged 15 &#x 2013; 19 years. Conclusions. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine was high in Nuuk, Greenland, especially among women. The highest incidence <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempts</b> with medication was observed among women in the age group 15 &#x 2013; 19 years (1. 31 %). This may reflect psychosocial vulnerability among young people in Greenland. Initiatives to improve living conditions for children and adolescents are highly recommended to be initiated immediately...|$|R
