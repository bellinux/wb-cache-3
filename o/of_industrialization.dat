5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} the role <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> {{on the general}} health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> in the 19th century, riverways beneath the Metacomet Ridge were dammed to provide power as {{the labor force}} {{expanded}} in nearby cities and towns.

However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year}} of its operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} half of Belgium, {{which would}} {{come to be known}} as Flanders, was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp, the city of Ghent and the capital, Brussels. In the southern half, which {{would come to}} be known as Wallonia, a number of smaller towns and cities along the valley of the Sambre and Meuse rivers – the sillon industriel ("industrial valley") – became the focus <b>of</b> <b>industrialization.</b> In the west of the valley, around Charleroi, was the Pays Noir ("Black Country"), which held significant coal deposits. In southeast Belgium, along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia (later Germany), was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{cultural}} properties {{were originally}} in {{the ownership of}} Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, and aristocratic or samurai families. Feudal Japan ended abruptly in 1867/68 when the Tokugawa shogunate {{was replaced by the}} Meiji Restoration. During the ensuing haibutsu kishaku ("abolish Buddhism and destroy Shākyamuni") triggered by the official policy of separation of Shinto and Buddhism and anti-Buddhist movements propagating the return to Shinto, Buddhist buildings and artwork were destroyed. In 1871, the government confiscated temple lands, considered symbolic of the ruling elite. Properties belonging to the feudal lords were expropriated, historic castles and residences were destroyed, and an estimated 18,000 temples were closed. During the same period, Japanese cultural heritage was impacted by the rise <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> and westernization. As a result, Buddhist and Shinto institutions became impoverished. Temples decayed, and valuable objects were exported.|$|E
5|$|Saruman {{makes his}} final {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the last volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses. When they reach the Shire, Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have already taken it over and started a destructive process <b>of</b> <b>industrialization.</b> Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ("The Scouring of the Shire") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue for the damage done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.|$|E

5|$|In 1830, the Belgian {{provinces of}} the Netherlands revolted in the Belgian Revolution and {{declared}} their independence. Despite widespread {{international support for}} Belgian independence, fighting between Belgium and the Netherlands continued {{under the rule of}} King Leopold I. Belgian independence was finally recognized by the Dutch in 1839. Under Leopold I's reign, Belgium remained relatively stable and was only lightly affected by the Revolutions of 1848. On his death in 1865, his son Leopold II was inaugurated as King. Leopold II's reign was dominated by the rise of the Socialist party and calls for reform to the voting system and military as well as the Schools' War between Liberal and Catholic political factions. Although Belgian independence was briefly threatened during the Franco-Prussian War, under Leopold II's reign the country reached an unprecedented level <b>of</b> <b>industrialization</b> and prosperity, becoming the second most industrialized state in the world after Great Britain. The period was also marked by the creation of a personal colony by Leopold II, the Congo Free State. The subsequent international outcry over human rights abuses forced the Belgian state to annex the region in 1908, forming the Belgian Congo. In 1909, after his uncle's death, Albert I began his reign, which lasted until 1934. In the years leading up to the First World War, the process of military and voting reform begun in the 1880s was finally completed. Despite declaring neutrality, Belgium was invaded by the German Empire in August 1914, beginning the country's involvement in World War I.|$|E

40|$|With the {{implementation}} of the policy of expanding domestic demand, farmers have become the main body of rural economy and rural <b>industrialization.</b> Development <b>of</b> rural <b>industrialization</b> promotes the development of rural economy in China, effectively transfers the surplus labor force in rural areas, continuously optimizes the rural economic structure, improves the living standard of farmers, and has made important contributions to the stability and development of economy and society in China. This paper introduces the connotation <b>of</b> rural <b>industrialization,</b> classifies it into three modes according to the farmer’s investment and economic development, such as exogenous model <b>of</b> rural <b>industrialization,</b> endogenous model <b>of</b> rural <b>industrialization</b> and integrated model <b>of</b> rural <b>industrialization.</b> Though rural industrialization has obtained great achievements, there are still some problems restricting the development of rural economy in China. For instance, cognitive bias leads to the slow pace of rural industrialization; rural industry develops rapidly but its efficiency is low; intensive degree of economic growth is still very low; ability of independent innovation is weak; there are obvious contradiction between the constraints of resource and environment and the acceleration of industrialization; and development gap between regions has further widened. Therefore, policy suggestions are put forward. Firstly, continue to strengthen policy support. Secondly, take a new road <b>of</b> rural <b>industrialization.</b> Thirdly, strengthen the construction of human resources in rural areas. Fourthly, actively guide the investment behavior of farmers. And finally, support the specialty cooperative of farmers and the leading enterprises, which has certain reference significance to enhance agricultural benefit, farmers’ income, rural development and modern agriculture.
