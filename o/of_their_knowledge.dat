Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, some Jesuit {{schools of}} Portugal cut several {{passages}} from Ovid's Metamorphoses. While the Jesuits saw his poems as elegant compositions {{worthy of being}} presented to students for educational purposes, they also felt his works as a whole might corrupt students. The Jesuits took much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Ovid to the Portuguese colonies. According to Serafim Leite (1949), the ratio studiorum was in effect in Colonial Brazil during the early 17th century, and in this period Brazilian students read works like the Epistulae ex Ponto to learn Latin grammar.|$|E
25|$|The Long Ships, or Red Orm (original title: Röde Orm), {{a best-selling}} Swedish novel written by Frans G. Bengtsson, {{contains}} a vivid description of Gotland in the Viking Age. A {{section of the}} book is devoted to a Viking ship setting out to Russia, stopping on its way at Gotland and engaging a pilot from the island who plays an important part in their voyage. Gotlanders of the Viking era are depicted as city people, more sophisticated and cosmopolitan than other Scandinavians of their time, and proud <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> and skills.|$|E
25|$|Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many {{opportunities}} and {{an abundance of}} supplies. He established a library in the Lyceum which aided {{in the production of}} many of his hundreds of books, which were written on papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism. He believed all peoples' concepts and all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> was ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.|$|E

25|$|The schools {{formed by}} Christian missionaries taught the English {{language}} {{to the students}} and they were employed {{in the public sector}} because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the English language. After 1815 the British colonial rulers started educating Sri Lanka's public workers about the administration rules and regulations. They also held examinations for the clerical workers to upgrade their working level. The famous manual among the public sector workers named Administration Rules and Regulations (ARR) is still used in Sri Lanka. An examination was held for the administration officers called the Ceylon Administrative Service (CAS) exam. After passing it they were graded as CAS officers.|$|E
25|$|In Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies, Kelly {{suggests}} that knowledge {{may have been}} originally preserved by the nomadic Britons by using the landscape as a mnemonic tool, {{in a similar fashion}} to the memorization technique known as Method of loci. As the Britons started to settle, they would have needed to modify the way they stored their knowledge as they were not moving as much anymore, so they would have built Stonehenge in an attempt to replicate the landscape locally, allowing them to memorize and store knowledge. The circles and stones or timber posts would have represented the landscape, and each stone would have been associated with a segment <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Bambaras {{are mostly}} farmers {{and are the}} most {{numerous}} ethnic group. Their language is Bambara or Djoula. The Bozos are the second most populous ethnic group. They typically live near {{the shore of the}} Niger river, in small towns of small houses. The Bozo economy is based on fishing. Bozo people have a monopoly on the transport system because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the Niger, its shallows and seasonal lakes, and are regarded as the masters of water. The Somono, also fishermen, are not a distinct ethnic group but a mixture of Bambara, Bozo and Soninke. The Malinké, Maninka, and Mandinka are closely related to Bambaras: They share costumes, religious beliefs, and practices with the Bambaras. The Marka, Saracollé or Soninke are merchants and warriors. The Soninke people are great travelers and Muslims, and have largely conserved their traditions.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the ability of {{students}} to appreciate the extent <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own <b>knowledge</b> is essential to enable them to appreciate where gaps may exist and prompt the development of remedial learning strategies. This article reports on a study investigating this capability in which 307 business undergraduates provided 7525 judgements on the state <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own <b>knowledge</b> in respect of issues addressed in their study programme. The findings indicated a general tendency for overconfidence in knowledge, which was more evident in those studying on the first year <b>of</b> <b>their</b> degree programme than students in their second year. These findings suggest that effective learning may be hampered by students’ ignorance <b>of</b> gaps in <b>their</b> <b>knowledge,</b> particularly {{in the early stages of}} academic programmes, and that they may benefit from interventions to assist them in developing a better appreciation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> current state <b>of</b> <b>knowledge...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{university}} cut off outside resupply of {{the protesters}} on June 19, 2008. The university claimed {{in a letter to}} the Berkeley City Council that to the best <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> the protesters had sufficient food and water and that the university would take action to maintain the health and safety {{of the protesters}} should they not come down. In response to the cutting off of supplies the City Council voted to send two city officials to the grove to check on the welfare of the protesters on June 24, 2008. The two officials, the Assistant City Manager and the Assistant Fire Chief, reported to the City Council on June 25, 2008, the protesters did indeed have sufficient food and water, and would refuse any supplies offered by the UCPD. Later that same day Mayor Tom Bates and City Manager Phil Kamlarz met with university officials to discuss the health of the tree-sitters.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the ERs, an in vitro study found that DES also possesses activity, albeit relatively weak, {{at a variety of}} other steroid hormone receptors. Whereas the study found EC50 values of 0.18nM and 0.06nM of DES for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, the drug showed significant glucocorticoid activity at a concentration of 1μm that surpassed that of 0.1nM dexamethasone as well as significant antagonism of the androgen, progesterone, and mineralocorticoid receptors (75%, 85%, and 50% inhibition of positive control stimulation, respectively, at a concentration of 1μm). It also showed approximately 25% inhibition of the activation of PPARγ and LXRα at a concentration of 10μm. The researchers stated that, to the best <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge,</b> they were the first to report such actions of DES, and hypothesized that these actions could be involved in the clinical effects of DES, for instance, in prostate cancer (notably in which particularly high dosages of DES are employed). However, they also noted that the importance of the activities requires further study in animal models at pharmacologically relevant doses.|$|E

500|$|At 4:00am, the {{soldiers}} began to march towards Trenton. Along the way, several civilians joined as volunteers, and led as guides (see Captain John Mott) because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the terrain. After marching [...] through winding roads into the wind, they reached Bear Tavern, where they turned right. The ground was slippery, {{but it was}} level, {{making it easier for}} the horses and artillery. [...] They began to make better time. They soon reached Jacobs Creek, where, with difficulty, the Americans made it across. The two groups stayed together until they reached Birmingham, where they split apart. Soon after, they reached the house of Benjamin Moore, where the family offered food and drink to Washington. At this point, the first signs of daylight began to appear. Many of the troops did not have boots, so they were forced to wear rags around their feet. Some of the men's feet bled, turning the snow to a dark red. Two men died on the trip.|$|E
500|$|Others {{were less}} optimistic. Ramsey chose zero (a {{complete}} dud), [...] Robert Oppenheimer chose , Kistiakowsky , and Bethe chose [...] Rabi, {{the last to}} arrive, took [...] by default, which would win him the pool. In a video interview, Bethe stated that his choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segrè, and he was swayed by Segrè's authority over that of a more junior [...] member of Segrè's group who had calculated 20 kt. Enrico Fermi offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state, or incinerate the entire planet. This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible, although {{for a while it}} had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for scaring the guards who, unlike the physicists, did not have the advantage <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> about the scientific possibilities. His own biggest fear was that nothing would happen, in which case he would have to head back to the tower to investigate.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} popular modern ways of writing Taiwanese is by using a mixed orthography called Hàn-lô ( [...] ; {{literally}} Chinese-Roman), and sometimes Han-Romanization mixed script, a style not unlike written Japanese or (historically) Korean. In fact, the term Hàn-lô does not describe one specific system, but covers any kind of writing in Southern Min which features both Chinese characters and romanization. That romanization is usually POJ, although recently some texts have begun appearing with Taiwanese Romanization System (Tâi-lô) spellings too. The problem with using only Chinese characters to write Southern Min is that there are many morphemes (estimated to be around 15 percent of running text) which are not definitively associated with a particular character. Various strategies have been developed to deal with the issue, including creating new characters, allocating Chinese characters used in written Mandarin with similar meanings (but dissimilar etymology) to represent the missing characters, or using romanization for the [...] "missing 15%". There are two rationales for using mixed orthography writing, with two different aims. The first is to allow native speakers (almost all of whom can already write Chinese characters) to make use <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge</b> of characters, while replacing the missing 15% with romanization. The second is to wean character literates off using them gradually, to be replaced eventually by fully romanized text.|$|E

500|$|According to Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, King Janaka of Videha Kingdom held a Rajasuya Yagna {{and invited}} all the learned sages, kings and princess of India to participate. The yagna lasted for many days. Large {{quantities}} of sandalwood, ghee (clarified butter) and barley (cereal grain) were {{offered to the}} Yagna fire creating an atmosphere of spiritual sanctity and aroma. Janaka himself being a scholar {{was impressed with the}} large gathering of learned sages. He thought of selecting a scholar from the assembled group of elite scholars, the most accomplished of them all who had maximum knowledge about Brahman. For this purpose, he evolved a plan and offered a prize of 1,000 cows with each cow dangled with 10 grams of gold on its horns. The galaxy of scholars, apart from others, included the renowned sage Yajnavalkya and Gargi Vachaknavi. Yajnavalkya, who was aware that he was the most spiritually knowledgeable among the assembled gathering, as he had mastered the art of Kundalini Yoga, ordered his disciple Samsrava to drive away the cow herd to his house. This infuriated the scholars as they felt that he was taking way the prize without contesting in a debate. Some of the local pundits (scholars) did not volunteer for debate with him as they were not sure <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>knowledge.</b> However, there were eight renowned sages who challenged him for a debate, which included Gargi, the only lady in [...] the assembled gathering of the learned.|$|E
