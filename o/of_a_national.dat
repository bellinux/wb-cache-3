5|$|With {{dramatically}} increasing {{population in}} the 20th century, there was major civil unrest in Omaha, resulting from competition and fierce labor struggles.

5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{nation-state}} is the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> culture, frequently—although not necessarily—through deliberate national policy. In the new German nation, a Kulturkampf (1872–78) that followed political, economic, and administrative unification attempted to address, with a remarkable lack of success, some of the contradictions in German society. In particular, it involved a struggle over language, education, and religion. A policy of Germanization of non-German people of the empire's population, including the Polish and Danish minorities, started with language, in particular, the German language, compulsory schooling (Germanization), and the attempted creation of standardized curricula for those schools to promote and celebrate {{the idea of a}} shared past. Finally, it extended to the religion of the new Empire's population.|$|E

5|$|Before Indiana {{became a}} state, the Indiana Territory had two governors. William Henry Harrison, the first governor, built a plantation-style home in Vincennes, and named it Grouseland for its many birds. Built in 1804, {{it was one}} of the first brick {{buildings}} in the territory. The home is still preserved and is a National Historic Landmark. Thomas Posey, the territory's second governor, had a home built in Corydon, but lived there only briefly before moving to Jeffersonville where he rented a room in a boarding house. The Posey House is preserved as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>National</b> Historic District.|$|E

5|$|Catholic {{efforts to}} win the {{population}} countered the Protestant idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> church with Polonization, or nationalization of the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native elements {{to make it more}} accessible and attractive to the masses.

5|$|Construction of {{the airport}} started in 1943 by the Luftwaffe who {{stationed}} a detachment of Jagdgeschwader 5 (JS5) there. Civilian operations started 1970 and were first provided by Norving. The airport was upgraded as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> program to establish regional airports and from 1974 services were taken over by Widerøe using de Havilland Canada Twin Otter aircraft. The current terminal building dates from 1988; Dash 8 aircraft were introduced in 1994. There have been local proposals to expand the airport, but Avinor {{does not wish to}} pursue these.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{wilderness}} as {{a social}} {{as well as an}} environmental ideal, Marshall promoted organization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> group dedicated to the preservation of primeval land.

He also supported socialism and civil liberties throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{attempts}} of the Kirk {{to limit the}} tradition of secular popular music, it continued. This period saw {{the adoption of the}} highland bagpipes and the fiddle. Ballads, some of which probably date from the Medieval period, existed as part of an distinctive oral tradition. Allan Ramsey advocated the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> musical tradition and collaborated with Italian composer and cellist Lorenzo Bocchi on the first Scottish opera the Gentle Shepherd. A musical culture developed around Edinburgh and a number of composers began to produce collections of Lowland and Highland tunes grafted on to Italian musical forms. By the middle of the eighteenth century a number of Italian musicians and composers were resident in Scotland and Scottish composers of national significance had begun to emerge.|$|E

5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were objections to the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E

They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>national</b> community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.|$|E
