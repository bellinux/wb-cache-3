5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of long arms and <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or submetacentric (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E

5|$|A {{solution}} to the minimax path problem between the two opposite corners of a grid graph {{can be used to}} find the weak Fréchet distance between two polygonal chains. Here, each grid graph vertex represents a pair of line segments, one from each chain, and the weight of an edge represents the Fréchet distance needed to pass from <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of segments to another.|$|E
5|$|Among lemurs, the toothcomb is {{variable}} in structure. Among indriids (Indriidae), the toothcomb is less procumbent {{and consists of}} four teeth instead of six. The indriid toothcomb is more robust and wider, with shorter incisors, wider spaces between the teeth (interdental spaces), and a broader apical ridge. It is unclear whether this four-toothed toothcomb consists of two pairs of incisors or <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of incisors and <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of canines. In fork-marked lemurs (Phaner) the toothcomb is more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces. All six teeth are longer, straighter, and form a more continuous apical ridge. In the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae) and sloth lemurs (Palaeopropithecidae), the toothcomb was lost and the incisors and canines resumed a typical configuration {{in the front of}} the mouth. The aye-aye also lost its toothcomb, replacing it with continually growing (hypselodont) front teeth, similar to the incisors of rodents.|$|E

5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|In the Diptera (true flies), {{there is}} only <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of {{functional}} wings, with the posterior pair of wings are reduced to halteres, which help the fly to sense its orientation and movement, {{as well as to}} improve balance by acting similar to gyroscopes. In Calyptratae, the very hindmost portion of the wings are modified into somewhat thickened flaps called calypters which cover the halteres.|$|E

5|$|The {{armament}} changes undergone by {{the ship}} {{during the war}} are not entirely clear.

'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on the aft turret were removed as were <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> was on the main deck further aft where they were not protected by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, {{the passing}} loop {{was used by}} <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of {{passenger}} trains in the evening, with an extra down train (toward Amlwch) making seven down and six up trains per day. The railmotor train's services had grown to 24 single trips between Gaerwen/Holland Arms and Llangefni/Red Wharf Bay. The continuing shortages of World War I meant that in January 1917 many passenger services were to be cut to give more resources to the war effort. The railways were slow {{to recover from the}} wartime hardships, and in 1921 there were six passenger trains to and from Amlwch, and only 18 single trips by the motor train.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|In summary, {{the desired}} line L1 {{is defined by}} two points: the radical center G of the three given circles and the pole in C1 {{of one of the}} four lines {{connecting}} the homothetic centers. Finding the same pole in C2 and C3 gives L2 and L3, respectively; thus, all six points can be located, from which <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of solution circles can be found. Repeating this procedure for the remaining three homothetic-center lines yields six more solutions, giving eight solutions in all. However, if a line L'k does not intersect its circle C'k for some k, there is no pair of solutions for that homothetic-center line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the lifts to the Piccadilly line {{platforms}} {{were replaced by}} escalators, with <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> being provided between the ticket hall and a new intermediate level, where it met a linking passageway to the Circle and District line platforms, and three being provided from there to a lower concourse between the levels of the two Piccadilly line platforms. Stairs up and down from the lower concourse connect to the platforms. The stairs and passage to the westbound platform {{are located in the}} disused DR westbound platform tunnel.

5|$|Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, {{a three-part}} body (head, thorax and abdomen), {{three pairs of}} jointed legs, {{compound}} eyes and <b>one</b> <b>pair</b> of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including {{more than a million}} described species and representing {{more than half of all}} known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.|$|E
