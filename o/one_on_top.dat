25|$|Building of Boca Juniors' current stadium {{began in}} 1938, under the {{supervision}} of Engineer José L. Delpini. Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940.

The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the other, the only way that makes it stand into the club premises.|$|E
