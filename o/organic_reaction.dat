5|$|The Carroll {{rearrangement}} is a rearrangement {{reaction in}} organic chemistry and involves {{the transformation of}} a β-keto allyl ester into a α-allyl-β-ketocarboxylic acid. This <b>organic</b> <b>reaction</b> is accompanied by decarboxylation and the final product is a γ,δ-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation.|$|E

25|$|In {{a classic}} (1905) <b>organic</b> <b>reaction</b> called the Bally–Scholl synthesis, named after Oscar Bally and Roland Scholl, {{anthraquinone}} condenses with glycerol forming benzanthrone.

25|$|The Birch {{reduction}} is an <b>organic</b> <b>reaction</b> which is particularly useful in synthetic organic chemistry. The reaction {{was reported in}} 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch (1915–1995) working in the Dyson Perrins Laboratory in the University of Oxford, building on earlier work by Wooster and Godfrey in 1937. It converts aromatic compounds having a benzenoid ring into a product, 1,4-cyclohexadienes, in which two hydrogen atoms have been attached on {{opposite ends of the}} molecule. It is the organic reduction of aromatic rings in liquid ammonia with sodium, lithium or potassium and an alcohol, such as ethanol and tert-butanol. This reaction is quite unlike catalytic hydrogenation, which usually reduces the aromatic ring all the way to a cyclohexane.|$|E
500|$|The Cope {{rearrangement}} is an extensively studied <b>organic</b> <b>reaction</b> {{involving the}} [...] sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. It {{was developed by}} Arthur C. Cope. For example, 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene heated to 300°C yields 2,6-octadiene.|$|E

2500|$|In organic chemistry, the hydroboration–oxidation {{reaction}} is a two-step <b>organic</b> <b>reaction</b> that converts an alkene into a neutral alcohol by the net addition of water across the double bond. The hydrogen and hydroxyl group are {{added in a}} syn addition leading to cis stereochemistry. Hydroboration–oxidation is an anti-Markovnikov reaction, with the hydroxyl group attaching to the less-substituted carbon. [...] The reaction was first reported by Herbert C. Brown in the late 1950s and it was recognized in his receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|An {{elimination}} {{reaction is}} a type of <b>organic</b> <b>reaction</b> in which two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one or two-step mechanism. The one-step mechanism is known as the E2 reaction, and the two-step mechanism is known as the E1 reaction. [...] The numbers do not {{have to do with the}} number of steps in the mechanism, but rather the kinetics of the reaction, bimolecular and unimolecular respectively. In rare cases, for molecules possessing [...] particularly poor leaving groups, a third type of reaction, E1CB, [...] exists.|$|E
