5|$|As a {{token of}} respect for Roman religion, however, Elagabalus joined either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the three to Elagabal as consort. A union between Elagabal and a {{traditional}} goddess would have served to strengthen ties between the new religion and the imperial cult. In fact, {{there may have been}} an effort to introduce Elagabal, Urania, and Athena as the new Capitoline triad of Rome—replacing Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.|$|E
5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942. The end of Barbette's performing career is attributed {{to a number of}} causes including a fall, pneumonia, polio, <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the three. All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette was left in extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals. Later members, {{including}} ceratopsids like Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators, they {{may also have been}} used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the above. Ceratopsians ranged in size from 1meter (3ft) and 23kilograms (50lb) to over 9meters (30ft) and 9,100kg (20,100lb).|$|E

The croquette is lightly pan fried before serving.Some recipe variations also require the croquette to be covered in breadcrumbs before frying, and served with a clear soup e.g. [...] "barszcz", similar to borscht.|$|R

5|$|The {{instruments}} used {{in musical}} entertainment are either solely the human voice (2, 6) or solely instrumental (1, 3) <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two (4, 5, 7, 8). Whether the performance {{is given by}} vocalists or instrumentalists, the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual (10), passing by (3), small (1, 2) or large (6, 7, 8, 9). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably a cappella and overtone singing, are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing (7).|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and {{found themselves in}} a similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives in their home countries <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having just spent six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men.|$|E
30|$|Indoor {{iterative}} localization algorithm {{of autonomous}} robots {{is an active}} subject because of the environmental complexity. The coordinates of autonomous robots are the fundamental parameters of robot control [1]. Due {{to the absence of}} Global Positioning System signals in an indoor-like environment, the autonomous robots need an iterative localization algorithm to provide their position information. Laser, sonar, infrared, visual sensors, <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> these methods are used to locate the robots [2]. However, those technologies may fail in some harsh environments, such as a firing building which is dusty, smoky, and dark.|$|R

25|$|Although single-estate teas are available, {{almost all}} tea in bags and most loose tea {{sold in the}} West is blended.

25|$|Once {{infrastructure}} is in place, operating {{water supply and}} sanitation systems entails significant ongoing costs to cover personnel, energy, chemicals, maintenance and other expenses. The sources of money to meet these capital and operational costs are essentially either user fees, public funds <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two. An increasing dimension to consider is the flexibility of the water supply system.|$|E

50|$|Black vinegar is an inky-black vinegar aged for a malty, woody, and smoky flavor.

25|$|Experts using {{computer}} modeling at Louisiana State University after Hurricane Katrina {{have concluded}} that the levees were never topped but rather faulty design, inadequate construction, <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two were responsible for the flooding of most of New Orleans: some canal walls leaked underneath, because the wall foundations were not deep enough in peat-subsoil to withstand the pressure of higher water.|$|E
25|$|Trephination {{involves}} an intentional and planned operation to open or bore into the skull on a live subject, using tools {{specifically designed for}} the purpose. This {{can be accomplished by}} several techniques, such as drilling, incising and abrasion, <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these. The purpose of such operations ranges from the medicinal (intended to relieve pressure, or address a number of other ailments) to the ritualised and experimental.|$|E
25|$|While {{normally}} and traditionally made of yeasted wheat, in {{the late}} 20th century variations on the bagel flourished. Non-traditional versions that change the dough recipe include pumpernickel, rye, sourdough, bran, whole wheat, and multigrain. Other variations change {{the flavor of the}} dough, often using blueberry, salt, onion, garlic, egg, cinnamon, raisin, chocolate chip, cheese, <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the above. Green bagels are sometimes created for St. Patrick's Day.|$|E
50|$|Many traditionalists further {{believe that}} errors have {{crept into the}} {{presentation}} and understanding of Catholic teachings {{since the time of}} the Council.

50|$|Navigation meshes can {{be created}} manually, automatically, <b>or</b> by <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the two.

Alternatively, an application could be created that takes the level geometry as input and automatically outputs a navmesh.|$|R
5000|$|A modern {{variety of}} roast beef {{sandwich}} {{has become a}} staple in Eastern Massachusetts.

25|$|Although the {{population}} of interest often consists of physical objects, sometimes we need to sample over time, space, <b>or</b> <b>some</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> these dimensions.

For the time dimension, the focus may be on periods or discrete occasions.|$|E
25|$|The speaker {{mounting}} scheme (including cabinets) {{can also}} cause diffraction, resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions.

50|$|Theologians usually use {{reason and}} {{deduction}} {{to prove the}} existence, unity and oneness of God.

Teleology is the supposition that there is a purpose or directive principle in the works and processes of nature.|$|R
50|$|Although not {{technically}} submetering, an alternate method of utility cost allocation called RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing Systems) is sometimes used to allocate costs to tenants when true submetering is not practical or not possible due to plumbing or wiring constraints.
