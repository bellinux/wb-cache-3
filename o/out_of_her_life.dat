5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to {{definitely}} push the limits... I think because, in the end, it's not really at all about domestic violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting that <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E

25|$|Jessica Tate (née Gatling) (Katherine Helmond)—The {{sister of}} Mary Campbell {{and one of}} the two main {{characters}} of the show. She is married to wealthy Chester Tate but separates from and later divorces him in the latter seasons of the series. Sweet-natured, extremely naïve and sheltered, she is often in a world of her own.

She is in denial of her husband's blatant infidelities throughout Season 1, although everyone repeatedly tells her about him and must listen to her increasingly absurd excuses. In Season 2 when she is accused of murder, she has no concept of the seriousness of her trial, flirting and making jokes with the judge. Later seasons show Jessica as still very sweet, but also stronger and less naïve in that she finally throws Chester <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Helmond is one of the two actors to appear in every episode of the series.|$|E
