In an interview with GameSpot, executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack. He stated how some nations were previously either too weak or too strong, and so features were added to balance gameplay. One way they did this is armed caravans and merchants were added to the Dutch nation, in order to weaken raids initiated by other players who rush their opponent. He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{article was}} {{published}} {{during a period}} of intense public debate. Freedom of press had been established in 1766 and encouraged people to give their suggestions <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> Swedish society. Economy, emigration, agriculture and education were hotly debated issues, as well as the problematic situation for unmarried middle class women. Without a spouse a woman in 18th century Sweden could have great difficulty supporting herself, especially as lower ranking servants were often promoted to maids and thereby lowering the number of employment opportunities for unmarried women.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, {{and that it}} can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets {{a job as a}} blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E
5|$|The pair of {{interchanges}} connecting NY390 to I-490 and NY31 {{have two}} major movements that cause weaving. The first is on NY390 northbound, where traffic entering NY390 from I-490 west must immediately merge into traffic to avoid taking the NY31 exit while motorists already on NY390 must cross traffic coming from I-490 {{to reach the}} ramp for NY31. The other is on NY390 southbound, where commuters entering NY390 south from NY31 must cross several lanes of traffic to access I-490 east. Additionally, the junction between NY390/ I-390 and I-490 serves over 200,000 cars daily and is often heavily congested during the morning and evening rush hours. In July 2010, the New York State Department of Transportation began soliciting ideas <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the junction. Roughly $32million has been earmarked for a future project to improve the interchange, which is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-2014.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the play are drawn from Fielding's own experiences. During Act II, the {{characters}} Marplay and Sparkish, two theatre managers, offer poor advice to Luckless <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> his play, which they then reject. This fictional event mirrors Fielding's own life when Colley Cibber and Robert Wilks of the Theatre Royal rejected The Temple Beau. Cibber was an inspiration for the character of Marplay and Wilks for Sparkish, but Sparkish {{does not appear in}} the revised version of 1734, after Wilks's death. In his place Fielding introduces a character who mocks Theophilus Cibber, Colley's son, and his role in the Actor Rebellion of 1733. Another biographical parallel involves the relationship between Luckless and Mrs Moneywood, which is similar to Fielding's own relationship with Jan Oson, his landlord during his stay in Leiden in early 1729. There Fielding incurred a debt of about £13 (equivalent to about £1,760 as of 2008), and a legal case was brought against him. Abandoning his personal property, Fielding fled to London; Oson's seizure of Fielding's possessions mirrors Mrs Moneywood's threats to seize those belonging to Luckless. Other characters are modelled on well-known personalities of whom Fielding was aware though they were not personal acquaintances:: Mrs Novel is Eliza Haywood, a writer, actress, and publisher; Signior Opera is Senesino, a famous Italian contralto castrato; Bookweight is similar to Edmund Curll, a bookseller and publisher known for unscrupulous publication and publicity; Orator is John Henley, a clergyman, entertainer, and well-known orator; Monsieur Pantomime is John Rich, a director and theatre manager; and Don Tragedio is Lewis Theobald, an editor and author. Sir Farcical Comick is another version of Colley Cibber, but only in his role as an entertainer.|$|E

25|$|Another {{class of}} methods assesses whether the {{inference}} {{was successful in}} light of the given observed data, for example, by comparing the posterior predictive distribution of summary statistics to the summary statistics observed. Beyond that, cross-validation techniques and predictive checks represent promising future strategies to evaluate the stability and out-of-sample predictive validity of ABC inferences. This is particularly important when modeling large data sets, because then the posterior support of a particular model can appear overwhelmingly conclusive, even if all proposed models in fact are poor representations of the stochastic system underlying the observation data. Out-of-sample predictive checks can reveal potential systematic biases within a model and provide clues <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> its structure or parametrization.|$|R

40|$|This review {{argues that}} {{implicit}} theories of malleability are essential constructs {{for the study}} of intergroup dynamics. As one of people’s core meaning-making tools, mindsets about malleability shed light on the mechanisms behind perceivers’ tendency to stereotype and feel prejudiced towards targets, {{as well as on the}} mechanisms underlying targets’ ability to shield against, and potentially confront, perceivers’ social bias. In addition to illuminating cross-group interaction dynamics between individuals, mindsets contribute to explaining the harmful processes at play in real-world protracted conflicts, and suggest interventions that may help lay the ground for peace processes. This review also aims to highlight areas of research that remain open for further investigation, or that have been overlooked to date. We argue that research integrating mindsets and intergroup relations will advance to our understanding of intergroup dynamics, as well as possibly offering insights <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improving</b> them, and that this approach will also further the study of lay theories of malleability...|$|R

25|$|Institutional {{factors have}} a {{significant}} impact on voter turnout. Rules and laws are also generally easier to change than attitudes, so much of the work done <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> voter turnout looks at these factors. Making voting compulsory has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout. Simply making it easier for candidates to stand through easier nomination rules is believed to increase voting. Conversely, adding barriers, such as a separate registration process, can suppress turnout. The salience of an election, the effect that a vote will have on policy, and its proportionality, how closely the result reflects the will of the people, are two structural factors that also likely have important effects on turnout.|$|E

25|$|Tc-99m {{remained}} a scientific curiosity until the 1950s when Powell Richards realized {{the potential of}} technetium-99m as a medical radiotracer and promoted its use among the medical community. While Richards {{was in charge of}} the radioisotope production at the Hot Lab Division of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Walter Tucker and Margaret Greene were working <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the separation process purity of the short-lived eluted daughter product iodine-132 from tellurium-132, its 3.2-days parent, produced in the Brookhaven Graphite Research Reactor. They detected a trace contaminant which proved to be Tc-99m, which was coming from Mo-99 and was following tellurium in the chemistry of the separation process for other fission products. Based on the similarities between the chemistry of the tellurium-iodine parent-daughter pair, Tucker and Greene developed the first technetium-99m generator in 1958 (see photo of this generator at the beginning of the article). It was not until 1960 that Richards became the first to suggest the idea of using technetium as a medical tracer.|$|E

25|$|The first {{proposal}} for a bridge across the Severn, approximately in the same location as that eventually constructed, was in 1824 by Thomas Telford, who {{had been asked to}} advise <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> mail coach services between London and Wales. No action was taken, and over the next few decades the railways became the dominant mode of long-distance travel, with the Severn Railway Bridge at Sharpness being opened in 1879 and the main line Severn Tunnel in 1886. However, the growth of road traffic in the early 20th century led to further calls for improvements, and in the early 1920s Chepstow Urban District Council convened a meeting of neighbouring local authorities to consider a Severn crossing to ease congestion and delays on the A48 passing through the town. In 1935 Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire County Councils jointly promoted a Parliamentary Bill to obtain powers to build the bridge over the estuary, with 75% of costs to be met by the Ministry of Transport from the Road Fund. However, the bill was rejected by Parliament after opposition from the Great Western Railway Company.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Thomas began courting Lucy Coleman, {{daughter}} of Pittsburgh iron manufacturing magnate William Coleman. Coleman provided Thomas with critical advice <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the Union Iron Mills, and inside {{information on the}} coming railroad building boom. Another critical business relationship was with Piper & Shiffler (later known as the Keystone Bridge Company), an iron bridge building firm invested in by Andrew Carnegie in 1862. Andrew diverted much of Piper & Shiffler's contracts to the Union Iron Mills, further bolstering the company's profits. Tom often tried to rein {{in some of his}} brother's excesses, but to no avail. For example, in 1866 Andrew proposed purchasing a pipe works adjacent to the old Cyclops iron works. Thomas opposed the purchase, arguing that the time for expansion was not ripe and that the pipe works used a kind of iron which the Union Iron Mills did not produce. The pipe works {{turned out to be a}} white elephant, but they burned down shortly thereafter (saving the firm from further losses).|$|E
25|$|Despite terrible winter weather, Eckford {{not only}} quickly {{established}} a shipyard, but also quarters for the shipbuilders, mess and kitchen buildings, a hospital, offices, and blockhouses, in what {{once had been}} merely a quiet hamlet, and made Sackets Harbor one of the US Navy's main bases during the war, also taking the opportunity to invest in real estate in the area. With the shipyard in operation, Eckford took time away from it in December 1812 to join Chauncey in an inspection tour of American military and shipyard facilities on the Great Lakes and, finding the yards on Lake Erie at Erie, Pennsylvania, and Black Rock, New York, struggling, made suggestions to their staffs <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> their shipbuilding efforts. Chauncey wrote to Noah Brown to hurry north from New York City and take charge at Erie, which Brown did in February 1813 while his brother Adam remained in New York City to work with Christian Bergh in ensuring that Noah received the men and supplies he needed. Noah Brown later moved to Lake Champlain, and later still to Sackets Harbor, where he joined Eckford in ship design and construction activities.|$|E
