He and NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) immediately travel to Massachusetts and break into Nancy's home while she is on vacation, hoping to erase the message. While Kenneth fumbles with the computer, Jack examines the house and finds evidence that Nancy's marriage is reaching its end. They eventually play the message, after Jack finds the voicemail code, in which Jack reminisces about their times in high school German class. In that class, [...] Jack had the name [...] "Klaus" [...] and Nancy had the name [...] "Greta"—and Jack says that he took the class to be with her. Jack decides not to erase the message, but Kenneth does so anyway. When they return to New York, Kenneth realizes that Nancy's voicemail code (55287) stands for [...] "Klaus", which means that Nancy does have feelings for Jack.|$|E
2500|$|Marzipan's Answering Machine is {{a series}} of {{cartoons}} with almost no animation. It features messages from the other characters, being played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> belonging to the character Marzipan. In early episodes, the episode number ended in [...]0 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 5.0), but since Marzipan changed to a new answering machine, the number ends in [...]2 (for example, Marzipan's Answering Machine Version 15.2). In every episode, Strong Bad prank calls Marzipan, badly pretending to be someone else, such as [...] "Detective Everybody", [...] "Safety Dan", and sometimes other characters. Although the animation is usually just a picture of the answering machine, sometimes there are short animated segments featuring the characters. As of April 1, 2016, there are 17 Marzipan's Answering Machines.|$|E

50|$|Instead of {{reaching}} the consumer, <b>the</b> consumer's <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> may have <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> call. The dialer may use an <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> detection (AMD) algorithm and leave a message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prospect's <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>The</b> objective is for the recipient to check and listen to their messages, and then to call back the phone number in the prerecorded message for more information.|$|R

2500|$|Trigger: On October 18, 2006, Penny Garden left a {{voice message}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> killer’s <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b> In <b>the</b> message, Garden {{informed}} the killer {{that she was}} firing her for not bleaching the grout as she had ordered.

[...] In the background, one can hear the song ("Lollipop Lollipop" [...] By The Chordettes) Penny listened to before she died, {{and the sound of}} her pouring a drink.|$|R
5000|$|In this segment, a {{selection}} of listener telephone calls left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show's <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> are played back, with the hosts and guests commenting on each call after it is played. While {{the content of the}} calls played varies, they are generally roughly divided into [...] "momentous occasions", wherein the caller relates something interesting which has happened to or around them, or [...] "moments of shame", wherein the caller recounts an event in which they acted foolishly or otherwise embarrassed themselves.|$|R

50|$|This {{school was}} the focus of a false email chain letter started around 2002. The message falsely claimed that a satiric message to parents about student truancies and {{homework}} problems was actually <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school's <b>answering</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>The</b> message was originally written in response to parent outrage that students who skipped class more than ten days per 90-schoolday semester (not counting legitimate absences, like sickness) could receive a failing grade in that class. This was reported on several web sites, including TruthOrFiction.com, Snopes, and BreakTheChain.org.|$|R
5000|$|...

In November 1995, Moore teamed up with friend and humorist Martin Lewis in organising a two-day salute to Cook in Los Angeles that Moore co-hosted with Lewis.|$|R

25|$|Star Caller - <b>The</b> feature began <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} show, {{and took}} place on Monday.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> had {{a rather}} serious problem in that, if it was in [...] "answer mode" [...] and was inactivated (perhaps by a mains power failure), when the power was restored, it would not return to [...] "answer mode" [...] until the user {{manually}} restored it to such using a switch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the machine.

50|$|Her partner, she says, was a feminist, {{a hopeless}} businessman, a {{journalist}} who could not hold down a staff job, and a passionate fighter and investigator for social causes and against the Far Right. The memoir details how the couple met and their struggles together at Expo, the anti-fascist publication Larsson founded in 1995. Larsson's crusade against Sweden's right wing fascist movements put him in constant danger and Gabrielsson writes that neo-Nazis left death threats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couple’s <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> and sent bullets in the mail, and suggests {{that part of the}} reason the two of them never married was that it would have made Larsson an easier target for his opponents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right.|$|R
2500|$|Ernest Edward [...] "Ernie" [...] Dell {{became the}} prime suspect after he {{was linked to the}} first three murders through {{employment}} records and club memberships. Upon investigating Ernie’s home, numerous models were found, making it clearer that he could be the Miniature Killer.

After being interrogated by the CSI’s, Ernie left a message <b>on</b> <b>the</b> killer’s <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> telling her that he saw her models, and knew that she was the killer before stating that he was heading over to talk. After Ernie killed himself, the CSI team discovered that he had only been covering for someone else.|$|R

50|$|The {{few words}} ("Allô oui c'est moi / Tu n'est pas là / Je me sens toute seule") of this mainly musical song were sampled from a singer's message left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> of Laurent Boutonnat, {{a day that}} {{she seemed to be}} sad after seeing a {{depressing}} television show. As a result, the lyrics are not of a high quality. The music is mostly composed of noise of water drops.|$|E
5000|$|On Track 3, [...] "They Get Lost", {{the band}} is {{introduced}} incorrectly as [...] "They Must Be Giants", which is a tongue-in-cheek reference to an untitled, partial recording that appears as track 13 on both Don't Let's Start and its re-release Miscellaneous T. It was inadvertently left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dial-A-Song <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> in which a confused listener named Gloria talks to an unknown third party about the mystery of [...] "There May Be Giants" [...] and [...] "There Must Be Giants", as she mistakenly refers to the band.

He served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II and was among the first soldiers to land on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, as part of the D-Day invasion. In addition to <b>the</b> patent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>answering</b> <b>machine</b> (1948), Zimmermann held dozens of other patents, including a security device that automatically dials a phone number and conveys information in case of an emergency; a magnetic recorder used to monitor heart patients; a system for accessing prerecorded lectures to earn college credit; an airport system to send out landing information to planes 24 hours a day. Zimmermann and his wife, Helen, had a son, Joseph.|$|R
50|$|Some series make {{minor changes}} to the title {{sequence}} of each episode, such as superimposing a different episode title on each one. Others make minor alterations to the content of the sequence itself, to keep them from being completely repetitive each episode and to reward attentive viewers. For example, The Rockford Files would feature a different message left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> title character's <b>answering</b> <b>machine,</b> and <b>The</b> Simpsons features several unique elements in the title sequence of each episode (e.g. the couch gag).|$|R
