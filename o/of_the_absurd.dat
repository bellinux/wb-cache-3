5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the sensibilities of the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurd,</b> and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
5|$|In a 1983 study, R. J. Kaufmann {{suggests}} that Shaw {{was a key}} forerunner—"godfather, if not actually finicky paterfamilias"—of the Theatre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Absurd.</b> Two further aspects of Shaw's theatrical legacy are noted by Crawford: his opposition to stage censorship, which was finally ended in 1968, and his efforts which extended over many years to establish a National Theatre. Shaw's short 1910 play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets, in which Shakespeare pleads with Queen Elizabeth I for the endowment of a state theatre, was part of this campaign.|$|E

25|$|For Camus, {{the beauty}} people {{encounter}} in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning {{in their own}} lives, {{which may not be}} the objective meaning of life (if there is one), but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an ironic distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurd,</b> lest the fictitious meaning take the place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurd.</b>|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, absurdism is a {{philosophical}} {{school of thought}} stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information {{as well as the}} vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Absurd</b> and how individuals, once becoming conscious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Absurd,</b> should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning.|$|E

50|$|Existentialism is {{generally}} considered a philosophical and cultural movement that holds that <b>the</b> starting point <b>of</b> philosophical thinking must be the individual and <b>the</b> experiences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual.

2500|$|<b>The</b> {{rejection}} <b>of</b> hope, in absurdism, {{denotes the}} refusal to believe in anything more than what this absurd life provides. Hope, Camus emphasizes, however, {{has nothing to do}} with despair (meaning that the two terms are not opposites). One can still live fully while rejecting hope, and, in fact, can only do so without hope. Hope is perceived by the absurdist as another fraudulent method <b>of</b> evading <b>the</b> <b>Absurd,</b> and by not having hope, one is motivated to live every fleeting moment to the fullest.

40|$|<b>The</b> work <b>of</b> Bruce Nauman can be {{understood}} as an enquiry into <b>the</b> <b>absurd.</b> His work is a critique <b>of</b> art, <b>the</b> artist and society, and is in part viewed as a mediation <b>of</b> stereotypical ‘truth’. <b>The</b> <b>absurd</b> is defined and analysed to elucidate <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> art and human behaviour by means of literary comparison, in particular of Camus, Sartre and Wittgenstein. This research focusses on Nauman’s subversive performance- based work and analyses how he simulates a particular work of Duchamp. I propose that Nauman espouses human activity into <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> objects, such as fountains. My artworks expand on Nauman’s interrogation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> a ‘true artist’ by embodying an absurd fountain as a Sisyphean construct.

25|$|When {{the market}} for {{etchings}} collapsed {{during the great depression}} in the early 1930s, Blampied reinvented himself as a cartoonist and caricaturist at an exhibition in 1931 called “Blampied’s Nonsense Show”. This brought out his love <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> and led to his only book, obscurely entitled Bottled Trout and Polo. In this period Blampied also published more than 30 humorous lithographs, many of dogs, that are not recorded in either of the catalogues raisonné (see Bibliography).|$|E
25|$|Another {{instance}} of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in The Sickness Unto Death, which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym Anti-Climacus. Exploring {{the forms of}} despair, Kierkegaard examines the type of despair known as defiance. In the opening quotation reproduced {{at the beginning of}} the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Absurd</b> Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.|$|E
25|$|Kierkegaard {{provides}} an example {{in one of his}} works, Fear and Trembling. In the story of Abraham in the Book of Genesis, Abraham is told by God to kill his son Isaac. Just as Abraham is about to kill Isaac, an angel stops Abraham from doing so. Kierkegaard believes that through virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurd,</b> Abraham, defying all reason and ethical duties ("you cannot act"), got back his son and reaffirmed his faith ("where I have to act"). However, {{it should be noted that}} in this particular case, the work was signed with the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio.|$|E
40|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Absurd</b> Hero in American Fiction, David Galloway portrayed Henderson as {{an absurd}} hero in Albert Camus' concept.

Both Camus' <b>The</b> Myth <b>of</b> Sisyphus and <b>the</b> Lord God's Holy Bible are the sources for this thesis comparison of Henderson's absurdity. In Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> 'absurd' is given as "unsound or incongruous". The world is strange to Camus’ and <b>the</b> Biblical <b>absurd</b> man. They have no set function in it. The traditional values and ideals of man are useless to these men because in these values {{they do not}} find reconciliation with the world. Hence, they feel heir presence {{in the world is}} “incongruous”. Their relationship to their environment is "unsound" because there is nothing to connect the two spiritually or philosophically. These absurd men refuse to accept reconciliation on what they feel are unsound terms. In this sense they are rebels...|$|R
2500|$|James's [...] "vastation" [...] {{initiated}} a spiritual crisis that lasted two years, and was finally resolved through <b>the</b> thorough exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Swedenborg (1688–1772), <b>the</b> Swedish scientist, religious visionary and teacher, and Christian mystic. [...] James became convinced that, {{as he put}} it, [...] "the curse of mankind, that which keeps our manhood so little and so depraved, is its sense <b>of</b> selfhood, and <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> abominable opinionativeness it engenders."

40|$|Violations to {{our sense}} of meaning have {{traditionally}} been {{thought of as a}} source of anxiety and threat. However, meaning violations can also be a source of humour, as is evidenced by their abundant use within comedy in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>absurd</b> humour. <b>The</b> present study investigated this apparent paradox by examining <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> expecting absurdity and perceiving an intention to be funny on humour ratings <b>of</b> <b>absurd</b> jokes. <b>The</b> roles <b>of</b> various individual differences were also investigated. Results indicated that expecting absurdity increased funniness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>absurd</b> joke encountered. Perceived intention to be funny did not affect funniness ratings. When controlling for individual differences, there was also a significant interaction between Expectation and Intention, although <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> this effect differed depending on which individual difference was controlled...|$|R
25|$|Certainly a man {{of fierce}} pride, his pride was {{tempered}} {{by a sense of}} humour that included a keen sense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> in his own situation. While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA's secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, his falling out with Cathal Brugha, for example; but at critical junctures he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests (such as his appointment to the Treaty negotiating team).|$|E

25|$|A {{consequence}} of the communist attitude towards the bourgeoisie elites in general, was the creation, {{for the first time}} in Romania's history, of a diaspora. Three individuals emerged as the most important Romanians abroad: playwright Eugen Ionescu (1909–1994) (who became known in France as Eugène Ionesco), creator of the Theatre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Absurd</b> and eventual member of the Académie française; religious historian and writer Mircea Eliade (1907–1986); and the essayist and philosopher Emil Cioran (1911–1996), the greatest French-writing master of style after Pascal. Fellow Romanian Ioan Petre Culianu continued Eliade's work with great success, in the United States. Another member of the diaspora who distinguished himself was the philosopher and logician Stephane Lupasco.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, the Cherry Lane Theatre was established. Located at 38 Commerce Street, it is New York City's oldest {{continuously}} running Off-Broadway theater.

25|$|His musical {{style is}} {{difficult}} to catalogue. It varies greatly {{with the passage of}} time, play after play and film after film. Working in a wide field of genres, due to the requirements of the dramaturgy or the script, Valdobrev successfully switches from melancholy, delicate and deeply emotional compositions to Balkan gypsy and folk brass music, from classic orchestra scores to ethno-ambient tunes. He sometimes uses a light jazz idiom with a slight hint <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> and another time would use examples of circus-like dodecaphonic themes in a gently ironic way. Artistic movements like New Romanticism, Postminimalism and World music are also influential on his work. What may be regarded as a mark of his output is the very occasional use of a memorable leitmotif in each of his compositions.|$|E
25|$|The {{intellectual}} {{tradition of}} his family was essential for Havel's lifetime adherence to the humanitarian values of the Czech culture. After finishing his military service (1957–59), Havel had to bring his intellectual ambitions {{in line with the}} given circumstances, especially with the restrictions imposed on him as a descendant of former middle-class family. He found employment in Prague's theatre world as a stagehand at Prague's Theatre ABC– Divadlo ABC, and then at the Theatre On Balustrade– Divadlo Na zábradlí. Simultaneously, he was a student of dramatic arts by correspondence at the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (DAMU). His first own full-length play performed in public, besides various vaudeville collaborations, was The Garden Party (1963). Presented in a series of Theatre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Absurd,</b> at the Theatre on Balustrade, this play won him international acclaim. The play was soon followed by The Memorandum, one of his best known plays, and The Increased Difficulty of Concentration, all at the Theatre on Balustrade. In 1968, The Memorandum was also brought to The Public Theater in New York, which helped to establish Havel's reputation in the United States. The Public Theater continued to produce his plays in the following years. After 1968, Havel's plays were banned from the theatre world in his own country, and he was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances of his works.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we tried to expose that <b>the</b> <b>absurd</b> theatre is {{opposing}} against the traditional theatre. <b>The</b> <b>absurd</b> theatre opposes against <b>the</b> traditional forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classic theatre.
