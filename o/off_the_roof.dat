5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof,</b> he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop of an abandoned gasworks in Hercules, California.

5|$|During the Second World War {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a {{conservation}} area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the fabric of the building and thieves had stolen the lead <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof.</b> Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Along the {{northern}} coastline of Venezuela, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation and a storm surge of about 13feet (4m), which damaged 60homes. Sustained winds on Isla Margarita peaked at 26mph (42km/h), {{and the most}} affected states were Falcón, Vargas, Aragua, Carabobo, and Anzoátegui. Rough waves capsized 10boats and closed several beaches, and one person drowned due to the surf. Further inland, two people drowned when a river overflowed its banks, and near Caracas a man died after strong winds toppled a wall. The combination of rainfall and winds destroyed 21houses and blew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of several others, affecting 1,376people, of whom 80 were left homeless. Power outages and lack of water were reported. In the country, the hurricane caused 127injuries, and a death toll reported between three and five. An initial news story reported 28people missing offshore on threeboats.|$|E

In the county, 2,500wharves and piers were destroyed, with another 1,000moderately damaged, resulting in $10.25million in monetary damage (2003USD, ($ USD). The storm surge destroyed {{the bridge to}} Saint George Island by {{a few hours after}} the hurricane made landfall, and the flooding covered much of the island for a week. There, 20homes were destroyed. Shore revetments experienced $53.4million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD). Throughout Saint Mary's County, residential damage amounted to about $17million (2003USD, ($ USD) with about $1.5million to commercial buildings (2003USD, ($ USD). The damage was caused primarily by the storm surge, though the winds produced minor to moderate damage, the worst effects in the state from winds. In the county, the winds blew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of a home and downed 70trees, leaving 27,092 without power.|$|E

5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station {{also had a}} garage door on the southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one main track and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E
5|$|As Charley {{moved across}} eastern North Carolina, {{hurricane}} warnings were extended northward, first to Virginia Beach; they were later extended to Cape Charles, {{then to the}} Maryland/Delaware border, and ultimately {{as far north as}} Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Prior to its arrival, the storm resulted in the closure of Norfolk International Airport, and more than 9,000people evacuated the coastline for emergency shelters. Tropical storm force winds spread across southeastern Virginia, with wind gusts reaching 82mph (133km/h) on Cape Charles. Offshore, a station on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel recorded sustained winds of 97mph (157km/h) with gusts to 104mph (168km/h). After the gust, the bridge-tunnel was closed overnight. The winds downed many trees, and in Norfolk, a motorist died after crashing into a downed tree. In Virginia Beach, the winds blew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of a hotel and destroyed two homes under construction. Across the area, the storm left about 110,000customers without power. Rainfall in Virginia was fairly light, including a 24-hour total of just over 1in (25mm) in Norfolk. Strong waves destroyed 250ft (76m) of Harrison's Pier in Norfolk. A preliminary damage estimate for the area was $1million (1986USD).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Edouard passed about 95miles (150km/h) {{southeast}} of Nantucket while moving at only 12mph (19km/h), much slower than previous New England hurricanes. This resulted in {{several hours of}} strong waves, winds, and rain. The hurricane produced wave heights of up to 31feet (9.4m), which washed twelve boats ashore and damaged numerous others. The strong waves and a storm surge of up to 2.1feet (.6m) in Nantucket flooded a few coastal roads. Edouard also produced tropical storm force winds across much of Massachusetts, {{as well as one}} hurricane-force gust on Nantucket. In addition, there were unofficial reports of stronger gusts, including 77mph (124km/h) on Cape Cod, 80mph (129km/h) on Martha's Vineyard, and 90mph (145km/h) on Nantucket. The strong winds caused power outages to 2/3 of Nantucket, all of Martha's Vineyard for six hours, and most of Cape Cod for several hours. Power outages, effecting 35,000 to 40,000 were reported throughout Massachusetts, though far from the power outages caused by Hurricane Bob five years prior. The winds also downed numerous trees, and blew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> of the fire station in Hyannis. Rainfall was moderate from the slow-moving hurricane, peaking at 6.37inches (162mm) in West Dennis with many other locations reporting over 3inches (76mm). The rainfall produced minor street flooding. Damage on Cape Cod totaled to $3.5million (1996USD, $4.6million 2007USD).|$|E

5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard cutout to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another.
