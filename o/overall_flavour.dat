40|$|Flavour {{is one of}} {{the most}} highly demanded {{consumer}} traits of tomato at present; poor flavour {{is one of the}} most commonly heard complaints associated with modern varieties of tomato. In order to combine flavour with other desirable fruit traits in improved cultivars, it is important to determine how much variability exists in the crucial compounds that contribute most to flavour. The objective of the present study was to determine the variability of flavour-contributing components including total soluble solids (TSS) and total titratable acids (TTA) among other subjective traits related to flavour in a core collection of tomato accessions. The core collection was comprised of 173 tomato accessions with a wide genetic background from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Services (ARS) Plant Genetic Resources Unit repository. The TTA varied from 0. 20 to 0. 64 %, whereas the TSS ranged from 3. 4 to 9. 0 %, indicating the availability of broad variation for these traits. Rinon (PI 118783), Turrialba, Purple Calabash and LA 2102 were among the high TTA (> 0. 45 %) containing accessions, whereas those with high TSS (> 7. 0 %) were AVRDC# 6, Sponzillo and LA 2102. A positive correlation of <b>overall</b> <b>flavour</b> with TTA (r= 0. 33; P< 0. 05) and TSS (r= 0. 37; P< 0. 05) indicated that these two components play an important role in determining the <b>overall</b> <b>flavour</b> in tomato.

Extracts of non-mature tequila were characterized by 26 odour-active regions, which included ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, 2 -phenylethyl acetate, β-damascenone, isoamyl alcohol and octanoic acid as the most odour-active compounds (flavour dilution, FD, factor ≥ 6561). In contrast, extracts of the mature spirit showed 36 odour-active zones, where the compounds with the highest FD factors (6561) were ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, 2 -phenylethyl acetate, isoamyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, guaiacol, 4 -ethyl guaiacol, vanillin, cis/trans whisky lactones, β-damascenone and octanoic acid. The aromagram of mature tequila was thus differentiated from that of the non-mature spirit owing to the presence of cask-extractive compounds and the increased FD factors of certain terpenes, higher alcohols and acetals.

40|$|Background and Aims:  This study {{investigated}} {{the interactive effects of}} malolactic bacterial strain, pre-malolactic fermentation (MLF) pH value and wine matrix/style on modulating chemical and sensory impacts of MLF in Cabernet Sauvignon wine. Methods and Results:  Malolactic fermentation was conducted in two styles of Cabernet Sauvignon wine, a lighter, fruity style and a more complex style. Each wine was divided into two equal volumes, one was adjusted to pH 3. 3 the other to pH 3. 7. Each of these wines was further divided into four equal volumes, three of which were inoculated with three different commercial Oenococcus oeni strains and the fourth used as a non-MLF control. Following MLF, all wines were standardised to approximately pH 3. 5. The MLF treatments exhibited significant strain- and wine matrix-dependent effects on a diversity of chemical components, including esters, volatile acids and higher alcohols, and on colour. Descriptive sensory analysis also demonstrated significant effects on several sensory properties. Partial least squares analysis revealed a strong correlation between important chemical components and sensory attributes, including <b>overall</b> fruit <b>flavour</b> and dark fruit aroma. Conclusions:  The extent and diversity of the impacts of MLF on wine chemical and sensory properties were directly influenced by choice of bacterial strain, pre-MLF pH and wine matrix composition. Relatively harsh conditions (pH 3. 3, 14. 8 % alcohol) protracted the time of MLF and supported greater differences between Oenococcus oeni strains in their modulation of important wine chemical components. Significance of the Study:  This study increases knowledge of the significant impacts of MLF on wine chemical composition and associated sensory properties. Specifically, variations in the effect of MLF on wine sensory and chemical properties has been found to arise from the choice of bacterial strain and wine matrix composition/style. P. J. Costello, I.

It has been cultivated in Japan {{for more than}} a thousand years and is now being grown in many coun-tries as interest in Japanese cuisine expands. Wasabi can be grown in two main ways, either in flooded fields or in soil based mediums. The unique flavour of wasabi comes from isothiocyanates (ITCs) which are evolved from precursor glucosinolates by the enzyme myrosinase when the tissue is disrupt-ed. ITCs found in wasabi are volatile, possess strong pungent smells and are toxic at high intakes. The <b>overall</b> <b>flavour</b> of wasabi depends on individual ITC content. Allyl ITC is found in the highest concen-tration in all tissues, ranging from 86 - 92 % of the total ITC content. Apart from flavouring sauces and foods wasabi isothiocyanates have interesting anticancer effects. ITCs can also counter inflammatory conditions like asthma and anaphylaxis.

40|$|Fruit and {{vegetables}} are regularly stored by consumers in the refrigerator at temperatures that may be well below the recommended storage temperatures. Apart from causing visible symptoms such as watery, sunken areas on the skin, chilling may also induce changes in fruit textural properties and flavour. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of low temperature storage on tomato flavour and off-flavour production. To more closely mimic the real-consumer aroma perception while eating, in addition to the standard solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (SPME/GC-MS) analysis, volatiles were also measured using a chewing device connected to a proton-transfer reaction–mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). Aroma volatiles were assessed in red ripe tomatoes of the cvs Cappricia RZ (round truss) and Amoroso RZ (cocktail truss) stored at refrigerator temperature (4 °C) and at higher temperatures (16 and 22 °C) for 20 days. The changes in aroma production were also monitored when the fruit was brought from room to refrigerator temperature and vice versa. After bringing the fruit from room to refrigerator temperature, the abundance of most volatiles was greatly reduced within 3 to 5 h, closely following the decrease in fruit temperature. When temperature was restored to room temperature following varying times of cold storage, the abundance of most volatiles increased again, but generally not to the original levels. Overall, the effects of low temperature storage on the decrease in volatile abundance were more pronounced in cv Cappricia RZ than in cv Amoroso RZ. On the contrary, the production of off flavours following prolonged cold storage was more pronounced in cv Amoroso RZ than in cv Cappricia RZ. Apart from changes in the overall abundance of the volatiles, marked changes in the volatile profile were observed in fruit stored for longer times in the cold and this may at least in part explain the negative effect of cold storage on <b>overall</b> tomato <b>flavour.</b> </p...|$|R

Another health issues affecting the world population is mineral deficiencies e. g. Iron deficiency. When swapping foods for healthier alternatives choosing foods that are rich in minerals could decrease the incidence of mineral deficiencies. Venison has long been thought of as a niche product and not as popular as other red meats. Evidence has shown venison to be a leaner red meat due to its lower fat content compared to others such as beef. This study will investigate if people like the taste of venison and how does venison’s mineral content compare to beef. This will ascertain if venison can be considered a viable option for people to swap over too. Objective: To investigate the mineral content of venison and beef to ascertain if swapping to venison from beef is a healthier option, while assessing consumer taste preferences. Methods: A consumer taste preference pilot study was carried out first. The main consumer taste preference study used the single blind randomised control tasting method using 21 subjects that recorded their results on a sensory questionnaire. The mineral content of venison raw (N= 3), cooked (N= 3) and beef raw (N= 3) and cooked (N= 3) were calculated by reducing samples to ash via ashing oven, and then using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectroscopy (ICPE).

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the present study}} is to provide an insight on the role played by {{non-volatile}} molecules on the different in-mouth attributes, particularly astringency. For achieving such goal, the main in-mouth sensory attributes of 34 oaked Spanish red wines were measured by a trained panel. The wine content in 30 sensory-active molecules was analysed by different HPLC based methodologies together with classical enological parameters and two proanthocyanidin indexes. Fourteen compounds (aconitic acids, polymeric proanthocyanidins, caftaric, caffeic and coutaric acids and seven quercetins) were found to be at concentrations above reported taste thresholds and to have a reasonably high range of occurrence. Two highly statistically significant models for astringency were built with those compounds. Even if the models could not be fully validated by sensory addition experiments, the research has demonstrated that wine astringency is driven by polymeric proanthocyanidins and by certain phenolic acids, the rate trans/cis-aconitic acid and flavonol profiles. The research has highlighted the existence of extremely complex interactions between non-volatile compounds on the in-mouth sensory perception. Particularly remarkable is the lack of additivity and potential antagonism found between the pairs cis/trans-aconitic acids, between aconitic and caffeic acids and between quercetin- 3 -O-galactoside and quercetin- 3 -O-glucoside. Also remarkable was the sweetness × astringent interaction and the matrix-dependence of the sensory responses elicited by flavonols. These results suggest the need for new paradigms and experimental procedures for fully decoding the real sensory relevance of individual non-volatile compounds in the <b>overall</b> wine <b>flavour.</b> © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
