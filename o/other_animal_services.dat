5000|$|Dogs are {{the most}} common <b>service</b> <b>animals,</b> {{assisting}} people in many different ways since at least 1927. [...] <b>Other</b> <b>animals</b> such as monkeys, birds, and horses have also been documented. In places of public accommodation in the United States, only dogs (and in some cases miniature horses) are legally considered <b>service</b> <b>animals.</b> [...] It is legal in certain states to have service [...] "animals". For instance, in Montana all animals are allowed at state level. Many cats, birds, and even a wolf are working to help mitigate people's disabilities in Montana. It is also legal to train your own <b>service</b> <b>animal</b> in the United States.

40|$|Animal {{diseases}} cause {{significant economic}} losses to the livestock sub-sector in sub Saharan Africa (SSA). To minimize these losses, SSA governments have allocated over 70 % of total livestock services budgets to {{disease control and}} <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> health <b>services.</b> Declining state budgets, however, have led to significant fluctuations in public animal health expenditures (PAHE). In Kenya, for example, annual PAHE varied from US$ 18. 3 million in 1988 to US$ 8. 0 million in 1989, recovering to US$ 15. 2 million by 1991. In 1995, PAHE had dropped again to US$ 7. 0 million. If public investment in disease control does indeed enhance livestock production, such fluctuations raise major concerns about Kenya's ability to develop its livestock sector. This paper measures the effects of PAHE on livestock production in Kenya. The hypothesis that higher levels of PAHE improve livestock production is empirically tested using annual time series data from 1970 - 1995. If the hypothesis is home out, the results provide a strong argument to policy makers for strengthening financial commitments to publicly funded <b>animal</b> health <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} the sustainability of Community-based Animal Health Worker (CAHW) services in Mwingi District, Kenya. These services began in 1992 and were supported by the District Veterinary Authority (DVA) with assistance from the Integrated Food Security Programme Eastern (IFSP-E). Over time and using a process of participatory reviews with multiple stakeholders, the system evolved into a network of CAHWs. The study focused on CAHWs service sustainability and their relationships with <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> health <b>service</b> providers. A mutually beneficial and supportive arrangement existed between the CAHWs and Animal Health Assistants (AHAs), based on a private drug supply system, referral and backstopping support. The CAHWs derived sufficient income from their veterinary work to maintain their interest in the system. Seventy per cent of CAHWs were continuing to offer adequate <b>animal</b> health <b>services</b> 3 years or more after their initial training and the withdrawal of donor support. Ninety-five per cent of sampled CAHWs (n = 40) viewed their business as successful and expanding. Considering the agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions of the district, the CAHW system can be viewed as an initial stage in the process of extending quality private sector veterinary services.

There have been attempts {{in one case}} to remove a cat from a library based upon concerns about patrons with allergies claiming violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in another specific case the reaction of a cat to <b>other</b> <b>service</b> <b>animals.</b> In one case, the removal of a library cat from its institution in Putnam Valley, New York, harmed the institution financially, when {{two members of the}} community were so upset about the removal that they removed the library from their wills, producing an $80,000 loss in potential revenue.|$|R

60|$|There {{are only}} two {{reasonable}} solutions of this exceedingly curious fact. The one is, that men of highly original ideas, like the mythical Prometheus, arose {{from time to time}} in the dawn of human progress, and left their respective marks on the world by being the first to subjugate the camel, the llama, the reindeer, the horse, the ox, the sheep, the hog, the dog, or some <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> to the <b>service</b> of man. The other hypothesis is that only a few species of animals are fitted by their nature to become domestic, and that these were discovered long ago through the exercise of no higher intelligence than is to be found among barbarous tribes of the present day. The failure of civilised man to add to the number of domesticated species would on this supposition be due to the fact that all the suitable material whence domestic animals could be derived has been long since worked out.|$|R
40|$|Brucellosis is an {{important}} disease among livestock and people in sub-Saharan Africa. In general, the incidence is the highest in pastoral production systems and decreases as herd size and size of landholding decreases.

The occurrence and epidemiology of brucellosis in pigs is poorly understood. This species bias is also reflected in control activities. As with <b>other</b> public-sector <b>animal</b> health <b>services,</b> the surveillance and control of brucellosis in sub-Saharan Africa is rarely implemented outside southern Africa. Brucellosis is even more ignored in humans and most cases go undiagnosed and untreated, leading to considerable suffering for those affected.

40|$|Endemic zoonoses {{are found}} {{throughout}} the developing world, wherever people live {{in close proximity to}} their animals, affecting not only the health of poor people but often also their livelihoods through the health of their livestock. Unlike newly emerging zoonoses that attract the attention of the developed world, these endemic zoonoses are by comparison neglected. This is, in part, a consequence of under-reporting, resulting in underestimation of their global burden, which in turn artificially downgrades their importance in the eyes of administrators and funding agencies. The development of cheap and effective vaccines is no guarantee that these endemic diseases will be eliminated in the near future. However, simply increasing awareness about their causes and how they may be prevented—often with very simple technologies—could reduce the incidence of many endemic zoonoses. Sustainable control of zoonoses is reliant on surveillance, but, as with <b>other</b> public-sector <b>animal</b> health <b>services,</b> this is rarely implemented in the developing world, not least {{because of the lack of}} sufficiently cheap diagnostics.

40|$|Community-managed {{reserves}} (CMRs) {{comprise the}} fastest-growing category {{of protected areas}} throughout the tropics. CMRs represent a compromise between advocates of nature conservation and advocates of human development. We ask whether CMRs succeed in achieving the goals of either. A fixed reserve area can produce only a finite resource supply, whereas human populations exploiting them tend to expand rapidly while adopting high-impact technologies to satisfy rising aspirations. Intentions behind the establishment of CMRs may be admirable, but represent an ideal rarely achieved. People tied to the natural forest subsist on income levels that are among {{the lowest in the}} Amazon. Limits of sustainable harvesting are often low and rarely known prior to reserve creation or respected thereafter, and resource exhaustion predictably follows. Unintended consequences typically emerge, such as overhunting of the seed dispersers, pollinators, and <b>other</b> <b>animals</b> that provide <b>services</b> essential to perpetuating the forest. CMRs are a low priority for governments, so mostly operate without enforcement, a laxity that encourages illegal forest conversion.

40|$|Mastitis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} diseases of dairy cows throughout the world, therefore it causes the greatest economic losses in dairy cattle industry. These losses are reflected through: reduced milk production, increased costs of medication and the <b>other</b> <b>animal</b> health <b>services,</b> reduced fertility, early culling of animals and the value of discarded milk. Mastitis is also important from the aspects of public health, milk processing and animal welfare. In the pathogenesis of mastitis the key role plays the innate immune response which is the first line of defence against the pathogen invasion of the udder. The innate immune response generates an inflammatory reaction which is the elementary response of an organism to the tissue trauma induced by any physical, chemical or biological causative agent, but primarily it is the protective mechanism of a vital significance which includes increased phagocytic activity, secretion of antimicrobial substances, fibrosis as well as the alterations in tissue structure of affected organ or body cavity. The release of a number of inflammatory mediators as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important part of inflammatory response. In dairy cows, the metabolic challenge that occurred during the transition from dry period to early lactation may additionally increase the release of ROS which may contribute to development of oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Oxidative stress is defined as a shift in the balance from cellular oxidation-reduction reactions towards oxidation, i. e. to the state of excessive release of oxidants when their removal by antioxidants is impaired and even insufficient. During peripartum period antioxidantive status of dairy cows is seriously impaired and consequently both the oxidative stress and inflammatory response may present the predisposing factors to their higher susceptibility to intramammary infections (IMI) and mastitis. This association between oxidative stress and inflammation during IMI and mastitis indicates their role in the pathogenesis of mastitis. Thus, a better understanding of such a synergism could contribute to development of new approaches to prevention and therapy of IMI and mastitis...|$|R
