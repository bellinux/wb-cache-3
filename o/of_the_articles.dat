5|$|An {{opposition}} {{group known}} as the Club emerged led by Sir James Montgomery, previously one of William's chief supporters but angered by Melville being preferred to him as Secretary of State. While the Club included a handful of Jacobites, it largely consisted of Episcopalians and dissident Presbyterians who opposed the Melville/Stair administration, not William himself. In July 1689, William agreed to end Episcopacy since nearly 200 Episcopalian clergy had already been evicted, a policy strongly supported by the Presbyterian majority in Parliament. He continued to resist abolition of the Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> before government defeat at the Battle of Killiecrankie led to Parliament being suspended on 2nd August.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been officially}} {{suspended}} {{at the end}} of the Cromwellian regime, parliament returned after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661. This parliament, later known disparagingly as the 'Drunken Parliament', revoked most of the Presbyterian gains of the last thirty years. Subsequently Charles' absence from Scotland and use of commissioners to rule his northern kingdom undermined the authority of the body. James' parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions, but after his escape to exile in 1689, William's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and, in contrast to the situation in England, effectively deposed James under the Claim of Right, which offered the crown to William and Mary, placing important limitations on royal power, including the abolition of the Lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles.</b> The new Williamite parliament would subsequently bring about its own demise by the Act of Union in 1707.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{coats of}} {{arms of the}} U.S. states {{date back to the}} {{admission}} of the first states to the Union. Despite the widely accepted practice of determining early statehood from the date of ratification of the United States Constitution, many of the original colonies referred to themselves as states shortly after the Declaration of Independence was signed on 4 July 1776. Committees of political leaders and intellectuals were established by state legislatures to research and propose a seal and coat of arms. Many of these members were signers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> of Confederation, Declaration of Independence, and United States Constitution. Several of the earliest adopted state coats of arms and seals were similar or identical to their colonial counterparts.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} Scotland regained its {{independent}} system of law, its parliament and its kirk, {{but also the}} Lords <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> (through which the crown controlled parliamentary business) and bishops. It also had a king who did not visit the country and ruled largely without reference to Parliament {{through a series of}} commissioners. These began with Middleton, now an earl, and ended with the king's brother and heir, James, Duke of York (known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany). Legislation was revoked back to 1633, by the Rescissory Act 1661, removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops' Wars, but the discipline of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods were renewed. Only four Covenanters were excluded from the general pardon and were executed, the most prominent being the Marquis of Argyll, but also including the Protester James Guthrie.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{figures in}} the new Parliament {{included}} Lord Melville, a Rye House Plotter who joined William's court in 1683 and the Earl of Stair, {{a former member of}} James VII's administration. In 1689 Melville became Secretary of State over Scotland, with Stair appointed Lord Advocate. The first session ended in a stalemate between Crown and Parliament over the abolition of Episcopacy and the Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles,</b> an unelected body used by the Scottish Crown to control legislation. Parliament refused to approve taxes or accept nominations for legal officers, closing the law courts. William retaliated by withholding Royal Assent which prevented the implementation of Parliamentary legislation.|$|E
5|$|Powers {{of search}} and seizure are covered by Section 3, which also {{repealed}} the Obscene Publications Act 1857. This section allows a Justice of the Peace, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe obscene publications are kept on certain premises for profit, to issue a warrant for that location. This warrant allows a police officer to enter the premises, search them and remove any suspect publications; if such publications are found, the officer can also take records relating to the businesses trade. The articles must then be brought before a magistrate and either forfeited by the owners or returned. The owner, author or publisher <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>articles,</b> or the person from whom they were seized, may appear before the magistrate to argue why {{they should not be}} forfeited.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{ratification}} {{and implementation of}} the United States Constitution, the thirteen sovereign states followed the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation was too weak to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy of}} salutary neglect for its North American colonies {{intended}} to minimise trade restrictions {{as a way}} of ensuring they stayed loyal to British interests. This permitted the development of the American Dream, a cultural spirit distinct from that of its European founders. The Thirteen Colonies of British America began an armed rebellion against British rule in 1775 when they rejected the right of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them without representation; they proclaimed their independence in 1776, and constituted the first thirteen states of the United States of America, which became a sovereign state in 1781 with the ratification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> of Confederation. The 1783 Treaty of Paris represented Great Britain's formal acknowledgement of the United States' sovereignty {{at the end of the}} American Revolutionary War.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> (1523).|$|E

5|$|When he had {{resigned}} as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a {{delegate to the}} Continental Congress, known as the Confederation Congress after the ratification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Articles</b> of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War, and was frequently ignored by the states. Congress elected Hancock to serve as its president, but he never attended because of his poor health {{and because he was}} not interested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in 1786.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{accepted}} Philip's invitation fully {{believing that}} {{he would be able to}} convince Luther. By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, Andreas Osiander, Johannes Brenz, and Justus Jonas. The debates were held from 1–3 October and the results were published in the fifteen Marburg Articles. The participants were able to agree on fourteen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>articles,</b> but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence of Christ in the eucharist. Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.|$|E
5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. The magazine was dedicated {{to the memory of}} the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less adversarial than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>articles</b> was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name anybody on the Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding all the participants from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E
