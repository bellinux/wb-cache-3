5|$|After 1261, {{new church}} {{architecture}} in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions to existing monastic churches, {{such as the}} Monastery of Lips and Pammakaristos Church, {{and as a result}} the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs.

5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to the glory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.|$|E

5|$|Brennus was {{the first}} pre-dreadnought style {{battleship}} built in the French Navy; the previous Magenta-class ships were barbette ships, a type of ironclad battleship.

5|$|Caversham has no {{secondary}} schools, {{although it}} does contain two primary schools and a special needs school. Caversham Primary School, {{at the corner of}} South Road and Surrey Street, has been at its present site since 1921. The school dates back to the early 1860s, and has a current enrollment of around 80 pupils. The school's two-storey 1920s brick buildings were pulled down and replaced in 1961, because of their structural unsoundness. The school's main gate– the only surviving remnant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> structure– is the suburb's war memorial.|$|E
5|$|Charles Martel was {{the first}} member of a group of five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship , but instead of mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E

5|$|From Exile onward, the {{characters}} of Myst were generally praised in each release. The live-action characters in the pre-rendered Myst titles were favorably received; Greg Kasavin of GameSpot said that the series' use of real actors and full-motion video endeared {{the characters}} to the player, giving the games a distinctively personal touch. Fellow Gamespot reviewer Scott Osborne stated the actors delivered convincing performances, and were smoothly incorporated into the game's scenes.
