5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Tales of Legendia was designed {{to focus on the}} interactions between the main cast. However, a unique feature to this game is the addition of a second series of scenarios after the player has completed the main story that focuses more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> characters themselves. Animated sequences also accompany certain story segments.|$|E

5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black.

Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> figures is clearly apparent.|$|E
5|$|Since camels have a {{slow growth}} rate; they reach sexual {{maturity}} only in advanced years. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> {{as does the}} reproductive period. Both sexes might mature by {{three to five years}} of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.|$|E
5|$|The History of British Political Parties is a {{comprehensive}} work which lists and describes over 250 political parties in the United Kingdom that have participated in parliamentary elections since 1832. Entries are organised alphabetically, and most descriptions of the political parties span a few paragraphs or pages.

5|$|The Temple {{teaches that}} the true self, or essence, is immortal, and Xeper {{is the ability to}} align {{consciousness}} with this essence. Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual's subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge understood as a conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping with its emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual,</b> the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} adds new difficulty levels ('Beginner' and 'Expert') and new {{modes of}} play ('Arena Challenge' and 'Legend' modes). In 'Arena Challenge Mode,' the player can engage one-on-one duels against various opponents, where they'll be rewarded if they win. The new 'Legend Mode' elaborates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> prowess {{of each individual}} warrior within Dynasty Warriors. Individual weapons are given the availability to have an 11th evolved state, increasing the weapon's stats further. Due to the great emphasis in the duelling system in this expansion, it is at times seen as its own individual game - separate from the original Dynasty Warriors 4.|$|E
5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P.

Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman to develop some musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what type of work {{will need to be}} completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects at the time as they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what they should look like.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{crocodilians}} are stalk-and-ambush predators, though hunting strategies {{vary depending}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> species and the prey being hunted. Terrestrial prey is stalked from the water's edge and then grabbed and drowned. Gharials and other fish-eating species sweep their jaws sideways to snap up prey, and these animals can leap {{out of the}} water to catch birds, bats, and leaping fish. Small animals can be killed by whiplash as the predator shakes its head. Caimans use their tails and bodies to herd fish into shallow water. They may also dig for bottom-dwelling invertebrates, and the smooth-fronted caiman will even hunt on land. Some crocodilian species have been observed to use sticks and branches to lure nest-building birds. Nile crocodiles are known to hunt cooperatively, and several individuals may feed on the same carcass. Most species will eat anything suitable that comes within reach and are also opportunistic scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a risk of damage to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E
5|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} is a spectrum disorder—its severity ranges over a spectrum from mild to severe. The {{majority of cases}} are mild and require no treatment. In these cases, the impact of symptoms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> may be mild, {{to the extent that}} casual observers might not know of their condition. The overall prognosis is positive, but a minority of children with Tourette syndrome have severe symptoms that persist into adulthood. A study of 46 subjects at 19 years of age found that the symptoms of 80% had minimum to mild impact on their overall functioning, and that the other 20% experienced at least a moderate impact on their overall functioning. The rare minority of severe cases can inhibit or prevent individuals from holding a job or having a fulfilling social life. In a follow-up study of thirty-one adults with Tourette's, all patients completed high school, 52% finished at least two years of college, and 71% were full-time employed or were pursuing higher education.|$|E
5|$|Wendover's {{mission was}} to train heavy bomb groups. The {{training}} of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator groups began in April 1942, {{with the arrival of}} the 306th Bomb Group flying B-17s. From March 1942 through April 1944, Wendover AAF hosted twenty newly formed B-17 and B-24 groups during one phase of their group training. The Second Air Force organized bombardment training into three phases. In the first, training focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> crew members. In the second, training involved the whole crew, who would conduct training together. The third and final phase saw the group's crews training together, with formation flying and practice combat missions. Until the end of 1943, each phase of training was conducted at a different base.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the United States can be found here.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E
