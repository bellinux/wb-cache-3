5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>experts.</b> The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.|$|E

5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> be charged with examining the issue.

40|$|The Alvey Report has {{resulted}} in a growing interest in the UK in 'expert systems'. It is fairly generally accepted, at least in the UK, that such systems function in a particular type of way, i. e. they arrive at decisions through a process of rule based inference. It is suggested that it may be more fruitful to regard rule based inference as one approach to the construction <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> systems, and that proven techniques of operational research may well be more useful in constructing other types <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> system. Alternative applications <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> systems are derived {{on the basis of a}} broader definition <b>of</b> an <b>expert</b> system in terms of what it does rather than how it does it. A parallel is drawn between these applications and some typical concerns of business research.

40|$|Scientific {{investigation}} or {{evidence is}} becoming increasingly important. Especially, {{there has been a}} dramatic increase in DNA testing. However, if the scientific evidence is false, this might lead to false accusation. It is difficult for laypersons including judges to understand and evaluate scientific evidence. Therefore, legal regulation is required for scientific examination or evidence. The Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure has the concept <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> evidence/examination that originated from “Gutachten” of German Law. Expertise, which may be scientific or nonscientific, is required because it does not belong to rules <b>of</b> thumb. <b>Expert</b> examiners have the dual character of being judges’ assistants and evidence themselves in the Japanese and European continental legal systems. In the Anglo-American legal system, experts are merely a type of witness（expert witnesses）. They work for the party（prosecutors or defendants）and impartiality is not required <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> witnesses. In contrast, expert examiners are appointed by judges and impartiality is required and expected of them. However, the legal status <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examiners does not necessarily guarantee the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> evidence/examination. We should consider the system required for maintenance and improvement <b>of</b> quality. <b>Expert</b> examination at the investigation stage is different from that at the trial stage. It is requested by police officers or prosecutors. Judges and defense lawyers have no involvement in the selection <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examiners and assignment of examination theses and materials. Expert examination requested by investigators might be influenced by unconscious biases. The major part <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> evidence presented in criminal trials is presented at the investigation stage. We must consider the appropriate system for handling expert evidence, with a clear picture <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> examination for investigation in mind...|$|R
