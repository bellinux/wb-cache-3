5|$|Although {{plants are}} {{better known for}} {{defensive}} mimicry, there are exceptions. For example, many flowers use mimicry to attract pollinators, while others may trick insects into dispersing their seeds. Nonetheless, most mimicry in plants would not be classified as aggressive, as although luring pollinators is similar to cases above, they are certainly not eaten by the plant. However some carnivorous plants {{may be able to}} increase their rate of capture through mimicry. For example, some have patterns in the ultraviolet region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>spectrum,</b> much like the spider webs described above.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} rate of supernova production in a galaxy {{the size of}} the Milky Way is about one every 50years.

5|$|M87 is a {{very strong}} source of gamma rays, which are the most {{energetic}} rays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Gamma rays coming from M87 have been observed since the late 1990s, but in 2006, using the High Energy Stereoscopic System Cherenkov telescopes, scientists have measured the variations of the gamma ray flux coming from M87, and found that the flux changes over a matter of days. This short period makes the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole in M87 the most promising source for these gamma rays. In general, the smaller the diameter of the emission source, the faster the variation in flux, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This {{is evidenced by}} the spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter {{demonstrates}} bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, {{which are}} transient and only occur {{at times of}} heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals. Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>spectrum</b> from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4μm and 7–14μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180nm).|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>spectrum,</b> including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the longer-wavelength {{afterglow}} emission (ranging from X-ray through radio) that follows gamma-ray bursts is better understood. Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself {{takes the form of}} matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light. As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas, it creates a relativistic shock wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space. A second shock wave, the reverse shock, may propagate back into the ejected matter. Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times (generally, hours to days after the explosion), although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma-ray burst has occurred.|$|E

5|$|Type I diamond has {{nitrogen}} (N) atoms as {{the main}} impurity, at a concentration of up to 1%. If the N atoms are in pairs or larger aggregates, they do not affect the diamond's color; these are Type Ia. About 98% of gem diamonds are type Ia: these diamonds belong to the Cape series, named after the diamond-rich region formerly known as Cape Province in South Africa, whose deposits are largely Type Ia. If the nitrogen atoms are dispersed throughout the crystal in isolated sites (not paired or grouped), they give the stone an intense yellow or occasionally brown tint (type Ib); the rare canary diamonds belong to this type, which represents only ~0.1% of known natural diamonds. Synthetic diamond containing nitrogen is usually of type Ib.
