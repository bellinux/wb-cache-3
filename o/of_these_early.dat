5|$|By about 5500BC, small tribes {{living in}} the Nile valley had {{developed}} {{into a series of}} cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and identifiable by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badari, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, stone tools, and its use of copper.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{immigrants}} to the Indonesian archipelago almost entirely originated from ethnic Han groups of what are now the Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China, areas known for their regional diversity. Large numbers of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, live in Southeast Asia. Nearly all Chinese Indonesians are either patrilineal descendants <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> immigrants, or new immigrants born in mainland China.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{was first}} {{subdivided}} into {{counties in the}} Middle Ages. Counties were first introduced in Croatia during the House of Trpimirović's rule. The exact number and borders <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> counties are difficult to determine accurately; they were considered to encompass areas subordinated to a single centre of local authority, but the possessions of significant nobles had a legal status separate from local authority.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} he joined an amateur theatre company, {{in which he}} acted and wrote plays. The {{manuscript}} of one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> plays, Amoroso, King of Little Britain, was by chance seen by the comic actor John Pritt Harley, who, recognising its potential, brought about (and acted in) its performance at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Its favourable reception launched Planché on his theatrical career.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> {{international}} {{performances were}} in German, {{under the title}} Die verkaufte Braut, and the German-language version continues to be played and recorded. A German film of the opera was made in 1932 by Max Ophüls.|$|E

5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E
5|$|Although many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> {{schools were}} open {{for only a}} short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest, {{continuously}} operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the first}} {{industries}} to arrive was the Manchester Patent Fuel Company, in 1898. The Trafford Brick Company arrived soon after, followed by J.W. Southern & Co. (timber merchants), James Gresham (engineers), and W. T. Glovers & Co. (electric cable manufacturers). Glovers also built a power {{station in the}} park, {{on the banks of}} the Bridgewater Canal. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> developments were built on the eastern side of the park, while the rest of it remained largely undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

50|$|A patent {{application}} may claim priority {{from one or}} more previously filed applications {{to take advantage of}} the filing date <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>earlier</b> applications (in respect of the information contained in <b>these</b> <b>earlier</b> applications). Claiming priority is desirable because the earlier effective filing date reduces the number of prior art disclosures, increasing the likelihood of obtaining a patent.|$|R

5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, optical fiber technology {{was applied to}} one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> gastrocameras to produce the first flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} outrigger canoes from southern Borneo. Upon arrival, early settlers practiced slash-and-burn agriculture {{to clear the}} coastal rainforests for cultivation. The first settlers encountered Madagascar's abundance of megafauna, including giant lemurs, elephant birds, giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus, which have since become extinct due to hunting and habitat destruction. By 600AD groups <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> settlers had begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Arab traders first reached the island between the seventh and ninth centuries. A wave of Bantu-speaking migrants from southeastern Africa arrived around 1000AD. They introduced the zebu, a type of long-horned humped cattle, which they kept in large herds.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, many of the descendants <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>earlier</b> German settlers had become successful and prominent businessmen, philanthropists, educators/academicians, international entrepreneurs, and scientists and were among the pioneers of Puerto Rico's television and mass media and journalism industries of today.|$|R

5|$|Following the duels, general {{engagement}} {{between the}} two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks. The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying the best <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift {{the outcome of the}} battle, as they ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known, but two possibles exist. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company until moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. Q. David Bowers says that the attribution <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> directors often comes from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known shrines {{appeared in}} Egypt {{in the late}} Predynastic Period, in the late fourth millenniumBC, at sites such as Sais and Buto in Lower Egypt and Nekhen and Coptos in Upper Egypt. Most of these shrines were made of perishable materials such as wood, reed matting, and mudbrick. Despite the impermanence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>early</b> buildings, later Egyptian art continually reused and adapted elements from them, evoking the ancient shrines to suggest the eternal nature of the gods and their dwelling places.|$|E

50|$|Although {{this was}} {{technically}} an Anglo-Dutch war (as it was fought between Britain and the Netherlands), many respectable historians, such as Steven Pincus, {{argue that this}} later war stemmed from completely different causes and therefore should not {{be included in a}} discussion <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>earlier</b> wars.|$|R
