40|$|We {{concentrate}} {{our efforts}} on building virtual modelling environments where the content creator uses controls (widgets) as an interactive adjustment modality for {{the properties of}} the edited objects. Besides the advantage of being an on-line modelling approach (visualised just like any <b>other</b> <b>on-line</b> VRML <b>content),</b> our approach provides also instant visualisation and an intuitive, graphical editing modality. Although visual modelling environments are more powerful in content creation than a text editor, our aim is to include certain domain knowledge to extend their capabilities. Our most recent system is a 3 D character modeller capable of handling H-anim or other types of hierarchies (based also on H-anim components) and the geometry attached to them. The modelling is based on the properties of regular grid geometries, on H-anim hierarchies and where applicable, on 3 D character symmetry. The novelty of our approach consists of 1) natural graphics components; 2) integrating the interface elements into the virtual environment itself; 3) rule based modelling of 3 D characters; 4) on-line modelling...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the impact that proctored versus un-proctored testing would have on {{learning}} for an <b>on-line</b> <b>content</b> module; and examine the relationship between LASSI variables and learning. A randomized, pre-test/post-test control group design was employed. College students in a pharmacy curriculum, were randomized to two groups utilizing asynchronous, <b>on-line</b> <b>content</b> with a medical terminology module. Group A utilized proctored, on-line testing, while Group B utilized un-proctored on-line testing. Both were given a pre-test and post-test on medical terminology at the beginning and end of a sixteen week semester. The Learning and Study Strategies Inventory was administered to all students. On-line module delivery paired with proctored testing was more effective in promoting learning when compared to on-line module delivery paired with un-proctored testing. The constructs: anxiety, self-testing, attitude/interest and motivation were significant in predicting learning for proctored students. No significant model emerged for un-proctored students. Internet based course instruction has been advocated as accentuating the "studen...|$|R
