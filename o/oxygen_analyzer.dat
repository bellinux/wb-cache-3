2500|$|<b>Oxygen</b> analyzer: <b>Oxygen</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{suitable}} for respirometry {{use a variety}} of oxygen sensors, including galvanic ("ambient temperature"), paramagnetic, polarographic (Clark-type electrodes), and zirconium ("high temperature") sensors. [...] Galvanic O2 analyzers use a fuel cell containing an acidic electrolyte, a heavy-metal anode and a thin gas-permeable membrane. Since the partial pressure of O2 near the anode is zero, O2 is driven by diffusion to the anode via the membrane at a rate proportional to ambient O2 partial pressure. The fuel cell produces a voltage linearly proportional to the O2 partial pressure at the membrane. As long as cabinet temperature is stable, and provided that air flow across the fuel cell is stable and within range, the response will be 0.01% or better depending on supporting electronics, software, and other considerations.|$|R

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} oxygen {{content in the}} flue gas at a coal-fired power plant {{is important for the}} plant operators to realize closed-loop and optimal control. In this paper, eight zirconium <b>oxygen</b> <b>analyzers</b> were used to measure the oxygen content in the flue gas under real plant conditions. A cloud model is incorporated into the measurement system. In consideration of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the oxygen sensors, a quantitative transformation fusion model based on the cloud model theory is established. The oxygen content in the flue gas is calculated using mean value, space fusion, and space-time fusion methods, respectively. The temperatures of both flue gas and cold air are also measured to calculate the heat loss of the flue gas and the combustion efficiency of the boiler. On-plant demonstration results show that the proposed method produces more accurate measurements than those from the mean value method, leading to increased combustion efficiency and reduced heat loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of {{heat release rate}} by oxygen consumption {{is based on the}} assumption that all materials release approximately the same amount of heat per unit mass of oxygen consumed.
