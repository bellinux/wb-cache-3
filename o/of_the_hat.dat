5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending from the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hat</b> and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, {{and as a result}} alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E

He reportedly gave a long speech praising cockfighting, in a joking manner, to Emperor Gia Long and sometimes beat the drum himself in order to encourage the actors and actresses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hát</b> bội troupes when they were performing for him. He was also known for his patronage of goddess spirits that were popularly venerated by local southerners in folk religions. In addition, Duyệt was the instructor of three đình formalities, a code of ceremonial conduct and customs that were copies of royal rituals.|$|E

40|$|We {{utilize the}} {{asymmetric}} random telegraph wave-based instantaneous noise-base logic scheme to represent <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> drawing numbers from a hat, and we consider two identical <b>hats</b> with <b>the</b> first 2 ^N integer numbers. In the first problem, Alice secretly draws an arbitrary number from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hats,</b> and Bob must {{find out which}} hat is missing a number. In the second problem, Alice removes a known number from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hats</b> and another known number from <b>the</b> other <b>hat,</b> and Bob must identify these hats. We show that, when <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hats</b> with <b>the</b> numbers is accounted for, the noise-based logic scheme always provides an exponential speed-up and/or it requires exponentially smaller computational complexity than deterministic alternatives. Both the stochasticity {{and the ability to}} superpose numbers are essential components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exponential improvement.

5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single tassel on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose on the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hat.</b> According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina {{took power}} in an {{atmosphere}} of national tension and international pressure to re-establish constitutional authority. The new head of state announced on 17 March that a new constitution would be presented for voter approval and general elections would be held within 24 months. Immediately after taking office, Rajoelina began naming opposition leaders to positions within the HAT. He dissolved the Senate and Parliament and transferred their powers to his cabinet, the officials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>HAT,</b> and the newly established Council for social and economic strengthening, through which his policies were issued as decrees. Legislative authority rested in practice with Rajoelina and his cabinet, composed of his closest advisers. A military committee established in April increased HAT control over security and defense policy. The following month, after the suspension of the country's 22 regional governors, Rajoelina strengthened his influence over local government by naming replacements despite the fact that regional governorships were normally elected positions. The National Inquiry Commission (CNME) was established shortly thereafter; although its official purpose was to strengthen HAT effectiveness in addressing judicial and legal matters, the new entity carried out investigations and arrests of TIM supporters and other opponents of the TGV party. In addition, the new administration launched a strong crackdown on demonstrations by the new opposition, composed largely of Ravalomanana supporters; at two demonstrations in April 2009 security forces opened fire on unarmed civilians protesting the HAT's closure of three media networks formerly controlled by Ravalomanana, killing four and wounding sixty. Political analysts have criticized Rajoelina for using his position primarily to consolidate power and protect his political position and business interests and those of his supporters, observing that his initially broad range of supporters within the opposition movement has significantly diminished over time.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} in Denton and Haughton was prosperous and {{an integral part}} of the town, working conditions in the factories were not risk free. One of the problems workers faced was mercury poisoning; mercury was used to separate the fur from the rabbit hide and workers were in regular contact with fur impregnated with mercury or exposed to mercury vapour. Inadequate ventilation in some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hat</b> making process led to other sorts of dangers; solvents were also used and on 14 January 1901 there was an explosion at the factory of Joseph Wilson & Sons in Denton, killing 13 people and injuring many more. The explosion was of vapour from methylated spirits used in the dying process.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} of the Spanish Civil War, Zimmerman led a trade union {{campaign}} to aid the Spanish workers and civilian populations in Spain who suffered under shortages of food, clothing, and medicine. The initial impulse for this fund-raising work was an appeal that came to Dubinsky and the ILGWU from secretary general Walter Schevenels and president Walter M. Citrine of the International Federation of Trade Unions, which had established a Labor Solidarity Fund for the relief work. In response the ILGWU took the lead in founding the Trade Union Red Cross for Spain, with Zimmerman as chairman, Dubinsky as treasurer, and Alex Rose, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hat,</b> Cap, and Millinery Workers Union, as secretary. Promoting the humanitarian effort as support to Spanish labor in the fight against fascism, the union leaders raised $125,000 by May 1937. The relief organization was later renamed Trade Union Relief for Spain, and remained in existence through early 1939.|$|E

25|$|Corps and regimental badges {{include both}} hat and collar badges (usually smaller {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hat</b> badge). The majority of corps badges in the Australian Army are copied from the badges {{of the equivalent}} corps in the British Army. Berets include the general duty dark blue (worn by service corps and others not eligible to wear a special-to-corps or unit beret), while other colours include black (armoured corps), rifle green (Royal Australian Regiment), fawn or sand / tan (SASR), Sherwood green (commandos), maroon or dull cherry (airborne), scarlet (military police), slate grey (nursing corps) and light blue (aviation and personnel on service with the United Nations). Lanyards vary in colour by corps and unit are mostly worn on the right shoulder, although units of the infantry corps wear them on the left, as do {{some members of the}} artillery, and the Australian Federation Guard. Different colours and designs are allocated to each corps and many units. Unit colour patches were re-introduced in 1987 for units that could trace their lineage back to units of either the 1st or 2nd AIF, while the current Series II colour patch was adopted in 1995, introducing a system of patches designed for all units and organisations of the Army. At this time the practice of wearing patches on the shoulder ceased, and they were worn on the right-hand side of the puggaree on the slouch hat instead.|$|E
25|$|The figure {{behind the}} daughter, Clotilde Sorolla, also wears a white dress, her hips accented {{by a white}} belt. Thus both the breasts and the {{buttocks}} have clearer contours than the daughter's. Clothilde's dress has cropped sleeves, and she carries a jacket, also made of white fabric, on her left forearm {{in front of her}} abdomen. In her left hand she holds an open white parasol, which is angled to the ground on the left side. Under Clotilde's dress are two elegant white women's shoes with small heels. On her head Clotilde wears a straw hat, which is also decorated with purple colored flowers. In addition, a greenish-transparent veil is draped over the entire hat, and falls forward over her face and is blown backward almost horizontally in the wind. Clotilde has bent her right arm upward and her hand lies on the veil. This creates the impression that she must adjust it due to the wind veil or even hold it in place. Of the head of Clotilde little can be seen. Large parts of face, depicted in profile, are in shadow and only the chin is in brighter sunlight. Also, the wide sweeping hat obscures the hair almost completely. Just behind a pearl earring is a bit of dark hair. While the young face of the daughter Maria is looks directly into the sun, the face of the mother is hidden by the shadow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hat.</b> The clothes and accessories show the two women to be members of the upper class spending their free time in the summer with mild temperatures and light winds.|$|E
