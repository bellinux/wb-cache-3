5|$|The {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> {{has led to}} extensive {{discussion about}} its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in {{the population of the}} eurozone that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which have seen their price round up after the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro.</b> The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> to do so.|$|E

5|$|As of January 2014, {{and since}} the {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro,</b> interest rates of most members countries (particularly those with a weak currency), have decreased.

5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> is mixed. Several studies failed to find any evidence of convergence following the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence {{may not have been}} linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
5|$|Uncovered {{interest}} rate parity asserts that an investor with dollar deposits will earn the {{interest rate}} available on dollar deposits, while an investor holding euro deposits will earn {{the interest rate}} available in the eurozone, but also a potential gain or loss on euros depending on the rate of appreciation or depreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> against the dollar. Economists have extrapolated a useful approximation of uncovered interest rate parity that follows intuitively from these assumptions. If uncovered interest rate parity holds, such that an investor is indifferent between dollar versus euro deposits, then any excess return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected loss from depreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> against the dollar. Conversely, some shortfall in return on euro deposits must be offset by some expected gain from appreciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> against the dollar. The following equation represents the uncovered interest rate parity approximation.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

We also construct a dataset that records <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> legislative-regulatory harmonization policies in financial services across the European Union. We find that <b>the</b> <b>euro's</b> impact on financial integration is primarily driven by eliminating the currency risk.

5|$|On 28 June 2012 eurozone leaders {{agreed to}} permit loans by the European Stability Mechanism {{to be made}} {{directly}} to stressed banks rather than through eurozone states, to avoid adding to sovereign debt.

The reform was immediately reflected by a reduction in yield of long-term bonds issued by member states such as Italy and Spain and a rise in value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Euro.</b>|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile is edible, as {{indicated}} by its alternative specific epithet edulis, and was known to the ancient Greeks; it is probably this species which they depicted on medals found at Agrigento, Sicily.

5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might {{be the source of}} observed increase in trade.|$|E
2500|$|Croatia's currency, the kuna, {{has used}} <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> (and {{prior to that}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro's</b> major predecessors, <b>the</b> Deutsche Mark) as its main {{reference}} since its creation in 1994, and a long-held policy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian National Bank has been to keep the kuna's exchange rate with <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> within a relatively stable range. Prior to Croatia becoming a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU on 1 July 2013, Boris Vujčić, governor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian National Bank, stated {{that he would like}} the kuna to be replaced by <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> as soon as possible after accession.

5|$|Just as {{the concept}} of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union. In 1951 the {{beginnings}} of the EU were founded with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This is where the relation between globalization, the EU, and First World countries arises. Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Euro,</b> the creation of the European Monetary Institute, and the opening of the European Central Bank.|$|E
5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> lasted about two months, from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months after that. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for ten years or more.|$|E
5|$|The euro was {{established}} by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict criteria, such as a budget deficit of less than three percent of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than sixty percent of GDP (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union {{which resulted in the}} introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>euro.</b>|$|E
