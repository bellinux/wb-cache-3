40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Presently, {{ecological}} conditions of landscapes {{are the result}} of <b>ownerships,</b> spatial pattern and dynamics of <b>ownerships,</b> and ecological interactions among individual <b>ownerships.</b> <b>Ownerships</b> are distinct jurisdictional units, however, forest spatial patterns, processes, functions, disturbances, and health conditions exceed current legal boundaries. Applying spatial and multivariate statistics across <b>ownerships</b> allows researchers and managers to quantify influences on {{ecological conditions}} and better identify objectives and alternatives for ecological issues. Research identified the value the Yakama Nation offers as an operational framework to implement collaborative planned treatment activities and promote development, planning, and implementation of future treatments. Analyses concluded increasing logging activity to enhance collaborative ecosystem restoration activities, sustain, and develop local industries and economies dependent on sustainable forest resources. Collaborative forest management networks like the Anchor Forest Pilot Project and Tapash Sustainable Forest Collaborative should review these results to determine applicability and identify opportunities for treatment implementation and sustained collaboration...|$|R

The NBA claimed the lawsuit was void because Schultz signed a release forbidding himself to sue Bennett's group but also argued that the proposal would have violated league <b>ownership</b> rules.

40|$|This {{research}} presents {{trends in}} life insurance purchases and <b>ownerships</b> in the United States and examines the {{factors related to}} their purchases and <b>ownerships</b> at both the macro and micro level. Despite {{an increase in the}} value (in current dollars) of life insurance purchased or owned, the number of life policies purchased and owned has declined in recent years. This study develops and uses purchase and owning rates to measure how Americans are protected by life insurance. These rates are better than absolute numbers for measuring the level of protection of a population. Besides looking at the effects of socio-economic factors on life insurance purchases and <b>ownerships,</b> this research focuses on the effects of demographic changes, specifically, the changes in the American population structure and household composition. Results show that most of the decline in purchase and owning rates resulted from the decline in the rate schedules; demographic changes accounted for {{only a small part of}} the decline. In addition, this research examines the relationship among different life insurance products within purchases or/and <b>ownerships</b> at both the macro and micro level, especially the relationship between the group and individual life insurance purchases or <b>ownerships.</b> This study shows that there is no evidence that the relationship between the two products is substitutive. ...|$|R
