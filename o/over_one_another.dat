5|$|A heated {{confrontation}} between Randy Orton and Edge was seen, with Edge spearing Orton. The following week, {{it was announced}} that Orton would defend the Intercontinental Championship against Edge at Vengeance. Weeks leading to the event, both men took the upper hand <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> At the scheduled event, Orton lost the Intercontinental Championship to Edge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match was}} between Eddie Guerrero and Luther Reigns. In the early stages, both {{competitors}} took the advantage <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Reigns controlled {{most of the}} match, as Guerrero tried to avoid Reigns' assaults. Guerrero won the match after attacking Reigns with a baton taken from a security guard.|$|E

5|$|Some affiliative {{behaviors}} are seasonal or gender-specific, {{such as the}} male squeal approach and anogenital inspections performed during the mating season. Another example is the female greeting behavior, where two females will use their anogenital scent glands to mark each other's backs, jump <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> writhe together, and emit squealing vocalizations. This behavior is not seen during {{the end of the}} cool, dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age. All ruffed lemurs over five months of age allogroom, and, in captivity, subadults participate in play more frequently than adults.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. The match saw all three wrestlers take the advantage <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> A spot in the match included Jericho applying the Walls of Jericho on Cena, but he released the move and performed a springboard dropkick on Christian, after Christian got up on the ring apron. Late in the match, Jericho reversed an Unprettier attempt by Christian by tossing Christian directly to Cena. Cena performed an FU on Christian and pinned Christian to retain the WWE title.|$|E
5|$|Around 1279BC, Ramesses II, {{also known}} as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, {{and went on to}} build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more {{children}} than any other pharaoh in history. A bold military leader, Ramesses II led his army against the Hittites in the Battle of Kadesh (in modern Syria) and, after fighting to a stalemate, finally agreed to the first recorded peace treaty, around 1258BC. With both the Egyptians and Hittite Empire proving unable to gain the upper hand <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> and both powers also fearful of the expanding Middle Assyrian Empire, Egypt withdrew from much of the Near East. The Hittites were thus left to compete unsuccessfully with the powerful Assyrians and the newly arrived Phrygians.|$|E
50|$|At {{lunch time}} when the {{ceremony}} begins, {{everyone in the family}} {{stands in front of the}} mirror to pray. Sharbat is drunk and then—as a good omen—sormeh is applied around the eyes. Handfuls of wild marjoram, lotus and sugar plum seeds are thrown <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> heads while they embrace <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 92 BC Crassus {{was elected}} censor with Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. The two colleagues were well remembered by ancient sources for their petty disputes, {{for example in}} exchanging insults <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> luxurious mansions. Eventually, these public quarrels forced them to abdicate the {{position}} early, amid much scandal and controversy.|$|R
60|$|I {{modestly}} assented, and we {{all fell}} through a little dirty swing door, {{into a sort of}} hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just room for us to look at him <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> shoulders, by keeping the packing-case door, or lid, wide open.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} {{televised}} match, Randy Orton faced Kurt Angle. In {{the early stages}} both superstars took the advantage <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Angle controlled most of the match, as Orton tried to avoid Angle's assaults. Angle tried to perform a suplex on Orton off the ring apron, but did not perform the move. This was followed by Angle performing a belly to back suplex on Orton on the outside ring floor. Mid-way in the match, Orton attempted to perform an RKO by jumping and grabbing Angle's head to drive it over his shoulders, but he countered by pushing Orton to the turnbuckle. Orton took the padding off the turnbuckle, leaving it exposed. Following this, Angle began performing a series of German suplexes on Orton. Angle then applied the ankle lock hold. Orton, however, flipped over and sent Angle face-first into the exposed turnbuckle. As he turned around, Orton performed the RKO, and covered Angle to gain the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of verbal cues, or all pantomiming <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.)</b> Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E
25|$|The knight {{moves on}} an {{extended}} diagonal from {{one corner of}} any 2×3 rectangle of squares to the furthest opposite corner. Consequently, the knight alternates its square color each time it moves. The knight is the only piece that jumps over any intervening piece(s) when moving (castling being the only special instance in which pieces jump <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another).</b>|$|E
50|$|Kōnane is a two-player {{strategy}} {{board game}} from Hawaii. It {{was invented by}} the ancient Hawaiian Polynesians. The game begins with all the counters filling the board in an alternating pattern of black and white. Players then hop <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> pieces, capturing them similar to checkers. The first player unable to capture is the loser; his opponent is the winner.|$|R

[...] She escapes from the arms {{stretched}} towards her, {{and out of the}} door, just before her guests enter from the library, and Campbell remains to receive them. The ladies, in returning, call <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> heads and shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... --but did {{not last}} long. The Raja's {{daughter}} -- for the principal maiden was a princess -- soon left her companions, who were scooping up water with their palms and dashing it <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> heads, and proceeded to perform the rites of purification, meditation, and worship. Then she began strolling with a friend {{under the shade of}} a small mango grove.|$|R
25|$|PC {{lighting}} is also high-power fluorescent lighting, but the tubes are thinner {{and are often}} folded <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> to reduce size. Most spiral-shaped energy-efficient light bulbs commercially available for house lighting are power compact fluorescent bulbs. PC bulbs are recommended to be replaced every {{six months to a}} year to keep the desired light spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Solids {{that are}} {{composed}} of small, weakly bound molecules are mechanically weak and have low melting points; an extreme case is solid molecular hydrogen, which melts at 14K (−259°C). The non-directional nature of dispersion forces typically allows easy plastic deformation, as planes of molecules can slide <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> without seriously disrupting their attractive interactions. Molecular solids are typically insulators with large band gaps.|$|E
25|$|The {{constant}} volume (or critical state) {{shear strength}} {{is said to}} be extrinsic to the soil, and independent of the initial density or packing arrangement of the soil grains. In this state the grains being sheared are said to be 'tumbling' <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> with no significant granular interlock or sliding plane development affecting the resistance to shearing. At this point, no inherited fabric or bonding of the soil grains affects the soil strength.|$|E
60|$|The crowd rushed {{down from}} the benches, <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> heads, <b>over</b> {{children}}'s fallen bodies; they rushed down {{because they wanted to}} get at him, their whilom favourite, and at his pale-faced mistress, and tear them to pieces, hit them, scratch out their eyes. They snarled like so many wild beasts, the women shrieked, the children cried, and the men of the National Guard, hurrying forward, had much ado to keep back this flood-tide of hate.|$|R

25|$|The {{octagonal}} pavilion supports an {{arched roof}} that is, in turn, surmounted by a clerestory and dome. The clerestory {{is supported by}} eight free-standing, wood-clad, cast-iron columns located within the rotunda and grouped in pairs. Projecting from the pavilion roof on the east, west, and south elevations are dormer windows with peak roofs. Between major arched structural framing members are wood muntins that hold the glass lights on their sides. The lights lap one <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> like shingles and follow {{the curve of the}} arches.|$|E
25|$|Neurological: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} and {{mononeuritis multiplex}} may occur. The most common problem is {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist. Rheumatoid disease of the spine can lead to myelopathy. Atlanto-axial subluxation can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process and/or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine's connection to the skull. Such an erosion (>3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to quadriplegia or even death.|$|E
25|$|For typical {{computer}} displays, three-dimensional is a misnomer—their displays are two-dimensional. Semantically, however, most graphical {{user interfaces}} use three dimensions. With height and width, they offer a third dimension of layering or stacking screen elements <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> This may be represented visually on screen through an illusionary transparent effect, which offers the advantage that information in background windows may still be read, if not interacted with. Or the environment may simply hide the background information, possibly making the distinction apparent by drawing a drop shadow effect over it.|$|E
50|$|Terhuchu is a two-player {{abstract}} strategy {{board game}} from India, and specifically from Assam and Angami. Another spelling {{for the game}} is Terhiichii. The game is similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> pieces to capture them. However, unlike draughts and standard Alquerque, {{the game is played}} on an expanded Alquerque board consisting of eight triangular boards attached to the four sides and the four corners of an Alquerque board. Also, pieces can move and capture in any direction from the beginning. There is no promotion to King.|$|R

50|$|Astar is a two-player {{abstract}} strategy {{board game}} from Kyrgyzstan. It {{is a game}} similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> pieces when capturing. However, unlike draughts and Alquerqe, Astar is played on 5x6 square grid with two triangular boards attached on two {{opposite sides of the}} grid. The board somewhat resembles those of Kotu Ellima, Sixteen Soldiers, and Peralikatuma, all of which are games related to Astar. However, these three games use an expanded Alquerque board with a 5x5 square grid with diagonal lines. Astar uses a 5x6 grid with no diagonal lines.|$|R
25|$|Acrylamide (C3H5NO; mW: 71.08) when {{dissolved}} in water, slow, spontaneous autopolymerization of acrylamide takes place, joining molecules together by head on tail fashion to form long single-chain polymers. The {{presence of a}} free radical-generating system greatly accelerates polymerization. This kind of reaction is known as vinyl addition polymerisation. A solution of these polymer chains becomes viscous but does not form a gel, because the chains simply slide <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Gel formation requires linking various chains together. Acrylamide is carcinogenic, a neurotoxin, and a reproductive toxin. It is also essential to store acrylamide in a cool dark and dry place to reduce autopolymerisation and hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Many dowsers today use a pair {{of simple}} L-shaped metal rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm {{pointing}} forward. When something is found, the rods cross <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> making an X over the found object. If the object is long and straight, such as a water pipe, the rods may point in opposite directions, showing its orientation. The rods are sometimes fashioned from wire coat hangers, and glass or plastic rods have also been accepted. Straight rods are also sometimes used for the same purposes, and were not uncommon in early 19th-century New England.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, the University of Pennsylvania {{sponsored}} Muybridge's {{research using}} banks of cameras to photograph {{people in a}} studio, and animals from the Philadelphia Zoo to study their movement. The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background {{in a variety of}} action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as baseball, cricket, boxing, wrestling, discus throwing, and a ballet dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.|$|E
