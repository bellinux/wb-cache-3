5|$|English {{attacks on}} the {{frontier}} communities {{of what is now}} southern Maine in the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703) again put Deerfield residents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alert.</b> In response to their own losses in the Campaign, the French and natives attacked Deerfield.|$|E
5|$|Warned {{about the}} size of the force Bowers was raising, Gov. Davis Hanson Waite interceded again in the strike. He issued a {{proclamation}} on May 27 in which he called on the miners to disband their encampment on Bull Hill. In a development unparalleled in American labor history, he also declared the force of 1,200 deputies to be illegal and ordered the group disbanded. He also ordered the state militia to be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> for a possible move on Cripple Creek. On May 28, the governor visited the miners, who authorized Waite to negotiate on their behalf.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry {{phase of}} the Battle of Sharon began {{as soon as the}} gap was made during the {{infantry}} attacks. The 5th Cavalry Division led the way north up along the Plain of Sharon followed by the 4th Cavalry Division with the Australian Mounted Division in reserve. These divisions subsequently rode across the Mount Carmel Range through two passes, to occupy the Esdraelon Plain, on 20 September. Here they cut the main Ottoman lines of communication. Units of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions converged to capture Afulah with the 4th Cavalry Division capturing Beisan in the afternoon. The Australian Mounted Division captured Jenin along with thousands of prisoners when they captured the main line of retreat from Nablus to Damascus. On 20 September Nazareth, the site of the Ottoman Army's Yildirim Army Group headquarters, was unsuccessfully attacked by the 5th Cavalry Division. During the Battle of Nazareth the Ottoman Commander in Chief, Otto Liman von Sanders, was forced to escape. The 5th Cavalry Division captured the town the following day and several days later this division also captured Haifa and Acre following the Battle of Haifa. On {{the last day of the}} Battle of Sharon, the Australian Mounted Division attacked a German reinforced rearguard garrison at Samakh, which had been put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> by Liman von Sanders during his escape from Nazareth. The Australian Light Horse victory at the Battle of Samakh and the subsequent Capture of Tiberias ended the Battle of Sharon and the Battle of Megiddo. As a result of the battles of Sharon and Nablus, known collectively as the Battle of Megiddo, much territory and many prisoners were captured. The Final Offensive of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign began the day after the Battle of Megiddo ended, with the pursuit to Damascus, which was captured on 1 October.|$|E

25|$|During 5 April more regiments {{arrived in}} Glasgow, causing {{considerable}} excitement.

40|$|Study Objectives: Light can induce {{an acute}} {{alerting}} response in humans; however, {{it is unknown}} whether {{the magnitude of this}} response is simply a function of the absolute illuminance of the light itself, or whether it depends on illuminance history preceding the stimulus. Here, we compared the effects of illuminance history <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alerting</b> response to a subsequent light stimulus. Design: A randomized, crossover design was used to compare the effect of two illuminance histories (1 lux vs. 90 lux) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alerting</b> response to a 6. 5 -h 90 -lux light stimulus during the biological night. Setting: Intensive Physiologic Monitoring Unit, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA. Participants: Fourteen healthy young adults (6 F; 23. 5 ± 2. 9 years). Interventions: Participants were administered two 6. 5 -h light exposures (LE) of 90 lux during the biological night. For 3 days prior to each LE, participants were exposed to either 1 lux or 90 lux during the wake episode. Measurements and Results: <b>The</b> <b>alerting</b> response to light was assessed using subjective sleepiness ratings, lapses of attention, and reaction times as measured with an auditory psychomotor vigilance task, as well as power density in the delta/theta range of the waking EEG. <b>The</b> <b>alerting</b> response to light was greater and lasted longer when the LE followed exposure to 1 lux compared to 90 lux light. Conclusion: The magnitude and duration of <b>the</b> <b>alerting</b> effect of light at night depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> illuminance history and appears to be subject to sensitization and adaptation...|$|R

25|$|The {{scouting}} activities {{took the}} troops {{through some of}} the harshest and most desolate terrain in the nation.

40|$|Pain is a {{subjective}} sensory and emotional experience, {{and it has}} been reported that many different brain regions are regulated by pain, and that pain can impact attention. Acupuncture is an important treatment component of Chinese traditional medicine, and has been used for thousands of years to treat a wide variety of conditions. Although several studies have shown that acupuncture improves consciousness, the precise impact of both acupuncture and painful stimulation on attention is unclear. Are all of the attention networks modulated, or do these stimuli act on a specific network? Is the effect of painful stimulation similar to that of acupuncture? We administered the attention network test to 30 participants (15 males) to investigate the relative efficiencies of three independent attention networks (alerting, orienting, and executive control networks) under three conditions: baseline, after painful stimulation, and after acupuncture. The degree of pain experienced was assessed on a horizontally oriented visual analogue scale. The results showed that painful stimulation and acupuncture had similar effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orienting and executive control networks; however, there was a significantly different effect between <b>the</b> three conditions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alerting</b> network. In conclusion, (1) painful stimulation can selectively impact attention; (2) acupuncture can also selectively impact attention; i. e., both have selective influences <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alerting</b> and executive control networks, but not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orienting network; (3) the effects of acupuncture and painful stimulation are not identical. The mechanisms by which painful stimulation and acupuncture influence attention warrant further research...|$|R
25|$|Some freedom suits {{were filed}} by slaves {{temporarily}} in New York and Massachusetts because of similar laws giving freedom to slaves brought into these states by their masters. Massachusetts began to rule that slaves whose masters brought them voluntarily {{into the state}} gained freedom immediately upon entering the state. Anti-slavery groups in Pennsylvania, New York and Massachusetts were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> to aid slaves who were brought into the free states and wanted to gain freedom. They conducted some daring rescues, often hiding slaves, testifying for them in court, or sometimes helping them reach Canada {{in order to be}} beyond the reach of slave catchers and, after 1850, the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
25|$|During the First Transjordan {{attack in}} April 1918, when Allenby {{employed}} infantry from the 60th (London) Division, the Anzac Mounted Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade {{in an attack}} on Amman, the German, Austrian and Ottoman forces demonstrated they were still capable of winning battles. And during the five weeks {{between the first and}} second Transjordan operations they demonstrated a substantial measure of recovery at Tulkarem, offensive tendencies in the upper Jordan Valley, and had created a strong defensive position at Shunet Nimrin which withstood all attacks. This already formidable enemy force was further strengthened with reinforcements said to number twice that faced during the first Transjordan operations and had been put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>alert</b> by the demonstration on 18 April. It is therefore hard to understand how Allenby concluded that Chauvel's force was strong enough to carry out its mission. Allenby may have thought German and Ottoman reinforcements would not, or could not in the time, transfer troops across the Jordan River; he may have thought that the better weather would enable his troops to move more rapidly which was indeed true, but German and Ottoman forces also benefited and it seems Allenby placed too much reliance on the Beni Sakhr.|$|E
