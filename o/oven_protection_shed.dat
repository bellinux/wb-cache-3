40|$|Pathogens with {{a complex}} lifecycles can {{effectively}} evade host immunity {{in part due}} to each developmental stage expressing unique sets of antigens. Multisubunit vaccines incorporating signature antigens reflecting distinct developmental stages (multistage vaccines) have proven effective against viral, bacterial and parasitic infection at preventing pathogen evasion of host immunity. Chlamydia trachomatis is characterized by a biphasic extra/intracellular developmental cycle and an acute/persistent (latent) metabolic state; hence a multistage vaccine may prevent immune evasion and enhance clearance. Here we tested the efficacy of a multistage vaccine containing outer membrane (MOMP and PmpG), type three secretion system (T 3 SS) (CdsF and TC 0873) and inclusion membrane proteins (IncA and TC 0500) in mice against an intravaginal challenge with Chlamydia muridarum.

50|$|Early in {{the process}} of apolysis the {{epithelial}} cells release enzymatic moulting fluid between the old cuticle and the epidermis. The enzymes partly digest the endocuticle and the epidermis absorbs the digested material for the animal to assimilate. Much of that digested material is re-used to build the new cuticle. Once the new cuticle has formed sufficiently, the animal splits the remaining parts of the old integument along built-in lines of weakness and sheds them in the visible process of ecdysis, generally shedding and discarding the epicuticle and the reduced exocuticle, though some species carry them along for camouflage or <b>protection.</b> The <b>shed</b> portions are called the exuviae.

40|$|Abstract – As large {{concentrations}} of producers and consumers, cities are host {{to a number}} of environmental problems that only increase as {{more and more of the}} world’s people leave the countryside for the opportunities of urban centres. Fortunately, there is increasing recognition of this contribution in the form of transnational networks of cities, acting together to ameliorate urban environmental problems. One such example is the Cities for Climate Protection Campaign, a network of almost 700 of the world’s cities that has formed to confront climate change at the local level. Framing the question as a collective action problem, I consider what factors encourage the members of Cities for Climate Protection to come together and confront what is traditionally considered an issue to be solved at the international level. After examining these factors I point to lessons for other transnational networks of local level actors to take from Cities for Climate Protection. Cities are often seen to be at competition with one another to attract investment, but increased urban ecological degradation will necessitate a local response.

While prior information systems (IS) security research thoroughly examines the determinants of employees’ security motivation, this work investigates if information protection motivation translates into actual behaviour and how security policy-enforcing technological agents influence behaviour.

40|$|This {{study was}} to {{determine}} whether individual rotavirus capsid proteins could stimulate <b>protection</b> against rotavirus <b>shedding</b> in an adult mouse model. BALB/c mice were intranasally or intramuscularly administered purified Escherichia coli-expressed murine rotavirus strain EDIM VP 4, VP 6, or truncated VP 7 (TrVP 7) protein fused to the 42. 7 -kDa maltose-binding protein (MBP). One month after the last immunization, mice were challenged with EDIM and shedding of rotavirus antigen was measured. When three 9 -μg doses of one of the three rotavirus proteins fused to MBP were administered intramuscularly with the saponin adjuvant QS- 21, serum rotavirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) was induced by each protein. Following EDIM challenge, shedding was significantly (P = 0. 02) reduced (i. e., 38 %) in MBP::VP 6 -immunized mice only. Three 9 -μg doses of chimeric MBP::VP 6 or MBP::TrVP 7 administered intranasally with attenuated E. coli heat-labile toxin LT(R 192 G) also induced serum rotavirus IgG, but MBP::VP 4 immunization stimulated no detectable rotavirus antibody. No <b>protection</b> against EDIM <b>shedding</b> was observed in the MBP::TrVP 7 -immunized mice. However, shedding was reduced 93 to 100 % following MBP::VP 6 inoculation and 56 % following MBP::VP 4 immunization relative to that of controls (P = < 0. 001). Substitution of cholera toxin for LT(R 192 G) as the adjuvant, reduction of the number of doses to 1, and challenge of the mice 3 months after the last immunization did not reduce the level of protection stimulated by intranasal administration of MBP::VP 6. When MBP::VP 6 was administered intranasally to B-cell-deficient μMt mice that made no rotavirus antibody, shedding was still reduced to < 1 % of that of controls. These results show that mice can be protected against rotavirus shedding by intranasal administration of individual rotavirus proteins and that this protection can occur independently of rotavirus antibody...|$|R

We took an afternoon walk through Christ-Church meadow and at the river-bank procured a boat which I pulled down the stream to Iffley and to the slanting woods of Nuneham--the sweetest flattest reediest stream-side landscape that could be desired. Here of course we encountered the scattered phalanx of the young, the happy generation, clad in white flannel and blue, muscular fair-haired magnificent fresh, whether floated down the current by idle punts and lounging in friendly couples when not in a singleness that nursed ambitions, or straining together in rhythmic crews and hoarsely exhorted from the near bank.

This charmed seclusion was especially grateful to my friend, and his sense of it reached its climax, I remember, on one of the last of such occasions and while we sat in fascinated flanerie over against the sturdy back of Saint John's.

It is also likely to be adopted by many countries following the coordinated global cessation of vaccination with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) after eradication. The success of IPV in the control of poliomyelitis outbreaks will depend on the degree of nasopharyngeal and intestinal mucosal immunity induced against poliovirus infection. We performed a systematic review of studies published through May 2011 that recorded the prevalence of poliovirus shedding in stool samples or nasopharyngeal secretions collected 5 - 30 days after a "challenge" dose of OPV. Studies were combined in a meta-analysis of the odds of shedding among children vaccinated according to IPV, OPV, and combination schedules. We identified 31 studies of shedding in stool and four in nasopharyngeal samples that met the inclusion criteria. Individuals vaccinated with OPV were protected against infection and shedding of poliovirus in stool samples collected after challenge compared with unvaccinated individuals (summary odds ratio [OR] for shedding 0. 13 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 08 - 0. 24)). In contrast, IPV provided no <b>protection</b> against <b>shedding</b> compared with unvaccinated individuals (summary OR 0. 81 [95 % CI 0. 59 - 1. 11]) or when given in addition to OPV, compared with individuals given OPV alone (summary OR 1. 14 [95 % CI 0. 82 - 1. 58]). There were insufficient studies of nasopharyngeal shedding to draw a conclusion. IPV does not induce sufficient intestinal mucosal immunity to reduce the prevalence of fecal poliovirus shedding after challenge, although there was some evidence that it can reduce the quantity of virus shed.

40|$|In {{considering}} whether to privatize a large state-owned steel enterprise in Argentina, the question arose: Would its sale to a consortium of large domestic enterprises, and the resulting increase in firm concentration, inevitably lead to cries for <b>protection?</b> To <b>shed</b> light on the question, the authors examine data for steel industries in the major industrial countries. They also construct a simulation of Argentina's steel sector to study the relationships between levels of industrial concentration, substitutability between domestic and imported steels, trade policy regimes, and mark-ups of domestic prices over international prices. Their simulation results show that heavier rents and economic distortions are generated through fixed-ratio import quotas (quotas that are a fixed proportion of domestic sales) than through use of a tariff or a fixed-quantity import quota. The results show why industries seeking protection prefer a fixed-ratio import restraint - a practice being used increasingly often in industrial countries. If there is not perfect substitutability between domestic and imported steels, the incentives for the Argentine industry to seek protection - particularly as a fixed-ratio quota - are greater, the more concentrated the industry is. The lesson for policymakers - who should be trying to minimize economic distortions - is that if protection is necessary, tariffs are preferable to import quotas, perhaps {{even to the point}} of making quota-type restrictions unconstitutional. The simulation results for Argentina confirm that the less substitutable domestic and foreign goods are, the higher the rents of domestic industry can extract. So, it is important for policymakers implementing privatization schemes to ease any explicit or implicit obstacles to imports by such measures as: (a) standardizing domestic product classifications with international classifications; (b) modernizing transportation facilities to improve the speed of shipment and communication; (c) reducing bureaucratic practices related to trade in goods and services; and (d) releasing foreign exchange restrictions.

Subsequently, we challenged pigs with virulent pseudorabies virus (PRV). We demonstrated that best-protected pigs stood out by maintaining strong T cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses after challenge. Of the immune parameters tested, <b>protection</b> against virus <b>shedding</b> was correlated best with the magnitude of the IFN-gamma-response of in vitro re-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with an additional role for PRV-specific IgG 2 antibodies. The use of an o/w adjuvant resulted in higher antibody and CMI responses, in particular with an increased frequency of memory T helper blast cells of in vitro re-stimulated PBMC. However, this adjuvant-induced enhancement of the immune response had a limited additional effect on the efficacy of inactivated vaccines. This study suggests a major contribution of the CMI response in early protection against PRV infection and that PRV-induced IFN-gamma responses may serve as a suitable indicator for assessing the immune status of vaccinated pigs.

40|$|During 2007, large {{outbreaks}} of equine influenza (EI) caused by Florida sublineage Clade 1 viruses affected horse populations in Japan and Australia. The likely protection {{that would be}} provided by two modern vaccines commercially available in the European Union (an ISCOM-based and a canarypox-based vaccine) {{at the time of}} the outbreaks was determined. Vaccinated ponies were challenged with a representative outbreak isolate (A/eq/Sydney/ 2888 - 8 / 07) and levels of protection were compared. A group of ponies infected 18 months previously with a phylogenetically-related isolate from 2003 (A/eq/South Africa/ 4 / 03) was also challenged with the 2007 outbreak virus. After experimental infection with A/eq/Sydney/ 2888 - 8 / 07, unvaccinated control ponies all showed clinical signs of infection together with virus <b>shedding.</b> <b>Protection</b> achieved by both vaccination or long-term immunity induced by previous exposure to equine influenza virus (EIV) was characterised by minor signs of disease and reduced virus shedding when compared with unvaccinated control ponies. The three different methods of virus titration in embryonated hens’ eggs, EIV NP-ELISA and quantitative RT-PCR were used to monitor EIV shedding and results were compared. Though the majority of previously infected ponies had low antibody levels at the time of challenge, they demonstrated good clinical protection and limited virus shedding. In summary, we demonstrate that vaccination with current EIV vaccines would partially protect against infection with A/eq/Sydney/ 2888 - 8 / 07 -like strains and would help to limit the spread of disease in our vaccinated horse population...|$|R
40|$|Chronic lower {{urinary tract}} {{symptoms}} (LUTS), such as urgency and incontinence, are common, {{especially among the}} elderly, but their etiology is often obscure. Recent studies of acute urinary tract infections implicated invasion by Escherichia coli into the cytoplasm of urothelial cells, with persistence of long-term bacterial reservoirs, but the role of infection in chronic LUTS is unknown. We conducted a large prospective study with eligible patients with LUTS and controls over a 3 -year period, comparing routine urine cultures of planktonic bacteria with cultures of shed urothelial cells concentrated in centrifuged urinary sedi-ments. This comparison revealed large numbers of bacteria undetected by routine cultures. Next, we typed the bacterial species cultured from patient and control sediments under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, {{and we found that}} the two groups had complex but significantly distinct profiles of bacteria associated with their shed bladder epithelial cells. Strikingly, E. coli, the organismmost responsible for acute urinary tract infections, was not the only or even the main offending pathogen in this more-chronic condition. Antibiotic <b>protection</b> assays with <b>shed</b> patient cells and in vitro infection studies using patient-derived strains in cell culture suggested that LUTS-associated bacteria are within or extremely closely associated with shed epithelial cells, which explains how routine cultures might fail to detect them. These data have strong implications for the need to rethink our common diagnoses and treatments of chronic urinary tract symptoms. The diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in current clin-ical practice hinges on the culturing of clean-catch,midstream urine (MSU) samples. Published guidelines for Europe, th...|$|R
40|$|Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a {{recently}} described paramyxovirus {{that is a}} major cause of upper and lower respiratory infection in children and adults worldwide. A safe and effective vaccine could decrease the burden of disease associated with this novel pathogen. We previously reported the development of the cotton rat model of hMPV infection and pathogenesis (J. V. Williams et al., J. Virol. 79 : 10944 - 10951, 2005). We report here the immunogenicity of an hMPV fusion (F) protein in this model. We constructed DNA plasmids that exhibited high levels of expression of hMPV F in mammalian cells (DNA-F). These constructs were used to develop a novel strategy to produce highly pure, soluble hMPV F protein lacking the transmembrane domain (FΔTM). We then immunized cotton rats at 0 and 14 days with either control vector, DNA-F alone, DNA-F followed by FΔTM protein, or FΔTM alone. All groups were challenged intranasally at 28 days with live hMPV. All three groups that received some form of hMPV F immunization mounted neutralizing antibody responses and exhibited partial <b>protection</b> against virus <b>shedding</b> in the lungs compared to controls. The FΔTM-immunized animals showed the greatest degree of protection (> 1, 500 -fold reduction in lung virus titer). All three immunized groups showed a modest reduction of nasal virus shedding. Neither evidence of a Th 2 -type response nor increased lung pathology were present in the immunized animals. We conclude that sequence-optimized hMPV F protein protects against hMPV infection when delivered as either a DNA or a protein vaccine in cotton rats...|$|R
40|$|The {{norovirus}} P particle is an octahedral nanoparticle {{formed by}} 24 {{copies of the}} protrusion (P) domain of the norovirus capsid protein. This P particle is easily produced in Escherichia coli, extremely stable, and highly immunogenic. There are three surface loops per P domain, making a total of 72 loops per particle, and these are potential sites for foreign antigen presentation for immune enhancement. To prove this concept, a small peptide (His tag, 7 amino acids [aa]) and a large antigen (rotavirus VP 8, 159 aa) were inserted {{into one of the}} loops. Neither insertion affects P particle formation, while both antigens were presented well on the P particle surface. The immune-enhancement effect of the P particle was demonstrated by significantly increased anti-body titers induced by the P particle-presented antigens compared to the titers induced by free antigens. In addition, the measured neutralization antibody titers and levels of <b>protection</b> against rotavirus <b>shedding</b> in mice immunized with the VP 8 chimeric P particles were significantly higher than those of mice immunized with the free VP 8 antigen. Sera from P particle-VP 8 chimera-vaccinated animals also blocked norovirus virus-like particle (VLP) binding to the histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) receptors. From these data, the P particle appears to be an excellent vaccine platform for antigen presentation. The readily available three surface loops and the great capacity for foreign antigen insertion make this platform attractive for wide application in vaccine development and antibody production. The P particle-VP 8 chimeras may serve as a dual vaccin...|$|R
