5|$|At its {{southern}} terminus, the route begins at Coules Court, where Brown's Line becomesHighway 427. Alderwood Plaza, {{located on the}} east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route,</b> has a parking lot which provides access to the highway; this is the only at-grade access along the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 28 March 2015, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route's</b> {{allocation}} {{was transferred}} to Northumberland Park. Route 19 was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> used to test automatic speed-limiting technology, beginning in July 2015.|$|R
5|$|Studies and {{environmental}} assessments into various extensions began {{almost immediately after}} the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> to Newmarket in 1989; it would take over a decade for any northward progression to take place. The completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> to Davis Drive was met with scorn as traffic in Newmarket rapidly increased as the bedroom community grew with the new highway access. Municipal officials warned prior to the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> that major traffic delays would be faced along Davis Drive. Then-mayor Ray Twinney began an immediate push to widen Green Lane – at that time an unpaved rural route – into a bypass of the town.|$|E
5|$|The Connecting Link through Barrie {{was also}} discontinued. Simcoe County has since renamed its portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> as Simcoe County Road10.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> listed operate {{all year}} round, but not {{necessarily}} with open top buses. Some services have a mixture of open and closed buses. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> only operate during <b>the</b> warmer months <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year.|$|R
50|$|Overall, the Trango Towers {{group has}} seen some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{difficult}} and significant climbs ever accomplished, due to <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> altitude, total height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>routes,</b> and <b>the</b> steepness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> are highly technical climbs.|$|R
50|$|S-Curve Area is {{a popular}} rock {{climbing}} area in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>routes</b> are bolted and {{offer a variety of}} grades.

5|$|After the Act of Parliament {{had been}} granted, {{membership}} {{of the board of}} the LNWR changed, and they abandoned their support for the extension. By this time, the MR had bought most of the land between Rickmansworth and Chesham required for that section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
5|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> is in Mississippi County.

Route 75 {{is not part of}} the National Highway System.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{with global}} warming, the {{development}} and utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route</b> has become possible. At present, <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route</b> navigation safety environment is the main factor that affects <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route,</b> so this paper mainly analyzes <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navigation safety environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route.</b> First <b>of</b> all, using <b>the</b> fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to analyze <b>the</b> influence factors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navigation safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route,</b> <b>the</b> structure diagram <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navigation safety system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route</b> is divided. Secondly, according to <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> navigation safety system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route,</b> entropy theory and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process are used to calculate <b>the</b> entropy values <b>of</b> navigation safety <b>of</b> Arctic <b>routes,</b> and <b>the</b> evolvement trend <b>of</b> navigation safety of Arctic routes is obtained. Finally, through <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route</b> navigation security, some management countermeasures are put forward for <b>the</b> navigation safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route.</b> <b>The</b> research results can provide reference for {{the development and}} utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>route...</b>|$|R

5|$|Due to {{encroaching}} Interstate highways—especially Interstate 35—the {{middle section}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> through Norman, Moore, and Oklahoma City was decommissioned in 1979 {{for reasons of}} redundancy.

5|$|Highway21 {{was first}} {{designated}} by the Department of Highways (DHO) between Highway3 and Highway7 in mid-1927 and extended to Goderich in 1934.

5|$|MS 465 first {{appeared}} as a gravel road on the state map in 1956, connecting US 61 near Vicksburg to MS 1 in Fitler. A year later, {{a section of the}} highway became paved in northwest Warren County, and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958. The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years, ending near Redwood. The southern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route</b> was fully paved by 1964, and the northern by 1984. The route has not changed significantly since. The route was proposed {{to be part of the}} Great River Road, but it was not included in the most recent reiteration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>route.</b>|$|E
