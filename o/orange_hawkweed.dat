40|$|Description: <b>Orange</b> <b>Hawkweed</b> is a {{perennial}} plant with matted, hairy leaves and showy flower heads. The flowers are bright orange-red, {{about an inch}} in diameter, born in tight clusters of 5 to 35 flowers {{at the top of}} wiry stalks from June to August. The flower stalks grow from a few inches to 2 feet in height, are nearly leafless, occasionally with 1 or 2 small clasping leaves, and are covered with distinctive, stiff black hairs. Plants spread by seeds, rhizomes (underground stems) or numerous hairy, leafy stolons (above ground runners). Impacts: <b>Orange</b> <b>Hawkweed</b> reproduces and spreads through prolific seed production as well as vegetatively through stolons and rhizomes. Under ideal conditions, one plant can spread and infest an area 2 - 3 feet in diameter in its first year of growth. It forms extensive mats, displacing native species and lowering biodiversity. It is an aggressive competitor for space, light and soil nutrients. Hawkweeds are able to produce seed either with or without pollination, and their own pollen is allelopathic, which can cause other plants to be infertile, giving them an even greater advantage. Control Options: Thurston County’s Integrated Pest Management emphasizes cultural, biological, and manual control methods to keep pests and vegetation problems low enough to prevent damage. The goal of Thurston County’s pesticide use policy is to minimize the use of pesticides by utilizing and providing information about the most effective control options that are available and practical. ► Manual / Mechanical For isolated plants or small patches, manual removal can help control hawkweeds, especially if used to prevent seed production by removing plants that are budded or in bloom. Use care when digging around rosettes; pieces of root crowns and stolons will form new plants very quickly if left in contact with the soil. Be very careful to double bag removed plants and deposit in garbage, not compost. ► Biological There are currently no known biocontrol agents for use on hawkweeds in the United States. Since there are many native, non-invasive hawkweed species as well, it seems unlikely that insects or pathogens will be discovered that would be effective on noxious strains without causing damage to native varieties...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} early {{results on}} the response of six non-native invasive plant species to eight wildfires on six National Forests (NFs) in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Stratified random sampling was used to choose 224 stands based on burn severity, habitat type series, slope steepness, stand height, and stand density. Data for this report are from 219 stands (875 plots) that have repeated measures 1 to 7 years post-fire. Six invasive plant species are abundant enough to analyze for early indications of response to burning. Spotted knapweed occurrence is highest on Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine habitat types on the Bitterroot NF. Canada thistle occurs {{on most of the}} sampled wildfires but at low occurrences and percent plot coverage. Bull thistle has rapid increases on the Bitterroot, Flathead, Kootenai, and Malheur NFs, generally with increasing occurrence at higher burn severities, but average percent coverage is low. <b>Orange</b> <b>hawkweed</b> has low occurrences (< 5 percent) and never more than 1 percent coverage on a plot. Meadow hawkweed has its highest occurrence on the Bitterroot NF in lo...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Christopher M. BakerInvasive {{species are}} {{responsible}} for enormous ecological and economic damage worldwide, and resources for managing them are severely limited. Allocating these resources efficiently is therefore a key concern for conservation managers. Unfortunately, {{the complexity of the}} problem makes developing cost-effective strategies for managing invasive species extraordinarily difficult. The scale and difficulty of the problem highlights that quantitative approaches are needed to both understand the general properties of a good control strategy and to assist in developing invasive species management plans in specific cases. In this thesis I use mathematical modelling to find optimal strategies for invasive species control. The theoretical work contained here focuses on solving for the optimal resource allocation in spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal systems. This gives insight into the qualitative features of optimal management. Moving from purely spatial or temporal optimal solutions to the full spatiotemporal solution increases the complexity of the models and solutions. However, key ideas about invasive species control in the spatial and temporal sections translate to the spatiotemporal problem, and a good understanding of these results in this thesis allow one to better understand solutions in the more complex spatiotemporal case. As well as general insights, I want to offer specific support to environmental managers; mathematical modelling is applied to three case studies in this thesis. The first two are applications of optimal control theory to feral cat (Felis catus) control in arid Australia and to <b>orange</b> <b>hawkweed</b> control (Hieracium aurantiacum). The third case is about the proposed eradication of tropical fire ants (Solenopsis geminate) from the islands of Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve in the Timor Sea, which is off the Northwest coast of Australia. This work focuses on providing quantitative advice about the management of tropical fire ants. Linked models for the population dynamics and detectability of tropical fire ants are developed. These models quantify how different control methods and schedules affect the probability of eradicating ants and allow the resource allocation for surveillance to be optimised...|$|E
