40|$|Most remote Nepali health {{posts and}} school {{buildings}} rely on poor quality kerosene and diyalo (fat wood) {{as a source}} of light. This paper reports <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> field <b>trip</b> carried out by UNSW staff and students in conjunction with Renewable Energy for Clean Environment and Development (RECED) in two remote villages in Nepal during February, 2008. The original photovoltaic (PV) system at Sankhe health post, which was installed in February, 2004, was inspected and found to be, on the whole, still providing lighting, especially for emergency operations. Sankhe health post was previously using expensive and toxic kerosene light for emergency treatment at night. Kerosene light provides very poor visibility and is inadequate for surgery, particularly childbirth. The photovoltaic lighting systems provide clean, safe, and free light, improving health services for more then fifty thousand people of this local community. Similarly, many remote Nepali schools are also not able to access grid electricity. Classes are often held before and after normal school hours (10 am – 4 pm). Students are often studying in very dim classrooms. A new PV system was installed at the local high school in Borlang- 7, which provides power for class room lighting and two computers. The benefit of laptop computers was demonstrated in the field. Both systems are currently being monitored by local project participants and results are reported in this paper...|$|R

Steven Hayes will talk about the DIU's role as a partner in an EU project and collaboration with the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at King's College, London. He will discuss the difficulties and solutions to long-range collaboration and provide some perspective on EU-funded projects. Willard McCarty will discuss opportunities for the digital humanities in relation to experiences with previous programs. Professor McCarty suggests that the most important initiative is the establishment of institutional models for humanities computing.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the major {{challenges in the}} documentation and study of sign languages in Peru, {{as well as some}} potential solutions. It also gives a brief prediction of the type of work that may be possible in the near future, both in terms of documentation and analysis, and in terms of strengthening the language through awareness and education. It is based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> scouting <b>trip</b> that assessed the plausibility and value of a long-term study. Some of the difficulties encountered are common to many documentation efforts and others are typical in sign linguistics, but the solutions must be tailored to the unique situation of Peru’s Deaf communities. In fact, simply being an outsider and working from a hearing perspective can be an issue, and aspects of this are seen throughout the specific topics discussed in this paper. The challenges can be divided into the following categories: 1) finding good informants despite conflict and lack of communication between organizations, 2) elicitation methods that encourage natural but consistent responses for comparative work, 3) ensuring reliable interpretation when the framework to train interpreters is, at best, in its beginning stages, and 4) dealing with variation, not only in dialect, but also in target and intermediary language fluency and in educational background. Despite the intervening factors mentioned above, the potential for future work is promising. The recognition of Peruvian Sign Language as a language is new to the Peruvian government and society. This leaves a clear opening for documentation as well as the creation of informative and educational materials for deaf and hearing children, adults, and future interpreters. Because sign languages are not typically acquired from birth, societal awareness and educational adaptation are fundamental in language maintenance, if not human rights. Beyond that, it is quite clear that several distinct dialects exist. The interaction between them and the exact factors influencing their distinctiveness would be a fascinating topic to explore. A preliminary look at a few speaker groups indicates that anything from region to age, to educational background, right down to a specific social group, can exert a significant influence. With careful documentation, it may even be possible to identify the origin of these varied lexical items, grammatical structures, and phonological features as native to the region or as loans from languages of education, religion, and relative prestige such as American and British Sign Language...|$|R

5000|$|Various {{individuals}} are credited with inspiring Damrosch’s decision to found the Oratorio Society of New York including Anton Rubenstein, Marie Reno (wife of the Society’s longtime secretary Morris Reno), Elkan and Bertha Naumburg, and three unnamed women who felt New York needed a singing society {{like the ones}} they had heard <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>trip</b> to Germany. Bertha Naumburg {{is said to have}} suggested the name. Rehearsals began in March 1873 and on December 3, the Society presented its first concert. One year later, on Christmas night, the Society began what has become an unbroken tradition of annual performances of Handel's Messiah. These have been held at Carnegie Hall since its opening in 1891.From its earliest days, the Society played an integral role in the musical life of the city, presenting its own concerts and performing at musically and historically significant events. In 1884 Andrew Carnegie joined the Society's board of directors, serving as its president from 1888 to 1919. Three years after joining the board (perhaps at the suggestion of his wife, Louise Whitfield Carnegie), a subscriber and supporter of the Society, or perhaps at the suggestion of Walter Damrosch who had taken over as conductor of the Society after his father's death in 1885, Carnegie decided to add his support to a fund the Society had begun several years earlier, the goal of which was to build a hall suitable for the performance of choral music. He engaged a fellow board member, the architect William Tuthill, to design the [...] "Music Hall," [...] now known as Carnegie Hall. During the five-day festival in May 1891 that inaugurated the new hall, the Society performed under the batons of Walter Damrosch and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in the first of more than a century of performances in its artistic home. Among the Society's many ground-breaking programs was one in April 1923 when, in conjunction with the experimental radio station, WEAF, the Oratorio Society presented the first choral concert broadcast from Carnegie Hall. In the years following, it was quite active in furthering the popularity of this new medium.The Oratorio Society has given the U.S. premiere of works as diverse as Brahms' Ein deutsches Requiem (1877), Berlioz' Roméo et Juliette (1882), a full-concert production of Wagner's Parsifal at the Metropolitan Opera House (1886), Tchaikovsky's a cappella Legend and Pater noster (1891) and Eugene Onegin (1908), the now-standard version of The Star-Spangled Banner (1917; it became the national anthem in 1931), Bach's Mass in B Minor (1927), Dvořák's St. Ludmila (1993), Britten's The World of the Spirit (1998), and Filas’ Song of Solomon (2012), as well as works by Handel, Liszt, Schütz, Schubert, Debussy, Elgar, Saint-Saëns, and many others, including contemporary composers.|$|E
