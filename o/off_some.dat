5|$|A {{particularly}} severe {{outbreak of}} malaria struck the ship in early February 1804; 212 members of Bellerophons crew fell ill. 17 died aboard the ship, while 100 had {{to be transferred to}} a shore-based hospital, where a further 40 died. She was ordered back to Britain in June, escorting a large convoy, and arrived in the Downs on 11 August. She briefly paid off and was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit. On 27 September four shipwrights working in magazine by candle light set <b>off</b> <b>some</b> loose powder. The explosion killed all four.|$|E

5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared {{for the state of}} Oaxaca shortly after Pauline made landfall. Abundant rainfall caused the River Los Perros to overflow its capacity, flooding 50municipalities in Oaxaca. The flooding damaged 12bridges, of which two were destroyed, and cut <b>off</b> <b>some</b> areas of electricity, drinking water, and telecommunications for several days. The passage of the hurricane affected thousands of houses, leaving roughly 250,000homeless in the state. At least 110people died in the state, with hundreds of thousands of residents and 1,278communities being affected.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies <b>off.</b> <b>Some</b> butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|In Los Angeles, Robbie Reyes and Daisy Johnson, the vigilantes Ghost Rider and Quake, plan {{to visit}} the former’s uncle in prison {{to talk to him}} about his past working at Momentum Energy labs, which they are investigating. However, another {{blackout}} hits that city, and the pair race to get Robbie’s brother Gabe. Fighting <b>off</b> <b>some</b> looters, Johnson injures her arms, so when they get Gabe to safety, Robbie goes to get her medical supplies. While he is gone, Gabe tells Johnson that he recognises her as Quake, and asks her to leave his brother to keep him out of trouble.|$|E

5|$|In the 1940s, freight and World War II traffic helped pay <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of {{the debt}} the SIRT had accumulated, briefly making the SIRT profitable. During the second World War, all of the east coast {{military}} hospital trains were handled by the SIRT, with some trains stopping at Arlington on Staten Island to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The need to transport war material, POW trains, and troops, made the stretch of the Baltimore & New York Railway between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill extremely busy. The B also operated special trains for important officials such as Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended <b>off</b> <b>some</b> {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, Canadian forces {{launched}} Operation Tractable, {{in conjunction}} with American movements northwards to Chambois. On 19 August, a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division, sealing <b>off</b> <b>some</b> 50,000 German troops in the pocket. By 21 August, German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted, and all German troops trapped in the pocket surrendered to Allied forces, effectively {{putting an end to}} the German 7th Army.|$|E

5|$|The 1846 {{session of}} Parliament {{experienced}} a snowstorm of bills for new railways; {{many of these}} threatened to encroach on the GPK area of influence and abstract business; several schemes were promoted by the Caledonian Railway or its allies; in self-defence the GPK itself promoted numerous schemes—in fact 25 branches {{as well as a}} bill nominally by the K to authorise the modernisation works—to head <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of the encroachment.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Zion Square and the Downtown Triangle lies was {{purchased}} by the Jewish Colonization Association from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which began selling <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of its holdings in Jerusalem after World War I. Mandate officials developed the field into a triangular district bordered by Jaffa Road, Ben Yehuda Street (constructed by the British in 1922) and King George Street (constructed by the British in 1924). Zion Square was also designed by the British as a roundabout.|$|E
5|$|The next day, a {{group of}} Yugoslav Navy vessels {{deployed}} to the Split Channel, organised into the Kaštela tactical group (TG) and bombarded the city of Split {{in retaliation for the}} loss of Mukos. In return, Croatian coastal artillery engaged the Kaštela TG. To draw <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of the artillery fire, the Yugoslav Navy deployed another group of vessels from the island of Vis, organised as the Vis TG, south of Šolta where the TG was engaged by more Croatian artillery. The Kaštela TG retreated east and joined with the Ploče TG consisting of three minesweepers.|$|E

5|$|While Allen {{participated in}} some of the actions to drive {{surveyors}} away, he also spent much time exploring the entire territory, probably ranging as far north as the site of Burlington in his wanderings. After selling <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of his Connecticut properties, he began buying wild lands further north in the territory, which he sold at a profit as the southern settlements grew and people began to move further north.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} he was consulted by {{the county}} commissioner and helped {{to set up the}} courts and laws in Yamhill County. In March 1850, he began practicing law in Oregon, appearing for three cases before judge Orville C. Pratt held at a local tavern. After receiving payment for his services, he sent $100 back to Ohio to Henry Kennon to pay <b>off</b> <b>some</b> debt. That summer he worked for Peter H. Burnett’s brother, Elder Glen Burnett, running his store while Burnett was in California acquiring supplies. While working at the store he sold many supplies to the local Native Americans and learned some Chinook jargon from them.|$|E
5|$|As {{speculation}} of {{a move to}} Hibernian came {{to nothing}} (despite his being installed as the bookmaker's favourite), Gannon instead was confirmed as manager of Scottish Premier League side Motherwell {{at the end of}} June 2009, two days before the club's Europa League first round qualifying tie against Llanelli of Wales. To do this he fended off competition from Aidy Boothroyd, Lawrie Sanchez, and Steve Staunton. At the start of his reign he had a limited squad, and had to draft in youth players for the Llanelli game. The club had sold <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of their best players, whilst loan deals had ended for others. He also brought in Peter Ward as assistant manager.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet {{from time to time in}} casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the war, Fort Bayard came under attack only once. During the Battle of Fort Stevens in July 1864, Confederate general Jubal Early {{launched}} a 25,000-man raid into Maryland with the hope of drawing <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of General Ulysses S. Grant's troops, who were pressing hard against the Army of Northern Virginia in the Siege of Petersburg. The raid hoped to attack Washington, thereby distracting Grant and potentially allowing the Confederate forces time to rest and regroup. On the morning of July 11, Confederate cavalry and infantry under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland advanced towards Washington with the goal of capturing Fort Reno, which defended the village of Tenleytown. Though they drove back the skirmish line in front of Fort Bayard, the Confederate cavalry were met with a heavy barrage of cannon fire from Bayard and its supporting forts. Discouraged by the resistance, McCausland's brigade moved to join up with the rest of Early's force, which was grouping for an assault on Fort Stevens.|$|E
5|$|During the session, {{in where}} drivers ran in packs and drafted off each other, Juan Pablo Montoya {{made contact with}} Kahne and sent his car {{spinning}} into the grass on the front stretch, tearing <b>off</b> <b>some</b> of its nose. Kahne was required to use a backup car {{for the rest of}} Speedweeks. Because the qualifying grids were chosen by the order in which drivers qualified in Daytona 500 pole position qualifying, the pole was given to Carl Edwards in the first race and to Biffle in the second. Edwards was joined on the grid's front row by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., with Ambrose in third. Stenhouse and Bayne started in fourth and fifth positions respectively. Biffle was joined by Mears on the front row for the second race, with Jeff Gordon in third. Martin Truex, Jr. started fourth, and was followed by Martin in fifth.|$|E
