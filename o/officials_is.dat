5|$|The {{offensive}} displaced 10,000 Serb {{refugees from}} Mrkonjić Grad, adding {{to a growing}} humanitarian crisis as another 30,000 Serbs fled Sanski Most before the ARBiH captured it {{in the final days}} of Operation Sana. Approximately 6,000 non-Serbs were forced to flee their homes in Prijedor and Novi Grad by Bosnian Serb forces. According to Bosnian Serb sources, 480 Serbs died or went missing in the fighting in the area of Mrkonjić Grad. The figure includes 181 bodies recovered in a mass grave at the town's Serbian Orthodox cemetery. According to the Republika Srpska police who investigated the scene and interviewed witnesses, most of the dead were VRS prisoners of war or civilians who were killed by the 4th Guards Brigade to avenge the death of Colonel Andrija Matijaš, the brigade's deputy commander. The results of the investigation were forwarded to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), but the ICTY did not pursue the matter. , an investigation by the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities against 27 high-ranking HV and HVO officers and Croatian <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> ongoing. In 2013, an officer and two soldiers of the 7th Guards Brigade charged with killing four Serb civilians near Mrkonjić Grad were acquitted, pending appeal.|$|E

For instance, {{they point to}} the Confucius Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas, where one of the top <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> also vice-president of Huawei, a Chinese telecom company the U.S. government regards as a national security threat, and which has been accused of industrial espionage, though an extensive security review found no clear evidence of spying.|$|E

25|$|A congressional {{amendment}} to the city charter enabling city residents to vote for provincial <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> required, followed by a plebiscite. Santiago's status as an independent component city was briefly in question after the enactment of Republic Act No. 8528 on February 14, 1998 which sought {{to make it a}} regular component city. The Supreme Court on September 16, 1999 however ruled in favor of the city's mayor who contended that such a change in the status of the city required a plebiscite just like any other merger, division, abolition or alteration in boundaries of any political unit. And {{due to the lack of}} a plebiscite to affirm such a change, RA 8528 was therefore unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|The strike lasted 172 days, at {{the time}} making it ({{at the time}}) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history. International Harvester made key errors—including using inexperienced negotiators, going public with {{bargaining}} demands, and attacking key union issues such as seniority {{and the lack of}} mandatory overtime without giving itself room to negotiate—which greatly prolonged the strike. The seeming arrogance of top company <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> {{considered by many to be}} a serious strategic error. Company officials seemed surprised that the union could hold out for any length of time, and McCardell appeared to assume that the international union staff (not rank and file members) were pushing for a strike.|$|E
25|$|While overall, India’s total {{volume of}} {{imported}} crude {{has only been}} rising slightly from 3.2 million b/d in 2009-10 to 3.44 million b/d in 2012-13, imports from Iran have basically been fluctuating around 250,000 b/d from 2012 to 2013 and thus rising proportionally due to a halt for Iranian exports to Europe. The recent detainment of an Indian tanker by Iranian <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> unrelated to the oil embargo, but {{in an effort to}} save over USD 8.5 billion in hard currency, and realising a 180-day waiver from US sanctions, India plans to increase Iranian imports by 11 million tons for 2014, in addition to the two million tons of crude oil shipped from Iran by June 2013, up 21.1% from last year.|$|E
25|$|Economic tension {{caused by}} war was serious. As famine spread, looting and crimes <b>were</b> widespread. Corrupt <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> {{reportedly}} abundant. According to some sources, many oppressions and abuses made by <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> reported. King Taksin punished them harshly, torturing and executing high officials. Discontent among <b>officials</b> could <b>be</b> expected.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} months of the occupation, new <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> {{appointed}} to several local and regional positions (e.g., mayors, governors, local councils). The <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> chosen from a select group of individuals (including ex-Ba'ath party officials) in an attempt to speed the return to normality and to avoid the election of people opposed to the American and British presence. Certain religious clerics and other <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> considered to be overly radical or dangerous. On occasion the appointed <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> found to behave less than admirably. On 30 June 2003, the appointed mayor of Najaf was arrested on charges of corruption.|$|R
50|$|Further {{complicating the}} job of an <b>official</b> <b>is</b> the {{proximity}} to the crowds. Unlike football or baseball, the crowd is nearly always located within {{a few feet of}} the <b>official,</b> as <b>are</b> coaches and other players on the bench. To combat this, <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> able to remove a fan from the arena with an ejection.|$|R
25|$|Until today Lebanon did {{not sign}} ILO {{convention}} No. 87, the Freedom of Association and Protection {{of the right}} to Organize, which states in Article 2 that no prior registration with government <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> needed to form a labour union. Article 86 of the Lebanese Labour Code however specifically states the need for authorization prior to trade union formation. Since there is no deadline for Ministry of Labour to either approve or disapprove the formation of a trade union the authorization process has been criticized to be depended on the political affiliation of the ministers of labour in charge. Article 4 of the Labour Law, and Decree No. 7993 of 1952 list domestic workers as one group of workers who are barred from forming trade unions. Even though article 7 and article 92 allows foreigners to join a union, they are denied to vote for trade union representatives and being elected into such a position.|$|E

[...] This is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. [...] To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury.

50|$|A main {{distinction}} between COPE and the ruling ANC party is that COPE favours {{a system in}} which top-level government <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> elected directly, by public election, and <b>officials</b> can <b>be</b> removed only by courts of justice, whereas the current situation in South Africa is that top-level government <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> appointed and can be removed from office by the political parties themselves.|$|R
500|$|The court first {{addressed}} {{the question of}} whether Glik's First Amendment rights had been violated. [...] It noted that [...] "we have previously recognized that the videotaping of public <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> an exercise of First Amendment liberties" [...] and held that Glik had a constitutional right to videotape a public official in a public place. [...] The court noted that this was not limited to reporters and journalists, but a right of all citizens, subject to reasonable limitations of time, place and manner. [...] The First Circuit concluded that in the current case, none of those limitations applied.|$|E
500|$|Athletes have cheated by over-representing {{impairment}} to have {{a competitive}} advantage, {{and the use of}} performance-enhancing drugs. [...] German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids in 2002. [...] He had won two gold medals in the alpine events but was stripped of his medals. One concern now facing Paralympic <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> the technique of boosting blood pressure, known as autonomic dysreflexia. [...] The increase in blood pressure can improve performance by 15% and is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. [...] To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury. [...] This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly and using high-pressured compression stockings. [...] The injury is painless to the athlete but affects the body and impacts the athlete's blood pressure, as can techniques like allowing the bladder to overfill.|$|E
500|$|Bribery {{of foreign}} public <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> a {{distinct}} crime under Section 6, {{in line with}} the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention. A person will be guilty of this offence if they promise, offer or give a financial or other advantage to a foreign public official, either directly or through a third party, where such an advantage is not legitimately due. A foreign public official is defined, under Section 6(4), as [...] " [...] an individual holding legislative, administrative or judicial posts or anyone carrying out a public function for a foreign country or the country's public agencies or an official or agent of a public international organisation". The inclusion of [...] "through a third party" [...] is intended to prevent the use of go-betweens to avoid committing a crime, although if the written law of the country of the foreign public official allows or requires the official to accept the advantage offered, no crime will be committed. Unlike with general bribery offences, there is no requirement to show that the public official acted improperly as a result; this is a distinction between the Act and the Anti-Bribery Convention. The offence under Section 6 only applies to the briber, and not to the official who receives or agrees to receive such a bribe.|$|E

500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E

2500|$|The county {{clubs are}} listed in {{alphabetical}} order. [...] Until 1962, the biographies occupied less space and were not sorted by county club. [...] Introductory information about each county club has expanded, {{largely because of the}} introduction of limited overs cricket competitions.

2500|$|At {{the federal}} level, Article Two of the United States Constitution states in Section 4 that [...] "The President, Vice President, and all civil Officers of the United States shall {{be removed from}} Office on Impeachment for, and {{conviction}} of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors." [...] The House of Representatives has the sole power of impeaching, while the United States Senate has the sole power to try all impeachments. [...] The removal of impeached <b>officials</b> <b>is</b> automatic upon conviction in the Senate. In Nixon v. United States (1993), the Supreme Court determined that the federal judiciary cannot review such proceedings.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{that general}} {{principle}} is widely accepted, there is disagreement about {{the strength and}} scope of the doctrine. It can be said that some favor a [...] "strongly unitary" [...] executive, while others favor a [...] "weakly unitary" [...] executive. The former group argue, for example, that Congress's power to interfere with intra-executive decision-making (such as firing executive branch <b>officials)</b> <b>is</b> limited, and that the President can control policy-making by all executive agencies within the limits set for those agencies by Congress. Still others agree that the Constitution requires a unitary executive, but believe this to be harmful, and propose its abolition by constitutional amendment.|$|E
50|$|Another {{challenge}} {{is the need}} for a prompt and irrevocable decision. Election results need to be confirmed promptly, before <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> sworn into office. In many commercial uses of information technology, managers can reverse computer errors even when detected long after the event. However, once elected <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> sworn into office, they begin to make decisions such as voting on legislation or signing contracts on behalf of the government.
