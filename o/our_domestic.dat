In this extended title (and elsewhere in the book) Darwin used the biological term [...] "races" [...] interchangeably with [...] "varieties", meaning varieties within a species. He used the term broadly, and as well as discussions of [...] "the several races, for instance, of the cabbage" [...] and [...] "the hereditary varieties or races of <b>our</b> <b>domestic</b> animals and plants", there are three instances in the book where the phrase [...] "races of man" [...] is used, referring to races of humans.|$|E
500|$|The Tyler-Texas treaty, {{signed on}} April 12, 1844, was framed to induct Texas into the Union as a territory, {{following}} constitutional protocols. To wit, Texas would cede all its public lands to the United States, {{and the federal}} government would assume all its bonded debt, up to $10 million. The boundaries of the Texas territory were left unspecified. Four new states could ultimately be carved from the former republic – three of them likely to become slave states. Any allusion to slavery was omitted from the document so as not to antagonize anti-slavery sentiments during Senate debates, but it provided for the [...] "preservation of all [...] property as secured in <b>our</b> <b>domestic</b> institutions." ...|$|E

[...] The Oneida Whig did not approve of the convention, writing of the Declaration: [...] "This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of womanity.

500|$|He {{was almost}} exasperated by the {{inventiveness}} of forms in nature; [...] "In my examination of Orchids, hardly any fact {{has so much}} struck me as the endless diversity of structure,—the prodigality of resources,—for gaining the very same end, namely, the fertilisation of one flower by the pollen of another." [...] His focus on detail was justified, as [...] "The use of each trifling detail of structure {{is far from a}} barren search to those who believe in natural selection." [...] The [...] "contrivances and beautiful adaptations" [...] slowly acquired through slight variations, subjected to natural selection [...] "under the complex and ever-varying conditions of life", far transcended the most fertile imagination. The mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of cross-fertilisation: [...] "For may we not further infer as probable, in accordance with the belief of {{the vast majority of the}} breeders of <b>our</b> <b>domestic</b> productions, that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injurious,—that some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations?" ...|$|E
500|$|In Darwin's {{time there}} was no {{agreed-upon}} model of heredity; in Chapter I Darwin admitted, [...] "The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown." [...] He accepted {{a version of the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics (which after Darwin's death came to be called Lamarckism), and Chapter V discusses what he called the effects of use and disuse; he wrote that he thought [...] "there {{can be little doubt that}} use in <b>our</b> <b>domestic</b> animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited", and that this also applied in nature. Darwin stated that some changes that were commonly attributed to use and disuse, such as the loss of functional wings in some island dwelling insects, might be produced by natural selection. In later editions of Origin, Darwin expanded the role attributed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Darwin also admitted ignorance of the source of inheritable variations, but speculated they might be produced by environmental factors. However, one thing was clear: whatever the exact nature and causes of new variations, Darwin knew from observation and experiment that breeders were able to select such variations and produce huge differences in many generations of selection. The observation that selection works in domestic animals is not destroyed by lack of understanding of the underlying hereditary mechanism.|$|E
500|$|The Public Order Act, {{intended}} to regulate public assemblies and processions and to introduce new powers {{for the preservation}} of public order, came into force on 9 October 2009. On the same day, the Public Order (Unrestricted Area) Order 2009 ("2009 POA Order") made pursuant to the Act declared that Speakers' Corner was an unrestricted area in which assemblies and processions could be held without the need for a police permit. Thus, at present, Speakers' Corner is concurrently regulated by the Parks and Trees Regulations, and by exemption orders issued under the PEMA and POA. The conditions under which addresses, debates, demonstrations, discussions, lectures and talks (whether or not together with any exhibition, performance, play-reading or recital), must be held have remained essentially unchanged. Speakers and demonstration organizers must be Singapore citizens, while participants in demonstrations must be either citizens or permanent residents. Banners, films, flags, photographs, placards, posters, signs, writing or other visible representations or paraphernalia containing violent, lewd or obscene material must not be displayed or exhibited. Persons making speeches must use any of the four official languages of Singapore or related dialects, and organizers of demonstrations must be present throughout the event. In January 2008, the Complaints Choir, a vocal group participating in the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2008, was denied the chance to perform at Speakers' Corner and other outdoor venues unless the six foreigners in the group of 50 did not participate in the performance. As the choir did not wish to be split up in any way, it decided not {{to go ahead with the}} performance. Queried on the matter in Parliament, the Minister for Communication, Information and the Arts Dr. Lee Boon Yang stated that the Government did not think it [...] "desirable or good precedent" [...] for [...] "foreigners [...] here to organise and to lead Singaporeans to complain about <b>our</b> <b>domestic</b> issues".|$|E

2500|$|Others {{helped with}} {{providing}} information, including Asa Gray on American plants. Darwin wrote to Gray on 20 July 1857 saying that after 19 {{years of work}} {{on the question of}} whether species [...] "have descended from other species, like varieties from one species" [...] and [...] "that species arise like <b>our</b> <b>domestic</b> varieties with much extinction", he had [...] "come to the heteredox conclusion that there are no such things as independently created species – that species are only strongly defined varieties. I know that this will make you despise me. – I do not much underrate the many huge difficulties on this view, but yet it seems to me to explain too much, otherwise inexplicable, to be false." [...] An intrigued Gray admitted to his own notion that there was some law or power inherent in plants making varieties appear, and asked if Darwin was finding this law. Realising that Gray had not grasped what he was suggesting, Darwin sent him a letter on 5 September outlining the difficulties involved. He enclosed a brief but detailed abstract of his ideas on natural selection and divergence, copied out by the schoolmaster to make it more legible.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{debate on}} Jewish {{religious}} slaughter in Norway first {{evolved in the}} animal protection movement in the late 1890s, but did not become a public matter until the Jews of Norway’s capital Kristiania (now Oslo) were forced by the city authorities to abandon the practice of kosher slaughter (shehitah) within the city borders in 1913. From that moment and until the law prohibiting the practice {{on a national level}} was adopted by the Norwegian parliament on the 12th of June 1929, the debate made the headlines on several occasions in Norwegian newspapers in the interwar years. Hundreds of articles, letters and editorials discussed the case which was known as the «Schächtning-affair».1 The issue received especially much attention from the nationalist right-wing of the Agrarian movement, and the Jewish slaughter practice became subject to a massive campaign from the Agrarian press and from Agrarian party members of parliament. In its final phase during the 1920s, many of the critics were also heavily influenced by the modern anti-Semitic ideology that had evolved in Germany since the late 1870s. One of the most quoted statements from the debate was made by the Agrarian MP, and later prime minister Jens Hunseid (1883-1965) during the conclusive parliamentary session on June 12, 1929: «We have no obligation to deliver <b>our</b> <b>domestic</b> animals to the cruelties of the Jews, we have not invited the Jews to this country, and we have no obligation to provide the Jews animals to their religious orgies»." ...|$|E
