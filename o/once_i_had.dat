500|$|Gary Files as Matthew Harding (aged 28), a BISHOP agent {{paired with}} Unwin, {{who serves as}} his {{accomplice}} on assignment and as gardener of the vicarage in public life. Files retained fond memories {{of his time on}} The Secret Service, stating that he enjoyed voicing the character of Harding more than the character of Captain Magenta on Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. He made significant contributions to Harding's characterisation, conceiving the rural accent of Unwin's assistant himself: [...] "It just seemed so right for the character. Then <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the voice, the rest of Matthew followed." ...|$|E
500|$|Kanille told Rimsky-Korsakov to {{continue}} coming to him every Sunday, not for formal lessons but to play duets and discuss music. In November 1861, Kanille introduced the 18-year-old Nikolai to Mily Balakirev. Balakirev in turn {{introduced him to}} César Cui and Modest Mussorgsky; all three were known as composers, despite only being in their 20s. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, [...] "With what delight I listened to real business discussions [...] of instrumentation, part writing, etc! And besides, how much talking there was about current musical matters! All at <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been plunged into a new world, unknown to me, formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends. That was truly a strong impression." ...|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{finally decided}} {{to take on the}} project when he noticed that Holocaust deniers were being given serious {{consideration}} by the media. With the rise of neo-Nazism {{after the fall of the}} Berlin Wall, he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s. Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg made Jurassic Park first. Spielberg later said, [...] "He knew that <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> directed Schindler I wouldn't be able to do Jurassic Park." [...] The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable. Spielberg forewent a salary for the film, calling it [...] "blood money", and believed the film would flop.|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, Owumi's agent Goran Gramatikov was {{approached}} by another agent looking for players of African descent to play professional basketball in Libya. By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about. I didn't really care about the team, I cared about the money and that it was going to be on time and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Swift's {{earliest}} musical memories {{is listening}} to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing at church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: [...] "My parents noticed that, <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> run out of words, I would just make up my own". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her [...] "fascination with writing and storytelling" [...] to her mother. Swift {{was drawn to the}} storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by [...] "the great female country artists of the '90s"—Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: [...] "Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's [...] "Cowboy Take Me Away" [...] was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is [...] "an amazing example to every female songwriter out there". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.|$|E
500|$|Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's {{ventilator}} {{should be}} turned off as {{there is nothing more}} the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes;--allow me. I {{should be}} too bold were I {{to ask you}} to return my love at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> only ask you to know that because <b>I</b> was repulsed <b>once,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not given up the pursuit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better!" [...] she declared. [...] "Let {{me tell you}} this at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not come here to answer questions. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to ask them. Are you content?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{masthead}} {{text was}} designed by Matthew Carter, who would later design the popular webfonts Verdana and Georgia, and the Windows 95 interface font Tahoma. He wrote that, [...] "Nick Luard [...] wanted to change Private Eye into a glossy magazine {{and asked me to}} design it. I realised that this was a hopeless idea <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> met Christopher Booker, Richard Ingrams and Willie Rushton." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, author Meyer Levin, a University of Chicago classmate, {{requested}} Leopold's cooperation in {{writing a novel}} based on the Franks murder. Leopold responded {{that he did not}} wish his story told in fictionalized form, but offered Levin a chance to contribute to his own memoir, which was in progress. [...] Levin, unhappy with that suggestion, went ahead with his book alone, despite Leopold's express objections. [...] The novel, entitled Compulsion, was published in 1956. [...] Levin portrayed Leopold (under the pseudonym Judd Steiner) as a brilliant but deeply disturbed teenager, psychologically driven to kill because of his troubled childhood and an obsession with Loeb. Leopold later wrote that reading Levin's book made him [...] "... physically sick ... More than <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to lay the book down and wait for the nausea to subside. I felt as I suppose a man would feel if he were exposed stark-naked under a strong spotlight before a large audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vyjayanthimala {{commented that}} [...] "his {{death is a}} big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't {{have the chance to}} work with him because he came much later. I {{remember}} when he came to Chennai for some film shoot, the college girls went crazy {{to catch a glimpse of}} him when he was going to his studio." [...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [...] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. [...] "We had met several times. <b>Once</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> wanted to cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|Greg Shipperd {{publicly}} {{suggested that}} Ponting could be selected as a reserve wicket-keeper {{for the upcoming}} West Indies tour, despite not keeping-wicket for Tasmania. However, he had kept wicket in pre-season matches and during centre wicket practice. In any case Ponting was selected as a specialist batsman. [...] "...It was like all my birthdays had come at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some reservations about making my Test debut against arguably the best fast bowling attack in the world", Ponting later said. The West Indies had been cricket's powerhouse for close to two decades and teams included many feared fast bowlers. Before the tour, Australian captain Mark Taylor thought the last Test batting vacancy was possibly between Ponting and Justin Langer. [...] "Ricky Ponting is more the stroke player while Justin is the tough man. It depends on what we need at the time but you can probably say Ricky has his neck in front because he's been on this tour [...] ", Taylor said. Rod Marsh believed Ponting's attitude and fearless approach could tear the West Indies apart. Nevertheless, Ponting {{did not expect to}} be selected. Steve Waugh noted that Ponting would [...] "not be intimidated by the West Indians' inevitable waist-to-chin length." [...] During the series, Ponting said the current crop of bowlers were not [...] "of the same high class" [...] that opposition teams had come to expect from the West Indies.|$|E

60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. That is true. But I should know. You {{short-lived}} {{people are}} so childish. If I met a man of my own age I should recognize him at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never done so.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> quite {{important}} news," [...] she continued. [...] "My {{sister in}} Norfolk is very ill, and I {{must go to}} her at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> spoken to Kate about it. Do {{you think you can}} get along while I am gone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Clarence, 'let us {{go down to}} Beachharbour. It must be done at <b>once.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been trying}} to write, and I can't do it,' and his face lighted with a quiet smile which I understood.|$|R
