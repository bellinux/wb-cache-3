25|$|On 10 October 1973 the Yom Kippur War begun, {{causing the}} 1973 oil crisis, tripling oil prices to US$10 per barrel, halting {{economic}} growth. Newly build ships sometimes went {{straight from the}} yard to lay-up. The situation worsened when the Suez Canal was reopened in 1975. Just when the situation began to improve in 1979, the Iranian Revolution caused the second oil crisis, causing oil prices to rise to US$30. Ships were sometimes sent to the breakers after being in service for only ten years. It took {{until the end of}} the 1980s before any profits were being made in <b>oil</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E

25|$|Crichton {{became the}} major {{shareholder}} in the 1870s {{and he became}} the company manager in 1878. He invested on rib steel workshop and riveting technology. The yard subcontracted two steel hulls for Crichton's own yard; the ships were Zurukan and Spasitelra built for <b>oil</b> <b>transport</b> at Caspian Sea. Julin had died in 1874, and in 1882 the yard owners were Crichton with 51 shares, commercial counsellor F. V. Martinson with 27 shares and two shares were owned by doctor A. Spoof. The company was discontinued in October 1883; the property was auctioned and bought by Crichton for 300000marks. Subsequently, the Crichton yard became the largest company of Turku with personnel of 936 and 1589000marks' turnover.|$|E
25|$|Pipelines {{are part}} of the {{intermodal}} freight transportation network as they are the preferred mode of transporting gas and liquids. Often unrecognized by the general public due to their placement underground, pipelines contribute to freight transport and are critical to the economy. Compared to trucks and trains, pipelines are less damaging to the environment, less susceptible to theft and more economical, safe, convenient and reliable. According to the American Association of Oil Pipelines, of a total <b>oil</b> <b>transport</b> of 6,400 Billion Board Miles (BBM), rail accounts for 2%, trucks 3%, water carriers 27% and pipelines 68% of all transport. In addition to oil, gas, liquid fertilizers, liquefied natural gas, and carbon dioxide are also transported by pipeline.|$|E
