5|$|Göth {{believed}} if {{one member}} of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, the entire team must be punished. On one occasion he ordered the shooting of every second member of a work detail {{because one of the}} party had escaped. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion</b> he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E

5|$|On several {{occasions}} during the war, Hines {{was forced to}} make narrow, seemingly impossible, escapes. At one point, he concealed himself in a mattress that was being used at the time; <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> he was confused for the actor and assassin John Wilkes Booth, a dangerous {{case of mistaken identity}} that forced him to flee Detroit in April 1865 by holding a ferry captain at gunpoint. Union agents viewed Hines as the man they most needed to apprehend, but apart from the time he served at the Ohio Penitentiary in late 1863, he was never captured.|$|E
5|$|The Skanda Purana narrates that Bhikshatana-Shiva appears <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion</b> as a naked, fierce Kapali beggar. Once, at a {{sacrifice}} hosted by Brahma, Bhikshatana appears and begs for food. The Brahmins performing the sacrifice try {{to drive him}} away, considering a hungry beggar unfit for sacrificial rites. Bhikshatana throws his skull begging-bowl {{on the ground and}} the Brahmins throw it out, but another skull bowl appears in its place. Consequently, hundreds of skulls appear, polluting the sacrifice, which compels Brahma to promise Shiva that no sacrifice will be deemed complete without an invocation to him, Kapaleshvara—the Lord of the skulls.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians would now be mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E

5|$|During {{the last}} week of the war, Johnson's {{squadron}} flew patrols over Berlin and Kiel as German resistance crumbled. During a flight over central Germany looking for jet fighters, Johnson's squadron attacked Luftwaffe airfields. On one sortie, his unit strafed and destroyed 11 Bf 109s that were preparing to take off. On another sortie, an enemy transport was sighted, but took evasive action and retreated back to German held territory but Johnson's pilots shot it down. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> Johnson intercepted a flight of four Fw 190s. The German fighters, however, waggled their wings to signal non-hostile intent and Johnson's unit escorted them to an RAF airfield.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a person could be possessed.|$|E
5|$|Monti {{was born}} in Abington, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1975, to Paul, a school teacher, and Janet Monti. He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, he disappeared from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt {{on the other side}} of the fence. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> a migraine headache kept him home from school, but he left the house and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School at the age of 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E

5|$|<b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion</b> {{during the}} war, when {{the lady in}} waiting who usually picked them up from the {{hospital}} was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and her sister Olga decided to go shopping for the first time. They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went {{into one of the}} stores, where they were unrecognized because of their nurses' uniforms. They came back out without buying anything when they realized they did not have money with them and wouldn't have known how to use it even if they did. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to use money.|$|E
5|$|Ranulf often {{worked in}} concert with Haimo the dapifer, or seneschal, and Urse d'Abetot in {{carrying}} out royal judgements. On one occasion, they, along with Robert Bloet the Bishop of Lincoln, reassessed the lands of Thorney Abbey for taxes. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> they were ordered along with Ralph de Luffa Bishop of Chichester {{to see that the}} abbey of Fecamp received custody of a church at Steyning. Others who often worked with Ranulf were Robert FitzHaimo, Roger Bigod, and Eudo the dapifer. These men are sometimes considered by historians to be the first Barons of the Exchequer. There are also signs during Ranulf's administration of resident justices in the counties who held courts for the king. Itinerant justices were probably also used to hear pleas that were reserved to the crown.|$|E
5|$|The group {{soon began}} a scripted rivalry {{with the team}} of CM Punk and Seth Skyfire, which saw The Untouchables winning the Southern Tag Team Title from them on August 2, 2006. The Untouchables later engaged in another rivalry with Shawn Spears and Cody Runnels. They also won the Deep South Wrestling (DSW) Tag Team Championship after making a {{surprise}} appearance at a DSW show on October 5, 2006. They lost the South Tag Team Championship on October 12 to The Major Brothers. In addition, the team lost the OVW Southern Tag Team Title to Spears and Runnels, prompting Cherry to leave The Untouchables to side with Spears and Runnels briefly before betraying them. The team won the Southern Tag Team Championship <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> before losing them to Spears and Rhodes in a street fight, thus ending their feud.|$|E

5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
5|$|Courville and Percy {{decided to}} test Tarrare's {{capacity}} for food. A meal {{had been prepared}} for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare {{in the presence of}} food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep; Courville noted that Tarrare's belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion</b> Tarrare was presented with a live cat. He tore the cat's abdomen open with his teeth and drank its blood, and proceeded to eat the entire cat aside from its bones, before vomiting up its fur and skin. Following this, hospital staff offered Tarrare a variety of other animals including snakes, lizards and puppies, all of which were eaten; he also swallowed an entire eel without chewing, having first crushed its head with his teeth.|$|E
5|$|Far more to Mao's liking {{were the}} {{accounts}} of war and banditry found in the Four Great Classical Novels, including Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, and Water Margin; while also steeped in Confucian morality, they emphasised the need to fight for justice in society, {{and it is possible}} that these texts inspired his interest in history. According to his later account, it was at this point that he attained a strong belief in justice; he began to divide his lunch in two to share with a poorer boy who could not afford food. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> he got into a physical fight with an older classmate; this greatly upset his mother, who held pacifist beliefs. According to his later account, at one point he rebelled when the teacher tried to punish him for disobedience; rather than permitting himself to be beaten with a rod, he marched out of the school and into the wooded mountains. He remained there for three days, until being discovered by a family member and brought home.|$|E
50|$|A centreman and wingman {{with great}} pace, stamina and skills, {{he was awarded}} the Brownlow Medal in 1940 and was runner-up <b>on</b> <b>another</b> two <b>occasions.</b> He won his club's best and fairest award five times and captained them from 1938 until 1945.|$|R

5|$|On {{the night}} of 4–5 February 1917, the 13th Battalion—with Murray {{commanding}} A Company—attacked the German position at Stormy Trench. Preceded by a heavy artillery barrage, A Company seized {{the right of the}} position after overcoming stiff resistance, consolidating their gains by setting up a makeshift barricade. The Germans counterattacked, prompting Murray to send an SOS signal to the artillery officer, calling for more support. Although repulsed, the Germans counterattacked twice more. On the third attack, Murray organised a twenty-man grenade bombing party and led them in a charge against their attackers, pushing them back to their original start line. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion</b> when the company lost some ground, Murray rallied his men and retook it. Between midnight and 03:00, the company maintained spasmodic bombing, repelling further assaults with the aid of artillery support. By 20:00 on 5 February, the 16th Battalion relieved Murray's company, which had only 48 survivors from the 140 who had begun the attack.|$|E
5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion</b> she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E
5|$|While training, Miller flew Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. He {{had another}} near death experience: {{mechanical}} problems {{forced him to}} make an emergency landing of his Beaufighter. The plane was repaired for use by others, but, on its next flight, the pilot was killed when the problem recurred. <b>On</b> <b>another</b> <b>occasion,</b> Miller avoided colliding with a hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment; a V1 bomb hit the venue and killed many of the patrons. In October, he went AWL to watch a concert and was summarily discharged, but the CO revoked his decision after Miller agreed to play for his cricket team. At {{the end of his}} officer training, Miller was sent aboard a Royal Navy destroyer as part of an exchange program between the forces. During a mission to Belgium, the vessel fought a German U-boat, which was sunk. Upon his return to England, Miller was promoted to flying officer on 4 November 1944.|$|E
