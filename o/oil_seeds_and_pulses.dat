It adapts well in sole crop and inter cropped conditions (with cereals, millets, <b>oils</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulses)</b> by enhancing the system productivity and net income {{to the small}} and marginal farmers across the globe. The range of maturity duration in the crop allows it to grow in diversified cropping systems and patterns in varied ecoregions of the world. Development of cytoplasmic male sterility based hybrids provided an opportunity for enhancing the yields under marginal environments. With recent interventions in addressing the photo sensitivity and maturity have led to evolving super early varieties with less than 100 days duration, provided a scope for horizontal expansion of the crop in different agro ecological systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Soybean is an {{important}} <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulse</b> crop. Mycoflora associated with soybean seeds collected from different region were studied. Among the samples MARS, Raichur sample showed very high percentage of discoloured (30. 0 %), 21. 0 per cent shrivelled, 2. 0 per cent broken and very low per cent of healthy (47. 0 %) seeds. Overall, 11 fungi were isolated by using agar and blotter techniques and six fungi were from seed washing method. Pathogenic fungi frequently isolated were Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Phoma spp. and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Less frequently isolated fungi were F. solani, F. moniliformae, Rhizophus spp., Botrytis cinerea and Cercospora kikuchi. Highest mycoflora was recorded from storage sample of MARS, Raichur (50. 0 – 52. 0 %) followed by market collected samples (23. 5 – 29. 0 %) and least per cent was recorded from field collected samples (15. 5 - 27. 5 %). The frequency of M. phaseolina (27. 0 – 28. 0 %) and F. oxysporum (5. 0 - 5. 5 %) was more in storage sample of MARS, Raichur whereas A. flavus (7. 0 %) and A. niger (3. 5 - 4. 0 %) were predominantly recovered from market collected sample of APMC, Raichur...|$|R
40|$|This study {{uses the}} Generalized Composite Commodity Theorem (GCCT) to {{investigate}} the consistency of aggregating major crop products in studying producer’s behaviour in Iran. The results show that all crop products, except corn, soybean, and melon can consistently be grouped into cereals, <b>oil</b> <b>seeds,</b> <b>pulses,</b> <b>and</b> vegetable composite commodities. In addition, the results testing the hypothesis {{of the possibility of}} aggregating all crop products in a single group was positive when we excluded sesame, cotton, and water melon from the list. Accordingly, modeling and estimating an aggregate production or cost function for Iranian crop sector will not cause consistent biases. Additionally, one can estimate a separate or cost function for each of the above sub-sectors without causing aggregation biases in grouping the commodities...|$|R

40|$|Non-chemical {{methods for}} weed control play an {{important}} role for the management of weeds in organic cropping systems in Europe. With the expansion of the organic area in recent years, more research has been conducted to develop new methods and improve management strategies. Currently, weed harrows, rotary cultivators and inter-row cultivators are the principal methods used for full-width treatments in large agricultural crops, such as cereals, <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape, maize <b>and</b> <b>pulses.</b> The mechanical methods are often combined with cultural measures, e. g. stale seedbeds, delayed sowing, placement of fertilizers etc., to benefit from the additive and sometimes even synergistic effects of combining direct and cultural methods. In row crops, such as sugar beets and horticultural crops, thermal and mechanical methods are mostly combined to remove as many weeds in the rows as possible in order to minimize the need for manual weeding. Weeds growing between the rows are easily controlled by inter-row cultivation. Robotic weeding for intra-row weed control is now possible for transplanted crops, and inter-row hoes have been equipped with GPS-systems and cameras for optimizing precision and steering. Works on new GPS technology is currently focusing on seeding systems with the ability to create parallel or diamond crop establishment patterns, which enable inter-row hoeing to be conducted in different directions. So far, non-chemical methods have had little uptake in conventional farming but national and EU-based legislative initiatives may change the situation radically in the near future. Several European countries have launched pesticide action plans and the EU a new directive for the implementation of integrated pest management (IPM); all aiming for minimizing the reliance on herbicides. This is expected to accentuate the need for non-chemical methods...|$|R
40|$|Responsibility for the {{marketing}} and storage of maize is shifting from government-sponsored marketing boards {{to the private}} trading sector. This change has implications for producers, who may encounter new problems with the storage and marketing of the crop, and for traders. Assistance may be required during this transitional phase. Major changes are occurring to the way that maize is being marketed in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. After several decades of influence over maize pricing, procurement, storage and distribution by government-subsidized grain marketing organizations, encouragement is being given {{to the private sector}} to participate in the maize trade. The reasons for the change are not charitable. Governments are having {{to face up to the}} high costs of subsidizing the grain sector and running parastatal bodies. Many marketing cooperatives too have found their access to credit for the purchase of grain curtailed because they have been unable to meet repayments on earlier loans. Likewise governments have been unable or unwilling to continue to underwrite the cooperatives' debts. Under structural adjustment policies, governments have been encouraged to divest much direct responsibility for grain marketing and to create an enabling environment for the private sector. The degree to which the private sector has been able to participate has depended very much on the commitment made and the strength of the economy. For example, Ghana has always had a very strong private sector, Tanzania has moved fast and government intervention has declined rapidly. Zambia has faced difficulties during its rapid transition phase, whereas Zimbabwe has been pursuing a more cautious and structured approach. Difficult decisions have to be made over how to ensure fair producer and consumer prices whilst reducing the subsidy to {{the marketing}} board. Pressure on farm storage The immediate effect for many small-scale farmers, with perhaps less than ten or twenty bags of maize for sale, has been that the guaranteed market has gone. Whereas previously, soon after harvest they were able to sell surplus grain locally at a guaranteed price and be fairly sure of payment, they now find that none of these factors applies. Sale at harvest may attract low prices, but if they forego immediate sale, they have to make provision for holding the grain for longer, with added risk of spoilage and loss. Traditional storage methods, whilst adequate for the safe-keeping of local varieties of grain, are less well-suited for the higher-yielding varieties of some grains, particularly maize, which are very susceptible to insect damage in store. Some donors consider that the solution to rural storage problems lies in the provision of a communal or village storage building. The intention is that surplus grain shall be stored in a safe place and marketed from there, or be sold back to the villagers. Unfortunately, such systems rarely seem to run well in practice; there are too many practical and operational problems to be overcome. Indeed, adverse experiences in much of Africa point to the inadvisability of recommending this as an option. Development of grain trading Until liberalization policies were implemented, there was little or no opportunity for legalized trade in grains and, with pan-territorial and pan-seasonal prices, there was no real inducement for a private trader. Now, in the enabling environment, opportunities exist. However, many entrepreneurs face initial difficulties: finding the money to purchase grain, the means of transporting it and ways of establishing storage facilities. In the short-term, the pattem of business tends to be one of rapid turnover of stocks, preferably supplying identified markets so as to avoid all interest, storage and doublehandling costs. Grain trading therefore tends to focus solely around transporting from an accessible area of surplus production to an identified market. Hopefully this pattern will change as grain trading becomes more established and competitive. The long-term technical solutions are not difficult, but in the short-term there are problems to be overcome. For the producer, advice on how, when and where to sell might seem unnecessary, but it must be sought by those inexperienced and uncertain of the free market. Seemingly simple things, like obtaining a grain bag or arranging transport to a market, prove very difficult to resolve when cash is required in advance and the producer has none. For many farmers, sale may not be possible and may not even be sought immediately after harvest, and some provision of extra storage will be needed. The options are to extend and improve the capacity of traditional storage or to find temporary storage for bags of grain, often inside the house. Use of either method for more than a few months will require treatment of the grain with insecticide. For this, safe and effective pesticides must be available locally. Those farmers who live a long distance from markets are now at a disadvantage because high transport costs will erode their profits. One option for them is to replace maize as a cash crop with alternative crops of higher value and lower bulk such as <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulses.</b> Extension support In the past, extension services have struggled to provide adequate support to farmers for post-harvest matters. Usually there are few storage experts and their research and extension support activities are underfunded. Post-harvest extension is now faced with a new challenge and demands for additional information. Producers would like to know where to deliver their grain to receive the best price and they need to know when is the best time to sell. Some wait at the farm hopefully for a buyer; others wait at the nearest roadside, sometimes for days on end. Ministries of agriculture must meet these new demands to support the dynamic process of liberalization. The challenge for extension workers is to serve farmers' interests with appropriate marketing and storage advice. This requires a new initiative but, if successful, it will raise the impact of the service significantly.
