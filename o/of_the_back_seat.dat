The battery pack is located just under and slightly aft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat.</b> The battery remains entirely ambient-air-cooled. There’s no liquid cooling of any sort, and no forced-air system either. Toyota improved the precision in battery cell assembly working together with battery supplier Panasonic.|$|E
2500|$|According to witnesses, the {{shooting}} occurred {{shortly after the}} limousine made the sharp left-hand turn from Houston onto Elm Street. Most of the witnesses recalled that the first shot was fired after the president had started waving with his right hand. The onlookers recalled hearing three shots, with {{the second and third}} shots bunched distinctly much closer together than the first and second shots. [...] The Zapruder film shows the President re-emerging in the footage after being temporarily hidden from view by the Stemmons Freeway sign at Zapruder film frame 224 to 225; his mouth has already opened wide in an anguished expression. He has already been impacted by a bullet and his hands clench into fists. He then quickly raises his fists dramatically {{in front of his face}} and throat as he turns leftwards towards his wife. Secret Service Agent Clint Hill testified that he heard one shot, then jumped off the running board of the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind Kennedy (Hill was filmed jumping off his follow-up car at the equivalent of Zapruder frame 308; about a quarter of a second before the president's head exploded at frame 313). Hill then rapidly ran towards the Presidential limo and then another shot hit Kennedy in the head, cracking open the right side of his skull. As the limousine began speeding up, Mrs. Kennedy was heard to scream [...] and she climbed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> onto the rear of the limo. [...] At the same time, Hill managed to climb aboard and hang onto the suddenly accelerating limo, and Mrs. Kennedy returned to the back seat. Hill then shielded her and the President. Both of the Connallys stated they heard Mrs. Kennedy say, [...] "I have his brains in my hand!" [...] The limo driver and police motorcycles turned on their sirens and raced at high speeds to Parkland Hospital, passing their intended destination of the Dallas Trade Mart along the way, and arriving at about 12:38p.m. (CST).|$|E
60|$|Even in {{the porch}} he hesitated.

60|$|I spoke hastily, my one desire {{being to}} escape from <b>the</b> scene <b>of</b> my humiliation unaccosted. One of my little audience, however, was of a {{different}} mind.

5000|$|Since {{boxer shorts}} fabric is rarely stretchy, a [...] "balloon seat", a generous panel of loosely fitting fabric in <b>the</b> center rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shorts, is {{designed}} to accommodate the wearer's various movements, especially bending forward. The most common sewing design of boxer shorts are made with a panel seat that has two seams running on <b>the</b> outer edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seating</b> area, creating a center rear panel. Most mass-produced commercial boxer shorts are made using this design.|$|R

25|$|In Europe, only 1152 {{examples}} of this model were sold through the official Mazda network.

Germany top the sales with 446 cars, while UK is second at 210 and Greece third with 168. The European models also received the 1994 interior facelift, with a passenger air bag.|$|R

60|$|Wrayson looked anxiously at his watch. It {{was already}} ten minutes past nine, and {{although}} {{he was standing on}} the precise spot indicated, there was no one about who in the least resembled <b>the</b> young woman <b>of</b> whom he was in search. The overture to the ballet was being played, a good many people were strolling about, or seated at the small round tables, but they were all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> usual class, the ladies ornate and obvious, and all having <b>the</b> air <b>of</b> habitués. In vain Wrayson scanned <b>the</b> faces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passers-by, and even <b>the</b> occupants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats.</b> There was no sign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young woman <b>of</b> whom he was in search.|$|R

60|$|I saw {{no more of}} Uriah Heep, {{until the}} day when Agnes left town. I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go; and there was he, {{returning}} to Canterbury by the same conveyance. It was some small satisfaction to me to observe his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered, mulberry-coloured great-coat perched up, in company with an umbrella like a small tent, on the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> on the roof, while Agnes was, of course, inside; but what I underwent in my efforts to be friendly with him, while Agnes looked on, perhaps deserved that little recompense. At the coach window, as at the dinner-party, he hovered about us without a moment's intermission, like a great vulture: gorging himself on every syllable that I said to Agnes, or Agnes said to me.|$|E
60|$|At three {{precisely}} the heavy open carriage, swung upon C-springs and drawn by two huge greys, drew {{up in front}} of the hall-door, and the squire, who was as usual dressed in the old-fashioned knee-breeches, and carried in his hand his gold-headed cane, stepped solemnly into it, and seated himself exactly in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> not leaning back, as is the fashion of our degenerate days, but holding himself bolt upright. Any more imposing sight than this old gentleman presented thus seated, and moving at a stately pace through the village street, it is impossible to conceive; but it so oppressed the very children that fear at the spectacle (which was an unwonted one, for the squire had not thus driven abroad in state for some years) overcame their curiosity, and at his approach they incontinently fled.|$|E

60|$|Now, of course, I {{might have}} refused an {{invitation}} conveyed {{in such a}} manner. But, {{as a matter of}} fact, I didn't. I wanted to see the thing out; also to put in a word for young Somers, if I got the chance. So we all departed from that room, followed by a titter of amusement from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company who had overheard the conversation. In the street stood a splendid carriage and pair; a powdered footman opened its door. With a ferocious bow Sir Alexander motioned to me to enter, which I did, taking one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> as it gave more room for my tin case. Then came Mr. Stephen, then Woodden bundled in holding the precious plant in front of him like a wand of office, and last of all, Sir Alexander, having seen us safe, entered also.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{based on}} a {{utilitarian}} hatchback, the Clio V6 is not a practical family car. With an average fuel consumption of 24 mpgimp, this resulted in an empty fuel tank in just over 300 mi. <b>The</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boot space, due to the engine placement, results in a severe restriction in luggage space - {{there is only a}} small space in the front where the engine used to be, suitable for a holdall or week-end groceries, a small netted area behind the seats plus a small stash area under the tailgate. The enhanced steering makes tight manoeuvring a little challenging, the turning circle is 13 m - around three car lengths - turning what might normally be a three-point turn into a five-point turn. The Clio V6 Phase 2 gained even more weight, but offset it with an additional 25 horsepower. This resulted in a reduced 0-60 mph run at 5.9 seconds and a top speed of 153 mph.|$|R
60|$|There {{were many}} {{thoughtful}} features which fitted the Touricar {{for use in}} camping--extra-sized baggage-box whose triangular shape made the car more nearly streamline, special folding silk tents, folding aluminum cooking-utensils, electric stove run by current from the car, electric-battery light attached to a curtain-rod. But the distinctive feature, the one which Carl could patent, was {{the means by which}} a bed was made up inside the car as Pullman seats are turned into berths. The back of the front seat was hinged, and dropped back to horizontal. The upholstery back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> could be taken out and also placed on the horizontal. With blankets spread on the level space thus provided, with the extra-heavy top and side curtains in place, and the electric light switched on, tourists had a refuge cleaner than a country hotel and safer than a tent....|$|E
60|$|She indeed {{held the}} lock fast. It was a firm hand, yet soft--their fingers had touched over the handle--and looked {{white in the}} moonlight. He made no reply, but sank back again in his seat with a {{singular}} sensation in the fingers that had touched hers. He was in the shadow, and, without being seen, could abandon his reserve and glance at her face. It struck {{him that he had}} never really seen her before. She was not so tall as she had appeared to be. Her eyes were not large, but her pupils were black, moist, velvety, and so convex as to seem embossed on the white. She had an indistinctive nose, a rather colorless face--whiter at the angles of the mouth and nose through the relief of tiny freckles like grains of pepper. Her mouth was straight, dark, red, but moist as her eyes. She had drawn herself into the corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> her wrist put through and hanging over the swinging strap, the easy lines of her plump figure swaying from side to side with the motion of the coach. Finally, forgetful of any presence in the dark corner opposite, she threw her head a little farther back, slipped a trifle lower, and placing two well-booted feet upon the middle seat, completed a charming and wholesome picture.|$|E
60|$|It {{was under}} these hard {{conditions}} that Cass Beard, convicted of overt sentimentalism, aggravated by inconsistency, {{stepped into the}} Red Chief coach that evening. It was his habit usually to ride with the driver, but the presence of Hornsby and Miss Porter on the box seat changed his intention. Yet he had the satisfaction of seeing that neither had noticed him, and as {{there was no other}} passenger inside, he stretched himself on the cushion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> and gave way to moody reflections. He quite determined to leave Blazing Star, to settle himself seriously to the task of money getting, and to return to his comrades, some day, a sarcastic, cynical, successful man, and so overwhelm them with confusion. For poor Cass had not yet reached that superiority of knowing that success would depend upon his ability to forego his past. Indeed, part of his boyhood had been cast among these men, and he was not old enough to have learned that success was not to be gauged by their standard. The moon lit up the dark interior of the coach with a faint poetic light. The lazy swinging of the vehicle that was bearing him away--albeit only for a night and a day--the solitude, the glimpses from the window of great distances full of vague possibilities, made the abused ring potent as that of Gyges. He dreamed with his eyes open. From an Alnaschar vision he suddenly awoke. The coach had stopped. The voices of men, one in entreaty, one in expostulation, came from the box. Cass mechanically put his hand to his pistol pocket.|$|E
50|$|Opens {{normally}} like {{a traditional}} van sliding door, but unlike most sliding doors where the track ison <b>the</b> exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, this type has it inside and on <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean {{in design and}} yet the door can slide past <b>the</b> trailing edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. However, this design is very unusual and can only {{be found on the}} Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> siding door, making it incapable of having a track on <b>the</b> exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the sliding door can slide open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of sliding door, but has it only on one side while the driver's side door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> is a normal hinge door. <b>The</b> sliding door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EK wagon is also electric-powered.|$|R

6000|$|The reply which {{decided the}} matter {{launched}} us upon yet wider conjecture regarding the unknown: {{was he a}} retired courier, a concierge out of place, a professor of languages on his holiday, or merely an amateur of philological studies? His declared proficiency was manifested in unexpected measure as we drove away from the Temple of Neptune on through the narrow street leading to it. Every motor has its peculiar note, and our car had something like the scream of a wild animal in pain, such as might have justly alarmed a stouter spirit {{than that of the}} poor little cab-horse which we encountered at the corner of this street. It reared, it plunged; when our chauffeur held us in it still backed and filled so dangerously that the mother and children overflowing the cab followed the example of the driver in spilling to the ground. Then our good international, the agent, jumped down and, mounting to the coachman's seat, took the reins and urged the horse forward, while its driver pulled it by the bridle. All was of no effect till the solitary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> rose in his place and shouted to the frightened creature in choice American: [...] "What d' you mean, there? Come on! Come on, you fool!" [...] Then, {{as if it had been}} an [...] "impenitent mule" [...] in some far-distant Far-Western incarnation, this Eoman cab-horse recognized the voice of authority; it nerved itself against the imaginary danger, and came steadily forward; our agent regained his place, and we moved shriekingly on to the next object of interest. It was not quite the note blown from level tubes of brass in the progress of a conqueror, but we did not lack the cheers of a disinterested populace, which at several points impartially applauded our orator's French and German versions of his not always tacit Italian.|$|E
