5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive flaccid paralysis, starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E

5|$|Myoclonic {{seizures}} involve spasms <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> {{in either}} a few areas or all over. Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking. The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends. Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second. This typically occurs {{on both sides of}} the body.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on {{one part of the}} body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action <b>of</b> <b>muscles.</b> The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso and limbs. The cranial nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E

30|$|Muscle {{morphology}} {{affects the}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> contraction. The cross-sectional area <b>of</b> a <b>muscle</b> determines the muscle force (Ikai and Fukunaga 1968) [in the case <b>of</b> pennation <b>muscle,</b> physiological cross-sectional {{area is a}} better index than anatomical cross-sectional area (Morse et al. 2008)] and the length <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres have a strong influence on the shortening velocity <b>of</b> the <b>muscle</b> fibres (Bodine et al. 1982). Thus, {{in the fields of}} sport science and physical therapy, clarification regarding the morphological plasticity <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> is important for enhancing the performance of human movement.|$|R
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather vibrate like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction <b>of</b> <b>muscles,</b> nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds with a wide range of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E

5|$|Flies {{are capable}} of great {{manoeuvrability}} during flight due {{to the presence of}} the halteres. These act as gyroscopic organs and are rapidly oscillated in time with the wings; they act as a balance and guidance system by providing rapid feedback to the wing-steering muscles, and flies deprived of their halteres are unable to fly. The wings and halteres move in synchrony but the amplitude of each wing beat is independent, allowing the fly to turn sideways. The wings of the fly are attached to two kinds <b>of</b> <b>muscles,</b> those used to power it and another set used for fine control.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|Most fish move by {{alternately}} contracting paired sets <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> {{on either}} side of the backbone. These contractions form S-shaped curves that move down the body. As each curve reaches the back fin, backward force is applied to the water, and in conjunction with the fins, moves the fish forward. The fish's fins function like an airplane's flaps. Fins also increase the tail's surface area, increasing speed. The streamlined body of the fish decreases the amount of friction from the water. Since body tissue is denser than water, fish must compensate for the difference or they will sink. Many bony fish have an internal organ called a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases.|$|E

Loss <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> mass and increased intramuscular fibrosis occur in both sarcopenia and muscular dystrophy. Several regulators (mTOR, serum response factor, atrogin- 1, myostatin, etc) seem to modulate protein synthesis and degradation or transcription of muscle-specific genes during both sarcopenia and muscular dystrophy. This review provides an overview of the adaptive changes in several regulators <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> mass in both sarcopenia and muscular dystrophy...|$|R
30|$|Many muscle {{diseases}} {{share common}} clinical features that render arriving at appropriate differential diagnoses difficult. The selective involvement <b>of</b> certain <b>muscles</b> {{is a key}} to the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> diseases. Muscle MRI can detect the pattern <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> affection, especially when clinical detection is difficult. The combination <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> imaging with clinical can limit the differential diagnosis and even yield the most probable one and can direct genetic testing as the only method to arrive at a definite diagnosis [1].|$|R
5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions <b>of</b> <b>muscles),</b> {{and loss of}} movement range and control (in particular {{with a loss of}} movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.|$|E
5|$|The {{muscular system}} has been {{similarly}} modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified {{to contribute to the}} action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers <b>of</b> <b>muscles,</b> some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
40|$|Growth of somatic {{tissue in}} Photololigo sp. was {{examined}} in terms <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> fibre recruitment and growth. Muscle blocks and muscle fibres were measured and size frequency distributions compared between different size-classes <b>of</b> squid. <b>Muscle</b> blocks increased in size as individuals grew. The size frequency distribution <b>of</b> the <b>muscle</b> blocks {{suggested that this}} increase was due to both the generation <b>of</b> new <b>muscle</b> fibres {{and an increase in}} the size <b>of</b> existing <b>muscle</b> fibres. The size frequency distribution <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres was very similar in all size-classes of squid examined, and the presence <b>of</b> small <b>muscle</b> fibres in all individuals suggested that fibre recruitment may be continuous. Growth <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> tissue, by muscle fibre growth and recruitment, provides a mechanism to explain constant growth throughout the life cycle described for tropical squid. Two structural types <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres, mitochondria-poor and mitochondria-rich, are present in juvenile and adult squid.

In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle in flight affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important in flight control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction <b>of</b> <b>muscles</b> attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E
5000|$|Sarcopenia is {{characterized}} first by a muscle atrophy (a {{decrease in the}} size <b>of</b> the <b>muscle),</b> along with a reduction in muscle tissue quality, characterized by such factors as replacement <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres with fat, an increase in fibrosis, changes in muscle metabolism, oxidative stress, and degeneration of the neuromuscular junction and leading to progressive loss <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> function and frailty. [...] Sarcopenia is determined by two factors: initial amount <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> mass and rate at which aging decreases muscle mass.
