In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers. In September 2012, Feige, while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film, including a film based on the [...] "Planet Hulk" [...] and [...] "World War Hulk" [...] storylines, stated, [...] "everything [...] is on the table.

2500|$|Having {{released}} {{a couple of}} early singles, Scritti Politti began planning their debut album in 1979, but the recording had to be delayed when Gartside collapsed after a gig supporting Gang of Four in Brighton in early 1980. Originally {{believed to be a}} heart attack, the cause of his collapse was eventually diagnosed as a panic attack, brought on by his chronic stage fright and his unhealthy lifestyle. Returning home to south Wales at his parents' insistence for a nine-month convalescence period, Gartside had plenty <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the direction the band and their music were going in. During 1979 he had already become less interested in the independent music and punk scene and had started listening to and buying American funk and disco like Chic and the Jacksons, Stax soul like Aretha Franklin, and 1960s British beat music such as the Beatles' early records. Gartside {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "you don't have to be lobotomised in order to make pop music. It's a real passion to make it" [...] and that making pop music didn't mean selling out punk's principles or dumbing down: [...] "I think the politics of punk does survive. There are a whole lot [...] people who aren't happy to make pap but want to make pop. They understand that what sells means something. It finds a way into people's hearts in a way that independent music never did." [...] He explained his reasons for abandoning the band's original [...] "do-it-yourself" [...] philosophy to Smash Hits in November 1981: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or Å“conomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of better words".|$|E

5000|$|Think about {{reasonably}} adequate provocation {{in terms}} of a stressful trigger to a loss of self-control. The law says insulting words, or words alone, cannot justify a trigger of criminal homicide. Your lover cannot call you a name, thereby making you justified in killing them. The legally adequate provocation must go beyond insulting words to events, situations and circumstances that surprise the defendant and trigger them to lose any sort <b>of</b> reasonableness without <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> through the consequences nor weigh the pros and cons. In this way, a court may establish a defendant, originally charged with second degree murder, to have been legally adequately provoked to commit the unlawful act of killing of another human being making his crime less punishable, but still punishable.|$|R

This 'capitalism' provided a secure way <b>of</b> life with <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and experiment, for a population that had been selected for inventiveness and resourcefulness.

40|$|This paper {{functions}} both as {{an overview}} of Albanian migration and as {{an introduction to the}} special issue as a whole. The special issue is devoted to a country which lies at the very centre of the region covered by the Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans, yet which has been treated only sparingly {{in the pages of the}} journal thus far. Thematically, the focus is on migrationâ€”the phenomenon which is at the heart of economic, social and cultural change in Albania over the past 15 years. No other country in Europe has been so deeply affected by migration over this period <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> But <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> migration as an agent of development in Albania is both simplistic and premature. Quite apart from the problematic nature of such label-terms as â€˜developmentâ€™, â€˜modernizationâ€™, â€˜transformationâ€™, etc. â€”especially in the Albanian settingâ€”the relationships involved in analysing what has been called â€˜the migrationâ€“development nexusâ€™ are complex indeed. Does migration, through its beneficial mechanisms which are hypothesized by economists (relief of unemployment, rising wage levels, inflow of remittances, investment-oriented return migration), stimulate development in the migrant-origin country? Or should the relationship be re-stated in a different way: for instance, that it is underdevelopment that causes migration; or that excessive outmigration leads not so much to development of the home country but to its further impoverishment because of the excessive outflow of human capital...|$|R
