40|$|In this work, we give a novel general {{approach}} for distribution testing. We describe two techniques: our first technique gives sample-optimal testers, while our second technique gives matching sample lower bounds. As a consequence, we resolve the sample complexity {{of a wide}} variety of testing problems. Our upper bounds are obtained via a modular reduction-based approach. Our approach yields optimal testers for numerous problems by using a standard ℓ_ 2 -identity tester as a black-box. Using this recipe, we obtain simple estimators for a wide range of problems, encompassing most problems previously studied in the TCS literature, namely: (1) identity testing to a fixed distribution, (2) closeness testing between two unknown distributions (with equal/unequal sample sizes), (3) independence testing (in any number of dimensions), (4) closeness testing for collections of distributions, and (5) testing histograms. For all of these problems, <b>our</b> <b>testers</b> are sample-optimal, up to constant factors. With the exception of (1), ours are the first sample-optimal testers for the corresponding problems. Moreover, our estimators are significantly simpler to state and analyze compared to previous results. As an application of our reduction-based technique, we obtain the first nearly instance-optimal algorithm for testing equivalence between two unknown distributions. Moreover, our technique naturally generalizes to other metrics beyond the ℓ_ 1 -distance. Our lower bounds are obtained via a direct information-theoretic approach: Given a candidate hard instance, our proof proceeds by bounding the mutual information between appropriate random variables.

We {{are developing a}} smart hardware device that transforms any conventional manual toothbrush into a gaming controller, so children and young-at-hearts can play fun & instructional mobile games while brushing. Brushing teeth is still a huge problem in our society, especially among children. Tooth decay is the single-most reason children between 5 and 9 are admitted to hospital. Various public health experts and dentists have recently warned {{about the state of}} oral health in the UK. With Playbrush we have tested toothbrushing behavior with over 300 children and found that motivation and education are the keys missing in the current system. Over 50 % of <b>our</b> <b>testers</b> have stated that brushing teeth is boring, annoying or a waste of time. Poor toothbrushing not only leads to discussions among parents and children, it also leads to frightening and painful dentist appointments and increased treatment costs. That’s why we came up with Playbrush, a simple technology solution to encourage children and teach them about proper oral hygiene. Out technology consists of both hardware and software. The hardware attaches to almost any conventional manual toothbrush via its elastic head. While the child is brushing it detects the brushing behavior and sends it in real-time via Bluetooth LE to a smartphone or tablet. On this device the data is processed and translated into unique simple games, which react to the users brushing. Using these games we help children to brush more regularly, longer and more accurately. We are supported by UCL, the Eastman Dental Hospital and various renowned dentists in the UK and Austria. So far we have tested Playbrush with over 300 children, who love what we do – and so do their parents and most dentists. Most of them enjoy brushing with Playbrush more than normal toothbrushing, and over 85 % were brushing for at least 2 min. We could even convert a lot of our early testers to Kickstarter backers last May, when we raised GBP 40 k (pre-orders) from our supporters without any marketing budget. Playbrush has been recognized by media outlets all over the world, including the Guardian, the FT, ITV, Pro 7, Focus and many more. In addition we were invited as speakers to the Royal Society of Medicine, the World Gamification Meetup, UCL and Advantage Austria. We now closed our Seed Round and are starting our first production batch to deliver and sell first products just before Christmas. We strongly believe that toothbrushing is fundamentally broken and it needs a shift in education, motivation and behavior to encourage children to focus more on their oral hygiene. Via games we are able to foster intrinsic motivation and build a positive atmosphere around dental health.

A property tester is given an oracle access to a function f and a proximity parameter ɛ, {{and it has to}} distinguish, with high probability, functions that have the property from functions that differ on at least an ɛ fraction of values from every function with the property. The Lipschitz property was first studied by Jha and Raskhodnikova (FOCS’ 11) who motivated it by applications to data privacy and program verification. They presented efficient testers for the Lipschitz property of functions on the domains { 0, 1 } d and [n]. <b>Our</b> <b>tester</b> for functions on the more general domain [n] d runs in time O(d 1. 5 n log n) for constant ɛ and δ.

40|$|The {{refrigeration}} and {{air conditioning}} industry has expressed {{a great interest in}} the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) as a refrigerant. CO 2 is anticipated to replace HFC refrigerants, which are known to {{have a negative effect on}} the environment. The reason behind the interest in CO 2 is the fact that it is a natural refrigerant, thus environmentally acceptable. Of course, such a replacement raises concerns regarding design criteria and performance due to the different thermodynamic properties of CO 2 and the very different range of pressures required for the CO 2 refrigeration cycle. So far, work related to CO 2 has been done from a thermodynamics point of view and researchers have made significant progress developing automotive and portable air-conditioning systems that use the environmentally friendly carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. The purpose of this work is to develop an understanding of how CO 2 plays a role from a tribology standpoint. More specifically, the goal of this work is to gain an understanding on how CO 2 influences friction, lubrication, wear and scuffing of tribological pairs used in compressors. Work in the area of tribology related to CO 2 is very limited. Preliminary work by Cusano and coworkers showed that consistent data for tests using CO 2 could not be acquired nor could a satisfactory explanation be offered for the inconsistency. Their results triggered the initiation of the work presented here. In this first attempt to understand the tribological behavior of CO 2 several problems were encountered. During this work we noted that its behavior, unlike conventional refrigerants, could not always be predicted. We believe that this can be attributed to the thermodynamic properties of CO 2, which cannot be ignored when studying its tribological behavior. Thermodynamic Properties such as miscibility are very important when tribological testing is performed. A limiting factor with <b>our</b> <b>tester</b> was that it was not designed for CO 2 testing, but for other conventional refrigerants and therefore made previously developed testing protocols non-applicable with CO 2.

This is the prototypical hypothesis testing problem that has received significant attention in statistics and, more recently, in theoretical computer science. The sample complexity of this general inference task depends on the underlying family P.

We provide a simple application of this tester for streaming testing special cases of instances of VPL that are already hard for both streaming algorithms and property <b>testers.</b> <b>Our</b> main algorithm is a combination of an original simulation of visibly pushdown automata using a stack with small height but possible items of linear size. In a second step, those items are replaced by small sketches. Those sketches relies on a notion of suffix-sampling we introduce. This sampling is the key idea connecting <b>our</b> streaming <b>tester</b> algorithm to property testers. ∗Partially supported by the French ANR projects ANR- 12 -BS 02 - 005 (RDAM) and ANR- 14 -CE 25 - 0017 (AGREG...|$|R

40|$|We {{described}} previously {{a simple}} test on petri plates for detecting chemical carcinogens as mutagens, using an especially sensitive set of bacterial strains to detect mutagenic acitivty and a mammalian liver extract for carcinogen activity. We now extend {{the utility of}} the method by introducing two new bacterial strains which can detect with great sensitivity many carcinogens which we did not detect before or detected with less sensitivity. Among these carcinogens are aflatoxin B- 1, sterigmatocystin, benzyl chloride, benzo[a]-pyrene, 7, 12 -dimethylbenzanthracene, 1 '-acetoxysafrole, and the nitrofuran food additive furylfuramide (AF- 2). The new strains TA 100 and TA 98 contain an R factor plasmid, pKM 101, in <b>our</b> standard <b>tester</b> strains TA 1535 and TA 1538. The R factor increases mutagenesis with certain mutagens, but not others. We present evidence that the mutagens that become more effective work through an error-prone recombinational repair...|$|R
