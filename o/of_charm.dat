5|$|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were {{determined}} that their eldest son {{should have an}} education that would prepare {{him to be a}} model constitutional monarch. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister Victoria, Edward did not excel in his studies. He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those <b>of</b> <b>charm,</b> sociability and tact—Benjamin Disraeli described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner. After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, Robert Bruce.|$|E

25|$|Although isospin {{symmetry}} is very slightly broken, SU(3) symmetry is more badly broken, due to {{the much}} higher mass of the strange quark compared to the up and down. The discovery <b>of</b> <b>charm,</b> bottomness and topness could lead to further expansions up to SU(6) flavour symmetry, but the very large masses of these quarks make such symmetries almost useless. In modern applications, such as lattice QCD, isospin symmetry is often treated as exact while the heavier quarks must be treated separately.|$|E
25|$|Ellington led the {{orchestra}} by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section. As a bandleader, Ellington {{was not a}} strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra with a combination <b>of</b> <b>charm,</b> humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself.|$|E
25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer {{who likes}} to {{think of himself as}} a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than a}} wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full <b>of</b> <b>charm,</b> but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.|$|E

500|$|Grisi and Petipa {{were great}} successes as the tragic lovers. Gautier praised their {{performance}} in Act II, writing {{that the two}} dancers made the act [...] "a real poem, a choreographic elegy full <b>of</b> <b>charm</b> and tenderness ... More than one eye that thought it was seeing only [...] {{was surprised to find}} its vision obscured by a tearsomething that does not often happen in a ballet ...

Grant's body was taken back to California, where it was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Pacific Ocean. He refused a funeral, which Roderick Mann remarked was appropriate for [...] "the private man who didn't want the nonsense of a funeral". The bulk of his estate, worth in the region of 60 to 80 million dollars, went to his wife Barbara Harris and his daughter Jennifer Grant.|$|E
500|$|During World WarII in Japanese culture, it was {{a popular}} custom for friends, classmates, and {{relatives}} of a deploying soldier to sign a Hinomaru and present it to him.

One term for this kind <b>of</b> <b>charm</b> is [...] One tradition is that no writing should touch the sun disc. After battles, these flags were often captured or later found on deceased Japanese soldiers. While these flags became souvenirs, {{there has been a}} growing trend of sending the signed flags back to the descendants of the soldier.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{described}} the game's ambiance as cheery and full <b>of</b> <b>charm.</b> David Sanchez of GameZone thought the game's self-awareness added to its charm, where the player learned through the game's poking lighthearted fun. He {{added that the}} music was an [...] "absolute delight" [...] and complimented its range from space sounds to themes to [...] "bizarre" [...] battle tracks that varied with the enemy type. GamesTM wrote that the game's reputation comes from the [...] "consistent ... visual language" [...] in its Charles M. Schulz-esque character and world design. Kotaku Jason Schreier found the ending unsatisfying and unrelieving, despite finding the ending credits with its character curtain call and photo album of [...] "fuzzy pickles" [...] moments all [...] "wonderful".|$|E

500|$|In its {{review of}} the {{original}} version, Japanese magazine Famitsu praised the game's tone and story, with one reviewer noting its focus on visual aesthetics, although another noted the [...] "mismatch" [...] between the game's light tone and darker themes. Speaking about the PS2 original in a feature about Goichi Suda, Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com positively noted the use of music for setting the mood and capturing that atmosphere, and referred to the title as a notable step towards the studio's more successful future titles. Speaking about the graphics, he negatively compared {{to those of the}} Nintendo 64, saying they undermined the experience. For the DS port, Famitsu held many of the same opinions, comparing it positively to Suda's other works and noting its combination <b>of</b> <b>charm</b> and weirdness, although one reviewer was disappointed that it was the same game as the original.|$|E
500|$|After marrying actress Jennifer Garner in 2005, and {{welcoming}} their first child, Affleck began a career comeback in 2006. Following {{a starring role}} in the little-seen Man About Town and a minor role in the crime drama Smokin' Aces, Affleck won acclaim for his performance as George Reeves in the noir biopic Hollywoodland. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised [...] "an award-caliber performance ... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor some of us had prematurely written off." [...] Geoffrey Macnab of The Guardian said he [...] "beautifully" [...] captured [...] "the character's curious mix <b>of</b> <b>charm,</b> vulnerability and fatalism". He was awarded the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival and {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor. Also in 2006, he made a cameo in Smith's Clerks II. Although they remain fans of each other's work, Affleck and Smith have had little contact since the making of Clerks II.|$|E
500|$|Today, many {{professional}} repertory companies, small opera companies, amateur societies, churches, {{schools and}} universities continue to produce the works. The most popular G works also continue to be performed {{from time to time}} by major opera companies, and professional recordings of the operas, and albums of songs from the operas, continue to be released. Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has been held every August in England, with some two dozen or more performances of the operas given on the main stage, and several dozen related [...] "fringe" [...] events given in smaller venues. The Festival sells both professional and amateur videos of its most popular productions. In connection with the 2009 festival, a contemporary critic wrote, [...] "The appeal of G special blend <b>of</b> <b>charm,</b> silliness and gentle satire seems immune to fashion." [...] There continue to be hundreds of amateur companies performing the Gilbert and Sullivan works worldwide.|$|E
