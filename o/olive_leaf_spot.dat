50|$|Spilocaea oleaginea is a deuteromycete fungal plant pathogen, {{the cause}} of the disease olive peacock spot, also known as <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> and bird's eye spot. This plant disease {{commonly}} affects the leaves of olive trees worldwide. The disease affects trees throughout the growing season and can cause significant losses in yield. The disease causes blemishes on the fruit, delays ripening, and reduces the yield of oil. Defoliation and in severe cases, twig death, can occur, and the disease can have long-term health effects on the trees.|$|E
5000|$|Bishmizzine {{rests in}} the middle of the Koura plain, {{probably}} one of the largest uninterrupted olive groves in the world. It is bordered by hills and thus winter rain flows in water ways down to the town. The village rests on a large aquifer and this underground water body partially explains the extremes in climate when compared to neighbouring villages. For example, thin ice develops overnight in winter while it does not in neighbouring villages. At night the temperature may differ by 5 to 7 degrees C lower than the nearby adjacent surrounding hills or neighboring villages. Another factor that may play a role in explaining this climate conundrum is the fact that Bishmizzine {{rests in the}} plain at the base of the Western Lebanese Range of mountains and is surrounded by hills which act to trap any cold air that may flow by convection down the range from as high up as the Cedars of Lebanon in Bcharre. Hence there was a climatology station for the government in the village that utilized the temperature of the plain at 4 to 5 am before sunrise in an equation to arbitrarily calculate the temperature at the top of the mountain range. In the old days this environmental phenomena was counteracted by a pine forest that used to blockade the cold night air advancing down the mountain slopes towards the town. Remnants of this pine forest remain to this day and act as a picnic zone visited by many. The argylls soil in Bishmizzine has been sought after by cement factories that find its characteristics favorable for quality cement production. This has been a blessing and a curse at the same time. The blessing is obviously financial for the land owner and jobs created in the nearby cement factories however the environmental impact has been catastrophic. Huge deep excavation areas emptied of soil remained after the removal of the soil. These areas then filled up with rain water during the winter and resulted in a swamp/wetland like environment with rising humidity. The damp environment as well as soil erosion have rendered the surrounding area susceptible to fungal diseases ex <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> or peacock eye spot Spilocea oleaginea [...] which infested initially the area around the excavations and then spread to involve the surrounding olive fields rendering the once productive olive groves unproductive. This disease now infests olives in an area up to 4 km away from the epicenter. Noteworthy is the recent natural transformation of these excavation sites from a swamp to a wetland habitat with flora and fauna uncharacteristic of Lebanon. This transformation has recently stopped soil erosion and stabilized the habitat. Also this phenomenon has become a source of inquiry for botanists curious as to where some of the atypical flora came from ex. reeds characteristic of the Nile or Danube. Since Bishmizzine lies on the route of migratory birds some experts have postulated that the water holes became a rest area for migrating birds ex storks and hence the seeds were carried in their feathers from distant areas. The disease burden of fungal olive disease peacock eye remains high however and a concerted effort by farmers, government and NGOs is needed. A large area of Bishmizzine remains free of fungal disease and produces some of the best extra virgin olive oil and table olives in the area.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe ethnobotanical uses of wild olive, O. europaea subsp. africana (sometimes {{referred}} to as subsp. cuspidata) in southern Africa and {{in other parts of}} Africa are reviewed. Chromatographic analyses of secoiridoids (oleuropein and other oleuropeosides) in 25 wild <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> samples from 10 localities in South Africa showed substantial amounts of oleuropein (up to 110 mg/g dry weight) and not trace amounts as reported in the literature. Oleuropein is the main active compound in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf,</b> with demonstrated anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, hypolipidemic and hypotensive activities. A comparison with nine cultivated <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> samples (subsp. europaea) from six cultivars and two localities showed that commercial <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> can be distinguished by the presence of verbascoside, which is absent in wild olive.

40|$|Background Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown a reduced {{incidence}} of cardiovascular disease in the Mediterranean population attributed to the consumption of dietary olive oil rich in antioxidants. This has lead to increased interest in the antioxidant properties of other phenolic compounds of olive tree products. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract may also have health benefits due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Antioxidants can prevent the effects of oxidative metabolism by scavenging free radicals and decreasing the hyperactivity of platelets associated with the development of occlusive thrombosis. No studies to date have investigated the effects of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract on platelet function to our knowledge. Improved understanding of the antioxidant properties of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract and its effect on platelet function could lead to improved cardiovascular health. Objective The current study used an <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract prepared from the Olea europaea L. tree. The aim was to determine if polyphenols in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract would reduce platelet activity and, to establish an optimal dose in vitro that would reduce platelet aggregation and ATP release. Design Eleven subjects with normal platelet counts (150 – 400 x 109 /L) were recruited for the current in vitro study. <b>Olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract was added to citrated whole blood to obtain five concentrations ranging from 5. 4 ug/mL to 54. 0 ug/mL for a dose response curve. Baseline samples, without <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract were used as a negative control for each subject. After 2 hours incubation with <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract samples were analyzed for platelet aggregation and ATP release from platelets stimulated by the addition of collagen. Results Whole blood analysis (n= 11) showed a clear dose-dependant reduction in platelet aggregation with the increasing <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract concentrations (p< 0. 0001). There was also a similar decrease in ATP release from collagen stimulated platelets (p= 0. 02).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{establishment}} of olive (Olea europaea) orchards in Brazil is increasing {{due to their}} economic potential and benefits to human health. However, a number of limiting factors need to be overcome, such as <b>Olive</b> <b>Leaf</b> <b>Spot</b> (OLS) occurrence, for olives to reach their full potential. OLS, which is caused by Fusicladium oleaginum, results in defoliation {{and a reduction in}} fruit production. This study aimed to develop a standard area diagram set (SAD) for the assessment of OLS severity under humid subtropical climate conditions. The SAD was developed with six levels of severity (1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 %) and OLS severity was validated by eight inexperienced raters. Using the SAD provided an increase in accuracy, precision and concordance, while also reducing the smallest difference detectable. The proposed SAD was adequate at estimating the OLS and could be a useful tool for use in epidemiological and phytopathometry studies, evaluation of control strategies and selection of resistant genotypes...|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{research}} was to improve the understanding of the environmental factors affecting development of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (OLS) in New Zealand olive groves and to develop strategies for the disease management. The effects of temperature, relative humidity (RR), leaf wetness and leaf age on conidium germination were investigated for Spilocaea oieagina, the causal organism of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot.</b> Detached leaves of five leaf ages (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks after emergence), six different temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C), eight wetness periods (0, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h), and three RR levels (60, 80 and 100 %) were tested. Results showed that percentage germination decreased linearly in proportion to leaf age (P< 0. 00 1). Temperature significantly (P< 0. 001) affected conidium germination, with the effective range being 5 to 25 °C and the optimum being 20 °C. The rate of germ tube elongation followed a similar trend, with the optimum being 15 °C. Formation of appressoria, when found, occurred 6 h after the first signs of germination and their frequency followed the same temperature trends with a maximum of 43 % at 15 °C and none formed at 25 °C. The minimum leaf wetness periods for germination at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C were 24, 12, 9, 9, and 12 h, respectively. Studies on the prepenetration and infection processes on olive leaves by S. oieagina, using scanning electron microscopy, showed that the penetration pegs allowed direct penetration of the cuticle, but could not penetrate the host through the trichomes. A study of the effects of temperature, leaf age, conidial concentration, continuous and interrupted leaf wetness periods and relative humidity (RR) during the dry periods on whole plants showed that OLS severity decreased (P< 0. 001) with increasing leaf age at the time of inoculation. The severity of OLS also increased as inoculum concentration increased from 1. 0 X 102 to 2. 5 X 105 conidia per mL at all five temperatures (5 - 25 °C), with most lesions formed at 15 °C and least at 25 °C. The minimum leaf wetness periods for infection at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C were 18, 12, 12, 12, and 24 h, respectively. Infection frequencies during wet periods interrupted with dry periods of 70 and 100 % RH depended on the RH and length of the dry period and the length of the initial wet period, with the lowest OLS severity after 12 h wetness and 12 h at 70 % RH. Sporulation on <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> lesions followed similar trends over the same temperatures and moisture conditions, with maximum sporulation at 15 °C and 100 % RH but none at 25 °C and 70 % RH. Lesion expansion was affected (P< 0. 001) by the same conditions, with 15 °C and continuous wetness being optimum and very little expansion occurring at 25 °C. Sequence analysis of rDNA (lTSl- 5. 8 S-ITS 2), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and universally primed-polymerase chain reaction (UP-PCR) techniques were used to study the genetic structure of S. oleagina populations using 98 isolates from New Zealand olive groves along with one isolate each from Australia and Italy. Alignment of the cloned sequences of four New Zealand isolates with the isolates from Australia and Italy showed great similarity with similarity indices for ITS 1, ITS 2 and 5. 8 S coding regions of the isolates being 96 - 100, 99. 8 - 100 and 99 - 100 %, respectively. RFLP analysis revealed no differences between the New Zealand isolates but UP-PCR found low levels of gene and genotypic diversity in all populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed small but significant (P = 0. 001) variations among regions, and most of the molecular variability (87 %) was found within populations. Greenhouse studies of the fungicides, boscalid, captan, carbendazim, copper hydroxide, copper sulphate, difenoconazole, dodine, kresoxim-methyl, and a kresoxim-methyllcopper hydroxide mixture, showed that all significantly (P< 0. 001) reduced OLS severity, with highest efficacy when applied up to 3 days pre- and 3 days post-inoculation. In field trials, most of the fungicides reduced disease incidence when applied twice in spring and autumn. Of the fungicides tested, copper sulphate and a mixture of kresoxim-methyl/copper hydroxide were the most effective, reducing disease severity by 85 to 96 % and 63 to 93 %, respectively. This research has provided three models relating climatic parameters to OLS development that focus on conidium germination, infection and sporulation models which should be field-tested with the more promising fungicides. They could then be incorporated into a disease forecasting system, which may be used in conjunction with a spray schedule that could improve disease control for New Zealand growers by optimising the number and timing of fungicide applications...|$|E
40|$|Pesticide {{applications}} are {{still one of}} the most common control methods against the main olive grove pests and diseases: the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), the olive moth, Prays oleae (Bernard), the black scale, Saissetia oleae (Olivier), and the <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot,</b> caused by the fungus Spilocaea oleagina Fries. However, and because the new pesticide legislation is aimed at an integrated pest and disease management, it is still important to evaluate and to know the ecotoxicology of pesticides on the natural enemies of the different agrosystems. A part of this work has been focusses on evaluating the direct and indirect effects of kaolin particle films and two copper-based products (Bordeaux mixture and copper oxychloride) through different laboratory, extended laboratory and semi-field experiments. Two natural enemies have been chosen: Psyttalia concolor (Szèpligeti), a parasitoid of the olive fruit fly, and Chilocorus nigritus (F.), predator of Diaspididae. This predator has been used instead of C. bipustulatus (L.), which is the species found in olive orchards. Kaolin mainly acts as a repellent of insects and/or as an oviposition deterrent. It is used in olive groves to control the olive fruit fly and the olive moth. Copper is applied against fungal and bacterial diseases. In olive groves it is used against the <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> and other diseases. No statistical differences were found in any of the experiments performed, compared to the controls, except when the oral toxicity of the products was evaluated on P. concolor females. In this case, kaolin and copper oxychloride caused a higher mortality 72 hours after the treatments, and both kaolin and the two copper formulations decreased females’ life span. Reproductive parameters were only negatively affected when kaolin was ingested. Apart from these experiments, due to the uncommon mode of action of kaolin, two extra experiments were carried out: a dual choice and a no-choice experiment. In this case, both P. concolor females and C. nigritus adults showed a clear preference for the untreated surfaces when they had the possibility of choosing between a treated surface and an untreated one. When there was no choice, no statistical differences were found between the treatments and the controls. Furthermore, the efficacy and the selectivity of three insect growth regulators (methoxyfenozide, tebufenozide and RH- 5849) on B. oleae and P. concolor, respectively, have also been evaluated. In addition to laboratory experiments to evaluate the toxicity of the insecticides, also molecular approaches were used. RNA of both insects was isolated. cDNA was subsequently synthesized and the complete sequences of the ligand biding domain (LBD) of the ecdysone receptor of each insect were then determined. Afterwards the three dimensional structures of both LBDs were constructed. Finally, the docking of the insecticide molecules in the cavity delineated by the 12 α-helix that composed the LBD was performed. Both toxicity assays and molecular docking approaches showed that either methoxyfenozide or tebufenozide had no negative effects nor on B. oleae nor on P. concolor. In contrast, RH- 5849 had no deleterious effect to the parasitoid but decreased olive fruit fly adults’ life span, especially when they were in contact with the fresh residue of the insecticide applied on a glass surface. The docking study of RH- 5849 molecule has shown a very light hindrance with the wall of the LBD pocket. This means that this molecule could more or less adjust in the cavity. Thus, searching of new insecticides for controlling the olive fruit fly could be based on the basic lead structure of RH- 5849 molecule...|$|E
40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (OLS) {{caused by}} Fusicladium oleagineum, {{is one of}} the major fungal {{diseases}} affecting olive orchards in South Africa and worldwide. Fungicides (copper containing sprays) successfully control OLS, when disease risk is low, but heavy infestation impairs effectiveness of chemical control and could lead to severe yield loss. Regular chemical treatment may prevent disease build-up in the orchard, but with cost and chemical residue implications. This study was aimed at evaluating commercial olive cultivars (‘Mission’; ‘Manzanilla de Seville’; ‘Frantoio’; ‘Nandi’; ‘Nocellara del Belice’; ‘Coratina’; ‘Barouni’ and ‘Leccino’) for resistance against OLS. A growth chamber trial was conducted at Bien Donne experimental farm of the Agricultural Research Council. Only one temperature treatment (16 °C) was applied during inoculation, while a relative humidity of above 80 % was maintained. Plants were kept for 48 hours at 99 % RH after inoculation and then moved to a shade net area for disease development at a temperature of 25 ± 5 °C. The results were used for categorising the eight olive cultivars evaluated in this study according to their OLS susceptibility. ‘Frantoio’ was categorised as highly tolerant, while ‘Nandi’ and ‘Leccino’ were found to be moderately tolerant and ‘Nocellara del Belice’ fairly tolerant. ‘Coratina’ was found to be the most susceptible cultivar. ‘Mission’ and ‘Manzanilla de Seville’ were found to be fairly susceptible. The findings of this study provide a basis for preliminary recommendations of OLS tolerant cultivars and selections for commercial olive production, as well as for further evaluation of OLS tolerance of olive cultivars and selections both in a controlled environment (glasshouse/ growth chamber), and under field conditions. As the results of this study were obtained over one season only (2011 / 12), it is recommended that the evaluation of OLS tolerance of the eight cultivars included in this study should be repeated both under controlled conditions, as well as under field conditions in the major olive production regions of South Africa, to verify the preliminary results.

40|$|A chitosan-based {{hydrophilic}} system containing an <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract {{was designed}} and its antioxidant capacity was evaluated. Encapsulation of <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract in chitosan microspheres {{was carried out by}} a spray-drying process. The particles obtained with this technique were found to be spherical and had a positive surface charge, which is an indicator of mucoadhesiveness. FTIR and X-ray diffraction results showed that there are not specific interactions of polyphenolic compounds in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract with the chitosan matrix. Stability and release studies of chitosan microspheres loaded with <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract before and after the incorporation into a moisturizer base were performed. The resulting data showed that the developed formulations were stable up to three months. The encapsulation efficiency was around 44 % and the release properties of polyphenols from the microspheres were found to be pH dependent. At pH 7. 4, polyphenols release was complete after 6 h; whereas the amount of polyphenols released was 40 % after the same time at pH 5. 5...|$|R
40|$|Background : Administration of Gentamicin is {{restricted}} {{due to its}} nephrotoxicity. Many {{studies have demonstrated that}} free radicals induced Gentamicin- nephrotoxicity. <b>Olive</b> <b>leaf</b> contains some antioxidant biophenols such as Oleuropin. In this study {{for the first time the}} effect of hydroalcohlic <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract on Gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity was investigated. Materials and Methods: 35 male Sprague-Dowley rates were randomly divided into five groups. The first group served as a control and injected with the normal saline. Nephrotoxicity induced by Gentamicin (100 mg/kg) in experimental groups for 12 days. Three groups were treated with hydroalcohlic <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg respectively). The rats were killed on the twelfth day. Plasma Malondialdehyde (MDA) and creatinine concentrations were measured. Kidney sections were prepared and stained with PAS method for histopathological studies. Results: hydroalcohlic <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/d significantly reduced gentamicin-induced tubular necrosis (p< 0. 05) and inhibited decreases of proximal tubule volume density (p< 0. 05). hydroalcohlic <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract at 50 and 100 mg/kg/d significantly reduced lymphocyte infiltration in comparison with Gentamicin administrated rats (p< 0. 05). Gentamicin increased level of MDA. Treatment with extract (100 mg/kg/d), significantly reduced level of MDA compared with other groups (p< 0. 05). Use of extract at 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/d significantly inhibited increase of serum creatinine (p< 0. 001). Treatment with extract (50 mg/kg/d), significantly inhibited increase of serum urea (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Hydroaleohlic <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extract can reduce Gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity and this effect is probably depends on antioxidant properties of this extract...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in viable cell {{numbers and the}} production of Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) by Bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus -both of human intestinal origin-were measured over 16 h at 37 o C in reconstituted skim-milk (100 g L - 1) and skim-milk with one of three <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extracts (water, ethanolic and methanolic extracts). The olive leaves were collected from a well known olive tree variety in Jordan (Nabali). All the three <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extracts increased cell counts over the control with no extracts and the final values for SCFA, especially acetic acid secreted by L. acidophilus (1. 84 gL - 1), were significantly higher than those observed in milk alone. The ethanolic extract of olive leaves showed highest effect on cell count and SCFA production for both bacterial species. It is proposed that the polyphenol compounds in <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extracts were responsible for the stimulation of probiotic bacteria growth and metabolism and that <b>olive</b> <b>leaf</b> extracts ingested in human diet might have the same effect on desirable components of the intestinal microflora. The results of the research will be used in functional food development and food preservation purposes. This research will create a market potential for a range of new health based food to maintain optimal human health.
