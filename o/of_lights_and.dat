5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kazuaki Kiriya. It opens with the camera traveling through a tunnel full <b>of</b> <b>lights,</b> <b>and</b> includes the song's title and Utada's name. For {{the first part of}} the song, it has Utada singing into a microphone, whilst walking inside the head of a spacecraft. The spacecraft exits the station, and flies all over a futuristic cityscape. The first verse has Utada as a hostess on the spacecraft, helping and serving the passengers in a dancing manner; the passengers are wearing theatrical clothing and headpieces that cover their faces. During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of her is walking through the woods, observing disfigured creatures. The chorus has Utada and the passengers marching across a bridge, while continuous intercut scenes of Utada outside a party is seen.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side. A window (shaped, like all the others in the church, like a star) set in mosaic is positioned above the door, and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building; in between them, there are patterns <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> coloured marble panels on the lower parts of the interior walls. The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall, built from masonry, underneath the church. The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011, when a carved crucifix, which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool, was also dedicated. The porch houses a sepulchral slab, dating from the latter half of the 13th century.|$|E

25|$|Santiago Zapotitlán {{was founded}} in 1435. After the Aztecs conquered the area, they rearranged the layout of this town. After the Spanish conquest, the Inmaculada Concepción church was {{established}} in 1541 and rebuilt in 1939. Its founding is celebrated on December 8 of each year. Santiago Zapotitlán is noted for its religious and cultural traditions with both pre Hispanic and Spanish roots. One of its main celebrations is the La Fiesta de Luces y Música (Festival <b>of</b> <b>Lights</b> <b>and</b> Music) {{which is based on}} the New Fire ceremony. Today it is celebrated with traditional dances and fireworks along with music played on both indigenous and European instruments.|$|E
25|$|In this litany seven processions, of clergy, laymen, monks, nuns, matrons, the poor, and {{children}} respectively, starting from seven different churches, proceeding to hear mass at St. Maria Maggiore. This litany {{has often been}} confused with the litania major, introduced at Rome in 598 (vide supra), but is quite distinct from it. Funeral processions, accompanied with singing and the carrying of lighted tapers, were very early customary (see ceremonial use <b>of</b> <b>lights),</b> <b>and</b> akin to these, also very early, were the processions connected with the translation of the relics of martyrs from their original burying place to the church where {{they were to be}} enshrined. From the time of the emperor Constantine I these processions were of great magnificence.|$|E
25|$|In January 1975, {{the band}} {{left for a}} world tour with each member in Zandra Rhodes-created costumes and {{accompanied}} with banks <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> effects. They toured the US as headliners, and played in Canada for the first time, after that they played in seven cities of Japan from mid-April {{to the start of}} May. In September, after an acrimonious split with Trident, the band negotiated themselves out of their Trident Studios contract and searched for new management. One of the options they considered was an offer from Led Zeppelin's manager, Peter Grant. Grant wanted them to sign with Led Zeppelin's own production company, Swan Song Records. The band found the contract unacceptable and instead contacted Elton John's manager, John Reid, who accepted the position.|$|E
40|$|Can {{we see in}} {{the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> <b>and</b> hear in the absence of sound?

In this paper, I defend the view that we see nothing in darkness, hear nothing in silence, and that experiencing the absence <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> sound is an affective, and not perceptual, matter...|$|R

25|$|Two basic {{types of}} {{entrapment}} are significant hazards for scuba divers: Inability to navigate {{out of an}} enclosed space, and physical entrapment which prevents the diver from leaving a location. The first case can usually be avoided by staying out of enclosed spaces, and when {{the objective of the}} dive includes penetration of enclosed spaces, taking precautions such as the use <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> <b>and</b> guidelines. The most common form of physical entrapment is getting snagged on ropes, lines or nets, and use of a cutting implement is the standard method of dealing with the problem. The risk of entanglement can be reduced by careful configuration of equipment to minimise those parts which can easily be snagged, and allow easier disentanglement. Other forms of entrapment such as getting wedged into tight spaces can often be avoided, but must otherwise be dealt with as they happen. The assistance of a buddy may be helpful where possible.|$|E

[...] This is followed by another letter addressed to the Puritan leaders in Massachusetts. [...] The largest part of the book is devoted to Clarke's beliefs on conducting a church and why he thought that the Massachusetts churches were proceeding in the wrong direction. [...] Less than half of the book concerns the persecution that Clarke and his companions experienced {{at the hands of the}} Massachusetts authorities. [...] He wrote, [...] "it is not the will of the Lord that any one should have dominion over another man's conscience….
