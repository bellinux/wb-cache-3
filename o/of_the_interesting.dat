25|$|This gallery {{is devoted}} to the Indian people who live in South Florida today: the Seminole and Miccosukee. Interpretive panels address their history and their living traditions. Display cases feature many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> objects from the museum's collections, {{including}} patchwork clothing, woodwork, basketry, silverwork, and artifacts from early Seminole sites.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> {{exceptions}} {{include an}} attempt by then NSW Police Minister Michael Costa to shut down , a case in 2001 involving the US Secret Service that was eventually pleaded out, and {{an attempt by}} the FBI using the Australian Federal Police to censor a Victorian they alleged was posting threats to the US.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> coincidences {{of the war}} {{was that}} the Germans had already {{developed}} their own version of chaff under the code-name Düppel, and had tested it near Berlin and over the Baltic. However, Hermann Göring was worried that if they used Düppel over the UK, the RAF would quickly copy the concept and use it against them. As Bomber Command's fleet was rapidly growing, the results would likely be greatly in the RAF's favour. Learning from past mistakes when older material had leaked, Göring had most of the paperwork on Düppel destroyed.|$|E

25|$|In the {{succulent}} greenhouse {{a variety}} of succulents and other xerophytes can be found with most species indigenous to Southern Africa and Madagascar. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> plants on display include Myrothamnus flabellifolius (resurrection plant), Didierea madagascariensis (octopus tree), Adansonia digitata (baobab), Fockea edulis (kambro), Hoodia gordonii (ghaap), Aloidendron dichotomum (quiver tree), Sceletium tortuosum (kougoed), Welwitschia mirabilis, Frithia humilis (fairy elephant's feet) and Euphorbia louwii (named after dr. Wynand Louw). Some locally threatened plants such as Nananthus vittatus, (bushveld vygie), Aloe peglerae (red hot poker aloe), Euphorbia knobelii, Euphorbia perangusta and Lithops lesliei (living stones) are also on display.|$|E
25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> {{dynamics}} of conservation of this butterfly {{is associated with}} increased nitrogen through air pollution. Increased nitrogen increases the fertility of serpentine soils, soils naturally low in nitrogen. This increased fertility allows invasive plants to thrive and exclude the nectar sources that the Bay checkerspot needs. This is where moderate grazing brings help to the threatened checkerspot. In a large metapopulation south of San Jose, removal of cattle from grasslands that the butterfly inhabited led to {{a significant decrease in}} the butterfly population because grazing leads to a net export of nitrogen as the cattle are removed for slaughter after eating the plants of the grasslands. In this way, moderate grazing enhances the butterfly's chance for survival.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} Balthazar {{was an example}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> minor {{characters}} that imbue the Adventures, commenting that his [...] "down-at-heel garret speaks volumes of loneliness and semi-realised artistry." [...] He also opined that the diamond within the fetish was the clitoris of the Arumbaya, describing it as [...] "their pleasure, {{wrapped up in a}} fetish". He also thought that there was a homosexual subtext between Ramón and Alonso, believing that the scene in which a bullet was fired into Ramón's buttocks was symbolic of anal sex.|$|E

500|$|Political {{literature}} became Johnson's mainstay in the 1790s: {{he published}} 118 works, which amounted to 57% of his total political output. As Chard notes, [...] "hardly a year went by {{without at least}} one anti-war and one anti-slave trade publication from Johnson". In particular, Johnson published abolitionist works, such as minister and former slave-ship captain John Newton's Thoughts Upon the African Slave Trade (1788), Barbauld's Epistle to William Wilberforce (1791), and Captain John Gabriel Stedman's Narrative, of a Five Years' Expedition, Against the Revolted Negroes of Surinam (1796) (with illustrations by Blake). Most importantly he helped organize the publication <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Interesting</b> Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano (1789), the autobiography of former slave Olaudah Equiano.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> things for the concept for this video is that {{we knew we had}} to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes felt like they were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E
500|$|Sputnikmusic {{reviewer}} John Hanson {{called the}} album [...] "extremely repetitive, with many songs sounding exactly the same." [...] Calling {{more than half}} the album [...] "essentially the same song," [...] Hanson wrote: [...] "Despite all the shortcomings becoming far more apparent here, Where You Want To Be is still a tolerable, if very average and common, album." [...] According to Stylus Magazine reviewer Todd Burns, Taking Back Sunday [...] "smooth away all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> bits and only focus on what works immediately and viscerally," [...] providing [...] "cheap thrills and obvious answers." [...] Edna Gundersen of USA Today wrote that the group [...] "cobbled together a host of emo clichés" [...] to create a record that is [...] "miraculously, more winsome than generic." [...] Despite some [...] "bittersweet confessional" [...] songs which [...] "resort to tired teen-angst whines," [...] "an arresting tug-of-war between raw emotions and charged rhythms" [...] pushes the band beyond [...] "the everyday emo-rock ensemble." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} cold work lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E

2500|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> concepts, {{was when}} the {{designers}} took the H-18 and fitted two large downward facing propellers (i.e. on under each wing at midpoint) driven by a small engine mounted in the fuselage. It was claimed that this conversion resulted in an aircraft that could take off {{in a very short}} distance. [...] Very little else is known about the conversion of an H.18 to this mode.|$|E

This gives the chord its special [...] "wavy" [...] and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a [...] "virtual pull-off".|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> features of the crater is its squared-off outline, believed to be caused by existing regional jointing (cracks) in the strata at the impact site.|$|E
2500|$|Let GL(n;C) {{denote the}} group of [...] {{invertible}} matrices with entries in C. Any closed subgroup of GL(n,C) is a Lie group; Lie groups of this sort are called matrix Lie groups. Since most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> examples of Lie groups can be realized as matrix Lie groups, some textbooks restrict attention to this class, including those of Hall and Rossmann. Restricting attention to matrix Lie groups simplifies {{the definition of the}} Lie algebra and the exponential map. The following are standard examples of matrix Lie groups.|$|E
