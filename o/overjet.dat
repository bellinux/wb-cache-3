25|$|Maxillary prognathism is a {{protrusion}} of the maxilla, and is {{a common}} feature in Sub Saharan Africans. Prognathism is less prevalent in East Asians and Caucasians. It {{is not to be}} confused with micrognathism, although combinations of both may be found. It affects the middle third of the face, causing it to jut out, thereby increasing the facial area, similar in phenotype of archaic hominids and apes. Mandibular prognathism is a protrusion of the mandible, affecting the lower third of the face. Alveolar prognathism is a protrusion of that portion of the maxilla where the teeth are located, in the dental lining of the upper jaw. Prognathism can also be used to describe ways that the maxillary and mandibular dental arches relate to one another, including malocclusion (where the upper and lower teeth do not align). When there is maxillary and/or alveolar prognathism which causes an alignment of the maxillary incisors significantly anterior to the lower teeth, the condition is called an <b>overjet.</b> When the reverse is the case, and the lower jaw extends forward beyond the upper, the condition is referred to as retrognathia (reverse <b>overjet).</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Overjet</b> is {{the extent}} of {{horizontal}} (anterior-posterior) overlap of the maxillary central incisors over the mandibular central incisors. In class II (division I) malocclusion the <b>overjet</b> is increased as the maxillary central incisors are protruded.|$|E

50|$|Ballard {{described}} {{a method for}} studying the jaw relationship in the Antero-Posterior direction in 1951. This method used the axial inclination of the incisor teeth to study the relationship. This method removes any influence of soft tissues and dental compensation and permits an adjustment to the inclination of the maxillary and mandibular incisors to their normal value in respect to maxillary and mandibular planes. This method uses incisor <b>overjet</b> as the indicator of the relative position of the maxilla to the mandible. Thus the <b>overjet</b> describes the skeletal discrepancy.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the wagon}} bed is narrow, many {{families}} would construct an “overjet” for additional space. An <b>overjet</b> {{is created by}} nailing boards or planks {{on top of the}} wagon bed that extend out over the wheels. This would create space to place mattresses for sleeping on either sides of the bed. Additional bows would be inserted to stretch the canvas to cover the <b>overjet</b> and keep the weather out. The area under the planks in the wagon bed could be used for storage. Homesteading prairie families would use the wagons as temporary accommodations until they could build more permanent housing.|$|E

50|$|Elastic {{bands are}} used to apply {{pressure}} to the bow or hooks which is then transferred to the patients teeth and jaw. Its purpose is to slow or stop the upper jaw from growing, thereby preventing or correcting an <b>overjet.</b> Other forms of headgear treat reverse overjets, in which the top jaw is not forward enough. It {{is similar to a}} facemask, also attached to braces, and encourages forward growth of the upper jaw.|$|E
50|$|Headgear is most {{commonly}} used to correct anteroposterior discrepancies. The headgear attaches to the braces via metal hooks or a facebow. Straps or a head cap anchor the headgear {{to the back of}} the head or neck. In some situations, both are used. Elastic bands are used to apply pressure to the bow or hooks. Its purpose is to slow or stop the upper jaw from growing, thereby preventing or correcting an <b>overjet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Class III: Mesiocclusion (prognathism, Anterior crossbite, {{negative}} <b>overjet,</b> underbite) In {{this case}} the upper molars are placed not in the mesiobuccal groove but posteriorly to it. The mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar lies posteriorly to the mesiobuccal groove of the mandibular first molar.

5000|$|Ravindra Nanda and Charles J. Burstone {{described}} {{three types}} of anchorages {{that are based on}} the need during a treatment where space closure is needed. In some orthodontic cases, teeth have to be removed in order to either relieve dental crowding or reduce a large <b>overjet</b> or overbite. Therefore, the space created after removing teeth is usually closed during an orthodontic treatment. A space can be closed by either moving back teeth forward or front teeth backward.|$|E

50|$|The {{characteristics}} of the syndrome are typically visible. The syndrome involves hypoplasia of variable severity of cartilaginous nasal septum and premaxilla. It includes complete total absence of the anterior nasal spine. There are also associated anomalies of muscle insertions of the upper lip and the nasal floor and of the cervical spine. Affected individuals typically have an unusually flat, underdeveloped midface (midfacial hypoplasia), with an abnormally short nose and flat nasal bridge. They have an underdeveloped upper jaw, relatively protruding lower jaw with anterior mandibular vertical excess and a Class III skeletal and dental (reverse <b>overjet)</b> profile. They have a small frontal sinus and global facial imbalance.|$|E
50|$|An {{anterior}} open bite {{occurs in}} humans when the front teeth fail to touch {{and there is}} no overlap between upper incisors and lower incisors. Anterior open can be caused by functional habits such as digit sucking, tongue thrust or long-term pacifier use. When digit sucking habit is present in the late primary to early mixed dentition stages, it can lead to different side-effects such as upper teeth flaring out, lower teeth flaring in, increase in the open bite and the <b>overjet.</b> A posterior crossbite in these children along with decrease in intercanine and intermolar width is also found. The more intense (longer) the habit, the worse the malocclusion may be.|$|E
5000|$|Dietz et al. {{recommended}} that to avoid tipping of molar teeth, a high pull headgear {{can be used}} in conjunction with this appliance. As the ACCO appliance will move the crown of molar distally, headgear will act to move the molar roots distally. In order to avoid loss of anchorage, they also recommended to achieve [...] "overcorrection" [...] of the molar distalization by 2mm or more. Anchorage loss occurs as anterior teeth move mesially, shown by 2mm increase in <b>overjet</b> and also 1st molars moving mesially. The authors also stated that presence of 2nd molars can exacerbate the loss of anchorage. Therefore, addition of finger springs can be added to the 2nd molars to move them distally also.|$|E

40|$|Objective : <b>Overjet</b> is a {{horizontal}} relationship between maxillary and mandibular incisors. Normal range from <b>overjet</b> is 2 - 4 mm. Increased <b>overjet</b> {{is marked by}} maxillary incisor’s protrusion. A 6 mm <b>overjet</b> will have impact on psychological and social relationship of children due to the aesthetics of the face profile. Increased <b>overjet</b> has relationship with Class II Angle malocclusion, Class II skeletal sagittal relationship, and mandibular retrognathia. Clinical problem caused by increased <b>overjet</b> in children are maxillary permanent incisors trauma in growing age, damaged periodontal tissue, lip incompetency, social impact such as {{lack of confidence in}} children, and also increased <b>overjet</b> has a close relationship with Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) sign and symptoms. Methods : Increased <b>overjet</b> case can be managed by maxillary retraction of labial segment and increasing mandibular labial segment. Case management are based on skeletal and soft tissue pattern and patient’s age. Reducing <b>overjet</b> can be based on using several appliances, such as functional removable appliance to modify dental and skeletal relationship, fixed orthodontic appliances with tipping and bodily movement or using jaw reposition by orthognathic surgery. Results : One of the effective appliance to reduce <b>overjet,</b> especially Class II malocclusion treatment is Twin Block Functional Appliances developed by Clark. Twin Block appliances is used for developing age children in certain time period to support mandibular growth. This appliance is easy to use, so the patient cooperativity can be maintained.

40|$|OBJECTIVE OF INVESTIGATION: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} anterior tooth relationship (overbite and <b>overjet)</b> according to the type of occlusion (canine guided, group function). METHODS: A total of 111 test subjects (56 men and 55 women, mean 23. 9 years of age) were examined, and it was determined that they have occlusional conception. The relationship of the front teeth in the position of maximum intercuspidation was evaluated by a portable meter. RESULTS: By analysing the obtained results of vertical <b>overjet</b> and horizontal overbite of the front teeth, we concluded that there was significant statistic difference in the amount of the vertical <b>overjet</b> with regard to occlusional conception (t= 6. 669, p= 0. 00001). Average value of the vertical <b>overjet</b> in examinees with occlusion lead by the canine was 2. 22 + 0. 09 mm, while in examinees with group function it was 1. 58 + 0. 26 mm. No significant statistical difference was found by analysing vertical <b>overjet</b> with regard to gender. No significant statistical difference between the groups was found by comparing the results of horizontal overbite of frontal teeth with regard to occlusional concepcion and gender.

40|$|Introduction : An {{important}} component of many orthodontic assessments is {{an evaluation of the}} horizontal relationship of the teeth and jaws. In this study, an attempt was made to assess the gender differences in the maxillary and mandibular morphology in different <b>overjet</b> groups. This is useful in analysis of malocclusion and prediction of treatment success. Materials and methods: Lateral cephalograms of a total 64 subjects were taken. The chronological ages of the subjects ranged from 18 to 24 years. The 64 subjects were {{selected on the basis of}} <b>overjet</b> and were divided into four groups according to <b>overjet</b> size. Finally, each <b>overjet</b> group consists of 16 subjects (eight males and eight females). Thirteen linear and one angular measurement were used to assess the maxillary and mandibular morphology. Results and conclusion: Analysis of variance shows that for males MxAABH (maxillary anterior alveolar and basal height), ANS-PNS (palatal length), Cd-Gn (mandibular length), RW (ramus width), and gonial angle were found statistically significant among <b>overjet</b> groups and in females MxAABH, MxAD (maxillary anterior depth), Cd-Gn, SD (symphysis depth) and RW were found significant among <b>overjet</b> groups. Correlations were found significant for both males and females in relation to Cd-Gn, RW and gonial angle parameters...|$|E

This shows us that more swimmers had close to ideal overjets. Statistical analysis revealed that the weighed mean was 2.6 mm in swimmers, while in non-swimmers it was 2.8 mm; there was also a significantly lower standard deviation in the swimmers (P < 0.05).|$|E
40|$|The aims were {{to compare}} {{clinical}} effectiveness, functional and social discomfort, explore and describe preadolescents’ experiences of treatment, {{and assess the}} COSTs of reducing large <b>overjet</b> with an Andresen Activator (AA) and a Prefabricated Functional Appliance (PFA). Subjects and methods: A multicentre, prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted with patients from 12 general dental practices. Ninety-seven patients with an Angle Class II, Division 1 malocclusion, and an <b>overjet</b> of ≥ 6 mm, were randomly allocated by lottery to treatment with either a PFA or an AA. The study was designed as intention to treat (ITT), and the endpoint of treatment was set to <b>overjet</b> ≤ 3 mm, followed by a 6 -month retention period. The PFA and AA group consisted of 57 (28 girls, 29 boys), and 40 subjects (16 girls, 24 boys), respectively, {{with a mean age}} of 10. 3 years. <b>Overjet,</b> overbite, lip seal, and sagittal molar relationships were recorded Before and at the end of treatment, and 1 -year post-treatment. One month and 6 -months after treatment start, a questionnaire addressing discomfort, perception of treatment need and outcome, was used. Individual interviews focusing on adolescents’ experiences of using a removable functional appliance were carried out with 21 adolescents. Direct costs and indirect costs were analysed with reference to ITT (intention-to-treat), successful, and unsuccessful outcomes. Societal costs were described as the total of direct and indirect costs, and did not include retreatments. Results: No difference in effectiveness could be shown between PFAs and AAs in correcting <b>overjet,</b> overbite, sagittal molar relationship, and lip seal. No difference in experienced functional and social discomfort after 6 months of appliance wear was seen between groups. Participants developed their own strategies of measurement for improvement. The results clearly show that in terms of cost-minimization, PFA is the preferred approach for reduction of large <b>overjet</b> in mixed dentition. Conclusions: PFAs are as effective as AAs in correcting <b>overjet,</b> overbite, sagittal molar relation, and lip seal. The success rate of treatment with both appliances is, however, low. Thus, the PFA, requiring lower costs, should be used for reduction of large <b>overjet</b> in mixed dentition. No difference could be seen between groups for the experience of functional or social discomfort after 6 months of appliance use. An active involvement of the preadolescents in treatment seems to be necessary, supported by the dentist in future appointments, using <b>overjet</b> measurement as a tool for motivation. Furthermore, efforts should be made by clinicians to listen and understand preadolescents’ needs and requirement before treatment start.

30|$|In this study, the net <b>overjet</b> {{correction}} with {{an average}} treatment time of 27.8  months was 4.7  mm. Heinig and Goz found a 4.7 -mm reduction in <b>overjet</b> with the Forsus Flat Spring (3 M Unitek) [[12]]. Karacay et al. found a 3.7 -mm reduction in net <b>overjet</b> with the Forsus NiTi Flat Spring relative to an untreated control group [[11]]. Jones et al. found a 3.2 -mm reduction in <b>overjet</b> with the Forsus FRD for 2.7  years of treatment, and the changes were similar to treatment with intermaxillary elastics with a 2.8 -mm reduction in <b>overjet</b> [[10]]. Franchi et al. reported a 5.5 -mm reduction in net <b>overjet</b> relative to an untreated control group [[13]]. These results are also similar to those reported on the Herbst appliance with a net <b>overjet</b> correction ranging from 2.7 to 5.2  mm [[21]-[25]]. The change in <b>overjet</b> was partially contributed by a restraint in the forward movement of the maxilla by 1.2  mm. Franchi et al. also reported a restraint in sagittal growth of 1.2  mm for ‘A’ point to Nasion perp [[13]]. Karacay et al. found a net posterior movement of ‘A’ point of 0.7  mm with the Forsus Flat Spring [[11]]. The slightly more posterior movement of the ‘A’ point {{in this study is}} probably due to the longer period of time that the Forsus FRD was left in place (average 9  months). This headgear effect has also been reported by fixed functional appliances such as the Herbst appliance [[21]-[25]], Jasper Jumper therapy [[26],[27]], and intermaxillary elastics [[10]]. The mandibular base contributed 0.7  mm for the change in <b>overjet</b> correction. Franchi et al. reported a 1.8 -mm increase in the total mandibular length (Co-Gn) with respect to untreated controls [[13]]. Karacay et al. found a net forward movement of the mandibular base of 1.0  mm relative to a control group with the Forsus NiTi Flat Spring [[11]]. Other studies with the Herbst appliance reported a greater forward movement in the mandibular base ranging from 0.9 to 4.5  mm [[2],[21],[22]]. However, a controlled clinical trial [[7]] following patients treated with FRD for 2.3  years after completion of comprehensive treatment showed no significant sagittal changes but mainly dentoalveolar changes [[14]].|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} retrospective, {{cross-sectional}} study was to assess whether mild and severe Class II division 1 subjects have craniofacial and upper airway characteristics, which relate to the severity of Class II as judged by <b>overjet</b> or ANB angle. The sample consisted of pre-treatment lateral cephalograms and dental casts of 131 males and 115 females (mean age 10. 4 ± 1. 6). Inclusion criteria were: healthy Caucasian subjects, at least &frac 34; Class II first molar relationship {{on both sides and}} <b>overjet</b> ≥ 4 mm. The cephalograms were traced and digitized. Distances and angular values were computed. Mild and severe Class II was defined by <b>overjet</b> (< 10 mm/≥ 10 mm) or by ANB angle (< 7 degrees/≥ 7 degrees). Statistics were performed with two-sample t-test and Pearson's correlation analysis. In the two <b>overjet</b> groups, significant differences were mainly found for incisor inclination while the two ANB groups differed significantly in SNA, WITS, Go-Pg, SpaSpp/MGo, SN/MGo, and Ar-Gn. The shortest airway distance between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall was significantly correlated to the NS/Ar angle. Statistical analysis revealed several significant correlations. Patients with a large <b>overjet</b> or ANB angle differed significantly from patients with a small <b>overjet</b> or ANB angle mainly in their incisor inclination. In the present sample, the <b>overjet</b> and to some extent also the ANB angle is determined by soft tissue or individual tooth position rather than by skeletal background. In retrognathic patients, a tendency towards smaller airway dimensions was found. However, statistical analysis did not reveal a strong connection between upper airway and dentoskeletal parameters, but a large interindividual variation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{skeletal}} and dental changes contributing to the correction of Class III malocclusion using a 2 x 4 appliance and reverse headgear in the mixed dentition. Seventeen consecutive patients (mean age, 9. 7 years) with pseudo-Class III malocclusions and an anterior functional shift and straight or concave facial profile were treated with a simple fixed appliance. Another 20 consecutive patients (mean age, 8. 5 years) with Class III incisor relationship and straight or concave facial profiles, were treated with reverse headgear. Lateral cephalometric films taken at the beginning of treatment, the end of the treatment, and 1 year after the active treatment, were analyzed with the modified Pancherz analysis. After active treatment, the <b>overjet</b> correction, 5. 2 mm and 6. 5 mm on average, respectively, were achieved using the 2 x 4 and reverse headgear. The <b>overjet</b> correction by the 2 x 4 appliance was due to dental changes only. In the reverse headgear group, 60 % of the <b>overjet</b> correction was due to dental changes and 40 % due to skeletal changes. During the 12 months follow-up period, the <b>overjet</b> was unchanged in the 2 x 4 group (1. 6 mm) and decreased in the reverse headgear group, the difference being statistically significant (P <. 05). The change of jaw relationship was similar between the 2 x 4 and reverse headgear groups. During the follow-up period, a decrease in <b>overjet</b> in the reverse headgear group was mainly due to forward growth of the mandible and proclination of lower incisors. The <b>overjet</b> in the 2 x 4 group was unchanged due to dental compensation (1. 6 mm). To conclude there was a similar amount of <b>overjet</b> correction in the 2 x 4 and reverse headgear groups. <b>Overjet</b> correction by the simple fixed appliance was produced by dental changes whereas in the reverse headgear group, it was produced by both dental and skeletal changes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{correlations}} between the sagittal jaw position and the cranio – cervical inclination are described in literature. Only few studies focus on the sagittal jaw position and the body posture using valid and objective orthopaedic examination methods. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that patients with malocclusions reveal significant differences in body posture compared to those without (upper thoracic inclination, kyphotic angle, lordotic angle and lower lumbar inclination). Methods Eighty-four healthy adult patients (with a mean age = 25. 6 years and ranging from 16. 1 to 55. 8 years) were examined with informed consent. The orthodontic examination horizontal <b>overjet</b> (distance between upper and lower incisors) was determined by using an orthodontic digital sliding calliper. The subjects were subdivided in respect of the <b>overjet</b> with the following results: 18 revealed a normal <b>overjet</b> (Class I), 38 had an increased <b>overjet</b> (Class II) and 28 had an reversed <b>overjet</b> (Class III). Rasterstereography was used to carry out a three – dimensional back shape analysis. This method is based on photogrammetry. A three-dimensional shape was produced by analysing the distortion of parallel horizontal white light lines projected on the patient's back, followed by mathematical modelling. On the basis of the sagittal profile the upper thoracic inclination, the thoracic angle, the lordotic angle and the pelvic inclination were determined with a reported accuracy of 2. 8 ° and the correlations to the sagittal jaw position were calculated by means of ANOVA, Scheffé and Kruskal-Wallis procedures. Results Between the different <b>overjet</b> groups, no statistically significant differences or correlations regarding the analysed back shape parameters could be obtained. However, comparing males and females there were statistically significant differences in view of the parameters 'lordotic angle' and 'pelvic inclination'. Conclusion No {{correlations between}} <b>overjet</b> and variables of the thoracic, lordotic or the pelvic inclination could be observed. </p...|$|E
