40|$|Social {{communication}} has interested analysts {{of nationalism}} {{and the construction}} <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> in particular since the authors {{of two of the}} principal schools concerned with the process of the creation of nation-states, the primordialist and the modernist schools, consider communicative processes as a basis for the initiatives of the construction <b>of</b> <b>nation.</b> Nevertheless, these contributions to the debate are insufficient to cover the problem from the dimension of relational communication. The construction <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> is a process which requires interactions at different levels: citizens-citizens, citizens-state, and between the state and other nations.

40|$|To date (critical) {{geopolitics}} has {{had little}} to say about contemporary competitive identity practices <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> branding in global politics, while existing analyses <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> branding in other disciplines have tended to overlook its geopolitical dimensions. This expanded Introduction (and the special issue as a whole) therefore seeks to explore some of the implications <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> branding for geopolitics, while simultaneously utilizing the insights of critical geopolitics {{to shed light on}} nation branding practices. The Introduction makes the case for a broad conception <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> branding that challenges claims it is immutably linked to capitalist logics in an era of globalization. It subsequently explores claims that nation branding is simply an updated form <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> building and that it is also an inherently benign and peace promoting activity. The Introduction ends by highlighting how, despite claims that the contemporary prevalence <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> branding practices is indicative of a categorical shift from a geopolitical to a geoeconomic world, nation branding practices frequently remain deeply infused with rather traditional geopolitical scripts...|$|R

Postcolonial theory negates master narratives <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> and nationhood, hence it deconstructs such narratives as problematic. Hungwe and Hungwe discuss problems associated with definitions <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> where groups or members are peripheralized. While Hungwe and Hungwe acknowledge that nationalism served a critical role during decolonization, their conclusion is that in postcolonial Africa notions <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> and nationhood represent problematic issues with regard to ethnicity and gender and that globalization in particular impacts and challenges the notion <b>of</b> <b>nation</b> and nationhood...|$|R
