40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the relationship between}} legitimacy and reform is complex. This is because ’political reform’ consists of an array <b>of</b> institutional <b>reforms.</b> The general question guiding this project is whether the introduction <b>of</b> <b>reform</b> helps boost the legitimacy of the democratic system: does the impact <b>of</b> <b>reform</b> on legitimacy vary with the type <b>of</b> <b>reform,</b> or with the process <b>of</b> <b>reform.</b> To answer these questions, this study also seeks to establish how many reforms have taken place, what types <b>of</b> <b>reform</b> have been introduced and under what circumstances these reforms occur.
