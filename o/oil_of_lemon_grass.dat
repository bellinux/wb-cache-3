40|$|Abstract Background Use <b>of</b> {{essential}} <b>oils</b> {{for controlling}} Candida albicans growth has gained significance {{due to the}} resistance acquired by pathogens towards a number of widely-used drugs. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the antifungal activity <b>of</b> selected essential <b>oils</b> against Candida albicans in liquid and vapour phase and to determine the chemical composition and mechanism of action of most potent essential oil. Methods Minimum Inhibitory concentration (MIC) <b>of</b> different essential <b>oils</b> in liquid phase, assayed through agar plate dilution, broth dilution & 96 -well micro plate dilution method and vapour phase activity evaluated through disc volatilization method. Reduction of C. albicans cells with vapour exposure was estimated by kill time assay. Morphological alteration in treated/untreated C. albicans cells was observed by the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) /Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and chemical analysis of the strongest antifungal agent/essential oil has been done by GC, GC-MS. Results <b>Lemon</b> <b>grass</b> (Cymbopogon citratus) essential oil exhibited the strongest antifungal effect followed by mentha (Mentha piperita) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) essential <b>oil.</b> The MIC <b>of</b> <b>lemon</b> <b>grass</b> essential <b>oil</b> in liquid phase (288 mg/l) was significantly higher than that in the vapour phase (32. 7 mg/l) and a 4 h exposure was sufficient to cause 100 % loss in viability of C. albicans cells. SEM/AFM of C. albicans cells treated with <b>lemon</b> <b>grass</b> essential oil at MIC level in liquid and vapour phase showed prominent shrinkage and partial degradation, respectively, confirming higher efficacy of vapour phase. GC-MS analysis revealed that <b>lemon</b> <b>grass</b> essential oil was dominated by oxygenated monoterpenes (78. 2 %); α-citral or geranial (36. 2 %) and β-citral or neral (26. 5 %), monoterpene hydrocarbons (7. 9 %) and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (3. 8 %).

40|$|A {{principal}} doença da goiaba (Psidium guajava L.), após a colheita, é a antracnose, causada por Glomerella cingulata e Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Estes patógenos e o resíduo de fungicidas em frutos são considerados os principais problemas para a exportaçãodesta fruta. Neste trabalho, foi avaliado o efeito fungitóxico de extratos, decoctos e óleos essenciais de plantas medicinais e aromáticas, no crescimento micelial dos patógenos, in vitro, recomendados como alternativa para o controle químico em pós-colheita. Os extratos aquosos a 10 % e os decoctos (subprodutos da hidrodestilação) foram adicionados em BDA, autoclavados e distribuídos em placas de Petri. Os óleos essenciais foram adicionados em três pontos eqüidistantes nas placas de Petri contendo BDA. Discos dos isolados foram repicados para o centro das placas de Petri. O efeito fungitóxico foi avaliado medindo-se o diâmetro das colônias, quando na testemunha ou em qualquer tratamento os patógenos atingiram a borda da placa. O extrato aquoso e o óleo essencial de cravo-da-Índia inibiram em 100 % o crescimento de G. cingulata e C. gloeosporioides, sendo este último totalmente inibido pelo óleo essencial de capim-limão. Os decoctos de alecrim, gengibre, calêndula e laranja (Citrus sinensis) apresentaram potencial de inibição sobre os isolados dos patógenos. No controle de C. gloeosporioides, destacaram-se também os decoctos de marcela, camomila e tagetes. A inibição total ou parcial do crescimento micelial de Glomerella cingulata e Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, in vitro, evidenciou a existência de compostos biologicamente ativos, com efeito fungitóxico nos extratos, decoctos e óleos essenciais de plantas medicinais e aromáticas. Isto indica uma aplicação potencial destes produtos no controle alternativo da antracnose em frutos de goiabeira. The main {{disease of}} the guava (Psidium guajava L.), after harvesting, is anthracnose, caused by Glomerella cingulata and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. This pathogen and chemical residues of fungicides in fruits are considered the mains problems for exportation. In this work was evaluated the fungitoxic effect of extracts, decoctions and essential <b>oils</b> <b>of</b> medicinal and aromatic plants in the mycelium growth of the pathogens, in vitro, to be recommended {{as an alternative to}} chemical control in postharvest. To prepare the aquous extracts a 10 % and the decoctions (sub-products of hydrodistillation) were added in PDA medium, autoclaved and distributed into Petri dishes. The essential oils were added in three equidistant points by Petri dishes contening PDA medium. Discs of the isolates of the pathogen were placed on the center of the Petri dishes. The fungitoxic effect was evaluated by measuring the diameter of the colonies when the pathogens or any other treatment reached the border of the Petri dishes. The aquous extract and the essential oil from the clove inhibit in 100 % of G. cingulata and C. gloeosporioides growth, and the last one was totally inhibited by the essential <b>oil</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lemon</b> <b>grass.</b> The decoctions <b>of</b> rosemary, ginger, calendula, orange (Citrus sinensis) showed inhibition potencial to control both isolates of the pathogen.
