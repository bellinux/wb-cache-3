5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{also suffered}} from engine problems, however, {{that were not}} so easily cured; the Ranger engine was well known for unreliability, and was particularly prone to overheating problems that were never satisfactoriarly solved. The aircraft's original XV-770-4 engine {{was replaced by a}} XV-770-6, with a repositioned <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> during flight testing; despite this, the problems continued.|$|E
5|$|Two-seat trainer version. Armament {{reduced to}} a single 20mm gun and the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was {{relocated}} underneath the engine cowling. Fitted with a radio compass and gun camera. Considerably heavier than the fighter at , but it retained the flying characteristics of the single-seat aircraft. 584 built, the last two delivered in 1947.|$|E
5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E

5|$|The {{contract}} for the Di6 called for the first delivery in February 1995. Several components were to be manufactured by NSB, including the fuel tanks, sandboxes, engine frames, alternators and some components for the bogies. The first locomotive was delivered on 7 March 1996, but quickly proved to not meet the specifications in the contract. In particular, the locomotives had too high fuel consumption and the bogies had faults, as they had too high track forces. Both of these issues were difficult to solve. The Di6 also had problems with overheating, in particular in the main alternators, the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> and the brakes. The on-board computer failed when the outdoor temperature fell too low.|$|E

25|$|Various {{engineering}} refinements {{that had}} gone into the Tempest II were incorporated into the last Tempest variant, designated as the Tempest VI. This variant was furnished with a Napier Sabre V engine with 2,340hp (1,700kW). The more powerful Sabre V required a bigger radiator which displaced the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> and carburettor air intake from the radiator's centre; air for the carburettor was drawn through intakes on {{the leading edge of the}} inner wings, while the <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> was located behind the radiator. Most Tempest VIs were tropicalised, the main feature of this process being an air filter which was fitted in a fairing on the lower centre section. Other changes included the strengthening of the rear spar and the inclusion of spring tabs, which granted the variant superior handling performance.|$|E
25|$|Supermarine 312: This was {{the basic}} Spitfire Mk I adapted to take four 20mm Oerlikon cannon mounted in {{modified}} wings. The radiator and <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> were moved {{from under the}} wing to a duct under the fuselage. This was R J Mitchell's last design {{before his death in}} 1937.|$|E
25|$|The 75 engine range at launch {{featured}} four-cylinder 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol carbureted engines, a 2.0-litre intercooled turbodiesel made by VM Motori, and a 2.5-litre {{fuel injected}} V6. In 1986, the 75 Turbo was introduced, which featured a fuel-injected 1779 cc twin-cam engine using Garrett T3 turbocharger, intercooler and <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b>|$|E

Armament and gunsight {{unchanged}} from the pre-production models. Provision for two droptanks under the wings. Rounded spinner caps with provision for Hucks starter. Late models had external fuel coolers. Forty produced (s/n 111-150).|$|E
25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} wet sump system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The oil system is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> is used, {{connected to the}} engine by flexible hoses.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, Toyota Australia {{announced}} a Pro-Am series with races exclusively during that country's V8 Supercars events from 2016. Its inceptor was long-time Toyota racing driver, Neal Bates. The race cars {{are based on}} manual production models with key specifications (such as engine management, extractors and exhaust, suspension, brakes, <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> wheels and tyres) controlled to ensure their suitability and reliability while keeping costs as low as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} use {{a hybrid}} cooling method where engine oil is circulated between the engine case {{and a small}} radiator. Here the <b>oil</b> doubles as <b>cooling</b> liquid, prompting the name [...] "oil-cooling." [...] Suzuki has produced many oil-cooled motorcycles. Modern BMW R-series flat-twin motorcycles, such as the R1150GS, use air and <b>oil</b> <b>cooling.</b> Polaris's Victory motorcycles use oil/air cooling exclusively.|$|R
5000|$|... at 2800 rpm, Minimum {{fuel grade}} 100 or 100LL avgas, {{compression}} ratio 8.5:1. Uses a TCM 639231A3 fuel injector. Same as the IO-360-A except for power rating and <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> pistons. The crankshaft has two 6th order dampers.|$|R
50|$|After the war OK {{produced}} a 292 cc two-stroke motor of its own, but also produced models using Blackburne (250 cc and 350 cc, sv and ohv), Bradshaw (348 cc <b>oil</b> <b>cooled),</b> and JAP (246 cc to 496 cc) engines.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{intercooler}} {{required a}} radiator, the radiator under the starboard wing was halved {{in size and}} the intercooler radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one radiator section provided enough coolant; a thermostatic switch turned off the starboard radiator section until more power was called for and extra engine cooling was required.|$|E
25|$|The GRMN 86 Concept is {{a version}} of Toyota 86 that {{incorporates}} the technical expertise gained through the 24 Hours Nürburgring endurance race, achieving optimal vehicle weight reduction, a lower center of gravity, an enhanced powertrain and improved body rigidity. It included FA20 engine, 6-speed manual transmission, 215/40R17 tires, carbon fiber engine cover, roof, rear hatch, diffuser, side skirt, tail wing, seats; polycarbonate windows, reinforced engine parts, <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> rewritten ECU, mechanical limited slip differential.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with Madapolam fabric and doped {{in a similar manner}} to the fuselage. The wing was {{installed}} into the roots by means of four large attachment points. The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag. The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic {{diagram of}} a basic dry-sump engine {{lubrication}} system. The oil collects in sump (1), is withdrawn continuously by scavenge pump (2) and {{travels to the}} oil tank (3), where gases entrained in the oil separate and the <b>oil</b> <b>cools.</b> Gases (6) are returned to the engine sump. Pressure pump (4) forces the de-gassed and <b>cooled</b> <b>oil</b> (5) back to the engine's lubrication points (7).|$|R
50|$|Similarly, it {{is usually}} {{desirable}} to minimize the number of heat transfer stages {{in order to maximize}} the temperature difference at each stage. However, Detroit Diesel 2-stroke cycle engines commonly use <b>oil</b> <b>cooled</b> by water, with the water in turn cooled by air.|$|R
50|$|Designed to give {{reliable}} service under prolonged hard use, {{the engine}} featured deep water jackets, thermostatically controlled <b>oil</b> <b>cooling,</b> copper-lead bearings and a hardened crankshaft.
