40|$|At {{the later}} legionary camp of Vindonissa, early Roman (Augustan-Claudian) {{structures}} were excavated during a rescue excavation between 1996 and 1998. In phase 2 (10 BC until O), seven in situ carbonised wooden barrels, {{dug into the}} ground, were found. They belong to a rather large building which was most probably used as storage facility. Two of the barrels contained, in the bottom layers, several hundred seeds and pericarp fragments of pomegranates (Punica granatum L.). A large number of other "exotic" plant taxa such as <b>olive,</b> <b>walnut,</b> pine, pistacio, peach, cherry (and probably date) were also found in rather large quantities. Above all, the finds of pomegranates are unique: {{they are the first}} finds of this Mediterranean fruit in regions north of the Alps. The origin, use, and other archaeological finds of the pomegranate in the Roman period are discussed. A comparison with other early Roman spectra shows that such large quantities of "exotic" useful plants are mainly present at larger military sites like the legionary camps of Novaesium or Oberaden. It must also be suggested that the pre-camp-phases in Vindonissa already had a military character, although this {{is not at all clear}} from the other archaeological finds. The precise role of the site is still a matter of debate...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{importance}} of abiotic drivers in wind-pollinated species is a key issue to predict seed production. Researches on anemophilous species (e. g. <b>olive,</b> <b>walnut,</b> oak) highlighted the correlation between airborne pollen concentration and seed production. Moreover, recent phenological studies revealed {{the importance}} of humidity as a trigger for tree phenology. Despite the economic importance of Corylus avellana, few in-field studies on pollen dispersal have been produced on this species. Pollen concentration depends on pollen production and atmospheric stability at the lower layers of the atmosphere, i. e. low convective activity and low radiation). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that high air humidity and low wind velocity within the canopies favor high pollen concentration. To unravel these mechanisms, we monitored hazelnut reproductive phenology on 10 adult trees of C. avellana var. TGL in Piedmont (Italy), together with daily pollen concentrations, air and bud temperature, air humidity and wind, during winter 2016 - 2017. Our data set on meteorological parameters and daily pollen concentration of the five previous years indicates that pollen concentrations lasted on average 12 weeks from mid-December to mid-March involving multiple phenological phases from catkin elongation until its decay. The highest pollen concentration peaks always occurred with air vapor pressure deficit well below 5 hPa and with no precipitation event. Also, catkins elongation resulted positively affected by higher absolute humidity between the 2 nd and the 3 rd phenological phase in 2016 - 2017. These findings disclose {{the importance of}} atmospheric stability within the canopy layer as explanatory parameters for hazelnut pollen emission...|$|E

40|$|The {{utility of}} high {{pressure}} liquid chromatography as a routine method to detect animal fats in vegetable margarines {{on the basis}} of sterol content was investigated. Cholesterol, which makes up almost 100 % of the total sterol in animal fats, constitutes only 0 - 4 % of the total sterols in vegetable oils. The major phytosterols in vegetable oils currently used for margarine production are B-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol. Brassicasterol is less conunon but in rapeseed oil it is present in high proportion. The minor phytosterols are: ~ 5 -avenasterol, ~ 7 -stiqmasterol, 7 ~ -avenasterol, 24 -methyl cholest- 7 -enol and cholesterol. A uBondapak c 18 column and a yariable wavelength ultraviolet detector along with a variety of mobile phases, have been used throughout this investigation. A method was developed for isolating, extracting and derivatizing sterols from biological material. Optimum chromatographic conditions are described. Lard, soy bean, corn, cottonseed, safflower, sunflower, <b>olive,</b> <b>walnut</b> and rapeseed oils were analyzed. A good separation was obtained for free sterols from vegetable o·ils. Free cholesterol could be separated from the major phytosterols but not from the whole group and in a blend of 25 % lard and 75 % corn oil, cholesterol did not show up clearly. With benzoate derivatives a good separation was obtained for cholesterol from major phytosterols, but brassicasterol from rapeseed oil and some minor phytosterols from other oils interfered with the cholesterol peak. Because of this interference, the detectable ratio of animal fat in vegetable margarine is dependent on the raw material. · Fifty percent of animal fat can be easily detected in all kinds of margarines. In soy bean oil marqarine, 25 % animal fat can be easily detected. The method is reproducible, rapid, and worth further investigation to find a column and solvent system capable of separating cholesterol completely from all phytosterols, so that very low levels of animal fat could be detected in vegetable oil...|$|E
40|$|Pollen {{data from}} three {{off-site}} records and twenty-six on-site (archaeological) sites are reviewed {{to investigate the}} development of cultural landscapes through {{the history of the}} <b>olive,</b> <b>walnut</b> and chestnut trees in the Italian Peninsula from the Late Glacial to late Holocene. The spread of these trees, which have been gathered or cultivated since ancient times, though not marked by high values in pollen diagrams, is an important indicator of increasing human activity and anthropization in the Mediterranean area. The sum of Olea, Juglans and Castanea percentages in pollen spectra constitutes the OJC curve. The off-site records discussed are core RF 93 - 30 from the Adriatic Sea (last 7000 years), and cores PALB 94 - 1 E of Lago Albano and PNEM 94 - 1 B of Lago di Nemi, two lakes in the Latium region (last 13, 000 years). The on-site records are located in several regions (Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, Basilicata, Calabria, and Sicily) and in the Republic of San Marino. Their chronology spans approximately from the Bronze to the Renaissance ages, from 4200 to 500 years BP. The simultaneous presence of OJC in the off-sites and in all the archaeological sites confirms that these trees were widespread in the Italian peninsula during the last four millennia. The OJC pollen sum shows low values but it is common in Bronze age sites from northern Italy, when their percentages increase in the off-site records. In Hellenistic and Roman times, there are sharp increments of their curves in the off-sites, and values of Olea are especially high in archaeological sites of southern Italy. The highest values of OJC, especially due to Castanea, are found in the different types of records in the Middle ages. Juglans is significant but less common in both the archaeological sites and the off-sites. The cultivation of walnut and chestnut trees in pre-Roman times may have included local stands. The nurturing for wood may have had negative effects on pollen fallout while the flowering of plants was favoured to obtain fruits. As humans exploited the natural resources they interfered with the distribution of useful plants. The development of human environments in a modern sense, however, is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has largely caused the expansion of complex agrarian landscapes, including fields, pastures and groves...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In elderly individuals, {{hypertension}} is a {{main risk}} factor for cardiovascular disease and oxidative damage is increased. Our aim {{was to assess the}} relationship between the degree of in vivo low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) oxidation and the hypertensive status in a elderly population at high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with baseline data from the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) trial, an intervention study directed at testing the efficacy of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Participants were 1, 130 subjects at high cardiovascular risk aged 55 - 80. At baseline, in vivo circulating oxLDL was measured, and stages of hypertension determined according to the USA Joint National Committee guidelines. RESULTS: A positive relationship between in vivo oxLDL and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was observed after adjusting for confounding factors (P < 0. 05). OxLDL concentrations increased in a linear manner from low to high hypertensive stages (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly individuals at high cardiovascular risk showed higher levels of circulating oxLDL when their hypertensive status increased. This fact identifies the hypertensive elderly population as a target for antioxidant preventive measures.
