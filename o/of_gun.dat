5|$|Each of the A, B, C and E {{categories}} <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> license {{allows the}} person to buy a B or C category <b>of</b> <b>gun.</b> Holders of an A category license may, after being granted may-issue exemption by the police, also purchase an A category firearm; holders of D category may possess and carry any category of firearm (which remains {{the property of the}} employer).|$|E

5|$|About a {{fifth of}} members of the Czech Parliament are holders <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> license; some of them are {{believed}} to conceal carry also within the parliament grounds (parliamentarians are not required to pass gun check on entry unlike other staff or visitors).|$|E
5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> in terms <b>of</b> butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms <b>of</b> <b>guns.</b> If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production <b>of</b> 2 <b>guns</b> must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice <b>of</b> one <b>gun</b> could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> in terms <b>of</b> butter is 4.|$|R
500|$|According {{to modern}} research, the number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> was {{considerably}} less than the official armament plan. At the time, armament plans regularly overstated the number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> available. In reality, they were ideal estimations that seldom reflected actual conditions, either {{because of a lack}} of ordnance or because they were impractical when tested. Heavy 30- and 36-pounder guns were particularly difficult to find in sufficient numbers and lighter guns were frequently used instead. Going by the number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> salvaged from Kronan in the 1680s (see [...] "History as a shipwreck") and during the excavations in the 1980s the total comes to 105–110. The upper figure matches the calculations of the number of gunports on the remains of the wreck and the number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> that could practically fit on the gun decks. The lower figure is the number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> found in the 1980s excavations combined with the list <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> brought up during the salvage operations in the 1680s. The table below lists the number <b>of</b> <b>guns,</b> comparing the official 1671 armament plan to the calculations by naval historian Jan Glete.|$|R
50|$|Total was 1 <b>of</b> 90 <b>guns,</b> 2 <b>of</b> 80 <b>guns,</b> 9 <b>of</b> 70 <b>guns,</b> 7 <b>of</b> 60 <b>guns,</b> 2 <b>of</b> 50 <b>guns,</b> 1 <b>of</b> 44 <b>guns.</b> The British fleet also {{comprised}} 6 smaller vessels - the fireships Garland (Samuel Atkins) and Griffin (Humphrey Orme), the storeship Success (Francis Knighton), {{the hospital}} ship Looe (Timothy Splaine), the bomb-ketch Basilisk (John Hubbard) and an unnamed bomb tender.|$|R

5|$|In 1941, the New York City Planning Department {{proposed}} the Gun Hill Crosstown Highway as an upgrade, {{but nothing happened}} with this plan. In the mid-1960s, the Tri-State Transportation Commission proposed a new route just a mile north <b>of</b> <b>Gun</b> Hill Road called the City Line Expressway; this plan also did not advance.|$|E

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} and safety <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> used for personal defense is debated. Studies place the instances <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> used in personal defense {{as low as}} 65,000 times per year, and as high as 2.5 million times per year. Under President Clinton, the Department of Justice conducted a survey in 1994 that placed the usage rate <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> used in personal defense at 1.5 million times per year, but noted this {{was likely to be}} an overestimate.|$|R
500|$|Over {{time the}} calibre <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> tended to increase. In the Royal Navy, the , {{launched}} 1910, had ten 13.5-inch guns, {{all on the}} centreline; the , launched 1913, had eight [...] guns. In all navies, fewer <b>guns</b> <b>of</b> larger calibre came to be used. The smaller number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> simplified their distribution, and centreline turrets became the norm.|$|R
5|$|Mdina's fortifications {{remained}} in {{use during the}} British period, and some minor alterations such as the installation <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> emplacements {{were made in the}} 19th century.

5|$|On social issues, Gillibrand is {{generally}} liberal, supporting abortion rights, legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2017, {{she came out}} in favor of single-payer healthcare, and cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, which would gradually expand the existing Medicare program to cover all Americans. She is a strong advocate for government transparency, being one of a few members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information. She is also a strong supporter of female equality and involvement, having begun the website offthesidelines.org in 2011. Although a supporter <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> rights while in the House, Gillibrand has since moved in the direction <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> control.|$|E
5|$|The two-storied north-west bastion {{protected}} the castle against attack along the spit from the mainland, and housed the castle's original portcullis {{as well as}} providing accommodation for the garrison. It had three levels <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> positions on its ground floor, first floor and roof, which were adapted in the 19th century to house heavier weapons and shelter riflemen. The bastion links to an external caponier, a covered walkway with rifle loops for close defence, built in 1852. The north-east and south-east bastions are only one storey tall, originally holding two levels <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> positions on the ground floor and roofs, again both adapted to support heavier guns in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|A gun {{emplacement}} is {{a position}} or platform specially prepared to support large heavy guns and artillery. The first type <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> put on Fort Pasir Panjang was the 7-inch Rifled Muzzle-Loading (R.M.L.). Two of these guns were first installed in 1878 {{so as to}} provide a temporary defence for the fort. They were, however, removed soon after.|$|E
50|$|There {{are special}} rules for {{collectors}} <b>of</b> <b>guns.</b> They {{are exempt from}} {{many parts of the}} regulation, but, in turn, they must meet even more narrow qualifications.

Just four days before the murders, Kovář had received a police request to present a new health clearance under the threat of revoking his license. Before entering the Družba restaurant, Kovář visited at least two other venues. Those, however, had fewer customers, and Kovář left them immediately after entering.|$|E
5|$|Development {{and testing}} {{continued}} until late 1938. Several variants <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> and carriage were proposed until on 15 December {{a combination of}} the T10 gun and T5 carriage was officially adopted as the 37mm Gun M3 and Carriage M4. Although the weapon followed the concept of the PaK 36 and was often referred to as a copy of it, the M3 differed significantly from the German design and used different ammunition.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} on 26 February 2015, Chovanec {{introduced}} five areas that were to be scrutinized {{in connection with the}} Uherský Brod attack: the communication of national police with municipal authorities, possible changes in crisis plans, operational range of tactical teams, and enhanced training of policemen. Chovanec didn't repeat his sentiment regarding the number <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> license holders, and instead specified that one of the issues to be analyzed will be the issuing and revocation of licenses under the existing legislation.|$|E

At his second trial on March 16, 2009, Lee Woods was found guilty of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, and 3 charges <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> possession.

5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v.

However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
