5|$|Ideal tank mates for convict {{cichlids}} {{consists of}} robust similar sized fish. Such fish include T-Bar cichlids, Honduran red points, Green Terrors, Jewel cichlids, Salvini, Jack Dempsey, (Keep {{in mind as}} Dempseys <b>outgrow</b> the convicts territorial issues will become a problem.) Pictus catfish, plecostomus, {{as well as other}} convicts. Other fast moving fish such as Giant Danios can be used as dither fish. Also remember, if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40-gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates. But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together.|$|E
5|$|It {{became clear}} that {{managing}} the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R. Gilruth's Space Task Group, which had been directing the nation's manned space program from NASA's Langley Research Center. So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center, the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC). A site was chosen in Houston, Texas, on land donated by Rice University, and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19, 1961. It was also clear NASA would soon <b>outgrow</b> its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida, so a new Mission Control Center would {{be included in the}} MSC.|$|E
5|$|It {{also became}} clear that Apollo would <b>outgrow</b> the Canaveral launch {{facilities}} in Florida. The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end: LC-34 and LC-37. But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission, so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center (LOC) immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island. The design, development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H. Debus, a member of Dr. Wernher von Braun's original V-2 rocket engineering team. Debus was named the LOC's first Director. Construction began in November 1962. Upon Kennedy's death, President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29, 1963, to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always <b>outgrow</b> smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{float in}} the pelagic zone of the ocean with other {{plankton}} {{for three to four}} weeks, during which a large number of them are eaten by predators. The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post-larval glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, they settle to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces. When they <b>outgrow</b> their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The coconut crab reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years.|$|E
5|$|Youngstown's downtown, {{which once}} underscored the community's {{economic}} difficulties, is {{a site of}} new business growth. The Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI), {{in the heart of}} the downtown, houses several start-up technology companies that have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities. Some companies supported by the incubator have earned recognition, and a few are starting to <b>outgrow</b> their current space. One such company–Turning Technologies–has been rated by Inc. Magazine as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall. In an effort to keep such companies downtown, the YBI secured approval to demolish a row of vacant buildings nearby to clear space for expansion. The project will be funded by a $2 million federal grant awarded in 2006. In 2014, the YBI was ranked as the number 1 university associated business incubator in the world by the Swedish UBII (University Business Incubator Index). In 2015, the YBI was the top University Associated Incubator in North America, and came in second to the Dublin Enterprise & Technology Centre, also known as the Guinness Enterprise Centre, in Dublin.|$|E
40|$|The loss of Bacillus subtilis penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 a, encoded by pbpA, was {{previously}} shown to slow spore outgrowth {{and result in}} an increased diameter of the <b>outgrowing</b> spore. Further analyses to define the defect in pbpA spore outgrowth have shown that (i) <b>outgrowing</b> pbpA spores exhibited only a slight defect {{in the rate of}} peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis compared to wild-type spores, but PG turnover was significantly slowed during outgrowth of pbpA spores; (ii) {{there was no difference in}} the location of PG synthesis in <b>outgrowing</b> wild-type and pbpA spores once cell elongation had been initiated; (iii) outgrowth and elongation of pbpA spores were dramatically affected by the levels of monovalent or divalent cations in the medium; (iv) there was a partial redundancy of function between PBP 2 a and PBP 1 or - 4 during spore outgrowth; and (v) there was no difference in the structure of PG from <b>outgrowing</b> wild-type spores or spores lacking PBP 2 a or PBP 2 a and - 4; but also (vi) PG from <b>outgrowing</b> spores lacking PBP 1 and - 2 a had transiently decreased cross-linking compared to PG from <b>outgrowing</b> wild-type spores, possibly due to the loss of transpeptidase activity...|$|R

5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to <b>outgrow</b> its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E
