Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, {{was one of the}} hardest hit cities by the fall of oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E

5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Following the Annexation of Texas to the United States, Sam Houston {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth to Washington, D.C. as the state's U.S. senator for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas raising their children.

Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the Civil War, {{at a time when the}} state was torn apart over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas Ordinance of Secession. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With children to protect, and no government security forces in place, she lived in fear for her family's safety.|$|E
5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K.

5|$|Occurring a {{year after}} Hurricane Donna, {{officials}} in the Florida Keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm. The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West, while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light, American Shoal Light, and Sombrero Key Light. Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls. On the morning of September7, a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. On September8, a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward. It was later extended westward to include the entire coast <b>of</b> <b>Texas,</b> <b>and</b> eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600UTC on September9. An estimated 500,000people fled the coasts <b>of</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> Louisiana, making it the largest evacuation {{in the history of}} the United States, at the time. Further, at least half of those people were from Texas. In small towns along the coast of Texas, 90100% of their populations evacuated, while 20% of people left the larger cities.
