5|$|In June 1976, {{a series}} of protests took place across {{communist}} Poland soon after the government announced plans to increase sharply the fixed prices charged nationwide for many basic commodities. Violent incidents occurred in Płock, Radom and Ursus as the protests were forcibly put down, and the planned price hikes were cancelled. These demonstrations and the events surrounding them brought the Polish workforce and intellectual political opposition together, and by 1980, a campaign of civil resistance for political change was intensifying strongly. Industrial strike action in Lublin in July 1980—the so-called Lublin July—preceded the formation of Solidarity (Solidarność) in {{the port city of}} Gdańsk during the following months. This was the first non-communist trade union in an Eastern bloc country. The government took several steps to obstruct Solidarity's emergence, enforcing press censorship and cutting off telephone connections between the coast and the hinterland, but despite these efforts four out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> Polish workers were members of the union by late 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{imposition}} of new taxation categories {{that were a}} departure from both secular Ottoman law and the traditionally accepted Islamic law drew local Muslim anger at the authorities. However, the principal point of contention between the authorities and the notables of Jerusalem and Nablus was the conscription order by Ibrahim Pasha on 25 April 1834. That day, Ibrahim Pasha convened {{with all of the}} clan leaders from both cities to demand the drafting of one out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> Muslim men of fighting age. The order would begin with the conscription of 200 men from Jerusalem, a combined 3,500 men from Sanjak al-Quds and Sanjak Nablus, and 500 men from Hebron. By May 1834, the only prominent ally of the Egyptians in Palestine was the Abd al-Hadi clan.|$|E
5|$|The list of Florida hurricanes from 2000 to {{the present}} {{has been marked by}} several devastating North Atlantic hurricanes; as of 2017, 79tropical or {{subtropical}} cyclones have affected the U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, cyclones in Florida during the time period resulted in more than $73billion in damage (2017USD). Additionally, tropical cyclones in Florida were responsible for 147direct fatalities and at least 92indirect casualties during the period. Eight cyclones affected the state in both 2004 and 2005, which were the years with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state. During the 2004 season, more than one out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> houses in the state received damage. After Wilma in 2005, it would be 11 years until another hurricane would strike the state, and 12 years until another major hurricane would strike the state.|$|E

In some regions of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, {{at least half of the}} workforce was employed in defense plants. (The comparable U.S. figures were roughly one-sixteenth of gross national product and about one of every sixteen in the workforce.) In 1989, one-fourth of the entire Soviet population was engaged in military activities, whether active duty, military production, or civilian military training.|$|E

25|$|Edward the Black Prince {{seemed to}} have good health until 1366. It was not until his {{campaign}} in Spain to restore Don Pedro the Cruel to the throne of Castille that he became ill. On this expedition, his army suffered so badly from dysentery that {{it is said that}} one out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> Englishmen would not return home. Edward the Black Prince contracted an illness on this expedition that would ail him until his death in 1376. It is widely believed that he contracted amoebic dysentery but some argue against the likelihood that he could sustain life with a ten-year battle with dysentery. Other possible diagnoses include nephritis, cirrhosis or a combination of these. His illness prevented him participating on the battlefield. However, in 1370, the Prince had to leave his sick bed and raise an army to defend Aquitaine against Charles V of France.|$|E
25|$|The high {{concentration}} of population around Mbanza Kongo and its outskirts {{played a critical role}} in the centralization of Kongo. The capital was a densely settled area in an otherwise sparsely populated region where rural population densities probably did not exceed 5 persons per square kilometer. Early Portuguese travelers described Mbanza Kongo as a large city, the size of the Portuguese town of Évora as it was in 1491. By the end of the sixteenth century, Kongo's population was probably close to half a million people in a core region of some 130,000 square kilometers. By the early seventeenth century the city and its hinterland had a population of around 100,000, or one out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> inhabitants in the Kingdom (according to baptismal statistics compiled by Jesuit priests). This concentration allowed resources, soldiers and surplus foodstuffs to be readily available at the request of the king. This made the king overwhelmingly powerful and caused the kingdom to become highly centralized.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1918, {{with the}} ending of the German Spring Offensive, the Australian troops started to conduct {{offensive}} patrols into no man's land. As the front lines after the Spring Offensive lacked fortifications and were non-continuous, it was discovered that the patrols could infiltrate the German outpost line and approach the outposts from behind. In this manner, the outposts could be taken quickly, and with minimal force. This tactic was first reported as being used on 5 April 1918 by the Australian 58th Battalion, 15th Brigade, 5th Division. However, within a few weeks all five of the Australian divisions (and the New Zealand Division) were using the tactic, with some units using the tactic more than others (for example, the 3rd Division conducted the tactic on three out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>five</b> days in April). In some units, it was treated as a competition, with companies of the 41st Battalion competing to see who could capture the most prisoners.|$|E
