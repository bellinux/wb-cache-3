500|$|In July 1965, {{the single}} [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] peaked {{at two in}} the U.S. and at four in the UK charts. At over six minutes, the song altered what a pop single could convey. Bruce Springsteen, in his speech for Dylan's inauguration into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> the single, [...] "that snare shot sounded like somebody'd kicked open the door to your mind". In 2004 and in 2011, Rolling Stone listed it as number one of [...] "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time". The song opened Dylan's next album, Highway 61 Revisited, [...] named after the road that led from Dylan's Minnesota to the musical hotbed of New Orleans. The songs were in the same vein as the hit single, flavored by Mike Bloomfield's blues guitar and Al Kooper's organ riffs. [...] "Desolation Row", backed by {{acoustic}} guitar and understated bass, offers the sole exception, with Dylan alluding to figures in Western culture in a song described by Andy Gill as [...] "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which {{takes the form of a}} Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of celebrated characters, some historical (Einstein, Nero), some biblical (Noah, Cain and Abel), some fictional (Ophelia, Romeo, Cinderella), some literary (T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound), and some who fit into none of the above categories, notably Dr. Filth and his dubious nurse." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mother Knows Best" [...] has {{garnered}} universal acclaim {{from both}} film and music critics, several of whom admitted to enjoying the song despite being unimpressed {{with the majority}} of Tangleds music. Writing for The Blade, Kirk Baird opined that most of the film's songs [...] "aren't particularly memorable" [...] except for [...] "Mother Knows Best". Likewise, Lindsey Ward of Canoe.ca wrote, [...] "the musical numbers aren't the best things in Tangled -- the exception being 'Mother Knows Best', a brash track that scene-stealing Tony-winner Murphy alone turns into a giant spectacle with her voice". Acknowledging that [...] "The songs ... don't sound <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> like top-drawer Menken", Richard Corliss of Time described [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as [...] "a pot of poisoned honey." [...] Similarly, Anthony Quinn of The Independent wrote, [...] "The songs are no great shakes ... apart from 'Mother Knows Best'." [...] Michael Smith, writing for the Tulsa World, felt that the song's darkness [...] "remind of the nasty bits of the original Grimm's fairy tale and give Tangled a bitter balance for the sugar and spice moments." [...] Mal Vincent of The Virginian-Pilot described the song as [...] "a good villain entry." [...] Critics have continuously cited [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as the film's best song. The Scotsman hailed it as Tangleds [...] "finest song." [...] Similarly, Nigel Andrews of the Financial Times acknowledged [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as one of Tangleds [...] "best tunes," [...] while Georgie Hobbs of Little White Lies identified it as the film's [...] "standout", deeming it [...] "worthy of the very best of [...] Sondheim's crazed heroines." [...] Likewise, Ken Hanke of the Mountain Xpress highlighted [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as the [...] "standout" [...] song surrounded by [...] "passable ones." [...] Calling the song one of the film's [...] "potential Broadway showstoppers", Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times described [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] as [...] "a knockout." [...] Also singling out the track as the film's [...] "finest number", Dan Kois of The Village Voice called it [...] "a Mama Rose–worthy tune." [...] Similarly, Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Tribune felt that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] was one of the more memorable songs of the film, calling it [...] "show-stopping", and feeling that [...] "Murphy channel all the monstrous smothering power of Mama Rose in Gypsy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although earlier BBC {{radio shows}} such as Much Binding in the Marsh, Take It From Here, and Beyond Our Ken had {{conditioned}} listeners to a mix of music, sketches and jokes in a 30-minute show, and Round the Horne was also doing this, ISIRTA accelerated the transitions, and it certainly seemed more improvised. It {{was one of those}} programmes where the listener was unlikely to get all the jokes <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing,</b> so would have to listen to the scheduled repeat (or a tape recording) to discover what they had missed. It thus helped prepare the television audience for At Last the 1948 Show, Spike Milligan's Q series, Monty Python's Flying Circus, and The Goodies. It also may have influenced other spoof-based British radio programmes such as Radio Active, On the Hour, The Sunday Format, The News Huddlines, and later [...] "Bleak Expectations".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{his early}} tutors {{were among the}} first to use the thumbpick in guitar playing, freeing the fingers to pick melody, Travis's style, {{according}} to Chet Atkins, went on in musical directions [...] "never dreamt about" [...] by his predecessors. His trademark mature style incorporated elements from ragtime, blues, boogie, jazz and Western swing, and was marked by rich chord progressions, harmonics, slides and bends, and rapid changes of key. [...] He could shift quickly from finger-picking to flatpicking in the midst of a number by gripping his thumbpick like a flat pick. In his hands, the guitar resembled a full band. As his son Thom Bresh puts it, <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> his father as a child [...] "I thought it was just the coolest sound, because it sounded like a whole bunch of instruments coming from one guitar.

[...] Roth Cornet from ScreenRant was positive towards them, saying that [...] "Alan Menken’s music is as catchy, uplifting and effecting as one would expect." [...] Scott of The New York Times positively reviewed the music, saying that it [...] "takes you back to a charmed world of swoony longing and sprightly mischief," [...] with a slick and efficient atmosphere and grace notes of self-conscious classicism. Corliss from Time was also positive to the songs, noting that though [...] "don't sound <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> like top-drawer Menken," [...] the songs still [...] "smoothly fill their functions." [...] He described the opener, [...] "When Will My Life Begin?," [...] as the [...] "heroine's 'I wanna' song," [...] a Disney tradition that stretches back to Snow White's [...] "Some Day My Prince Will Come."

60|$|She {{had gone}} to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the {{strength}} of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> of his death.

No wonder he went for sympathy to the maid-servants at Mr. Lambert's lodgings. Wherever that dusky youth was, he sought comfort in the society of females. Their fair and tender bosoms knew how to feel pity for the poor African, and the darkness of Gumbo's complexion was no more repulsive to them than Othello's to Desdemona. I believe Europe has never been so squeamish in regard to Africa, as a certain other respected Quarter. Nay, some Africans--witness the Chevalier de St. Georges, for instance--have been notorious favourites with the fair sex.|$|E

5000|$|For {{fans and}} the industry, the album was like a thirst-quencher—it was {{something}} had been awaiting {{for a very long}} time. Retail sales certainly point in that direction. The S.I.G.I.T. offered a fresh approach to their kind of rock music. The production on the album— which was a long process—comes across very well. They did a lot of sound explorations, flowing from one song to another, working on beats and few other things. Probably for some people, it will be quite hard to get this <b>on</b> the <b>first</b> <b>hearing.</b> This album was not as friendly to the ear as the previous one, but this was The S.I.G.I.T. now.

6000|$|The {{outburst}} and paroxysm of Gazetteer rumor, which {{arose in}} Europe over this, must {{be left to}} the imagination; still more the whirlwind of astonishment, grief, remorse and indignation that raged in the heart of Friedrich <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> of it.

This disgrace, loss nigh ruinous; in fine, this infernal Campaign (CETTE CAMPAGNE INFEMALE)!" [...] The Anecdote-Books abound in details of Friedrich's behavior at Wilsdruf that day; mythical all, or in good part, but symbolizing a case that is conceivable to everybody.

60|$|<b>On</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing,</b> {{from some}} {{satellite}} of Oliver's, of Wrecked Islands, {{as they are}} called in the Gardens, David said wistfully that he supposed you needed to be very very good before you had any chance of being wrecked, and the remark was conveyed to Oliver, on whom it made an uncomfortable impression. For a time he tried to evade it, but ultimately David was presented to him and invited gloomily to say it again. The upshot was that Oliver advertised the Gardens of his intention to be good until he was eight, and if he had not been wrecked by that time, to be as jolly bad as a boy could be. He was naturally so bad that at the Kindergarten Academy, when the mistress ordered whoever had done the last naughty deed to step forward, Oliver's custom had been to step forward, not necessarily because he had done it, but because he presumed he very likely had.|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt this}} advice sounds <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> just a trifle paradoxical; and no doubt, too, the {{proposed}} university has certain serious drawbacks (like many others) {{on the various}} grounds of health, expense, faith, and morals. Senior Proctors are unknown at Honolulu; Select Preachers don't range {{as far as the}} West Coast. But it has always seemed to me, nevertheless, that certain elements of a liberal education are to be acquired tropically which can never be acquired in a temperate, still less in an arctic or antarctic academy. This is more especially true, I allow, in the particular cases of the biologist and the sociologist; but it is also true in a somewhat less degree of the mere common arts course, and the mere average seeker after liberal culture. Vast aspects of nature and human life exist which can never adequately be understood aright except in tropical countries; vivid side-lights are cast upon our own history and the history of our globe which can never adequately be appreciated except beneath the searching and all too garish rays of a tropical sun.|$|E

5000|$|Warrack {{adds that}} Rubinstein's criticisms fell into three categories.

[...] Second, he mentioned [...] "outside influences and unevenness of invention ... but it must be conceded that the music is uneven and that it would, like all works, seem the more uneven <b>on</b> a <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> before its style had been properly understood."

6000|$|During {{all this}} time poor Jarwin's heart had been greatly stirred. Being tatooed, and nearly naked, as well as painted {{like the rest of}} his comrades, of course no one took {{particular}} notice of him, which depressed him greatly, for he felt an intense desire to seize the missionary by the hand, and claim him as a countryman. Indeed this feeling was so strong upon him <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> Mr Williams's English tone of voice--although the missionary spoke only in the native tongue-- that he could scarcely restrain himself, and had to mutter [...] "honour bright" [...] several times, in order, as it were, to hold himself in check. [...] "Honour bright" [...] became his moral rein, or curb, on that trying occasion. But when, {{in the course of the}} palaver, Mrs Williams, who had accompanied her husband on this dangerous expedition, came forward and addressed a few words to the missionary in English, he involuntarily sprang forward with an exclamation of delight at hearing once more the old familiar tongue. He glanced, however, at Big Chief, and checked himself. There was a stern expression on the brow of the savage, but his eyes remained fixed on the ground, and his form and face were immovable, as though he heard and saw nothing.|$|E
60|$|There was no hour {{during the}} day when there was not heavy firing and {{generally}} hard fighting at some point on the line, but seldom at all points at the same time. It {{was a case of}} Southern dash against Northern pluck and endurance. Three of the five divisions engaged on Sunday were entirely raw, and many of the men had only received their arms on the way from their States to the field. Many of them had arrived but a day or two before and were hardly able to load their muskets according to the manual. Their officers were equally ignorant of their duties. Under these circumstances it is not astonishing that many of the regiments broke at the first fire. In two cases, as I now remember, colonels led their regiments from the field <b>on</b> <b>first</b> <b>hearing</b> the whistle of the enemy's bullets. In these cases the colonels were constitutional cowards, unfit for any military position; but not so the officers and men led out of danger by them.

Which, soon after that of Svein's nocturnal battle-axe, was the course adopted; and, to the joy of all parties, did prove a successful solution. Magnus agreed to part his kingdom with Uncle Harald; uncle parting his treasures, or uniting them with Magnus's poverty. Each was to be an independent king, but they were to govern in common; Magnus rather presiding. He, to sit, for example, in the High Seat alone; King Harald opposite him in a seat not quite so high, though if a stranger King came on a visit, both the Norse Kings were {{to sit in the}} High Seat. With various other punctilious regulations; which the fiery Magnus was extremely strict with; rendering the mutual relation a very dangerous one, had not both the Kings been honest men, and Harald a much more prudent and tolerant one than Magnus. They, on the whole, never had any weighty quarrel, thanks now and then rather to Harald than to Magnus. Magnus too was very noble; and Harald, with his wide experience and greater length of years, carefully held his heat of temper well covered in.|$|E
