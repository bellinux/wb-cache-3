[...] No financial statement was too intricate for her, and no contract too abstruse. <b>Once,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had to put one of her letters to me before my legal adviser... he declared firmly 'this letter must {{have been written by}} a solicitor.' He would not admit that any woman could draw up a document so cleverly guarded with qualifications. [...] Mrs. Carte, besides her natural business talent, had fine artistic taste and was a sound judge, too, of the capabilities of those who came to the theatre in search of engagements".|$|E
2500|$|Pisemsky {{remembered his}} mother a nervous, dreamy, astute, eloquent (even if not well educated) and rather sociable woman. [...] "Except for those clever eyes of hers, she wasn't good-looking, and <b>once,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a student, my father asked me: 'Tell me Aleksey, {{why do you think}} your mother becomes more {{attractive}} with age?' – 'Because {{she has a lot of}} inner beauty which, as years go by, becomes more and more evident', I answered, and he had to agree with me," [...] Pisemsky later wrote. His mother's cousins were Yury Bartenev, one of the most prominent Russian Freemasons (colonel Marfin in the novel Masons) and Vsevolod Bartenev (Esper Ivanovich in People of the Forties), a Navy officer; both exerted considerable influence upon the boy.|$|E

Only 10,000 tickets were printed for the inaugural game and 20,000 people showed up. Both Hoover and Lang had to find pots, bowls and any other available receptacles to collect admission fees. Stanford won the game. In 1892 Hoover invited Polish composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski to give a benefit concert. Hoover and his associates were unable to pay Paderewski the entire honorarium. The musician after hearing their story returned them the money so they could pay for rental of the concert hall. In 1919 Paderewski, now prime minister of Poland, traveled to America to thank the head of the American Relief Administration for helping Poland. [...] "That's all right, Mr. Paderewski," [...] Hoover replied. [...] "Besides, you don't remember it, but you helped me <b>once</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a student at college and I was in a hole." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was {{mother who}} flung the shutter into place softly and {{replaced}} the bars, and I stood {{there like a}} stupid until the house was barricaded <b>once</b> more, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said stupidly: ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. COADE (not more deceived {{than the}} others). How lovely {{it is in}} the moonlight. Roses, roses, all the way. (Dreamily.) It is like a hat <b>I</b> <b>once</b> had <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young.|$|R

6000|$|... "Hullo! That you, Norgate? This is Hebblethwaite. I'm {{just back}} from {{a few days in}} the country--found your note here. I want to hear all about this little matter at <b>once.</b> <b>When</b> can <b>I</b> see you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} that, sir," [...] said Bassett, {{more and more}} perplexed. [...] "It’s not in my book, but <b>I</b> {{remember}} <b>once</b> reading, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was at school, that spiders are sometimes attracted {{by the sound of}} a flute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the Supervisor got {{a letter}} {{yesterday}} enclosing his resignation, and asking to be relieved at <b>once.</b> And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> heard of it I asked the Supervisor to bring me down to see him; he's too good a man to lose." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "None whatever.
