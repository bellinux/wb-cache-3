Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> <b>to</b> indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring. Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking lattes. The character's new addiction to coffee was suggested by writer-producer David Mirkin, who has friends who stopped drinking alcohol and became addicted to coffee.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms from {{complete}} isolation, called sensory deprivation, often include anxiety, sensory illusions, or even distortions {{of time and}} perception.

The general accountant has in mind the preparation of correct, unpadded statements of condition and of operation.

Reconciliation of the opposing ideas ought to be possible, perhaps along the lines suggested by Messrs. Nicholson and Rohrbach.|$|E
