5|$|Wilson's {{experience}} in the militia, service with the 22nd Massachusetts, and chairmanship of the Military Affairs Committee provided him with more practical military knowledge and training than any other Senator. He made use <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience</b> throughout the war to frame, explain, defend and advocate for legislation on military matters, including enlistment of soldiers and sailors, and organizing and supplying the rapidly expanding Union Army and Union Navy.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as they were used to send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience,</b> Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.|$|E
5|$|There are two known {{photographs}} of Bahá'u'lláh, both {{taken at the}} same occasion in 1868 {{while he was in}} Adrianople (present-day Edirne). The one where he looks at the camera was taken for passport purposes and is reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bahá'í Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the Bahá'í World Centre, and one is on display in the International Archives building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized pilgrimage. Outside <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience</b> Bahá'ís prefer not to view his photos in public, or even to display any of them in their private homes, and Bahá'í institution strongly suggests to use an image of Bahá'u'lláh's burial shrine instead.|$|E

25|$|After high school, Walker went to Spelman College in Atlanta {{on a full}} {{scholarship}} in 1961 and later transferred to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, graduating in 1966. Walker was strongly affected by becoming pregnant and having an abortion {{in the summer of}} 1965 before her senior year of college. She became severely depressed and determined to commit suicide.

25|$|Upon graduation, Obama {{worked for}} a year in business. He moved to Chicago, where he {{worked for a}} {{non-profit}} as a community organizer in the Altgeld Gardens housing project on the city's mostly black South Side. Obama recounts the difficulty of the experience, as his program faced resistance from entrenched community leaders and apathy {{on the part of the}} established bureaucracy. During this period, Obama first visited Chicago's Trinity United Church of Christ, which became the center of his spiritual life. Before attending Harvard Law School, Obama decided to visit relatives in Kenya. He recounts part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience</b> in the final, emotional third of the book. Obama used his memoir to reflect on his personal experiences with race and race relations in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In April 2000, Rose-Tu, {{a female}} {{elephant}} {{born at the}} zoo, was severely abused by her handler, resulting in 176 lacerations including puncture wounds allegedly due to the handler attempting to shove a bullhook into her anus.

The handler was let off with a minimal sentence, the best that the state laws could do at the time. As a fall out from this incident, Animal Legal Defense Fund authored the Rose-Tu law, signed by Governor Kitzhaber in 2001. The law made Oregon the first {{state in the country}} to legally recognize the link between animal abuse and violence toward people, and increased the penalties for animal abuse.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Sciascia {{was elected}} for the Radical Party in the House of Deputies {{and become a}} member of the {{committee}} of the House for the investigation into Moro's kidnapping, which stated that there was a certain amount of negligence on the part of the Christian Democrat Party in their stance that the state was bigger than a person, and that they would not swap Moro for 13 political prisoners, even though Moro himself had stated that the swapping of innocent people for political prisoners was a valid option in negotiations with terrorists. However, senior members of the party disagreed with this stance and were of the view that Moro had been drugged and tortured to utter these words.

25|$|Page 13 - Finally, a word {{should be}} said for the inestimable value of the Type JR-1 relay {{operated}} battle lanterns, which were the only source of illumination after the ship's lighting system failed. The confidence that these beams of light along the exit routes maintained in the men contributed largely to the lack of panic and contributed to the saving of many lives. There were 110 of these lanterns installed throughout the ship in locations best suited for just such an emergency. This is twice the number shown in the ship's machinery allowance book. The excess was obtained through an error, but in view <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>experience</b> it is believed that the quantity of 110 is the acceptable minimum for cruisers. It is recommended that the allowance of this item for cruisers be increased accordingly and that it be increased proportionately for other types of ships.|$|E
