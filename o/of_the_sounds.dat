5|$|The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an {{alphabetic}} {{system of}} phonetic notation {{based primarily on}} the Latin alphabet. It was devised by the International Phonetic Association in the late 19th century as a standardized representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of spoken language. The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators and translators.|$|E

He died following the inaugural season, after which Bob Jamison was hired for the 1979 season. Jamison remained the voice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> through 1990 {{when he was}} hired as the radio broadcaster for the California Angels. Nashville-native and future sports talk show host George Plaster served as a color commentator from 1980 to 1981 and 1985 to 1986. For the 1991 season, the Sounds hired former Huntsville Stars and Iowa Cubs broadcaster Steve Carroll. After 1995, Carroll left to become the radio voice of the NHL's Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{has been}} written {{with a number of}} {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day. However, the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for the Jews, and it became the source for the modern Hebrew alphabet. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of Biblical Hebrew, though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, no {{official}} album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs {{featured in the}} film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sounds,</b> Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name is Death during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sound</b> {{generator}} {{is turned}} on and the piston is adjusted until <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> from <b>the</b> tube suddenly gets much louder.

This means <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> round-trip path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> waves, from one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube {{to the other and}} back again, is a multiple <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wavelength λ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> waves. Therefore <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube is a multiple of half a wavelength. At this point <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> waves in <b>the</b> tube are in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> standing waves, and <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> vibrations of air are zero at equally spaced intervals along the tube, called the nodes.

5|$|The {{contrasting}} {{geography of}} Northern England is reflected its literature. On the one hand, the wild moors and lakes have inspired generations of Romantic authors: {{the poetry of}} William Wordsworth and the novels of the Brontë sisters {{are perhaps the most}} famous examples of writing inspired by these elemental forces. Classics of children's literature such as The Railway Children (1906), The Secret Garden (1911) and Swallows and Amazons (1930) portray these largely untouched landscapes as worlds of adventure and transformation where their protagonists can break free of the restrictions of society. Modern poets such as the former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Oxford Professor of Poetry Simon Armitage have found inspiration in the Northern countryside, producing works that take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> and rhythms of Northern English dialects.|$|E
5|$|Vocalizations made {{by right}} whales are not {{elaborate}} {{compared to those}} made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500Hz. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> is not known but may {{be a form of}} communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts {{to reduce the number of}} ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.|$|E
5|$|While the Leslie {{speaker is}} still made and sold, similar effects {{can now be}} {{obtained}} via analogue electronic devices and digital emulation. Chorus and phase shifter devices can give an approximation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> produced by a Leslie speaker. The Uni-Vibe, a four-stage phase shifter, was specifically marketed as a low-cost Leslie substitute for guitarists, and used a foot-operated fast/slow switch similar to the combo preamp. The pedal was popular, and notable users included Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour and Robin Trower, but vintage units tend {{not to be in}} good condition now due to the degradation of capacitors in the unit. Although the sound of a Leslie speaker heard in person is quite distinct, digital clones have become increasingly better at emulating it.|$|E

5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E
5|$|The aging Greer Stadium was {{not meant}} to last longer than 30years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds {{proposed}} a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sounds</b> lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor Bill Purcell agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, {{due in part to the}} Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks and avoiding taxpayer expense. It was to be called First Tennessee Field. Opening day at the proposed new venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.|$|E
