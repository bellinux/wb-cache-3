5|$|As unrest grew the 64th {{took place}} in an {{incident}} which lays a claim to the first blood of the American War of Independence being shed in Salem, Massachusetts. On 26 February 1775 a supply <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> ammunition {{was known to be}} in Salem. The 64th, under their commander Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Leslie, were ordered to seize the weapons. American patriots in Salem were forewarned and tried to prevent the 64th from carrying out their orders. In the scuffle that ensued a local Salem man, Joseph Whicher, was slightly injured by a British bayonet. Negotiations prevented any further bloodshed and the 64th withdrew to Boston, their mission a failure.|$|E
5|$|Chānakya (c. 350–283 BC), {{also known}} as Kautilya, was adviser and prime {{minister}} to the first Maurya Emperor Chandragupta (c. 340–293 BC). Kautilya suggested employing means such as seduction, secret use <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>and</b> poison for political gain. He also urged detailed precautions against assassination—tasters for food and elaborate ways to detect poison. In addition, {{the death penalty for}} violations of royal decrees was frequently administered through the use of poison.|$|E
5|$|During its {{development}} the ZNG experienced {{a number of}} problems, including shortages <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> ammunition, lack of uniforms, inadequate training and an overall deficiency in trained officers, and poor staff work and command structures (preventing the effective coordination of multiple units). These problems were offset by good morale, clear objectives {{and high levels of}} mobilisation. After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija). By the end of October 60 new brigades and independent battalions were established, and on 3 November the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska).|$|E

5|$|On 18 March, the Cambodian National Assembly deposed Sihanouk {{and named}} Lon Nol as {{provisional}} head of state. This led Sihanouk to immediately establish a government-in-exile in Beijing and to ally himself with North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge, the NLF, and the Laotian Pathet Lao. In doing so, Sihanouk lent {{his name and}} popularity {{in the rural areas}} of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. The North Vietnamese response to the coup was swift. PAVN began directly supplying large amounts <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> advisors to the Khmer Rouge, and Cambodia plunged into civil war.|$|E

5|$|Operation Osterei (Easter Egg) {{began on}} 12 April 1944 {{with the goal}} of {{clearing}} the Majevica mountain, which was held by elements of the 3rd Corps led by General Kosta Nađ. The 27th Regiment quickly captured Janja and drove through Donja Trnova to reach the Ugljevik coal mines, an important economic objective for the German war machine. Following fighting which continued into the evening of 13 April, the 27th Regiment reported Partisan casualties of 106 dead, 45 captured and two deserters along with large amounts <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> ammunition. The regiment also seized a huge amount of medical supplies from aid stations in the area of Donja Trnova.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} faced by the ZNG included a shortage of trained officers, inadequate troop training, a shortage <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> especially a shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes. The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E

5|$|The Nazis {{seized from}} the French {{thousands}} of locomotives and rolling stock, stockpiles <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> raw {{materials such as}} copper, tin, oil and nickel. Financial demands were levied on {{the governments of the}} occupied countries as well and payments for occupation costs were received from France, Belgium and Norway. Barriers to trade led to hoarding, black markets and uncertainty about the future. Food supplies were precarious; production dropped in most areas of Europe, {{but not as much as}} during World War I. Greece experienced famine in the first year of occupation and the Netherlands in the last year of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Sack of Damietta was a {{successful}} raid on {{the port city of}} Damietta on the Nile Delta by the Byzantine navy on 22–24 May 853. The city, whose garrison was absent at the time, was sacked and plundered, yielding not only many captives but also large quantities <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> supplies intended for the Emirate of Crete. The Byzantine attack, which was repeated in the subsequent years, shocked the Abbasid authorities, and urgent measures were taken to refortify the coasts and strengthen the local fleet, beginning a revival of the Egyptian navy that culminated in the Tulunid and Fatimid periods.|$|E
5|$|Within the Celtic spiritual sphere {{there is}} {{considerable}} variation. The 4th and early 3rd century BC burials in Wrocław and Ślęża region are skeletal. Sometimes {{a man and a}} woman were buried together, suggesting the known Celtic practice of killing the wife during her husband's funeral, but women were usually buried separately, with their jewelry. Some of the dead were given meat and a knife for cutting it. From the 3rd century on the bodies were cremated, which was also the case in all of the Lesser Poland burials. There in Iwanowice the graves of Celtic warriors (3rd century BC) contain a very rich assortment <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> decorations.|$|E

5|$|After the French {{conquest of}} Algeria, Abdelkader El Djezairi {{declared}} war against France, and requested assistance from Sultan Abd al-Rahman of Morocco. When the Sultan responded favorably, it triggered the Franco-Moroccan War. France sent warships to bombard Tangier on 6 August 1844, destroying {{large parts of}} the city and its defenses. The French then bombarded Essaouira, and occupied the Iles Purpuraires. After the French army defeated the Moroccan cavalry at the Battle of Isly on 14 August 1844, Sultan Abd al-Rahman asked for peace with France, leading to the signing of the Treaty of Tangier on 10 September 1844. Morocco's defeat caused a revolt in Rabat; in Salé, the city's nobility, known as the Sharif, {{sent a letter to the}} Sultan complaining about the lack <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> ammunition in the city.|$|E
5|$|Alien Soldier is a side-scrolling run and gun {{video game}} {{developed}} by Treasure {{and published by}} Sega for the Mega Drive. Retail copies were released in Japan and PAL territories while in North America it was only available exclusively via the Sega Channel cable service. The story follows a powerful being named Epsilon-Eagle, who after being nearly killed becomes determined to avenge his near death and save his planet. The character has a variety <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>and</b> moves that the player must master to complete the game. Many gameplay ideas are borrowed from Treasure's earlier Mega Drive release, Gunstar Heroes (1993). However, Alien Soldier puts an emphasis on challenging boss fights with short and easy levels serving as downtime in-between.|$|E
5|$|As the NK 9th Division {{approached}} Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on {{the north}} and its 2nd Regiment on the south. The division's attached support, consisting of one 76mm artillery battalion from the NK I Corps, an antiaircraft battalion of artillery, two tank battalions of the NK 16th Armored Brigade, and a battalion of artillery from the NK 4th Division, gave it unusually heavy support. Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> <b>and</b> made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured North Korean document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of NK I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1.|$|E

50|$|The Tomb of the TaskMaker {{features}} additional gameplay aspects, {{while retaining}} many {{elements of the}} first game {{such as the use}} <b>of</b> <b>weapons,</b> potions, spells <b>and</b> wands, and most of the monster designs. New options include the ability to choose a male or female character, as well as the role of magician, fighter or thief. A fighter can use every form <b>of</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>and</b> armor, a magician can cast certain spells that other players cannot, and a thief can pick locks and steal objects. Although only the fighter can wield and wear every piece <b>of</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>and</b> armour in the game, the most powerful ones can be wielded and worn by all three classes. Hell has been redesigned to involve doing a deplorable task such as bestowing gifts to demons, killing bunnies, throwing random switches or binning a large number of gold bars. After doing one of these tasks, the exit will be open.|$|R
