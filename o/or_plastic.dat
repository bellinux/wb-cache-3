5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel is a savory butter {{prepared}} by mixing softened butter with very finely minced parsley, lemon juice, salt and pepper. A ratio of around 1.5 tablespoons of parsley to two ounces of butter may be used. Additional ingredients may include shallot and Worcestershire sauce. Vinegar is sometimes used, although its inclusion is rare. Cayenne pepper {{has also been}} used. After mixing, it is typically rolled in parchment paper <b>or</b> <b>plastic</b> wrap and chilled to harden.|$|E
5|$|Nativity scenes {{have not}} escaped controversy. A life-sized {{scene in the}} United Kingdom {{featuring}} waxworks celebrities provoked outrage in 2004, and, in Spain, a city council forbade the exhibition of a traditional toilet humor character in a public nativity scene. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) indicates that animals in living displays lack proper care and suffer abuse. In the United States, nativity scenes on public lands and in public buildings have provoked court challenges, and the prankish theft of ceramic <b>or</b> <b>plastic</b> nativity figurines from outdoor displays has become commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant glass <b>or</b> <b>plastic,</b> needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used}} to support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E

5|$|Using this information, {{a plan of}} {{the optimal}} {{distribution}} of the radiation sources can be developed. This includes consideration of how the source carriers (applicators), which are used to deliver the radiation to the treatment site, should be placed and positioned. Applicators are non-radioactive and are typically needles <b>or</b> <b>plastic</b> catheters. The specific type of applicator used {{will depend on the}} type of cancer being treated and the characteristics of the target tumour.|$|E
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered metal <b>or</b> <b>plastic</b> tag to the leg or wing of a {{wild bird}} to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal <b>or</b> <b>plastic</b> dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E

For example, extrusion molding {{is a way of}} producing lengths of metals <b>or</b> <b>plastics</b> <b>or</b> other materials with a particular cross-section. This nozzle is typically referred to as a die.|$|R
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} <b>or</b> <b>plastic</b> cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween day, {{she goes}} to the party store, but it is closed. However, the store manager appears and allows her into the shop. She dismisses the masks she sees on display as not good enough for scaring anyone. But she sneaks into a back room and discovers a row of hideously {{deformed}} masks. She is startled to find that the masks feel warm and like human skin, not rubber <b>or</b> <b>plastic.</b> The store owner reluctantly sells her one of the masks and Carly Beth goes home in delight. Later that day, after she takes the mold of her head that her mother made, she puts on the mask and goes in search of Chuck and Steve, determined to get revenge on them. She starts acting more and more aggressively as the night goes on: she chokes Sabrina, throws apples at a house, and frightens children she doesn't know. When she manages to scare Chuck and Steve, she loses the head her mother made, but no longer cares.|$|E

50|$|Luminescent solar {{concentrators}} convert sunlight {{or other}} sources of light into preferred frequencies; they concentrate the output for conversion into desirable forms of power, such as electricity. They rely on luminescence, typically fluorescence, in media such as liquids, glasses, <b>or</b> <b>plastics</b> treated with a suitable coating or dopant. The structures are configured to direct the output from a large input area onto a small converter, where the concentrated energy generates photoelectricity. The objective is to collect light over a large area at low cost; luminescent concentrator panels can be made cheaply from materials such as glasses <b>or</b> <b>plastics,</b> while photovoltaic cells are high-precision, high-technology devices, and accordingly expensive to construct in large sizes.|$|R
50|$|Such collars are {{typically}} made from leather, {{but may also}} be made from metal, rubber <b>or</b> <b>plastics</b> such as PVC.

25|$|Concrete {{reinforced}} with fibers (which are usually steel, glass, <b>or</b> <b>plastic</b> fibers) is {{less expensive than}} hand-tied rebar, while still increasing the tensile strength many times. The shape, dimension, and length of the fiber are important. A thin and short fiber, for example short, hair-shaped glass fiber, is only effective during the first hours after pouring the concrete (its function is to reduce cracking while the concrete is stiffening), {{but it will not}} increase the concrete tensile strength. A normal-size fiber for European shotcrete (1mm diameter, 45mm length—steel <b>or</b> <b>plastic)</b> will increase the concrete's tensile strength.|$|E
