5|$|The {{scene in}} which Desmond goes nude {{swimming}} {{was not included in}} the same form in Etheridge's version of the episode; however, Thomas enjoyed the take that was eventually used more, so he put it in the final cut. Because the show could not show full nudity, they gave the stunt performer who was filling in for Rudd flesh-colored swim briefs and put him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> so they could notify the network that the man <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> was indeed clothed. The lights that can be seen in the distant background of the scene illuminating the bay were placed nearly ten miles away by grips.|$|E
5|$|Director of {{photography}} Mark Irwin was fired during filming of Screams finale, {{a week before}} principal photography was to be completed. Upon review of the dailies, Craven found the footage was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> and unusable. Irwin was initially ordered to fire his camera crew. He retorted that if his crew were to be fired, they {{would also have to}} fire him. The producers fired him and replaced him with Peter Deming, who finished the film.|$|E
5|$|Max Payne 2 {{uses the}} same game engine as the one used in Max Payne, but with several {{significant}} upgrades. Even though the game only supports DirectX 8.1, the graphics in Max Payne 2 mimic those generated by DirectX 9 by making optimal use of effects such as reflection, refraction, shaders, and ghosting. The developers considered one particular scene in which effects are used well: When Max has lucid dreams, the screen appears fuzzy and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> Since Max Payne, the polygon count (the number of polygons rendered per frame) has been increased, which smooths out the edges of character models. In addition, characters have a much greater range of expressions. Previously, Max had only one expression available; in Max Payne 2, he often smirks and moves his eyebrows to react to different scenarios.|$|E

5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The Dark Side of the Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E
5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E

She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E

25|$|The use of oblique (from the side) {{illumination}} {{gives the}} image a three-dimensional (3D) appearance and can highlight otherwise invisible features.

Oblique illumination suffers from the same limitations as bright field microscopy (low contrast of many biological samples; low apparent resolution due to <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> objects).|$|E
25|$|To help {{mitigate}} the above effects, the latest EUV tool introduced in 2017, the NXE:3400B, features a membrane {{that separates the}} wafer from the projection optics of the tool, protecting the latter from outgassing from the resist on the wafer. The membrane contains layers which absorb DUV and IR radiation, and transmits 85-90% of the incident EUV radiation. There is of course, accumulated contamination from wafer outgassing as well as particles in general (although the latter are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus,</b> they may still obstruct light).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} marketing {{challenges in}} the special context of software component business. Commercial software components have {{received a lot of}} attention in current research on software engineering and software business. Technical aspects of developing and using this kind of software have been discussed rather extensively in the literature. In addition to these, also the management related aspects have received a growing attention. However, these management studies have so far mainly been concentrated on the buyer’s point of view, leaving the supplier perspective and the question how to market and sell the developed software components <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> the current literature, yet the marketing issues represent big challenges for these companies. The idea of software component business is to have competitive markets where software components can be sold and bought as standard components and exchanges can be conducted without much joint development work between the software seller and buyer. However, this kind of ideal for single exchanges in an industry where close co-operation has traditionally been needed in exchanges creates many marketing challenges especially in terms of customer interface. Thus, in this specific context, we are dealing with very interesting marketing questions...|$|R

25|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three-dimensional information of biological structures. However, this information is blurred by the fact that, upon illumination, all fluorescently labeled structures emit light, irrespective of whether they are in focus or not. So {{an image of a}} certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures that are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high resolving power, typically oil immersion objectives with a high numerical aperture.|$|E
25|$|Depth {{of field}} can be {{anywhere}} from {{a fraction of a}} millimeter to virtually infinite. In some cases, such as landscapes, it may be desirable to have the entire image sharp, and a large DOF is appropriate. In other cases, artistic considerations may dictate that only a part of the image be in focus, emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the background, perhaps giving only a suggestion of the environment (Langford 1973, 81). For example, a common technique in melodramas and horror films is a closeup of a person's face, with someone just behind that person visible but <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> A portrait or close-up still photograph might use a small DOF to isolate the subject from a distracting background. The use of limited DOF to emphasize one part of an image is known as selective focus, differential focus or shallow focus.|$|E
25|$|Saul Swimmer's Concert for Bangladesh {{documentary}} combined {{footage from}} both of the Madison Square Garden shows held on 1 August 1971, using George Harrison's preference of the performances of the songs. Harrison later explained {{that much of the}} concert footage was unusable, as a camera on the right-hand side of the venue was faulty and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus</b> throughout, while the one opposite, down the left side, had cables hanging down in front of it. The compromised quality would result in some brutal edits in the released movie – Eric Clapton, for instance, appears to change jackets and guitar part-way through a song (Leon Russell's medley in particular). In an interview accompanying the 2005 DVD release of the film, Swimmer would cite the audio syncing and the frame-by-frame conversion to 70mm format (from the original 16mm) as other challenging, labour-intensive tasks. With work almost completed on the Concert for Bangladesh live album, Harrison is said to have begun editing the footage on 6 September; at some stage during the next few months, he was joined in this lengthy process by Bob Dylan.|$|E

25|$|Depth {{of field}} {{increases}} with f-number, {{as illustrated in}} the image here. This means that photographs taken with a low f-number (large aperture) will tend to have subjects at one distance in focus, {{with the rest of}} the image (nearer and farther elements) <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>focus.</b> This is frequently used for nature photography and portraiture because background blur (the aesthetic quality of which is known as 'bokeh') can be aesthetically pleasing and puts the viewer's focus on the main subject in the foreground. The depth of field of an image produced at a given f-number is dependent on other parameters as well, including the focal length, the subject distance, and the format of the film or sensor used to capture the image. Depth of field can be described as depending on just angle of view, subject distance, and entrance pupil diameter (as in von Rohr's method). As a result, smaller formats will have a deeper field than larger formats at the same f-number for the same distance of focus and same angle of view since a smaller format requires a shorter focal length (wider angle lens) to produce the same angle of view, and depth of field increases with shorter focal lengths. Therefore, reduced–depth-of-field effects will require smaller f-numbers when using small-format cameras than when using larger-format cameras.|$|E
