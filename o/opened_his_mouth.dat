25|$|During World War II, both Japanese {{military}} personnel, {{especially the}} Kempeitai, {{and the officers}} of the Gestapo, the German secret police, used waterboarding {{as a method of}} torture. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, the Double Tenth Incident occurred. This included waterboarding, by the method of binding or holding down the victim on his back, placing a cloth over his mouth and nose, and pouring water onto the cloth. In this version, interrogation continued during the torture, with the interrogators beating the victim if he did not reply and the victim swallowing water if he <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> to answer or breathe. When the victim could ingest no more water, the interrogators would beat or jump on his distended stomach.|$|E

Roosevelt's Secretary of War Elihu Root said of Parker that he [...] "has never <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> on any national question", but Roosevelt feared that the man's neutrality would prove a political advantage, writing that [...] "the neutral-tinted individual is very apt to win against the man of pronounced views and active life".|$|E

Together with the other two long-serving regents of 1886–1887, Stambolov and Zhivkov, Mutkurov was one of only three persons to receive the Order of Bravery 1st grade, the oldest and highest Bulgarian military decoration.|$|E

[...] "The second he <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and started reading the scene, I {{knew it was}} him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal {{admitted that he had}} no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E

500|$|While in {{the comics}} Shaw's {{absorption}} power was depicted by having him {{grow up to}} ten times his original size, First Class instead does what company Digital Domain called a [...] "kinetic echo", where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated [...] "iterations" [...] that appear in a short period, to [...] "see [...] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way". According to Dykstra, {{the biggest problem with}} Frost's diamond body was depicting it [...] "without looking like she was made of Jell-o or the polygon model of a human being". The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make look more like a faceted crystal than glass, was rotomated into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips. As the character kept on {{going in and out of}} her diamond form, a motion capture tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference. For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way, and the designers added iridescence to [...] "make the wings prettier". The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as Schlieren photography. The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings, concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then match moved into Till's mimed throwing. For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig. Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the [...] "inky smoky effects" [...] used with Nightcrawler, who appeared in X2 and is Azazel's son in the comics. However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke [...] "because he was more closely aligned with the devil". The fire was also used [...] "as a mask to hide or reveal the body", according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson. Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble [...] "a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness" [...] by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with dry ice, which was augmented by computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with [...] "the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca." [...] For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.|$|E

2500|$|Elizabeth Abbott, in her History of Celibacy, contends that, {{although}} Leonardo {{was probably}} homosexual, {{the trauma of}} the sodomy case converted him to celibacy {{for the rest of his}} life. A similar view of a homosexually-inclined but chaste Leonardo appears in a famous 1910 paper by Sigmund Freud, Leonardo da Vinci, A Memory of His Childhood, which analysed a memory Leonardo described of having been attacked as a baby by a bird of prey that <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and [...] "stuck me with the tail inside my lips again and again".

[...] Even the one serious negative onstage incident, at Fat Sam's in Dundee on 21 May 2011 when Ant reacted angrily to some crowd elements who booed his kilt decorated with the St George's Cross (as previously worn at the Dark Mills concert) was mitigated by local newspaper The Courier as merely a [...] "disappointing end to {{what had been a}} great show by the 56-year-old, who still looks the part and still managed a near two-hour set including hits like Goody Two Shoes, Stand And Deliver, Dog Eat Dog and Kings of the Wild Frontier, bringing huge cheers and two encores." [...] The tour closed in Manchester on 5 June with a show at the city's Manchester Academy which was applauded by frequent supporter John Robb in hyperbolic fashion: [...] "What a great singer he is, the yodelling is really fab, it's that very Adam touch of pure pop and dark underground... {{this is one of the}} great rock n roll voices, a brilliant clarity that cuts like a knife even two weeks into a tour. [...] The set list is perfect. Loads of 'Dirk' period stuff. Plastic Surgery, Kick, Cartrouble, Cleopatra, Physical but also the hits including a great stripped down Prince Charming, and a whole host of off the cuff covers.

2500|$|The Midrash ha-Ne'lam (The Midrash of the Concealed) {{told that}} when Noah left the Ark {{and saw the}} terrible {{destruction}} all around, he wept and cried out to God that God should have shown compassion for God’s creatures. [...] God called Noah a foolish shepherd and asked why Noah complained only then, and not when God told Noah in [...] “You have I seen righteous before Me in this generation”; or when in [...] God told Noah, “And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh”; or when in [...] God told Noah, “Make an ark of gopher wood.” God told Noah those things so that Noah would seek compassion for the world. [...] But as soon as Noah heard {{that he would be}} saved in the Ark, the evil of the world did not touch his heart. [...] Noah built the Ark and saved himself! [...] Now that the world had been destroyed, Noah <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> before God with prayers and supplications! [...] When Noah realized his mistake, he offered sacrifices, as [...] says, “And Noah built an altar to the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.” Similarly, the Midrash ha-Ne'lam contrasted Noah with the righteous heroes who arose for Israel afterward. [...] Noah did not shield his generation and did not pray for them as Abraham did for his. [...] For as soon as God told Abraham in [...] “the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,” immediately in [...] “Abraham drew near, and said.” Abraham countered God with more and more words until he implored that if just ten righteous people were found there, God would grant atonement to the generation for their sake. [...] Abraham thought that there were ten in the city, counting Lot and his wife, his daughters and sons-in-law, and that is why he beseeched no further.|$|E
