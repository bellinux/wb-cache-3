40|$|Nitinol stent <b>oversizing</b> is {{frequently}} performed in peripheral arteries {{to ensure a}} desirable lumen gain. However, the clinical effect of mis-sizing remains controversial. The goal {{of this study was}} to provide a better understanding of the structural and hemodynamic effects of Nitinol stent <b>oversizing.</b> Five patient-specific numerical models of non-calcified popliteal arteries were developed to simulate the deployment of Nitinol stents with <b>oversizing</b> ratios ranging from 1. 1 to 1. 8. In addition to arterial biomechanics, computational fluid dynamics methods were adopted to simulate the physiological blood flow inside the stented arteries. Results showed that stent <b>oversizing</b> led to a limited increase in the acute lumen gain, albeit at the cost of a significant increase in arterial wall stresses. Furthermore, localized areas affected by low Wall Shear Stress increased with higher <b>oversizing</b> ratios. Stents were also negatively impacted by the procedure as their fatigue safety factors gradually decreased with <b>oversizing.</b> These adverse effects to both the artery walls and stents may create circumstances for restenosis. Although the ideal <b>oversizing</b> ratio is stent-specific, this study showed that Nitinol stent <b>oversizing</b> has a very small impact on the immediate lumen gain, which contradicts the clinical motivations of the procedure.

30|$|MDCT {{can provide}} better {{estimates}} {{of both the}} long- and short-axis diameter of the aortic annulus, surface area and perimeter measurements. Extensive {{work has been done}} to establish the role of MDCT in aortic annular sizing with Edward Sapiens transcatheter heart valves (THV) [11, 26, 46]. While exaggerated <b>oversizing</b> of the THV and excessive calcification of the native aortic valve can result in aortic annular rupture, some THV <b>oversizing</b> is required for both types of THV to prevent PAR. For the CoreValve device the recommended device/annulus <b>oversizing</b> is 15  % of the aortic basal ring perimeter. For the Edwards Sapiens valve, the recommended device/annulus <b>oversizing</b> is 15 – 25  % of the area and 7 – 12  % of the mean diameter. This degree of <b>oversizing</b> of the THV appears to provide the best risk-benefit ratio in terms of PAR reduction and conduction disorders [57, 58]. Undersizing of the THV can lead to increased PAR and greater likelihood of valve ‘pop-out’ or migration [10, 59].|$|R

40|$|PurposeThe role of {{endovascular}} graft <b>oversizing</b> on risk of distal graft migration following endovascular aneurysm repair for abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} is poorly understood. A controlled in vitro {{investigation of the}} role of <b>oversizing</b> in graft-aorta attachment strength for endovascular grafts (EVGs) with barbs was performed. MethodsBarbed stent grafts (N = 20) with controlled graft <b>oversizing</b> varying from 4 - 45 % were fabricated while maintaining other design variables unchanged. A flow loop with physiological flow characteristics and a biosynthetic aortic aneurysm phantom (synthetic aneurysm model with a bovine aortic neck) were developed. The stent grafts were deployed into the aortic neck of the bio-synthetic aortic aneurysm phantom under realistic flow conditions. Computed tomography imaging of the graft-aorta complex was used to document attachment characteristics such as graft apposition, number of barbs penetrated, and penetration depth and angle. The strength of graft attachment to the aortic neck was assessed using mechanical pullout testing. Stent grafts were categorized into four groups based on oversizing: 4 - 10 %; 11 - 20 %; 21 - 30 %; and greater than 30 % <b>oversizing.</b> ResultsPullout force, a measure of post-deployment fixation strength was not different between 4 - 10 % (6. 23 ± 1. 90 N), 11 - 20 % (6. 25 ± 1. 84 N) and 20 - 30 % (5. 85 ± 1. 89 N) groups, but significantly lower for the group with greater than 30 % <b>oversizing</b> (3. 67 ± 1. 41 N). Increasing <b>oversizing</b> caused a proportional {{decrease in the number of}} barbs penetrating the aortic wall (correlation = − 0. 83). Of the 14 barbs available in the stent graft, 89 % of the barbs (12. 5 of 14 on average) penetrated the aortic wall in the 4 - 10 % <b>oversizing</b> group while only 38 % (5. 25 of 14) did for the greater than 30 % group (P <. 001). Also, the stent grafts with greater than 30 % <b>oversizing</b> showed significantly poorer apposition characteristics such as eccentric compression or folding of the graft perimeter. The number and depth of barb penetration were found to be positively correlated to pullout force. ConclusionGreater than 30 % graft <b>oversizing</b> affects both barb penetration and graft apposition adversely resulting in a low pullout force in this in vitro model. Barbed stent grafts with excessive <b>oversizing</b> are likely to result in poor fixation and increased risk of migration. Clinical RelevanceMigration of the endovascular grafts in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients continues to be a cause of long-term complication in patients. This study is an assessment {{of the role of}} graft <b>oversizing,</b> a key variable chosen by the physician, on the fixation strength of these implants to the parent aorta.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundGenerous endograft <b>oversizing</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with propensity for aortic neck dilation and subsequent device migration in endografts without suprarenal fixation. Effects of variable <b>oversizing</b> of endografts with suprarenal fixation have been poorly studied. MethodsThree hundred fifty-one patients underwent endovascular AAA repair (EVAR) in a prospective multicenter trial using the Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft, a fully supported bifurcated 3 -piece endograft with barb-enhanced suprarenal stent fixation. Blinded core-laboratory measurement of variables was prospectively recorded at predischarge and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after the procedure. Potential influence of endograft <b>oversizing</b> on subsequent aortic neck dilation (minor axis), aneurysm shrinkage (major axis), device migration, endoleak, rupture, open conversion, and death were retrospectively studied. Data are given as mean ± SEM. ResultsRisk of endograft migration (> 5 mm) at 12 months was 2. 3 % (6 / 261). However, patients with endograft <b>oversizing</b> of > 30 % had a 14 % (4 / 29) migration risk compared with those oversized ≤ 30 % (0. 9 %, 2 / 232), P 10 mm or clinical event). Device <b>oversizing</b> > 30 % was associated with decreased AAA sac shrinkage (48 % vs 77 %) and with increased sac enlargement (9. 5 % vs 0. 6 %) at 24 months when compared with <b>oversizing</b> of ≤ 30 %, respectively (P =. 001). Incidence rate of any endoleak at 12 and 24 months was 8. 2 % (21 / 256) and 7. 1 % (12 / 169), respectively. <b>Oversizing</b> of endografts by > 30 % was associated with an increased type II endoleak rate (11 vs 4. 7 %) that failed to reach statistical significance (P =. 27). Aortic neck diameters increased significantly by 6 months (P 30 % was associated with an ∼ 14 -fold increase in device migration (> 5 mm) at 12 months and with a ∼ 16 -fold increased risk of AAA expansion at 24 months.

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} assess the {{differential}} adherence to transcatheter heart valve (THV) -oversizing principles between transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and multislice computed tomography (CT) {{and its impact on}} the incidence of paravalvular leak (PVL). BackgroundCT has emerged as an alternative to 2 -dimensional TEE for THV sizing. MethodsIn our early experience, TEE-derived aortic annular diameters determined THV size selection. CT datasets originally obtained for vascular screening were retrospectively interrogated to determine CT-derived annular diameters. Annular dimensions and expected THV <b>oversizing</b> were compared between TEE and CT. The incidence of PVL was correlated to TEE- and CT-based <b>oversizing</b> calculations. ResultsUsing TEE-derived annulus measurements, 157 patients underwent CoreValve implantation (23 mm: n = 66; 29 mm: n = 91). The estimated THV <b>oversizing</b> on the basis of TEE was 20. 1 ± 8. 2 %. Retrospective CT analysis yielded larger annular diameters than TEE (p < 0. 0001). When these CT diameters were used to recalculate the percentage of <b>oversizing</b> achieved with the TEE-selected CoreValve, the actual THV <b>oversizing</b> was only 10. 4 ± 7. 8 %. Consequently, CT analysis suggested that up to 50 % of patients received an inappropriate CoreValve size. When CT-based sizing criteria were satisfied, the incidence of PVL was 21 % lower than that with echocardiography (14 % vs. 35 %; p =  0. 003). Adherence to CT-based <b>oversizing</b> was independently associated with a reduced incidence of PVL (odds ratio 0. 36; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 14 to 0. 90; p = 0. 029); adherence to TEE-based sizing was not. ConclusionsRetrospective CT-based annular analysis revealed that CoreValve size selection by TEE was incorrect in 50 % of patients. The percentage of <b>oversizing</b> with CT was one-half of that calculated with TEE resulting in the majority of patients receiving a THV that was too small...|$|R

BackgroundThe inverse relationship of PAR occurrence and <b>oversizing</b> has been demonstrated for the Sapien XT but the incidence of PAR with comparable <b>oversizing</b> with the Sapien 3 is not known. MethodsSixty-one prospectively enrolled patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Sapien 3 THV were compared with 92 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the Sapien XT THV. Patients were categorized depending on the degree of MDCT area <b>oversizing</b> percentage: undersizing (below 0 %), 0 % to 5 %, 5 % to 10 %, and above 10 %. The primary endpoint was mild or greater PAR on transthoracic echocardiography. ResultsMild or greater PAR was present in 19. 7 % of patients (12 of 61) in the Sapien 3 group and in 54. 3 % of patients (50 of 92) in the Sapien XT group (p  10 % (p for interaction = 0. 54). Moderate or severe PAR rates were also lower in the Sapien 3 group than in the Sapien XT group (3. 3 % vs. 13. 0 %, p = 0. 04). In the Sapien 3 group, a MDCT area <b>oversizing</b> percentage value of ≤ 4. 17 % was identified as the optimal cutoff value to discriminate patients with or without mild or greater PAR.

We compared different level of <b>oversizing</b> in our cohort of con- secutive patients to address if severe <b>oversizing</b> compared to normal sizing {{had an impact on}} post-procedural outcomes. Methods From January 2010 to August 2013, consecutive patients were referred for TAVI with preoperative Multislice-CT (MSCT) and the procedures were achieved using Edwards Sapien® or Corevalve devices®. Retrospectively, according to pre-procedural MSCT and the valve size, pa- tients were classified into three groups: normal, moderate and severe oversizing; depending on the ratio between the prosthesis area and the annulus area indexed and measured on MSCT. Main endpoint was mid-term mortality and secondary endpoints were the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC- 2) endpoints. Results Two hundred and sixty eight patients had a MSCT and underwent TAVI procedure, with mainly Corevalve®. While all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar in all groups, post-procedural new pacemaker (PM) implantation rate was significantly higher in the severe <b>oversizing</b> group (P = 0. 03), while we observed more in-hospital congestive heart-failure (P = 0. 02) in the normal sizing group.

BackgroundCA and PPIs are frequent complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a next-generation balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve (SAPIEN 3). The potential underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. MethodsOf 244 patients treated with SAPIEN 3, 208 without a previous pacemaker and 184 without baseline CA were analyzed. We assessed the association of angiographic implantation depth (% of frame height below the annulus) and degree of <b>oversizing</b> with PPI and CA. ResultsNew PPI and new or worsened CA or PPI occurred in 16 % (34 of 208) and 31 % (57 of 184), respectively. Patients requiring PPI had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (44 % vs. 24 %; p = 0. 017), complete right bundle branch block (27 % vs. 5 %; p = 0. 001), and bradycardia (< 60 beats/min, 38 % vs. 21 %; p = 0. 034). In patients with new CA or PPI, implantation depth was lower (at septal side: 29 ± 8 % vs. 25 ± 7 %; p = 0. 003), and rate of <b>oversizing</b> was higher (19 % [11 of 57] vs. 6 % [8 of 126]; p = 0. 007). Independent predictors of new or worsened CA or PPI were implantation depth at septal side (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 063 [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 017 to 1. 110]; p = 0. 006 per % of frame below the aortic annulus), <b>oversizing</b> (OR: 3. 489 [95 % CI: 1. 236 to 9. 848]; p = 0. 018), and QRS duration (OR:  1. 033 [95 % CI: 1. 011 to 1. 056]; p = 0. 003 per ms).

40|$|AbstractHeating, ventilation, {{air-conditioning}} and Refrigeration (HVAC&R) {{systems are}} seldom designed or commissioned properly. The situation leads to abrupt or degradation faults resulting in inefficient energy uses, excessive energy consumption and high service costs. To solve these aforementioned problems, fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) is utilized to firstly detect any abnormal conditions {{of a system}} and then diagnoses and determines their causes. In order to apply this concept in HVAC <b>oversizing</b> designs, this paper proposes the state-of-art procedure of a FDD procedure for analyzing the inherently faulty design (<b>oversizing)</b> of multiple packaged air-conditioning units used to supply cooling for an open space in light commercial buildings. A generic process of FDD for a packaged unit is briefly introduced to efficiently design FDD algorithms and to illustrate an overview picture for new researchers in FDD areas. In the procedures, compressor statuses, time-on and time-off operations and outdoor air temperatures are recorded {{by means of the}} on-board controller of each machine unit. These physical and electrical monitoring data are applied to diagnose and evaluate <b>oversizing</b> level in terms of runtime fraction (RTF) and cycling rate (N).

40|$|Rooftop {{packaged}} air-conditioning units (RTUs) {{have been}} intensively utilized in commercial buildings for providing space heating and cooling. They serve over 60 % {{of the commercial}} building floor space in the U. S. Inefficient routine operations of multiple RTUs result in waste energy consumption. Specifically, <b>oversizing</b> is an inherent issue practically caused by overdesign of mechanical engineers. With field test studies, <b>oversizing</b> can be up to 100 % leading to much energy penalty. ^ Although there are locally advanced control technologies utilized to improve the overall efficiency performance of RTUs, they are invasive approaches to interrupt normal operations and require experienced service teams for preventative maintenance causing high first cost installation and service costs with returning on investment (ROI) being more than 3 - 5 years {{depending on the type}} of a building. ^ To reduce ROI and permanently reduce inherent <b>oversizing</b> issue without intervention of an original system, the report proposes a non-invasive methodology for reducing energy penalty caused by non-optimal design. The technique will use adaptive control strategies to minimize the fault impact until the receipt of actual physical repair or to ultimately eliminate the fault without any further physical intervention. Control algorithms are systematically developed to mainly reduce <b>oversizing</b> effect utilizing simplified instantaneous building load. With the control algorithm implemented and tested by a building simulation platform, the <b>oversizing</b> effect is decreased at least 30 % and can be reached to 60 %. With the decrease of the <b>oversizing</b> effect and energy penalty without original system interference, the improved results lead to: 1) compressor energy savings between 15 and 30 % and fan energy savings between 30 and 55 % and 2) improved indoor relative humidity resulting in more energy savings for commercial supermarket applications. ^ The proposed method will be further applied to: 1) temporarily minimize the fault impact caused by faulty operations and improper commissioning such as over-circulation and outdoor damper leakage and 2) temporarily disabled severe faults including fail compressor, fail heater and some control-related faults meanwhile the overall performance of a system is in acceptable thresholds until these faults are physically fixed and ready to use normally. ...|$|R
