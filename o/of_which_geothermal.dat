40|$|An {{attempt to}} {{demonstrate}} that native Hawaiians have some special claim to geothermal resources might proceed on either of two theories. The first is that geothermal fluids, or the steam or heat from them, were among those natural resources access to which was guaranteed to descendants of the aboriginal population {{as part of the}} native Hawaiian rights preserved during the Great Mahele [...] the division <b>of</b> estates <b>which</b> here created private ownership in land. As is well known, the government of Kamehameha III (Kauikeouli) under strong Western influence, in the mid- 19 th century replaced an essentially feudal land system in <b>which</b> outright ownership <b>of</b> land had no place with an allodial system generally based on the ownership concepts of Anglo-American common law. However, the declarations and statutes which brought about this radical change repeatedly acknowledged that some customary rights of access to natural resources were preserved for the native tenants of lands now held in fee by their old landlords and by their successors in title. The first theory could assert that the bundle of rights so protected includes rights to <b>geothermal</b> resources <b>which</b> remain in force today, more than a century after the Great Mahele. The second possible theory is that, irrespective of other property rights preserved to native Hawaiians, they are the beneficiaries of a trust, the corpus <b>of</b> <b>which</b> includes <b>geothermal</b> resources. It is the primary purpose of this paper to examine each of these theories in the light of Hawaiian history and case law to ascertain if either provides the basis for making a prima facie case asserting ownership of geothermal resources by or on behalf of native Hawaiians. The secondary purpose is to state what group within the population are "native Hawaiians" in this context. "Department of Planning and Economic Development, State of Hawai...|$|R

40|$|Turkey {{is an area}} {{of complex}} geology with active {{tectonics}} and high geothermal potential. Especially, the western part of Turkey is a region of abundant geothermal activity. Faults accommodating the deep circulation of hydrothermal fluids of meteoric origin are the primary means by <b>which</b> <b>of</b> <b>geothermal</b> systems are controlled in this region. Many of the thermal activities are related to the improved dilation on the ~E-W-strikes of the graben faults. This situation serves as a suitable environment for the presence of high levels of arsenic in geothermal water resources. The highest concentrations of naturally occurring aqueous arsenic (As) are found in certain types of geothermal waters, generally those related to major graben faults. In this regard, high arsenic concentrations in geothermal resources have been detected in Western Turkey, including but not limited to Biga Peninsulla, Gediz Graben, Kucuk, and Buyuk Menderes Graben with values ranging from 1 to 1419 ppb in geothermal fluids. The thermal waters have surface temperatures of up to 100 °C and reservoir temperatures range from 150 to 248 °C in the Menderes Graben, from 120 to 287 °C in the Gediz Graben, and from 153 to 174 °C in Biga Peninsula. Hydrogeochemically, the Menderes graben and Gediz Graben thermal waters are of the Na-HCO 3, Ca-HCO 3, and Na-SO 4 types, whereas some geothermal fluids such as those of Tuzla and Kestanbol in the Biga Peninsula, Çeşme, and Urla are of the Na-Cl type...|$|R

Considering {{the fact that an}} ideal Rayleigh wave will be characterized by particle motions with a phase difference of 90 ° between the horizontal and vertical components and with either 0 ° or 180 °phase　difference between the two horizontal components, the direction of arrival is determined by the relative amplitude of the cross-correlations among two horizontal components and vertical one. The cross-correlations are evaluated for the selected frequencies 7 Hz and 12 Hz through band pass filter,which indicate the high peaks in the power spectra. Moreover the direction of arrival is also determined for such filtered waves by the particle motion method. The results of arrival direction at 7 Hz in the Camp and D-point observation stations show a special quardrant in each observation station, while the waves at 12 Hz in both stations come from all directions.
