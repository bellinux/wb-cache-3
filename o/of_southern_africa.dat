5|$|Common elands live on {{the open}} plains <b>of</b> <b>{{southern}}</b> <b>Africa</b> and along {{the foothills of the}} great southern African plateau. The species extends north into Ethiopia and most arid zones of South Sudan, west into eastern Angola and Namibia, and south to South Africa. However, there is a low density of elands in Africa due to poaching and human settlement.|$|E

In 1996, civil servants, nurses, and junior doctors went on strike over salary issues. The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|E

5|$|In South Africa, a few {{records of}} {{hybridization}} with the white-faced whistling duck {{have been noted}} in the wild, although in most parts <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> the two species breed at different times, bicolor {{during the dry season}} (April to September) and viduata during the rains (October to March). Hybridization in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in the genus Dendrocygna.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{between the}} Swazi, Zulu and Thembu royal houses <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> are common. For example, the {{daughter}} of former South African president and Thembu royal Nelson Mandela, Zenani Mandela, in 1977 married Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini, a brother of Mswati III, King of Swaziland. Elsewhere in the region, Princess Semane Khama of the Bamangwato tribe of Botswana married Kgosi Lebone Edward Molotlegi of the Bafokeng tribe of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow is an {{abundant}} and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation in most <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> It is not {{believed to be}} threatened, and accordingly is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN's Red List.

The eastern green mamba's range extends from Kenya south through Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, eastern Zimbabwe, eastern Zambia into South Africa {{as far as}} southern Natal and northern Pondoland. It {{can also be found}} in Zanzibar. The distribution of this species is assumed to be continuous, but reports seem to be scarce in regions within the species' range.|$|E
5|$|On , the ship's {{supercargo}} ordered some assegais, or African spears, {{and some}} swords, {{to be brought}} on deck for the Malagasy to clean. When the weapons were clean and the Malagasy were ordered to return them, they attacked the ship's crew, and {{took control of the}} ship. A truce ensued, the terms of which were that if the Malagasy would spare the lives of the remaining crew the ship would be sailed back to Madagascar, but taking advantage of the Malagasy's lack of navigational skills, the crew instead set sail for the coast <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian African Rifles {{were based}} at Borrowdale in {{north-east}} Salisbury between 1940 and 1943. Apart from a contingent sent south to Durban to guard Italian prisoners {{on their way}} to Rhodesia, the regiment's main role was garrison duties within the colony. The Rhodesian Air Askari Corps, a unit of black volunteer troops under white command, guarded the air bases and also provided manpower for non-armed labour. The perceived possibility that Japan might attempt an invasion <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> via Madagascar led to the consolidation of a few hundred rural whites into the Southern Rhodesia Commando, a part-time cadre intended as the basis for a guerrilla-style resistance movement, from 1942.|$|E

5000|$|One <b>of</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa’s</b> biggest {{issues is}} the lack of clean water. According to The United Nation’s Convention on Climate Change on South Africa in 2000, the water around Africa is {{unevenly}} distributed, meaning that 60% of the water is situated in only 20% of the land. Less than 10% <b>of</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa’s</b> surface water is accessible [...] and {{due to the fact that}} a majority of their ground water lay under large rock formations, ground water becomes difficult to access as well. [...] Climate change and its attendant effects on temperature and precipitation may have an additional impact.|$|R
5|$|The blue {{stingray}} (Dasyatis chrysonota) <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> {{has long}} been regarded as {{a variant of the}} common stingray. However, the common stingray lacks the blue markings of the other species and differs in morphological and meristic characters, which led the latter to be definitively recognized as a separate species by Paul Cowley and Leonard Compagno in 1993. The distinction between this species and the similar Tortonese's stingray (D. tortonesei) of the Mediterranean is poorly understood and may not be valid, requiring further investigation.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra occurs {{mainly in}} western and central Africa. It is found from Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, southeastern Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and Gabon in western Africa to the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and {{northern}} Angola in central Africa to western Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in eastern Africa, and to fragmented parts <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa,</b> including the Natal.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} habitats of {{this species}} were the semi-arid savanna, thornveld, and light woodland typical <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years ago, it adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} very common and is {{widespread}} through much of sub-Saharan Africa and is found in western, eastern, central, and parts <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> It is absent from the rainforests of the Congo Basin. It has been recorded from Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (except in the center), Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Sudan, Tanzania, Somalia, Togo, Uganda, Zambia. Older records from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mozambique, or most of Namibia refer to Naja mossambica or Naja nigricincta, which were formerly regarded as subspecies of N.nigricollis.|$|E
5|$|While the BPC was {{primarily}} political, Black Consciousness activists also established the Black Community Programmes (BCPs) {{to focus on}} improving healthcare and education and fostering black economic self-reliance. The BCPs had strong ecumenical links, being part-funded by a program on Christian action, established by the Christian Institute <b>of</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa</b> and the South African Council of Churches. Additional funds came from the Anglo-American Corporation, the International University Exchange Fund, and Scandinavian churches. In 1972, the BCP hired Biko and Bokwe Mafuna, allowing Biko to continue his political and community work. In September 1972, Biko visited Kimberley, where he met the PAC founder and anti-apartheid activist Robert Sobukwe.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1796 French and allied forces had been almost {{completely}} driven from the Indian Ocean, most of the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic falling to British invasions during 1795. The only significant French presence was on Île de France {{and a few other}} nearby islands, from which a squadron of two frigates periodically operated against British trade. The British were so confident of supremacy that they had split their forces, with a large squadron based at Simon's Town in the Cape Colony <b>of</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa</b> under Sir George Keith Elphinstone and a smaller dispersed force operating under Peter Rainier in the Dutch East Indies, based at the captured port of Malacca. The important trading ports of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay were largely undefended, as were the valuable trade routes which supported them.|$|E

5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects to pollinate flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually pollinate flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, UCL {{promoted}} Murray – then aged sixty-two – to {{the position}} of assistant professor, and in 1927 she was awarded an honorary doctorate for her career in Egyptology. That year, Murray was tasked with guiding Mary of Teck, the Queen consort, around the Egyptology department during the latter's visit to UCL. The pressures of teaching had eased by this point, allowing Murray to spend more time travelling internationally; in 1920 she returned to Egypt and in 1929 visited South Africa, where she attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, whose theme was the prehistory <b>of</b> <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> In the early 1930s she travelled to the Soviet Union, where she visited museums in Leningrad, Moscow, Kharkov, and Kiev, and then in late 1935 she undertook a lecture tour of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia.|$|E
5|$|The Astronomical Society <b>of</b> <b>Southern</b> <b>Africa</b> in 2003 {{reported}} that observations {{of four of}} the Mira variables in Microscopium were very urgently needed as data on their light curves was incomplete. Two of them—R and S Microscopii—are challenging stars for novice amateur astronomers, {{and the other two}} U and RY Microscopii are more difficult still. Another red giant, T Microscopii, is a semiregular variable that ranges between magnitudes 7.7 and 9.6 over 344 days. Of apparent magnitude 11, DD Microscopii is a symbiotic star system composed of an orange giant of spectral type K2III and white dwarf in close orbit, with the smaller star ionizing the stellar wind of the larger star. The system has a low metallicity. Combined with its high galactic latitude, this indicates that the star system has its origin in the galactic halo of the Milky Way.|$|E
