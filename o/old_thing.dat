500|$|... "Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)" [...] has {{received}} generally mixed reviews from music critics. Talia Kraines, writing for BBC Music was positive in her review, {{and called the}} song a [...] "classic Spice ballad". According to a writer from The Daily Collegian, [...] "for the naysayers, who say the Spice Girls time has passed, two new tunes, [...] "Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)" [...] and [...] "Voodoo" [...] may grab your attention". Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented in his positive review, [...] "'Headlines' won't be the first tune you skip to on the Spice Girls' Greatest Hits album – or, in all honesty, the tenth – but, as its pretty, gently melodic chorus surges gracefully, the feeling that comes over you is unmistakable. Nostalgia's a funny <b>old</b> <b>thing,</b> isn't it?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the <b>old</b> <b>thing</b> over again. If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E

Chris develops a rebellious and rude attitude after joining the band, and he significantly changes his appearance. Peter and Lois, worried about his behavior, search his room to find {{the cause of his}} behavioral change; Lois becomes convinced it is a result of listening to the violent lyrics from his music.

They decide to track down Manson and find him at the Grammys Music Awards. When they find Manson, Peter punches him in the face and Lois accuses him for destroying their son with his songs. Manson, played by writer Tom Devanney, laughing at [...] "this <b>old</b> <b>thing</b> again", offers to help them with Chris. Manson returns to the Griffin house with Peter and Lois, where he tells Chris and his bandmates {{that it is important to}} respect and obey their parents, and in addition to mending the tension between them, Manson ends the episode by giving Peter some more parental advice: Peter and Chris should start fishing.|$|E
