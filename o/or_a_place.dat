Blout and Bloak are very similar words, with a Bloak Moss not very far away at Auchentiber.|$|E

25|$|The target {{launch date}} was {{originally}} January 1985. Smith and Holland had eleven months {{in which to}} write, cast and shoot the whole thing. However, in February 1984, they did not even have a title <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to film. Both Smith and Holland were unhappy about the January 1985 launch date, favouring November or even September 1984 when seasonal audiences would be higher, but the BBC stayed firm, and Smith and Holland had to concede that, with the massive task of getting the Elstree Studios operational, January was the most realistic date. However, this was later to be changed to February.|$|E
25|$|Names {{of trees}} or {{plantations}} are also locative surnames, originally related to identifying {{a person who}} lived near or inside a plantation, an orchard <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> with a characteristic kind of vegetation.

25|$|Pheromone {{communication}} {{can be used}} {{to recruit}} workers to a food source, a new nesting site, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where work is required. The pheromone is released from the abdomen of the wasp, {{at the base of the}} fifth sternite. It is excreted by Richard's glands. The pheromone has a strong leather-like odor, and looks like brownish wax. Because of the strong odor, workers can easily follow a pheromone trail left by other colony members. The pheromone is produced slowly and continuously throughout life, so it can be used up if used too often or too quickly. Another species that exhibits this behavior is Synoeca surinama.|$|E

500|$|During Linnaeus' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, {{he taught}} many devoted students, 17 {{of whom he}} called [...] "apostles". They were the most promising, most {{committed}} students, {{and all of them}} made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> on an expedition. To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished. Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland. The British botanist William T. Stearn notes without Linnaeus' new system, {{it would not have been}} possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens. Many of the apostles died during their expeditions.|$|E
500|$|As German film {{professor}} Anton Kaes wrote, [...] "The {{style of}} German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers {{to experiment with}} filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations". The visual style of Caligari conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer, giving {{the impression of a}} nightmare or deranged sensibility, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings [...] "amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments". The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown, giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman. As with German Expressionist paintings, the visual style of Caligari reflects an emotional reaction to world, {{and in the case of}} the film's characters represents an emotional response to the terror of society that Dr. Caligari and Cesare represent. Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem too big for the small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind. Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state.|$|E
