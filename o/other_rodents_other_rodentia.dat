50|$|A {{mousetrap}} is a specialised type {{of animal}} trap designed primarily to catch mice; however, it may also (intentionally or unintentionally) trap other small animals. Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location {{where there is a}} suspected infestation of rodents. Larger traps are designed to catch other species of animals; such as rats, squirrels, <b>other</b> small <b>rodents,</b> or <b>other</b> animals.|$|R
50|$|The Hystricognathi are an infraorder of <b>rodents,</b> {{distinguished}} from <b>other</b> <b>rodents</b> by the bone structure of their skulls. The masseter medialis (a jaw muscle) passes partially through the infraorbital foramen and {{connects to the}} bone on the opposite side. This, together with their lack of an infraorbital plate and the relative size of the infraorbital foramen, distinguishes hystricognaths from <b>other</b> <b>rodent</b> groups.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the isolation and characterization of 12 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci for the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus. Microsatellite markers from three <b>other</b> <b>rodent</b> species were cross-amplified in muskrat {{and one of}} them was polymorphic. We observed moderate to high levels of genetic variability in these 13 polymorphic loci (five to 22 alleles per locus) with observed heterozygosity ranging from 0. 48 to 0. 96. These markers will be useful for further studies on population genetic structure in muskrat and potentially in <b>other</b> <b>rodent</b> species...|$|R

40|$|Lymphocytes from lymph nodes, spleen or thymus of hamsters {{differ from}} those of guinea-pig, rat or mouse in their {{response}} to PHA by reacting maximally at concentrations 10 – 50 times higher than those optimal for <b>other</b> <b>rodents.</b> The cells from the other animals were inhibited by the levels optimal for hamster cells. Hamster lymphocytes, however, resembled cells of the <b>other</b> <b>rodents</b> in their dose response to Con A or PWM. The possibility that the particularity in response of hamster cells is related to number and/or distribution of PHA-receptors is discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{retrovirus}} endogenous to {{guinea pig}} cells was earlier {{shown to be}} morphologically similar to type B and type D prototype retroviruses. Molecular hybridization techniques were used to show that guinea pig virus nucleotide sequences are endogenous to both domestic (Cavia porcellus) and indigenous (Cavia aperea) guinea pigs, but cannot be detected in the DNA of either <b>other</b> hystricomorph <b>rodents</b> or <b>other</b> mammals tested. Using radioimmunological techniques designed to detect interspecies relationships, the major internal polypeptide of guinea pig virus (p 26) was shown to share three different sets of interspecies antigenic determinants with squirrel monkey retrovirus, viper retrovirus, and mouse mammary tumor virus. Thus, guinea pig virus appears to provide an evolutionary link between type B and D retroviruses...|$|R

40|$|Reproductive {{potential}} in the pine vole is low compared with <b>other</b> small <b>rodents</b> including <b>other</b> species of voles. Age of maturity is late. Males do not reach puberty before 51 days and females before 77 days. Estrus and ovulation are not spontaneous but tend to be induced by mature males. Gestation is long (24 days). Litter sizes are small (2. 8 young weaned per female). Litters are produced less frequently because, although females mate and conceive within 3 days of parturition, prolonged gestation insures a minimum of 24 - 27 days between litters. Only dominant females in a group carry litters to term regardless {{of the age of}} other females in the group. Life span is short and crowding delays reproductive maturity thereby reducing potential for large {{potential in}}creases...|$|R

50|$|They {{are fairly}} {{aggressive}} {{but can be}} domesticated, and become very gentle. They have hard tough skin on their noses used to burrow into gopher holes and the burrows of <b>other</b> <b>rodents.</b> During the winter they hibernate.
