5|$|In 1882, {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant in the United States was built at the falls on Upton Island. The Brush Electric Company, headed by Charles F. Brush, supplied the equipment, which included five generators. The electricity was transmitted via four circuits to shops on Washington Avenue. The power plant turned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on September 5, 1882, {{just ahead of the}} Vulcan Street Plant in Appleton, Wisconsin, which started generating electricity on September 30. The company competed with the Minneapolis Gas Light Company, which later became Minnegasco and is now part of CenterPoint Energy.|$|E
5|$|From 2010, Smooth and Real Radio {{were the}} {{official}} broadcaster of the switch-on ceremony for the Blackpool Illuminations, the broadcast rights {{to which it}} won from BBC Radio 2, which had aired it since 1997. 2010 {{was the first time}} the event was broadcast on commercial radio. The annual event was compered by presenters from the two stations at a purposely-built arena, and featured a music concert by popular artists. Performers in 2010 included Alesha Dixon, Gabriella Cilmi, The Wanted, Olly Murs, and Robbie Williams, who switched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> that year. The 2012 switch-on was performed by Greg Rutherford, Luke Campbell and Beth TweddleBritish Olympians who won gold medals at the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{a copy of a}} desk calendar chronicling all of Ron Swanson's meetings {{from the}} episode was placed on the official Parks and Recreation website. That site also featured three deleted scenes from the episode. In the first, 80-second clip, Leslie and Jessica get into a fight about the gazebo, and Jessica reveals she has trimmed the mansion's historic hedges into the shape of elephants. The second clip, which lasted one minute, features several more of Ron Swanson's meetings, including one where he tries to literally will a man away with his mind. Andy also tells Ron he accidentally agreed to sell the recreation center to the Quiznos fast food restaurant chain. In the third, 90-second clip, Leslie tries to end Nick Newport Sr.'s birthday party by pulling the plug <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> but accidentally disconnects his breathing machine instead.|$|E

5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing to the first floor below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

50|$|Evidence that {{supports}} Cholodny-Went over competing theories {{was reported by}} Iino and Briggs in 1984, showing that there was decreased growth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> side of a corn coleoptile and increased growth of the shaded side. Experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana in 1993 following a similar methodology gave similar results, and these have been backed up by direct measurements of auxin distribution. Other theories predict slower growth on both sides, but particularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> side (Blaauw/Paal 1918/1919), or faster growth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shaded side but no change in growth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lighted</b> side (Boysen Jensen 1928).|$|R

25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an electric motor driving, through reduction gearing, a set of three slow-turning cams. These cams would actuate switches to turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> in sequence. Later Ford cars and the 1969 Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear, break, or go out of adjustment.|$|E

500|$|In August 2007, Sanctus Real {{returned}} to the studio to record a fourth album, which was finished {{by the end of}} the year. In November 2007, the album was originally slated for release under the title Turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lights,</b> the name of a track on the album. It was later changed to We Need Each Other, and was released in February 2008, through Sparrow Records. The title track [...] "We Need Each Other" [...] was released earlier as the album's lead single in November 2007. The song stayed at number 1 on R's Christian CHR chart for five consecutive weeks by February 2008, and it was 2008's eighth most-played song of the year in the same format.|$|E
500|$|That same year, Ralph Pulitzer, who {{had succeeded}} his father Joseph as {{publisher}} of the World, began a drive to raise [...] for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night. He claimed over 80,000 contributors, but failed to reach the goal. The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor—a fact that was not revealed until 1936. An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood. Gutzon Borglum, who later sculpted Mount Rushmore, redesigned the torch, replacing much of the original copper with stained glass. On December 2, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> successfully illuminating the statue.|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E

Formerly titled Year of the Woman, {{the album was}} released on June 18, 2013 in the US. It is Rowland's first release with Republic Records following Universal Music Group's decision to close Universal Motown and Universal Republic, and reviving Motown Records and Republic Records. Talk a Good Game sold 68,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, becoming Rowland's third top-ten album in the US. The album's lead single [...] "Kisses Down Low" [...] was a moderate success on the US R/Hip-Hop Songs chart and was certified gold by RIAA for exceeded 500,000 copies sold. The second and final single [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] was acclaimed by critics for its lyrical and the emotional honesty. In December 2013, Rowland appeared in Beyoncé's [...] "Grown Woman" [...] music video and alongside Williams in Beyoncé's [...] "Superpower" [...] music video and provided backing vocals on the same track, taken from her self-titled fifth studio album.|$|E
500|$|Aliens {{was filmed}} over ten months {{on a budget}} of [...] at Pinewood Studios in England. Cameron, bound by a low budget and a deadline, found it {{difficult}} to adjust to what Paxton called the [...] "indentured" [...] working practices of the British crew, such as the tea breaks that brought production to a halt. Many of the crew had worked on Alien and were fiercely loyal to Ridley Scott, and they believed the 31-year-old Cameron was too young and inexperienced to direct. In response, he arranged a screening of The Terminator, which had not yet been released in the UK, but many of the crew did not attend. They also mocked producer Gale Anne Hurd, insisting that she was only receiving the producer credit because she was married to Cameron. Cameron clashed with the original director of photography Dick Bush when Bush started production saying the schedule couldn't be met and when he insisted on lighting the alien nest set brightly. Cameron insisted on a dark, foreboding nest, relying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> from the marines' armor. After Bush was fired, the crew walked out. Hurd managed to coax the team back to work, and Adrian Biddle was hired as Bush's replacement.|$|E
500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the room and he could not turn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had no idea the intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother pointed it out for him. [...] "My brother told me — I guess the day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.' Of course I said something intelligent like, 'What's 11/4?' Duane just said, 'Okay, dumbass, I'll try to draw it up on paper for you.'" ...|$|E
