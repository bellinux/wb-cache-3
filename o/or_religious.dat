5|$|According to Chard, in the 48 {{years of}} his career, Johnson {{published}} around 2,700 imprints, averaging 56 per year. About half of these were pamphlets (e.g. sermons, religious tracts, political leaflets) and many were reprints; therefore he averaged around 20 to 30 new books per year. About 25% of his publications were of anonymous authors; these were usually political <b>or</b> <b>religious</b> works. He published more religious works than any other genre (1,067 titles). Johnson made roughly 750 copies for each print run, although many of his political and religious works would have been printed in editions of 250, as their topics were often ephemeral.|$|E

This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, <b>or</b> <b>religious</b> affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human).
