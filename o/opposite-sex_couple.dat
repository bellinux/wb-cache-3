25|$|On May 31, 2009, the Nevada {{legislature}} overrode Governor Jim Gibbons' veto of {{a domestic}} partnership bill. The bill allows registered domestic partners, whether they are a same-sex or <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple,</b> to have {{most of the state}} level rights and responsibilities afforded to married couples. It does not require any other entity to provide rights or benefits afforded to married individuals. This has left the partnership bill ineffective compared to those of other states. The law took effect 1 October 2009.|$|E
25|$|For instance, with {{relation}} {{to social security}} and general family law, same-sex couples were not previously recognised as a couple for social security or family assistance purposes. A person who had a same-sex de facto partner {{was treated as a}} single person. The reforms ensured that same-sex couples were (for the first time under Australian law) recognised as a couple akin to opposite-sex partners. Consequently, a same-sex couple receives the same rate of social security and family assistance payments as an <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple.</b> Generally speaking a couple in a de facto relationship is treated equally to a married couple in legal proceedings, though a few small differences exist in family law disputes, including property settlements and entitlements to spousal maintenance. A partner in a de facto relationship may also be required to prove the existence of a relationship before a court in order to access benefits, a process which is automatic for married couples and consequently can have a discriminatory impact on same-sex couples, who cannot yet marry in Australia. De facto relationships also have different time eligibility requirements than marriages when it comes to laws dealing with Centrelink, migration, family law matters and assisted reproduction. The greater burden of proof can impact on a person's ability to arrange their partner's funeral, and the rights of a de facto partner may be poorly understood by government departments. Despite large equality of rights, Australia does not have a national registered partnership, civil union or same-sex relationship scheme.|$|E

50|$|The church's {{doctrine}} {{is not entirely}} specific concerning who should be sealed to whom when there are multiple spouses, and the church permits a sealing to take place any {{time there was a}} valid marriage between an <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple.</b> One possibility is that regardless of how many times a man or woman is sealed, only one marriage will remain in the afterlife. Another possibility is that multiple sealings will be valid in the next life. The church does not clearly teach whether or not polygamous marriages exist in the afterlife. It is believed that the proxy sealings, like the church's proxy baptisms, are only offered to the deceased souls, and that deceased persons must accept the ordinance for it to take effect. The LDS Church opposes same-sex marriages and does not perform them for either living or deceased couples.|$|E

5000|$|In {{most parts}} of the United States, there is no legal {{registration}} or definition of cohabitation, so demographers have developed various methods of identifying cohabitation and measuring its prevalence. The Census Bureau, currently describes an [...] "unmarried partner" [...] as a [...] "person age 15 years and over, who is not related to the householder, who shares living quarters, and who has a close personal relationship with the householder." [...] Before 1995, the Bureau identified any [...] "unrelated" [...] <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple</b> living with no other adults as [...] "POSSLQs", or Persons of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters. and the Bureau still report these numbers to show historical trends. However, such measures should be taken loosely, as researchers report that cohabitation often does not have clear start and end dates, as people move in and out of each other's homes and sometimes do not agree on the definition of their living arrangement at a particular moment.|$|E

These suggest, very abstractly, a barren modern landscape and a traffic jam of sorts. As the overture ends, Piet the Pot, [...] "by trade wine taster," [...] {{in the country of}} Breughelland (named after the artist that loosely inspired it), appears to deliver a drunken lament, complete with hiccups. He is accompanied by bassoons, which become the representative instrument for his character. The focus switches to two lovers, Amanda and Amando, who are played by two women even though they represent an <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple.</b> Nekrotzar, prince of Hell, hears the lovers from deep inside his tomb and subtly joins their duet. The lovers, confused, discover Piet and become enraged, believing he is spying on them. Piet protests that he [...] "spoke no word, so who spoke? The almighty?" [...] The lovers hide in the tomb to make out.|$|E

50|$|The couple {{sued for}} the {{recognition}} of their marriage, the trial beginning on 5 June 2006 before Sir Mark Potter, President of the Family Division. For an overseas marriage to be recognised in the UK, it must be shown that the marriage was legal, recognised {{in the country in}} which it was executed, and that nothing in the country's law restricted freedom to marry; Kitzinger and Wilkinson argued that their marriage fulfilled these requirements even though people cannot legally enter into same-sex marriages in the UK. They rejected entering a civil partnership, believing them to be both symbolically and practically a lesser substitute, and asked the court to recognise their overseas marriage {{in the same way that}} it would recognise the marriage of an <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple.</b> They argued that a failure to do so breached their human rights under Articles 8 (right to respect for privacy and family life), 12 (right to marry) and 14 (prohibition of discrimination), taken together with Article 8 and/or 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which was incorporated into domestic UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998.|$|E
50|$|Austrian law {{recognised}} {{many different}} forms of adoption, however it prevented second-parent adoptions made by homosexual couples in accordance with s182(2) of the Austrian Civil Code. Section 182(2) provided for second-parent adoption if the adopting parents had formed a marriage. Importantly, it did not prevent unmarried heterosexual couples from doing so. X concluded an adoption agreement and sent in to the Austrian District Court for approval, knowing it would be denied. The domestic court argued that the father refused to give his consent and that the adoption requested by them was in any case not possible under Austrian law. Upon that verdict, X and her partner applied to the Constitutional Court of Austria to have the s179 declared unconstitutional because it discriminated against them {{on the basis of}} their sexual orientation. They argued that in the case of an <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple,</b> the District Court would have carried out a detailed examination (as to whether override the father’s refusal or not) and would have had to deliver a separate decision on this issue. However, in the applicants’ case it had denied them any inquiry of the facts on the ground that the adoption requested by them was in any case not possible under Austrian law. The Constitutional Court of Austria refused to do so and rendered the request inadmissible.|$|E
40|$|OPPOSITE-SEX {{couples are}} {{prohibited}} from forming a civil partnership. Following the introduction of same-sex marriage, the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was not extended to opposite-sex couples, resulting in the unusual position that English law permits same-sex couples access to two relationship forms (marriage and civil partnership) yet limits opposite-sex couples to one (marriage). This discrimination was recently challenged in the courts by an <b>opposite-sex</b> <b>couple,</b> Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who wish to enter a civil partnership owing to their deeply-rooted ideological opposition to marriage. Rejecting marriage as a patriarchal institution and believing that a civil partnership would offer a more egalitarian public expression of their relationship, the couple argued that the current ban constitutes a breach of Article 14 {{read in conjunction with}} Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights...|$|E
