5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation.

5|$|Despite {{the stylistic}} {{innovations}} Radama adopted {{for the construction}} of several of the compound's buildings, the Rova largely retained its traditional features during his reign. The basic layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> remained largely unaltered from its original design with the sole exception of an expansion of the Rova along its north-south axis. Stone walls topped with sharpened wooden stakes were built around the new perimeter during this period. Venerable buildings such as Besakana, Nanjakana, Mahitsy and Manjakamiadana were retained, as were the houses of several of Andrianampoinimerina's wives, many of whom were still living at the time of Radama's death in 1828. During his reign, Radama undertook the restoration of Marivolanitra to serve chiefly as housing for visiting foreigners, and briefly inhabited it himself in addition to his main residence at Besakana. He also had a house called Kelisoa ("Petite Beauty") built as a lodging for his concubines.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia (low blood {{potassium}} levels) commonly {{occurs during}} attacks; levels below 3.0mmol/l are typically encountered. Magnesium and phosphate levels are often {{found to be}} decreased. Creatine kinase levels are elevated in two thirds of cases, usually due to a degree of muscle injury; severe elevations suggestive of rhabdomyolysis (muscle tissue destruction) are rare. Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) may show tachycardia (a fast heart rate) due to the thyroid disease, abnormalities due to cardiac arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia), and conduction changes associated with hypokalemia (U waves, QRS widening, QT prolongation, and T wave flattening). Electromyography shows changes similar to those encountered in myopathies (muscle diseases), with a reduced amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compound</b> muscle action potentials (CMAPs); they resolve when treatment has commenced.|$|E
5|$|In ES MS spectrum, a given {{oligonucleotide}} {{generates a}} set of ions that correspond to different ionization states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>compound.</b> Thus, the oligonucleotide with molecular mass M generates ions with masses (M– nH)/n where M is the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide {{in the form of}} a free acid (all negative charges of internucleosidic phosphodiester groups are neutralized with H+), n is the ionization state, and H is the atomic mass of hydrogen (1 Da). Most useful for characterization are the ions with n ranging from 2 to 5. Software supplied with the more recently manufactured instruments is capable of performing a deconvolution procedure that is, it finds peaks of ions that belong to the same set and derives the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide.|$|E

On 24 September 2007, members of C squadron SBS and the Italian SOF unit Col Moschin rescued two Italian intelligence agents who were kidnapped by the Taliban in Herat province near Farah, they had been kidnapped 2 days before.
