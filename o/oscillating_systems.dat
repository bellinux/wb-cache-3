50|$|The {{earliest}} {{scientific evidence}} that such reactions can oscillate was met with extreme scepticism. In 1828, G.T. Fechner published a report of oscillations in a chemical system. He described an electrochemical cell that produced an oscillating current. In 1899, W. Ostwald observed {{that the rate of}} chromium dissolution in acid periodically increased and decreased. Both of these systems were heterogeneous and it was believed then, and through much of the last century, that homogeneous <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems</b> were nonexistent. While theoretical discussions date back to around 1910, the systematic study of oscillating chemical reactions and of the broader field of non-linear chemical dynamics did not become well established until the mid-1970s.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{specially}} designed and developed coupling equipment (patent name: MULTIKÁTOR) applied in driving cutting mechanism (ie on forage harvesters) excites the {{motion in the}} direction of cutting-edge and results energy saving. Such a system could be modeled as a univariant <b>oscillating</b> <b>system.</b> The applied torque on the <b>oscillating</b> <b>system</b> can be divided into two parts: on the one hand a deterministic applied {{and on the other hand}} a stochastic loading torque originating from the cutting process. For this reason the excitation of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>system</b> is a stochastic signal. We present the theoretical method to evaluate the model with help of the random variable of the excitation signal we will characterize the probability parameters of angular speed and oscillation of the MULTIKATOR.

5000|$|The [...] "classic" [...] {{mechanism}} of vasomotion generation {{is thought to}} be the voltage-dependent coupled model. In this model, high gap junction coupling is present between the vascular smooth muscle cells, the endothelial cells and the endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cells. An initial depolarizing current leads to the opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels, ultimately resulting in synchronization of individual calcium levels. When patch clamp recordings are conducted, depolarization occurs in the endothlial layer {{at the same time as}} the underlying vascular smooth muscle. The cause of the initial depolarizing current, however, remains to be determined. Mathematical modeling has pointed to the existence of 2-4 independent non-linear <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems</b> interacting to produce vasomotion. It is possible that in order for vasomotion to be generated, these systems must pass a depolarizing threshold.|$|E
50|$|This {{suggestion}} is surprising because the seasons have been {{thought to be}} governed by the tilt of the Earth's axis (see Effect of sun angle on climate). The two types of years differ by a mere 4 days over 300 years, so Thompson's result may not be significant. However, the result is not unreasonable. The seasons can {{be considered to be}} an oscillating system driven by two inputs with slightly different frequencies: the total input of energy from the sun varies with the anomalistic year, while the distribution of this energy between the hemispheres varies with the tropical year. In other physical situations, <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems</b> driven by two similar frequencies can latch onto either one. One point that must be considered is that the oscillation arising from the tilt of the axis is much greater than that arising from the distance of the sun.|$|E

40|$|Oscillating {{reactions}} {{are one of}} the most interesting topics in chemistry and analytical chemistry. Fluctuations in concentrations of one the reacting species (usually a reaction intermediate) create an oscillating chemical reaction. In <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems,</b> the reaction is far from thermodynamic equilibrium. In these systems, at least one autocatalytic step is required. Developing an instinctive feeling for how oscillating reactions work will be invaluable to future generations of chemists. Some software programs have been released for simulating oscillating systems; however, the algorithm details of such software are not transparent to chemists. In contrast, function of spreadsheet tools, like Microsoft Excel, is well understood, and the software is nearly universally available. In this work, the simulation and visualization of different <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems</b> are performed using Microsoft excel. The simple repetitive solving of the ordinary differential equation of an autocatalytic reaction (a spreadsheet row) followed by time, easily automated by a subroutine (a “Macro” in Excel), readily simulates an oscillating reaction. This permits the simulation of some <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems</b> such asBelousov-Zhabotinsky. The versatility of an easily understandable computational platform further enables the simulation of the effects of linear and nonlinear parameters such as concentrations of reactants and catalyst, and kinetic constants. These parameters are readily changed to examine their effects...|$|E

Business cycles in different industries or sectors {{have a tendency to}} synchronize with one another in {{what appears to be a}} national business cycle, yet trade between sectors may not be strong enough for one sector to "drive" business cycle fluctuations in another sector. How are these sectors synchronized? This study suggests that the national business cycle results from a "mode-locking" phenomenon between different sectors, a nonlinear process through which weak coupling between <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems</b> (sectors) tends to synchronize the fluctuations between the <b>oscillating</b> <b>systems</b> (sectors).

40|$|Abstract: Coriolis mass {{flowmeters}} (CMF) are {{claimed to}} be not affected by {{the properties of the}} liquid such as heat conductivity, heat capacity and viscosity. They are direct mass flowmeters and form a real mean along the flow profile. However, there is some evidence from field applications that the devices, in particular with single straight pipe, suffer under the null drift. Therefore, the zero shift must be adjusted to the properties of liquid, installation site and operating conditions. The zero shift is caused by asymmetry of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>system.</b> A change in the asymmetry leads to the zero shift. This paper presents two methods to determine the zero shift: a sensor and a model based approach. The first uses additional acceleration sensors to measure the vibration of the straight pipe’s mounting. The motion of the mounting represents asymmetries in dissipation. The second method utilizes a model which includes the asymmetries as parameters. These can be detected by auxiliary exitation of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
