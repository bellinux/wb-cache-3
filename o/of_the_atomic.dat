5|$|The Beginning or the End (1947) is an American {{docudrama}} {{film about}} the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> bomb in World War II, directed by Norman Taurog, starring Brian Donlevy and Hume Cronyn, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film dramatizes the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> bomb in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E

5|$|Maria Goeppert Mayer (June 28, 1906 – February 20, 1972) was a German-born American {{theoretical}} physicist, and Nobel laureate in Physics for proposing {{the nuclear}} shell model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> nucleus.

5|$|With Dexter Masters, she co-edited the 1946 New York Times bestseller One World or None: a Report to the Public on the Full Meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> Bomb. The book {{included}} {{essays by}} Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer, and sold over 100,000 copies.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s RAF Aldermaston {{was created}} on the parkland at the {{southern}} end of the parish, with XIX Tactical Air Command stationed at the manor house. After World War II, the manor was returned to AEI who built the MERLIN reactor on part of the land. The reactor was opened on 6 November 1959 by The Duke of Edinburgh. With the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) in 1950, Aldermaston became synonymous with a number of CND marches.|$|E
5|$|Enola Gay {{became the}} center of a {{controversy}} at the Smithsonian Institution when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> bombing of Hiroshima. The exhibit, The Crossroads: The End of World War II, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War, was drafted by the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum staff, and arranged around the restored Enola Gay.|$|E

5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating a demonstration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> bomb, but the Interim Committee chose to use them against cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Along with his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C.

5|$|High {{amounts of}} {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{can increase the}} risk of AML. Survivors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had an increased rate of AML, as did radiologists exposed to high levels of X-rays prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices. People treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring AML, but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after 12 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 the {{population}} of the parish was 528. By 1896, {{the population}} had grown to 585. The population fluctuated steadily around 550 until the 1950s and 1960s, when a population explosion resulted in the 1961 UK census reporting 2,186 residents in the parish. This coincides with the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> Weapons Establishment in the early 1950s, and the majority of this figure counts residents in the parts of Tadley within the parish of Aldermaston—between 1901 and 1961, 368 houses were built in the parish.|$|E

5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} period he served {{on a number of}} {{government}} bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.|$|E
