5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by critics. Jeffrey Rosen, who reviewed {{the book for}} The New York Times, {{was surprised by the}} author's departure from traditional civil libertarian views. Rosen pointed out that Lewis did not support absolute protection for journalists from breaking confidentiality with their anonymous sources, even in situations involving criminal acts. Nat Hentoff called the book an engrossing and accessible survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment.</b> Kirkus Reviews considered the book an excellent chronological account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment,</b> subsequent legislation, and case law.|$|E

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E
5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type in New York as a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were {{to be put in}} escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E
50|$|A 1955 French {{film version}} {{based on the}} novel and {{released}} by Kingsley Pictures was in the United States <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> attempted censorship in New York {{on the grounds that it}} promoted adultery.

50|$|On its face, {{this ruling}} finds that state tax systems cannot treat the press {{differently}} {{from any other}} business without significant and substantial justification. <b>The</b> state <b>of</b> Minnesota demonstrated no such justification to impose a special tax on a select few newspaper publishers. Therefore, this tax was in violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment's</b> guarantee <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> press.|$|R
5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v. Finkel, the Court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two major {{victories}} in the 1930s cemented the ACLUs campaign to promote free speech. In Stromberg v. California, decided in 1931, the Supreme Court sided with the ACLU and affirmed {{the right of a}} communist party member to salute a communist flag. The result {{was the first time the}} Supreme Court used the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment to subject states to the requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment.</b> In Near v. Minnesota, also decided in 1931, the Supreme Court ruled that states may not exercise prior restraint and prevent a newspaper from publishing, simply because the newspaper had a reputation for being scandalous.|$|E
5|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>amendment</b> to its {{articles}} of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund {{as an alternative to}} gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
50|$|NARLA's {{focus is}} on matters {{pertaining}} to freedom of conscience. This includes supporting a broad interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment's</b> guarantee <b>of</b> {{free exercise of religion}} and laws protecting religious freedom, supporting laws to advance religious liberty, and supporting the principle that religion must not be co-opted by the state through regulation or through financial entanglements.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, textualist {{scholars}} have advanced {{the argument that}} <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> only applies to legislative action, and thus that executive authority is unencumbered by <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> prohibitions. According to this argument, the words “Congress shall make no law” cannot be construed to limit <b>the</b> powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive branch. Upon first glance, it might seem that a textualist reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> <b>first</b> word would give the executive branch carte blanche in <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> religion, expression, and association. Yet as this Article seeks to show, a textualist reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> <b>first</b> word does not necessarily generate legal conclusions starkly at odds with modern-day doctrine. This is because as a general rule, statutes authorizing executive action either (a) empower the executive to abridge <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> freedoms (in which case the statute itself violates <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment)</b> or (b) do not empower the executive to abridge <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> freedoms (in which case executive actions abridging <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> freedoms are ultra vires). While the textualist argument implies that some <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> challenges to executive actions should be recast as claims that those executive actions are ultra vires, the results in most cases may {{be the same as}} if <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> applied to <b>the</b> executive directly. Importantly, this equivalence only holds when the executive acts pursuant to legislative authorization under Article I <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution. When the executive acts pursuant to its own Article II inherent authority, actions that infringe upon <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> freedoms do not necessarily violate any distinct constitutional provision. When, for example, the President acts as “Commander in Chief,” a strict textualist could conclude that the President is not bound by <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> at all. Notably, federal courts’ deference to <b>the</b> executive in <b>First</b> <b>Amendment</b> cases involving military matters already seems to reflect the principle that <b>the</b> force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> prohibitions might hinge on the source (Article I vs. Article II) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive authority being exercised...|$|R

5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning intelligent design as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Amendment.</b> The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that intelligent design is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching intelligent design in science classes.|$|E
