5|$|Marysville's economy {{historically}} {{relied on}} lumber production and agriculture, including the cultivation <b>of</b> <b>strawberries,</b> hay and oats. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Marysville was not adversely impacted unlike {{other cities in}} the county and country because of its diverse industries, including sawmills, grain mills, a tannery, a fertilizer plant, and a berry packing plant. The city's largest employer in the early 1950s, the Weiser Lumber Company, was destroyed in a fire on May 6, 1955, causing $300,000 in damage. The lumber mill at the site was later acquired by Welco Lumber, who closed the plant in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Wrington Vale line {{closed in}} 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic {{to the gas}} works ended, though there was some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not faring well either: the number of tickets sold along the line had {{decreased}} dramatically since the early 1900s, although {{there was still a}} significant flow <b>of</b> <b>strawberries,</b> milk and cheese to London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a private siding near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969.|$|E

50|$|Common spot <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} common and {{widespread}} diseases <b>of</b> <b>strawberry.</b> Common spot <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> is caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella fragariae (imperfect stage is Ramularia tulasnei). Symptoms of this disease first appear as circular, dark purple spots on the leaf surface. Mycosphaerella fragariae is very host specific and only infects strawberry.|$|R
40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} conducted to study the effect of humic acids and bio-fertilizer on the qualities, yields <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> and soil agrochemical characters. Humic acids and bio-fertilizer were applied based on the requirement of the normal growth <b>of</b> <b>strawberry.</b> Four treatments were plotted: control(conventional treatment), dressing humic acid, topdressing bio-fertilizer, dressing humic acid+bio-fer-tilizer. Each treatment {{was repeated three times}} and randomly arranged. Results showed that application of bio-fertilization, humic acid, hu-mic acid+bio-fertilization could significantly improve the growing <b>of</b> the <b>strawberry,</b> average weight <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> during full burning period increased by 8. 85 %, 14. 12 % and 16. 23 %, respectively; Incidence of powdery mildew, gray mold and rot disease <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> was signifi-cantly reduced. Yield <b>of</b> <b>strawberry</b> was also improved by 7. 70 %, 10. 80 % and 14. 7 % respectively, compared with the control treatment. The results also showed that application of humic acid+bio-fertilization could significantly increase the protein, vitamin C and soluble sugar con-tent while reduce free acid <b>of</b> <b>strawberry.</b> Soil organic matter content was significantly improved by 0. 13, 1. 51 g·kg- 1 and 1. 69 g·kg- 1 respec-tively than control when bio-fertilization, humic acid, humic acid+bio-fertilizer were applied. In summary, humic acid and bio-fertilization had a positive impact on the growth <b>of</b> <b>strawberry.</b> Combined application <b>of</b> those two kinds of fertilizer would show the best agricultural effect...|$|R

Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries showed up in writing in 1578. By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: F. vesca, F. moschata, and F. viridis. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated asexually by cutting off the runners.|$|E

By the 1930s those crops had flourished so much that Pasadena was claiming the title of Strawberry Capital of the World. At its height, the city's strawberry growers shipped as many as 28 train carloads <b>of</b> <b>strawberries</b> each day. To honor that history, the city still holds an annual Pasadena Strawberry Festival. Strawberry Road stretches through much of the city near where the old strawberry crops grew. Attendance at the annual Strawberry Festival was 56,000 in 2008.|$|E

An extensive menu is available for guests, with special menus for children and for dieters. The executive chef of the Waldorf for many years was John Doherty, following the Austrian Arno Schmidt who held the position for ten years from 1969 to 1979. Restaurateur George Lang was awarded the Hotelman of the Year Award in 1975. As of the early 1990s, the hotel served over three million dishes a year, and got through 27,000 pounds of lobster, 100 pounds of beluga caviar, 380,000 pints <b>of</b> <b>strawberries</b> annually. The hotel has gained significant renown for its lavish feasts. During one grand feast for Francis Cardinal Spellman, over 200 VIP guests, according to Arno Schmidt, devoured some 3,600 pounds of fillet, 600 pounds of fresh halibut, 1,500 pounds of potatoes, and 260 pounds of petit fours, eating on gold china plates.
