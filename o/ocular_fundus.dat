40|$|Purpose: To report {{two cases}} of solitary {{unilateral}} vitreous cyst. Methods: A complete <b>ocular</b> examination, <b>fundus</b> photography, B-scan ultrasound and spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} were performed in both patients. Results: The first patient (a 39 -year-old man) presented with transient blurred vision in the right eye. The second patient (a 78 -year-old man) reported transient blurred vision in the right eye when changing head position. He was referred to the Eye Hospital because of vitreomacular traction in the other eye. After examination, a diagnosis of vitreous cyst was made in both cases. Conclusions: Vitreous cysts are rare clinical findings. They can occur in normal eyes or in eyes with certain ocular pathologies. When a cyst floats into the visual axis area, it can disturb visual function; therefore, patients usually report transient blurring of vision.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: The <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> {{examination}} is infrequently {{and poorly}} {{performed in the}} emergency department (ED) clinical settings, placing patients at risk for missed diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the feasibility of the <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> photography with a smartphone small optical device in an ED setting and to compare it with a traditional <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> examination. METHODS:: The study included 52 consecutive patients (mean age 69 ?±? 16 years, 50 % women) presenting to a hospital ED with an acute increase in blood pressure (SBP?>? 180 and/or DBP?>? 100 ?mmHg). When admitted to the ED all patients had mydriatic <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> examination obtained by a medical student (observer 1) using both a traditional ophthalmoscope and a commercially available <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> smartphone device (D-Eye, Si 14 S. p. A., Padova, Italy), to assess the presence of grade III and IV Keith Wegener retinopathy. All <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> images and videos recorded with the D-Eye system were analyzed by two independent expert (ophthalmologist – observer 2) and inexpert (medical student – observer 1) observers. A quantitative score of hemorrages, exudates and/or papillary edema was used (0 absent, 1 early, 2 moderate, 3 severe and 4 very severe). The Cohen K coefficient was used to assess the interobserver concordance index. RESULTS:: Six patients had headache, six had focal neurologic symptoms and four had acute visual changes. The mean duration of <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> examination was 130 ?±? 39 and 74 ?±? 31 ?s for traditional ophthalmoscopy and for smartphone D-Eye, respectively. No relevant abnormalities of their <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> were detected by traditional ophthalmoscopy, performed by observer 1, whereas a significant number of abnormal <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> findings were detected by the use of the D-Eye device in 17 and 19 patients by observer 1 and observer 2, respectively. The K coefficient value ranged from 0. 66 to 0. 77 (good concordance) for the assessment of hemorrhages and exudates, and from 0. 89 to 0. 90 (optimal concordance) for the evaluation of presence and severity of papilledema. CONCLUSION:: Our results show that a new small smartphone device (D-Eye) may be feasible in an ED setting for the fundoscopic examination, detecting a significant number of abnormal <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus.</b> The reliability of relevant <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> abnormalities seems to be superior in respect to traditional retinal fundoscopy...|$|E

40|$|Double-pass (DP) and Hartmann [...] Shack (HS) are {{complementary}} techniques {{based on}} reflections {{of light in}} the <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> that may be used to estimate the optical properties of the human eye.

In this work, we estimate the response of the <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> to incident light by fitting the deviations between DP and HS estimations using an exponential model. In measurements with negligible intraocular scattering, such differences {{may be related to the}} lateral spreading of light that occurs in the <b>ocular</b> <b>fundus</b> due to the diffusive properties of the media at the working wavelength.

The methods performed were OCT scan with a Spectralis HRA-OCT, for the measurement of macular thickness and morphology; best corrected visual acuity was assessed using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), was assessed slit-lamp biomicroscopy, <b>ocular</b> tonometry, <b>fundus</b> biomiocrosopy, and color fundus photography.

Normal range (mean± 2 SD) of IOP was determined to be 9. 3 - 19. 7 mmHg. IOP increased significantly with age and cup-disc ratio except for a fall in old ages. This relationship was also observed when we analyzed individuals without diabetes or hypertension history. IOP increased with darker eye pigmentation except for blue/gray eyes.

40|$|Background: To {{report the}} rare {{association}} of peripheral retinal ischemia {{in a patient}} with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. Case Presentation: A 39 -year {{old man with a}} recent diagnosis of asymptomatic Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) was referred from his physician for <b>ocular</b> evaluation. The <b>fundus</b> examination in his right eye (RE) revealed very mild central vein dilation, while retinal hemorrhages associated with microaneurismal alterations of the vascular plexus were detected at the temporal periphery. Fluoroscein angiography of his RE revealed an extended area of capillary dropout distal to the microaneurismal lesions. In our patient with WM an extensive area of capillary non-perfusion, in the absence of severe involvement of the posterior pole was documented; this association {{to the best of our}} knowledge has never been reported before. Conclusion: Although the incidence of the disease is rare, meticulous examination of the retinal periphery should be performed in all patients with WM and vice versa the differential diagnosis of peripheral retinal ischemia of unknown origin should include an investigation to rule out asymptomatic Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia. Backround Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) is a non-Hodgkin’...|$|R
