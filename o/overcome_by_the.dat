5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the team would be sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had had only two winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They then mounted a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Double.|$|E

5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to <b>overcome.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|As the division's assault units {{began their}} {{approach}} march towards {{the line of}} departure late {{on the evening of}} 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, breaking up the assaulting units as men became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division's assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, after a number of mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed {{a large part of the}} German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> division's lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack.

Despite Gloria's protests, Snake kidnaps her and Homer. When Burns finds Gloria's ring, dropped in the commotion, he assumes she ran off with Homer. Snake takes Gloria and Homer to his hideout. Though Gloria says she loves Burns, Snake vows he can change. The police arrive and confront Snake. Homer tries to escape but instead sets Snake's house on fire. Snake and Homer get out and Burns runs in to save Gloria, however he is soon <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smoke and Gloria is then seen carrying him to safety. Although initially grateful, Gloria begins to reminisce about Snake, causing her to break up with Burns and become Snake's girl again.|$|E
5|$|Lead's lighter carbon group {{congeners}} form stable or metastable allotropes {{with the}} tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure. The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are {{close enough to}} allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb2+ ions. Lead consequently has a face-centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium.|$|E

With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment.

5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E

5|$|His {{absence from}} the Penguins' line-up served as a {{stepping}} stone for teammate Evgeni Malkin, who, now in his second season, was developing into a superstar in his own right. Picking up the offensive slack, Malkin finished second in league scoring to Alexander Ovechkin and was also a Hart Memorial Trophy nominee as MVP honours also went to Ovechkin. In addition to Crosby's return to the line-up late in the regular season, the Penguins acquired star winger Marián Hossa from the Atlanta Thrashers at the trade deadline, placing the club in a strong position to make a deep playoff run. Pittsburgh finished the regular season as Atlantic Division champions and just two points shy of the first-seeded Montreal Canadiens. In a rematch of the previous year's opening round, the Penguins began the 2008 playoffs facing the Ottawa Senators, whom they quickly swept in four games. After then defeating the New York Rangers and archrival Philadelphia Flyers, each in five games, the Penguins reached the final round {{for the first time}} since 1992, to face the Detroit Red Wings. After being shut out as a team for the first two games of the series, Crosby scored the first two goals of game three as the series shifted to Pittsburgh to fuel a 3–2 win. The Penguins lost the next game and despite staving off defeat in game five, they were <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Red Wings in six games. Crosby finished the playoffs with 27 points (6 goals and 21 assists in 20 games), tying Conn Smythe-winner Henrik Zetterberg (13g, 14a in 22 games) for the playoff scoring lead.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{began the}} month {{with a loss}} to Indiana on February 2. The team rebounded against Nebraska on February 5 with its largest conference-game victory margin (79–50) under John Beilein and its largest conference-game victory margin since {{defeating}} Indiana 112–64 on February 22, 1998. On February 8 the Wolverines played poorly against (#17, #13) Iowa, losing 85–67 and surrendering the most points in a non-overtime game since December 12, 2007 (against Oakland). It was the team's biggest point deficit since its loss to Wisconsin by 18 on February 6, 2010. Michigan then defeated the (#22, 20) Ohio State Buckeyes at Value City Arena, the first Michigan victory at Ohio State since the 2002–03 team defeated the Buckeyes on January 15, 2003, and ending a nine-game losing streak at Ohio State. It was the first road sweep of Michigan State, Ohio State and Wisconsin since 1992–93. On February 16 Michigan lost to (#21, 21) Wisconsin. The Wolverines set a season low on February 23 with three turnovers and no turnover points against (#13, 14) Michigan State, rebounding from an early 22–11 deficit to win 79–70. Stauskas led the way with 25 points on 9-for-13 shooting, with 21 {{in the second half}} (including 10 which brought the score from a 48–43 deficit to a 53–51 lead). He had five assists, three rebounds and no fouls, and was Big Ten Player of the Week for the third time on February 24. It was the first time Michigan defeated the same ranked opponent twice in a season since the 2000–01 team defeated the 2000–01 Iowa Hawkeyes twice. The Wolverines (19–7, 11–3 Big Ten) regained first place in the Big Ten race, ahead of Michigan State (22–6, 11–4), gaining control of its destiny for the conference title with four games remaining against teams in {{the bottom half of the}} standings averaging five conference wins. On February 26, Michigan defeated Purdue 77–76 with a buzzer beater by Robinson (against his father's alma mater) in overtime. Michigan trailed by 19 (27–8) in the first half and 13 (37–24) at halftime. The 19-point deficit was the largest <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Wolverines that season, raising their overtime record to 13–3 under Beilein (including eight of their last nine and three straight). It was the team's first buzzer beater since DeShawn Sims' on November 29, 2008 against Savannah State.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was <b>overcome</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of running her kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E
