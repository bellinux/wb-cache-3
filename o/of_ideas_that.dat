5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> included game ideas for The War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E

His publications, however, represent a storehouse <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> are not fully mined.|$|E

25|$|With {{the aid of}} the Porto {{architect}} José Marques da Silva (1869-1947), {{the author}} of the first drafts for the Villa and the Park, Carlos Alberto Cabral gradually put together the different views and contributions. This can be seen in an annotation in a programmatic plan, proving his desire to keep only what was essential by integrating the structure of the existing gardens in the new plans. This plan also contains sketches <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> would later materialize in Gréber’s plans for the Park.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{liberalism}} {{is a set}} <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> {{arose in}} the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural rights (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers individual liberty {{to be the most}} important goal, because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.|$|E

25|$|Act 90-615 of 13 July 1990 or the Gayssot Act (named for its sponsor in the National Assembly) {{introduced}} {{a right to}} respond for any person who considers that a newspaper or other print medium has damaged his honor {{on the grounds of}} his ethnicity, nationality, race or religion. The Gayssot Act sets a punishment of five years' imprisonment and a €45,000 fine for the public expression <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> challenge the existence of the crimes against humanity committed by Nazi Germany during World War II as defined in the appendix to the London Agreement of 8 August 1945 (see Holocaust).|$|E
25|$|The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 aroused greater {{interest}} {{within the government}} in constitutional reform. Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights, as well as patriation of the Constitution, meaning the British Parliament {{would no longer have}} to approve constitutional amendments. Subsequently, Attorney General Pierre Trudeau appointed law professor Barry Strayer to research a potential bill of rights. While writing his report, Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars, including Walter Tarnopolsky. Strayer's report advocated a number <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> were later incorporated into the Charter, including protection for language rights. Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights. Finally, he recommended allowing for limits on rights. Such limits are included in the Charter's limitation and notwithstanding clauses. In 1968, Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office and in 1974 he became Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice. During those years, Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted.|$|E
25|$|The ideological {{basis for}} fascism {{came from a}} number of sources. Mussolini {{utilized}} works of Plato, Georges Sorel, Nietzsche, and the economic ideas of Vilfredo Pareto, to develop fascism. Mussolini admired Plato's The Republic, which he often read for inspiration. The Republic expounded a number <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the ultimate end, opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarization of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties {{in the interest of the}} state, and utilizing state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state. The Republic differed from fascism in that it did not promote aggressive war, but only defensive war. Also unlike fascism, it promoted very communist-like views on property. Plato was an idealist, focused on achieving justice and morality, while Mussolini and fascism were realist, focused on achieving political goals.|$|E

Rowell proposes that it is [...] "a figurative head swelling <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> all lead back to the artist". The proximity of the sex scene to Audrey's murder prompts Lyons to insist: [...] "Sex in Barton Fink is death". Others have suggested that the second half of the movie is an extended dream sequence.|$|E

[...] He applauded the episode's humor, willingness to explore controversial ideas, and its set pieces. Specific praise went towards the episode's final act, which takes place in Wizard Prison, with Sava likening the act to the late-90s television series Oz.|$|E

In other words, I seek to contextualize the publication and thereby deploy the very contextual approach that is promoted by the members of the Sussex School to examine Winch 2 ̆ 7 s own work. A secondary goal of the review essay is to disentangle the various traditions that use the contextual approach to the history of ideas— ranging from the Oxford tradition in the history <b>of</b> philosophical <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> is associated with R. G. Collingwood to the Cambridge tradition in the history <b>of</b> political <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> is associated with Quentin Skinner—to determine {{whether or not there is}} anything singular about the tradition associated with the Sussex School...|$|R

500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Korean War the U.S. Army used the areas in Japan where Task Force Smith had trained as a memorial. A monument to Task Force Smith was also established on the Osan battlefield, where an annual commemoration of the Battle of Osan is held by the Eighth Army, which is still headquartered in South Korea. On July 16, 2010, 60 years after the Battle of Osan, Eighth Army leaders, in conjunction with government officials of Osan, held another ceremony, speaking of Task Force Smith and describing the engagement as [...] "the opening shots of a war <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> exists even today." [...] On the 61st anniversary, another ceremony was held by both the U.S. military and Osan politicians to remember the task force.|$|E

Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio {{around the corner from}} Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as [...] "a nest of gentle artists"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization <b>of</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore.|$|E
