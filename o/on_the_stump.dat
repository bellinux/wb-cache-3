5|$|In his 1958 reelection campaign, McGovern faced {{a strong}} {{challenge}} from South Dakota's two-term Republican Governor and World War II Medal of Honor recipient Joe Foss, who was initially considered the favorite to win. But McGovern ran an effective campaign that showcased his political strengths of having firm beliefs {{and the ability}} to articulate them in debates and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> He prevailed with a slightly larger margin than two years before.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{played a}} key role in 1856 in {{bringing}} forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because of his success as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, and his name was put in nomination by supporters (knowing that he supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore. Banks was active <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> in support of Frémont, who lost the election to James Buchanan; Banks easily won reelection to his own seat. Democrats, however, regained control of the House of Representatives, depriving him of the speakership.|$|E
5|$|Methods for {{controlling}} {{the spread of}} Armillaria root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. Biological control is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. In one study, thinning stumps of Eucalyptus diversicolor were simultaneously inoculated with A.luteobubalina {{and one of the}} saprobic wood decay fungi Coriolus versicolor, Stereum hirsutum and Xylaria hypoxylon; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by A.luteobubalinea. These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of A.luteobubalina <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> base.|$|E

50|$|If the bails {{have been}} removed from <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> a batsman is only out if the fielder pulls a <b>stump</b> out of <b>the</b> ground with the hand holding the ball. If one bail is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> <b>the</b> fielder is allowed to knock the bail off to claim a run out.|$|R
50|$|Adventitious buds form <b>on</b> roots near <b>the</b> ground surface, <b>on</b> damaged stems (as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> of cut trees), or on old roots. These {{develop into}} {{above-ground}} stems and leaves.|$|R
25|$|While Roosevelt {{followed}} {{the tradition of}} incumbents in not actively campaigning <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump,</b> he sought to control the campaign's message through specific instructions to Cortelyou. He also attempted to manage the press's release of White House statements by forming the Ananias Club. Any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access.|$|E
25|$|The Premiership was a reclusive office {{prior to}} 1832. The {{incumbent}} worked with his Cabinet {{and other government}} officials; he occasionally met with the Sovereign, and attended Parliament when it was in session during the spring and summer. He never went out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> to campaign, even during elections; he rarely spoke directly to ordinary voters about policies and issues.|$|E
25|$|Each year two scrolls are {{prepared}} by {{the vice president of}} the Inner Circle: one says early spring and one says six more weeks of winter. These scrolls are placed during the ceremony <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> and after Phil is awoken by the crowd, Phil communicates in Groundhogese to the President who is then directed by Phil to the proper scroll and forecast.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} in the second Test of the 1960–61 series involved the West Indies player Joe Solomon being given out after his hat fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> after being bowled at by Richie Benaud. The crowd sided with the West Indies over the Australians.|$|R
25|$|If a bowler's {{delivery}} hits <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> and if {{at least}} one bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> <b>the</b> striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in <b>the</b> <b>stump's</b> spigots). <b>The</b> ball can either have struck <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not bowled out if the ball is touched by a fielder or touched by the wicket-keeper or the umpire before hitting <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b> <b>The</b> batsman is not out if <b>the</b> bails remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The valley's name may {{originate}} {{from a time}} when a great windstorm felled hundreds of spruce and fir trees on its slopes. These moss-covered stumps resembled graves. Another theory says that extensive logging during the early 1900s left stumps behind. Mosses and lichens grew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> resembling an overgrown graveyard.|$|R
25|$|Whether it be {{as a legal}} professional, educator, or feminist, the Iowa native spearheaded her own one-woman {{progressive}} movement. The range rider {{seemed to}} be constantly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> in Wyoming giving speeches, organizing historical associations, conducting citizenship classes for immigrants, participating in the local and national suffragist movement, lobbying for child-welfare laws, serving as a Red Cross volunteer, and traveling the state selling war bonds during World War I.|$|E
25|$|The bent of {{his mind}} was decidedly political. He was a natural born politician. Politics was his meat and drink, and nothing so delighted him as the {{opportunity}} to engage in political discussion {{in which he was}} apt to engross most of the time. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> he was a formidable antagonist and his experiences in this respect has probably never been equaled in Perry County. His knowledge of the roads, streams and by paths, the ravings and hollows, the school houses and places of public resort in Perry county was surpassed by no one.|$|E
25|$|Taylor’s {{campaign}} in 1904 was unsuccessful. The party’s promise to put 300 speakers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> {{to support his}} candidacy and its plan to field 6,000 candidates for local offices failed to materialize. No newspaper supported the party. State laws kept the party from listing candidates officially on election ballots. Taylor’s name failed {{to be added to}} any state ballot. The votes he received were not recorded in state records. William Scott, who had been the party convention’s first choice as candidate, later estimated that the party had received 65,000 votes nationwide, a number that could not be verified.|$|E
25|$|It {{was used}} in the game in the 19th Century, where {{trajectory}} was the most important consideration. Lob bowlers, both right and left-handed, sometimes attempted 'donkey drops', pitching <b>the</b> ball <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> from as great a height as possible, preferably with the ball descending behind the batsman standing at the crease.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} bizarre hit wicket {{dismissals}} was of Sri Lanka national cricket team captain Kumar Sangakkara in the finals of the triangular ODI Compaq Cup against India at Colombo on 14 September 2009, as he attempted a shot and in the follow through his bat slipped out of his hands, flew backwards {{in the air and}} landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{the dell}} of Shadow Brook, Eustace Bright {{and his little}} friends had eaten their dinner. They had brought plenty of good things from Tanglewood, in their baskets, and had spread them out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> of trees and on mossy trunks, and had feasted merrily, and made a very nice dinner indeed. After it was over, nobody felt like stirring.|$|R
25|$|Luce {{returned}} to politics during the 1952 presidential election and she campaigned {{on behalf of}} Republican candidate Dwight Eisenhower, giving more than 100 speeches on his behalf. Her anti-Communist speeches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump,</b> radio, and television were effective in persuading {{a large number of}} traditionally Democrat-voting Catholics to switch parties and vote Eisenhower. For her contributions Luce was rewarded with an appointment as Ambassador to Italy, a post that oversaw 1150 employees, 8 consulates, and 9 information centers. She was confirmed by the Senate in March 1953, the first American woman ever to hold such an important diplomatic post.|$|E
25|$|In the 1844 {{election}} Willard, a Democrat, stumped {{all around}} the Louisville area and southern Indiana for James Polk who ultimately won the election. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> the people of New Albany, Indiana so liked him that they invited him to come live in their community. He accepted their offer and moved there {{in the spring of}} 1845 and set up a law office. Finding there to be a lack of clients, he also worked for a time as a writer in the clerk's office to obtain extra income. He met Carline C. Cook, a town native, and was married to her in 1847. The couple had three children, but the oldest, Ashbel P. Willard Jr. died from scarlet fever at age three. New Albany remained Willard's home {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|As {{the crowd}} departs, the stump starts cackling {{and makes the}} charlatan confess. The stump cackles again, {{demanding}} the king never hurt a wizard again, and build a statue of Babbitty <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> {{to remind him of}} his foolishness. The king agrees and heads back to the palace. Afterwards, a [...] "stout old rabbit" [...] with a wand in its teeth hops out from a hole beneath the stump and leaves the kingdom.|$|E
30|$|A hectare of land encroached by A. drepanolobium and A. mellifera {{was divided}} into three plots. Each {{replication}} (plot) with an area of 33.33 m by 100 m {{was divided into}} five sub-plots, each with 20 m by 33.33 m ready to accommodate five treatments, namely cutting at 0.5 m above ground and pouring kerosene <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> T 1, cutting at 0.5 m above ground and debarking <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> down into <b>the</b> soil surface T 2, cutting at 0.5 m above ground alone T 3, cutting at 0.5 m above ground and dissecting <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> T 4 and no cutting T 5.|$|R
25|$|The {{giant sequoia}} regenerates by seed. Young trees start to bear cones {{at the age}} of 12 years. Trees up to about 20 years old may produce stump sprouts {{subsequent}} to injury, but unlike coast redwoods, shoots do not form <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> of mature trees. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from their boles when branches are lost to fire or breakage.|$|R
50|$|Park Ridge Provisional School {{opened on}} 23 April 1895 located between Rosia Road and Hillcrest Road; {{it became a}} state school on 1 January 1909. Unfortunately, the {{building}} did not have ant caps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> and eventually <b>the</b> white ants damaged the building. In 1915, the school relocated to its present site where the (then) disused Browns Plains Provision School had been relocated.|$|R
500|$|Biden {{ran for the}} 1988 Democratic presidential nomination, {{formally}} declaring {{his candidacy}} at the Wilmington train station on June 9, 1987. [...] He was attempting to become the youngest president since John F. Kennedy. When the campaign began, he was considered a potentially strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump,</b> his appeal to Baby Boomers, his high-profile position {{as chair of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his fundraising appeal. He raised $1.7million {{in the first quarter of}} 1987, more than any other candidate.|$|E
500|$|Biden was {{initially}} {{considered one of}} the potentially strongest candidates as campaigning began in 1987. [...] This was because of his moderate image, his speaking ability <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> (rated second only to that of Jesse Jackson), his appeal to Baby Boomers, his high-profile position as chair of the Senate Judiciary committee, looming for the Robert Bork confirmation hearings, and his fundraising appealhis $1.7 million raised {{in the first quarter of}} 1987 was more than any other candidate. [...] By the end of April he had raised $2 million, using not just contributions from Delaware but also establishing a base of support among young professionals and Jewish voters in a number of urban- and suburban-oriented states. [...] He had no campaign debt, and Fortune magazine termed his [...] "most impressive start" [...] a [...] "surprise".|$|E
500|$|When {{the head}} of {{household}} finds a suitable tree, he {{stands in front of}} it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words [...] "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the Sign of the Cross, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: [...] "I have come to you to take to my home, to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place." [...] He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put gloves on before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. It must not be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man. In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called [...] "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off {{from the base of the}} tree. In Šumadija, half of a circular loaf of bread is left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump,</b> the other half being eaten on the way back home. In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.|$|E

2500|$|In 46 Test innings, {{only one}} of them was {{converted}} into a century (against India at Delhi on his first Test tour), while his occasional leg breaks yielded four Test wickets – including two batsmen with Test batting averages above 45, Ken Barrington and Bill Lawry. He also contributed to the result in the first Tied Test in 1960, when his long-range throw hit <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> to run out Ian Meckiff, who was going for the winning run. In the next Test, he was out hit wicket after his cap fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Donovan {{ran on the}} Republican line in 1932 {{to succeed}} Franklin D. Roosevelt as Governor of New York. Assisting Donovan in his 1932 {{campaign}} was journalist James J.

But despite Donovan's offstage charm and force, he {{proved to be an}} uninspiring campaigner <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> He ran a disorganized, strategy-free campaign, and in the end lost to the Democratic nominee, Herbert Lehman.|$|E
2500|$|The {{election}} of 1888 afforded Tillman {{an opportunity to}} convince the politicians to accept the Clemson bequest or face {{the possibility of being}} voted out of office. [...] He demanded that the Democratic party nominate its candidates by the primary system, which was denied, but they did accept his request that the candidates for statewide office canvass the state. [...] Tillman proved excellent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump,</b> by far superior to his Conservative opponents, and as the Democratic convention neared there was a clear groundswell of support for the acceptance of Clemson's estate.|$|E
2500|$|According to Harper's New Monthly Magazine, {{toward the}} end of his career, he was present when an {{itinerant}} missionary was exhorting an open-air congregation in Mansfield, Ohio. The sermon was long and severe on the topic of extravagance, because the pioneers were buying such indulgences as calico and imported tea. [...] "Where now is there a man who, like the primitive Christians, is traveling to heaven barefooted and clad in coarse raiment?" [...] the preacher repeatedly asked until Johnny Appleseed, his endurance worn out, walked up to the preacher, put his bare foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> that had served as a podium, and said, [...] "Here's your primitive Christian!" [...] The flummoxed sermonizer dismissed the congregation.|$|E

25|$|If {{the umpires}} {{have agreed to}} {{dispense}} with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> <b>the</b> {{decision as to whether}} the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's bat, person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.|$|R
