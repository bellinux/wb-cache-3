5|$|Members of the Westerfield Club hire Brisco County, Jr. (Bruce Campbell), {{the son of}} {{the slain}} U.S. Marshal, to track and re-capture Bly (Billy Drago) and his gang. The Westerfield Club's timid lawyer, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemenson) relays {{instructions}} and financial support to Brisco. Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County's fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival.

5|$|The plot of Arrested Development {{revolves}} around {{the members of the}} Bluth family, a formerly-wealthy family who continue to lead extravagant lifestyles despite their changed circumstances and who <b>often</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> drawn into interactions with incestuous undertones. At the center of the show is Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman), the show's straight man, who strives {{to do the right thing}} and keep his family together, despite their materialism, selfishness, and manipulative natures. Michael is a widowed single father. His teenage son, George Michael (Michael Cera), has the same qualities of decency but feels a constant pressure to live up to his father's expectations and is often reluctant to follow his father's plans. He battles with a crush he has on cousin Maeby, which developed from a kiss she gave him as part of a prank.|$|E

25|$|Crayfish <b>often</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> in a {{conflicting}} {{situation where}} they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when they suddenly receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it is absolutely necessary.|$|E

25|$|Nawaz notes how all {{transnational}} {{social movements}} of today, whether European Neo-fascism or Islamism, are extremist in nature, and democracy aspirants {{all over the}} world are left behind. He criticises the idea of political correctness, and the hesitation of democrats in asserting the universality of democratic norms. He also points to the political failure of many states in the Muslim world as a contributing factor. According to Nawaz, there is absence of democratic choice in many Muslim-majority countries, which means that their democratic parties <b>often</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> competing with non-democratic parties, including theocratic and military-backed ones. The political failure of democratic parties is taken as a failure of democracy itself in the Muslim world.|$|E

Within the simulation, correct and incorrect knowledge diffuse simultaneously, however, simulation agents are not explicitly made aware that contradictory information exists. Instead, they may become aware of this by obtaining both correct and incorrect knowledge of the same piece of information. The agent must then determine what knowledge to accept. We implement various models of how people react to conflicting knowledge, which we refer to as intrapersonal conflict resolution strategies (ICRS).

There were, however, no qualifications for this majority to include religious believers associated with the given religious structure. This allowed the practice to be conducted in the following years wherein a meeting would be organized under pressure at which believers who attended would be risking their social status and would <b>often</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> in a minority, which would allow for a vote to close the structure.

25|$|Counties {{have since}} {{gone out of}} use in Australia, and are rarely used or even known {{by most of the}} {{population}} today. Part of the reason is that counties are based on the size of land, rather than population, so in a large country where most of the population live in cities on the coast while the countryside has a very low population density, they have little relevance. The counties which contain the capital cities have millions of people, while those in remote areas have a very small population. The County of Adelaide, for instance, has a larger population than all the other counties in South Australia combined. Another reason {{is that many of the}} counties' borders follow rivers, having been proclaimed before settlements developed, which means that towns which typically grow up on rivers <b>often</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> in more than one county. Wangaratta, for instance, is located at the junction of the Ovens and King rivers, and is thus in three counties; Moira, Delatite and Bogong.|$|E
25|$|From 1956 {{there was}} a move toward the return of {{regional}} colour schemes. Most regions adopted a maroon livery which strongly resembled that of the former London Midland and Scottish Railway but the Western Region returned some of its coaches that were used on named express trains to a chocolate/cream scheme {{similar to that used}} by the GWR before nationalisation and from July 1956 the Southern Region began using a 'coaching stock' green that was somewhat darker than the malachite green colour of the old Southern Railway. For cost reasons, liveries were usually changed piecemeal, when coaches came in for scheduled maintenance. Coaches from different regions could also <b>often</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> coupled together. Due to the consequent muddle of liveries, many trains began to get an untidy if not tatty appearance which added to the run-down image of the railway. The rebranding of British Railways to British Rail on 1 January 1965 was coupled with the introduction of an entirely new national livery.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{in-depth}} single {{case study of}} a frontline social work team based in the third sector. The Bromyard Team provided comprehensive parenting assessments in care proceedings and safeguarding matters. This research is partly derived from the author‟s own experience and makes use of ethnographic and psychoanalytically informed observations of ordinary day to day work processes in the professional team. The study aims to identify, understand and conceptualize the variety of emotional forces and relationship dynamics that impact on first line managers in social work and social care settings in order to deepen and extend understanding of these demands, and the stresses and conflicts managed by professionals in these roles. The author undertook Management Consultative Interviews (MCIs) with the managers of this service, {{in which they were}} afforded space to think about their roles and detailed field logs of researcher/observer experiences were used to gather data. The emergent data identified four emergent episodes, these were analyzed using aspects of thematic analysis informed by psychoanalytic theory. The overall findings of the study are that the first line manager <b>often</b> <b>finds</b> <b>themselves</b> assailed from all sides: task related anxieties that filter through the front line workers, organisational anxieties and projections that trickle down from above, wider environmental anxieties that rock the stability of services and also impact on more senior staff, personal anxieties and projections that invade the professional space and organisational/systemic anxieties arising from inter-group, cross-boundary role tensions. The author recommends that rather than being left to cope with such experiences, front line managers need effective and robust support, which would promote further understanding of the emotional and unconscious forces affecting their role...|$|R

To highlight some of the organizational issues facing CBOs,Anglin (2000) observes that many community development organizations “operate outside the norms of good organizational practice. Accounting is haphazard. Boards are weak and lack the diverse skills needed to guide an organization.

50|$|Safety net {{hospitals}} <b>often</b> times <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> {{in difficult}} financial positions. This {{is due to}} the vulnerable state of the payers. Safety net hospitals have high rates of Medicaid payers and Medicaid is an unreliable form of payment. Also, there is a high rate of patients that do not have insurance and have low income, so that is yet another unreliable form of payment. In 2013, hospitals across the country generated $44.6 billion in uncompensated care costs, which are services that the hospital provides that the patient cannot pay. These hospitals can afford to provide the services that produce these uncompensated costs due to the funding from the federal, state, and local levels of government. Also, there is a complex array of public funding that comes to safety net hospitals mostly through Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments, Medicaid Upper Payment Limit Payments, Medicaid DSH Payments, Medicaid Indirect Medical Education Payments, and state/local indigent health programs. These public funds are, for the most part, coming from Medicaid and Medicare, and in 2013, about $30 billion public dollars were used to pay back safety net hospital uncompensated costs.|$|R

40|$|Public {{debate about}} the ethical {{acceptability}} of genetically modified (GM) plants in general and GM food in particular, is highly polarized. Proponents of GM products passionately argue that novel gene technologies {{have the potential to}} contribute to more efficient agricultural processes, promote environmental sustainability, and curb malnutrition in the developing world. Opponents of novel plant biotechnologies, counter with equal vehemence, that GM products are unnatural, potentially harmful to humans, and capable of catastrophic environmental injury. As more uses for GM products are realised, and investment in plant biotechnologies continues to grow, both groups have stepped up advocacy of their respective views in academic and public forums. Both sides continue to be at loggerheads with one another, in trying to force the public to choose between their two opposing views. This research discusses in detail the most prominent arguments put forward in favour of, and in opposition to, the development and use of novel plant biotechnologies. It covers developing and industrialized contexts and describes the most likely applications of GM products within these contexts. The principal approach used in this analysis is one that embraces a spirit of pragmatism in its commitment to moving forward through the traditional impasse in which ethical and policy debates <b>often</b> <b>finds</b> <b>themselves.</b> This project sets out to clarify the issues, explore the most salient of these, and make suggestions about the best ways to move the debate forward. Early on in this work it is established that within specified constraints, novel plant technologies have the capacity to make a substantial contribution to agricultural practices, the environment, and the wider community. These assumptions are carried throughout the project and serve as points of departure in discussions about the ethical concerns raised by the application of novel genetic technologies to plants. One of the aims of this research is to produce a piece of work that can inform future policy decisions related to agricultural and environmental applications of GM technologies in Australia and elsewhere.
