5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|Thus far, the German fighters had {{performed}} well, {{but now it}} came to {{the most difficult part of}} the operation: withdrawing under attack. The German fighters were low on fuel and could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to protect the bombers. Damaged stragglers lagged behind the main bomber streams and were easy prey for RAF fighters if they could be found. The four German raiding formations were all heading in different directions by 13:30: 9 Staffel were well clear to the south, heading back over Beachy Head; KG 1 were completing their bomb run while the Spitfires of 610 were being held at arm's length by JG 54 Bf 109s; the Ju 88s of KG 76 had attacked West Malling and their escorts were battling Nos. 32, 64, 501 and 615 Squadrons. The Dorniers were heading home under attack by elements of 32, 64 and 615 Squadrons. However, further to the east, Nos. 1, 17, 54, 56 and 266 Squadrons totalling 23 Spitfires and 36 Hurricanes were moving in to meet the main formations during their withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{haphazard}} {{nature of}} evacuation, many labourers did not arrive with their factory, {{and had to}} find labour on their own, though jobs were hard to come by. Additionally, cities like Tashkent became overwhelmed at {{the sheer volume of}} people arriving at its gates and had great difficulty supplying the food and shelter necessary for evacuees. Upon arrival, many evacuees died of illness or starvation in extreme poverty in Central Asia. Uzbek officials set up aid stations at Tashkent, which were mirrored at other railway stations to help combat the poverty, but they could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as little could be spared economically for the war effort. Despite these troubles, the ability of Central Asia to absorb Soviet industry and population {{to the extent that it}} did and in the harried manner that it did was impressive. The Germans certainly didn't foresee the preparedness of Soviet Central Asia, and in the end they paid dearly for it.|$|E
60|$|Mabel sickened at this sight, {{which not}} <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{violence}} to all her notions of propriety, but {{which was in}} itself so revolting and so opposed to natural feeling. She withdrew to a seat, and hid {{her face in her}} apron for several minutes, until a low call from June again drew her to a loophole. The latter then pointed out the body of Jennie seemingly standing in the door of a hut, leaning forward as if to look at the group of men, her cap fluttering in the wind, and her hand grasping a broom. The distance was too great to distinguish the features very accurately; but Mabel fancied that the jaw had been depressed, as if to distort the mouth into a sort of horrible laugh.|$|R

500|$|A {{collection}} of previously unreleased studio recordings from 1987 to 1991, {{was released in}} 2000 as No Boundaries. This release was not endorsed by the Cassidy family and was released under a different label. An AllMusic review of the album stated that even [...] "a gifted vocalist like Eva Cassidy can <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with bad material".|$|E
500|$|The {{appearance}} of Samantha Mulder, {{this time as}} a clone of her from {{when she was still}} a little girl, was due to series creator Chris Carter's desire to bring her back. Carter felt Samantha was an important element of the show, referring to her as being part of the lifeblood of the series. The decision to kill the character X was made {{at the end of the}} third season. The writers felt that they could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger player on the show, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Fox Mulder. Ultimately they decided on the latter. This led to the introduction of Marita Covarrubias at the end of the episode, Mulder's latest informant.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to have the character of X killed off in [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] was made {{at the end of}} the third season. The writers felt that they could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger character in the series, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Mulder. The show's producers decided to give Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully cancer early in the fourth season. Carter initially discussed giving Scully's mother cancer but decided to have Scully suffer from it instead. Carter felt the move would give the show an interesting platform on which to discuss things such as faith, science, health care and a certain element of the paranormal. Some of the writing staff felt that the decision was a poor one to make, citing it as [...] "a cheap TV thing". However, Frank Spotnitz felt that, given the appearances of cancer-stricken abductees in previous episodes, it was an [...] "obligatory" [...] move to have Scully follow suit.|$|E
50|$|The {{downturn}} {{was directly}} related to the twin losses of QB Randall Cunningham (broken leg) and WR Fred Barnett (ACL tear) to season-ending injuries in a 35-30 win against the New York Jets on October 3. Though the Eagles won their first four, following that game, lost six straight to fall out of playoff contention. Bubby Brister was <b>only</b> able to <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in a starting role, but the club rallied to win their final three games, including their first road win in San Francisco in 10 years.|$|R
50|$|Efforts to man-rate the Titan II {{also ran}} {{afoul of the}} fact that the Air Force and not NASA was in charge of its development. The former's primary aim was to develop a missile system, not a launch vehicle for Project Gemini, and they were only {{interested}} in technical improvements to the booster insofar as they had relevance to that program. On 29 January, the Air Force Ballistic Systems Division (BSD) declared that pogo in the Titan had been reduced sufficiently enough for inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) use and that no further improvements needed to be made. While adding more pressure to the propellant tanks had reduced vibration, it could <b>only</b> be <b>done</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> before putting unsafe structural loads on the Titan and in any case the results were still unsatisfactory from NASA's point of view. While BSD tried to come up with a way to help NASA out, they finally decided that it was not worth the time, resources, and risk of trying to cut down further on pogo and that the ICBM program ultimately came first.|$|R
5000|$|In case {{of failure}} to achieve any gains by a strike, the worker resorts to sabotage, the silent strike by which are gained all the {{advantages}} of the open strike without its dangers; i.e., the men keep their places at their machines, thus preventing and making unnecessary the employment of scabs, pretending to do the work for which they receive their pay, but actually <b>doing</b> <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of it as is needed to deceive the overseers. At the same time the worker employs many methods of attacking the employer, such as breaking delicate parts of machinery, mixing wrong ingredients into compounds, telling truth or lies to customers, anything, in short, to force the employer to terms.It is useless to assert that these methods will not appeal to AngloSaxon workers, as does one writer on the subject. Certainly sabotage is not [...] "fair-play," [...] but neither is {{in the eyes of the}} laborer, the condition which forces him to it.|$|R
2500|$|The film did {{not perform}} well at the box office, and {{was not one of}} the few films {{released}} by RKO that year which posted a profit. Mordaunt Hall, critic for The New York Times was less than impressed by the film, calling it [...] "unbelievable", and stating that both the script and the acting were [...] "crude". He did, however, give credit to the performance of Sidney Toler, as the one bright spot for the film. Modern Screen magazine only rated the film [...] "fair", making the comment that the actors tried their best with the material given them, but they could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with the improbable plot. Motion Picture Daily also referenced the improbable plot, while giving credit to the attempts by the acting crew to overcome the material. They went on to call Brown's direction, [...] "ineffectual". Screenland called it a [...] "weak melodrama", and gave credit to the cast for attempting to overcome the implausible script.|$|E
2500|$|Volume 1 {{focuses on}} the {{introduction}} of the characters of the story, marking the events that lead to their team formations. All the while, mysterious thefts of Dust are occurring around the city of Vale, notably organized by the show's antagonist, Roman Torchwick. Volume 2 follows up from these events of Volume 1, and team RWBY sets out in order to investigate the meaning behind these thefts. They aim to discover the villain's plans for the city of Vale before the Vytal Festival—a festival between the four kingdoms of Remnant where they have their best students demonstrate their skills and abilities in celebration of the peace between all four kingdoms. Volume 3 starts with the beginning of the Vytal Festival; however, a sinister plot lurks behind the celebratory events, and the heroes can <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to prepare for the evil that is coming. Volume 4 takes place six to eight months following the events of Volume 3, with the members of Team RWBY separated and {{in different parts of the}} globe, mainly trying to get to [...] "Mistral" [...] (another location in the series) where another Huntsman Academy is located, to prepare it for a new evil. Volume 5 follows the members of Team RWBY each making their way to Mistral, as well as picking themselves back up after recovering during the previous Volume.|$|E

6000|$|On a tiger-skin {{from the}} ice-clad {{regions of the}} sunless north recline the heroes of Ouida, rose-scented cigars in their mouths; {{themselves}} gloriously indolent and disdainful, but perhaps huddled a little too closely together {{on account of the}} limited accommodation. Strathmore is here. But I never felt sure of Strathmore. Was there not less in him than met the eye? His place, Whiteladies, was a home for kings and queens; but he was not the luxurious, magnanimous creature he feigned to be. A host may be known by the cigars he keeps; and, though it is perhaps a startling thing to say, we have good reason for believing that Strathmore did not buy good cigars. I question very much whether he had many Havanas, even of the second quality, at Whiteladies; if he had, he certainly kept them locked up. <b>Only</b> once <b>does</b> he <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as refer to them when at his own place, and then in the most general and suspicious way. [...] "Bah!" [...] he exclaims to a friend; [...] "there is Phil smoking these wretched musk-scented cigarettes again! they are only fit for Lady Georgie or Eulalie Papellori. What taste, when there are my Havanas and cheroots!" [...] The remark, in whatever way considered, is suggestive. In the first place, it is made late in the evening, after Strathmore and his friend have left the smoking-room. Thus it is a safe observation. I would not {{go so far as to}} say that he had no Havanas in the house; the likelihood is that he had a few in his cigar-case, kept there for show rather than use. These, if I understand the man, would be a good brand, but of small size--perhaps Reinas--and they would hardly be of a well-known crop. In color they would be dark--say maduro--and he would explain that he bought them because he liked full-flavored weeds. Possibly he had a Villar y Villar box with six or eight in the bottom of it; but boxes are not cigars. What he did provide his friends with was Manillas. He smoked them himself, and how careful he was of them is seen on every other page. He is constantly stopping in the middle of his conversation to [...] "curl a loose leaf round his Manilla;" [...] when one would have expected a hero like Strathmore to fling away a cigar when its leaves began to untwist, and light another. So thrifty is Strathmore that he even laboriously [...] "curls the leaves round his cigarettes"--he <b>does</b> not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as pretend that they are Egyptian; nay, even when quarrelling with Errol, his beloved friend (whom he shoots through the heart), he takes a cigarette from his mouth and [...] "winds a loosened leaf" [...] round it.|$|R
