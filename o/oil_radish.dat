40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} effects of long-term N fertilizer application rates on dry matter (DM) production and nitrogen (N) accumulation in an <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus L.) cover crop. The N fertilizer application was done to the main crop winter wheat (Triticum spp.) before <b>oil</b> <b>radish.</b> The experiment was carried out at the research station (Lönnstorp) at SLU, Alnarp in a long-term experiment with (conventional and reduced tillage systems) different N fertilizer application rates in a crop rotation including cover crops. The autumn cover crop DM production and N accumulation were significantly increased with the increased amount of N fertilizer applications to the main crop. According to the hypothesis, the observations of DM production and N accumulation {{were expected to be}} in a linear trend with the N levels but they were highly significant with the N levels without any linear increasing tendency. A socio-economic evaluation of cover crops was estimated by comparing the establishment costs of cover crop and the economic value of N conserved in the cover crop, assuming its value to be similar to the value of synthetic N fertilizer. The results showed that the cost of establishing <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> as cover crop was not completely compensated by the economic value of N conserved in the system. However, several other beneficial aspects of cover crops are discussed to have positive effects in agrosystems, but their economic valuations are complex. Incorporation of cover crop in cropping system has shown to improve biodiversity, suppress of pests and weeds, reduce soil erosion, improve soil organic matter (SOM) and soil texture and structure. Finally, considering the beneficial environmental aspects of cover crops, introducing more subsidies from national and international levels will increase the interest of farmers to grow more cover crops to improve sustainability of cropping system...|$|E
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Vermicompost tea (VCT), a {{water extract}} of vermicompost (VC), has been {{documented}} to suppress several soil-borne pathogens as well as plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). Previous research has not showed consistent performance of VCT for suppressing PPNs. Several factors affect the performance of VCT for PPNs suppression. This thesis focused on studying potential factors affecting the VCT in suppression of PPNs and understanding some mechanisms involved in PPNs suppression by VCT. Specific objectives of this thesis were 1) determining the effects of VCT prepared from different curing ages of VC on penetration, reproduction and hatch of Meloidogyne spp., root-knot nematodes (RKs), 2) determining the effective VCT drenching frequency for suppression of RKs, and enhancement of free-living nematodes in a cucumber agroecosystem, and 3) determining if VCT drenching could induces host plant resistance on cucumber (Cucumis sativus). Three greenhouse trials showed that VCT prepared from uncured and partially cured (cured for 1 - 1. 5 months) VC consistently reduced root penetration and hatch of M. incognita at 1 and 2 weeks after VCT treatment, respectively. However, VCT drenching did not suppress M. incognita reproduction on tomato (Solanum lycopersicon) and cucumber in longer-term greenhouse trials (2. 5 months) despite repeated drenching at 2 -week interval. Thus {{the next logical step}} was to evaluate drenching frequency for effective management of PPNs in the field. Two cucumber field trials were conducted to examine the drenching frequency of VCT in conjunction with a pre-plant nematode management technique, of a <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus) cover crop. VCT drenching at 1 -week intervals consistently reduced the abundance of RKs in both trials, but <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> only suppressed the abundance of RKs in Trial II. Weekly VCT drenching also increased abundance of bacterivorous nematodes in Trial I (P < 0. 05), indicating an enhancement of bacteria decomposition. VCT drenching could further improve soil health when integrated with <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> cover crop as indicated by higher nematode richness and abundance of Ecumenicus, an omnivorous nematode. However, this effect of VCT on soil health was not obvious in Trial II. Weather conditions might {{play a role in the}} inconsistent performance of VCT drenching on soil health. Although VCT drenching had no effect on cucumber yield, <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> cover crop consistently increased cucumber yield. Thus, integration of VCT drenching with <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> cover cropping could offer an economical nematode management practice. To understand the mechanism on how VCT prepared from uncured VC suppress PPNs, split-root experiments and quantitative real time PCR were used to test the hypothesis on whether VCT drenching induced the expression of plant defense related genes. Split-root experiments showed that drenching VCT prepared from uncured VC on one side of the cucumber roots significantly suppressed root penetration of M. incognita on the other side of the roots compared to the water control (P < 0. 05). Plants drenched with VCT showed an increased expression of CHIT- 1 at 2 days after M. incognita inoculation, and increased expression of PAL- 1 at 2 and 8 days after M. incognita inoculation. VCT drenching resulted in up regulation of LOX- 1 at 2 and 5 days and down regulation of PR 1 at 5 and 8 d after M. incognita inoculation. CHIT- 1, PAL- 1 and LOX- 1 were known to be involved in Induce Systemic Resistance (ISR) on cucumber. Down regulation of PR 1 supporting the hypothesis that VCT did not induce Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR). This is the first study to demonstrate the ability of using VCT prepared from uncured VC as root drenching to induce ISR on cucumber. Although this induction of ISR was short lived, drenching VCT at a weekly interval could provide consistent suppression of root-knot nematodes for a cucumber crop. Thus, use of VCT prepared from an uncured VC is a viable post-plant nematode management tool against RK...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} address {{environmental}} and sustainability issues, in 2015 the European Commission replaced the Single Farm Payment Scheme by a Basic Payment including a “greening” payment that is worth about 30 % of the total payment. A prerequisite for greening payments includes to maintain an “ecological focus area” covering at least 5 % of the area of holding. This request can alternatively be achieved by sowing nitrogen fixing catch/cover crops in the off season (generally in fall and winter).

The biochar treatment received 10 Mgha− 1 wood-derived biochar in September 2012. Four levels of N fertilizer, corresponding to 0, 50 %, 100 %, 130 % of the recommended fertilizer level, were applied in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)) and winter rye (Secale cereal L.) in 2013 and 2014 followed by the catch crop <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis).

Relay-intercrop production involves overlapping growth cycles {{of two or more}} crops. This production system is common with legumes seeded into small grains; however, the companion crops may compete for water, nutrients, and sunlight, which may slow development of either crop. Relay-intercropped soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] production involves seeding wheat in the fall and an intercrop seeding of soybeans into standing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). This cropping system has been proposed to reduce risk associated with double-crop soybean production, move double-crop production farther north, and increase farm profitability.

The rate of dry matter accumulation in intervals of 14 days appeared to be determined primarily by the amount of radiation intercepted. A regression, forced through the origin, gave as a common slope 1. 12 g dry matter accumulated per MJ intercepted global radiation, irrespective of season, species, sowing date or nitrogen treatment (period from ca. day 250 to day 310). From this result the inference is made that leaf expansion is a key process, determining the performance of catch crop species under varying environmental conditions...|$|E

In the greenhouse study, reproduction was suppressed similarly by the resistant sugar beet cultivar Nematop and all trap crop cultivars (P ≤ 0. 05). In the growth chamber study, the radish cultivars were superior {{to most of}} the mustard cultivars in reducing nematode populations. All trap crops showed less reproduction than Nematop (P ≤ 0. 05). In both studies, Nematop and all trap crops had lower Pf than susceptible sugar beet cultivars HH 50 and HM 9155 (P ≤ 0. 05). In field studies, Rf values of radish cultivars decreased with increasing Pi of H. schachtii (r² = 0. 59 in 2000 and r² = 0. 26 in 2001). In 2000, trap crop radish cv. Colonel (Rf = 0. 89) reduced nematode populations more than cv. Adagio (Rf = 4. 67) and cv. Rimbo (Rf = 13. 23) (P ≤ 0. 05) when Pi was lower than 2. 5 H. schachtii eggs and J 2 /cm³ soil.

A field experiment was initiated in 2002 to evaluate winter weed dynamics following various winter cover crops in both continuous cotton and a corn and cotton rotation. Winter cover crops included black oats (Avena strigosa Schreb.); two crimson clover entries (Trifolium incarnatum L.); two cultivars of forage rape (Brassica napus L. var. napus), spring and winter; <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus var. oleiformis Pers.); three cultivars of turnip (Brassica rapa L. subsp. rapa); white lupin (Lupinus albus L.); and a mixture of black oat and lupin. Two-year conservation-tillage rotational sequences included conventionally tilled continuous corn and cotton winter fallow systems as controls. The 10 conservation-tillage, winter cover-crop systems investigated were three continuous cotton systems that alternated a winter legume (lupin or clover), six cotton-corn systems, where lupin preceded cotton and radish, rape, or turnip preceded corn, and a cotton-corn system that had a lupin-black oat mixture as a winter cover crop every year. Use of lupin or ‘AU Robin ’ clover resulted in weed biomass reduction of up to 80 % and 54 %, respectively, in weed biomass compared to the fallow system. The highest yielding corn-cotton conservation tillage rotation with a winter cover yielded 200 lbs/acre more that the continuous cotton winter fallow system. Continuous conventional corn with winter fallow yielded 30 bu/acre less than the highest yielding 2 -yr, conservation tillage winter crop system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{goals of}} this work were to present {{original}} liquid-liquid equilibrium data of the system containing glycerol + ethanol + ethyl biodiesel from fodder <b>radish</b> <b>oil,</b> including the individual distribution of each ethyl ester; to adjust binary parameters of the NRTL; to compare NRTL and UNIFAC-Dortmund in the LLE representation of the system containing glycerol; to simulate different mixer/settler flowsheets for biodiesel purification, evaluating the ratio water/biodiesel used. In thermodynamic modeling, the deviations between experimental data and calculated values were 0. 97 % and 3. 6 %, respectively, using NRTL and UNIFAC-Dortmund. After transesterification, with 3 moles of excess ethanol, removal of this component until a content equal to 0. 08 before an ideal settling step allows a glycerol content lower than 0. 02 % in the ester-rich phase. Removal of ethanol, glycerol and water from biodiesel can be performed with countercurrent mixer/settler, using 0. 27 % of water {{in relation to the}} ester amount in the feed stream...|$|R
40|$|Difficulties {{with the}} supply of organic protein feed; low crop yields and low value of leguminous forage crops {{and a lack of}} organic fertiliszers are {{nowadays}} threesome of the major challenges faced by farms with monogastric animals. Thus, forcing the organic farmers to import feed and manure forom conventional farms. The main idea of the OrganoFinery project is to develop a green biorefinery concept where the same organic crop is utilizsed for animal feed, fertilizser and energy production in the form of methane, coping in this way with those challenges. One of the aims of the project includes the identification of crops that can be grown on organic arable farms, where there is generally a significant lack of nitrogen. Particularly legumes are interesting as they can biologically fix N, producing large amounts of protein without the addition of N fertilizer. Red clover, clover grass, alfalfa and <b>oil</b> seed <b>radish</b> are being studied. Right after the harvest, the biomasses are separated in a green juice and a press cake using a screw press. Organic protein feed is produced by lactic acid fermentation of the green juice. The extraction of proteins is based on an already developed technique to extract proteins from alfalfa. The method for separation of proteins from alfalfa was developed by AAUs subcontractor Biotest Aps in a joint Biorefinery program (FØSU grant 2101 - 08 - 0041). After the fermentation, two fractions are obtained: 1) the protein paste, with non-denatured proteins suited for development of a protein feed additive for poultry and 2) the brown juice, which is studied together with the press cake as a substrate for anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the digestate obtained after the anaerobic digestion is evaluated as organic fertilizser for the crops. The protein yields obtained during the separation-fermentation process are in the range of 7 kg of crude protein from one tonne of fresh biomass. Crude protein contents up to 45...|$|R

Foi conduzido um experimento na região do Planalto Norte de Santa Catarina, entre maio de 2006 e abril de 2011, no qual foram avaliadas cinco formas de uso do solo no inverno, repetidas por cinco anos nas mesmas parcelas: 1) consórcio de aveia preta + azevém + ervilhaca comum manejado sem pastejo (consórcio cobertura); 2) o mesmo consórcio, com pastejo e com 100 kg ha- 1 de N ano- 1 em cobertura (pastagem com N); 3) o mesmo consórcio, com pastejo e sem adubação nitrogenada (pastagem sem N); 4) nabo forrageiro sem pastejo (nabo forrageiro); e 5) pousio sem pastejo (pousio). O consórcio cobertura aportou a maior quantidade de palha para cultivo do feijão em sucessão, mas não foram observadas diferenças expressivas em atributos de solo entre as formas de uso investigadas. Coberturas de solo, pastagem anual e pousio no inverno não afetaram a produtividade de grãos de feijão cultivado em sucessão. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate in the fifth year of experimentation, the effect of winter soil uses on residual straw on the soil, physical and chemical soil attributes and grain yield of common bean cultivated in succession. An experiment was carried out in the North Plateau of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, from May 2006 to April 2011. Five winter soil uses were investigated: 1) multicropping with black oat + ryegrass + common vetch without grazing (multicropping cover); 2) the same multicropping, with grazing and 100 kg ha- 1 of nitrogen year- 1, applied during the growing period (pasture with N); 3) the same multicropping, with grazing and without nitrogen fertilization (pasture without N); 4) <b>oil</b> seed <b>radish,</b> without grazing (<b>oil</b> seed radish); and 5) natural vegetation, without grazing (fallow).

40|$|Carabid beetles in {{arable land}} move between {{different}} habitats to exploit resources that vary {{in time and}} space. Understanding such movement is key to explaining how the pest control function of carabids in arable crop lands depends on the spatial configuration of crop fields and associated semi-natural habitats, but movement at and beyond field scale is not well understood. Here we use a model selection framework to identify and parameterize a parsimonious movement model, based on mark-release-recapture data in two adjacent arable crop fields, one planted with rye, {{and the other with}} <b>oil</b> <b>radish.</b> The simplest model assumes motility of beetles to be the same in the two crops, and it does not consider losses of beetles over time due to death or mark loss. These assumptions are relaxed either separately or together in competing models, resulting in a comparison between four models. All models consider the effect of spatially heterogeneous pitfall trapping {{on the size of the}} moving population. Models were fitted to data with Poisson likelihood, and Akaike’s information criterion was then used to rank the models. The model selection showed that including a parameter for loss of beetles due to mortality or mark loss resulted in the best approximation of the observed data. The data did not support the assumption of different motility between the two crops. We conclude that our extended model can be used to simulate beetle recapture in mark-release-recapture experiments, but further refinements to the model are needed. The inverse modeling framework for model identification and parameter estimation that was applied in this study proved effective to select the most promising model and parameter values...|$|E

The aim of the investigation was to establish the weediness’ dynamics of crops in a six-field crop rotation of an organic farming system. The field was certified as being organic. Crop rotation: 1. triticale/ rye (for green manure in spring), 2. <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> (for green manure) / rye (for green manure in autumn), 3. potatoes, 4. oats, 5. vetch-oats mix (for green forage) with an undersown mixture of red clover and timothy, 6. red clover and timothy. Conventional soil tillage was done according to the requirements of the crops. The weeds were counted two times during the vegetation period of crops: at the early development stages of crops (for instance, at the tillering of cereals) and before the crop harvesting. The composition of weed flora comprised from 59 species in the crops’ stands. The annual dicotyledonus were dominating groups of the weed flora. The most abundant weeds were lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski), common yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris R. Br. p. p.). The significantly smaller amount of weeds among crop rotation links was observed in the link rye/ oil radish/ rye – potatoes – oats. Much worse suppression of weeds was obtained in the crop rotation link red clover and timothy – triticale/ rye – oil radish/ rye. The number of weeds in the fields of crop rotation in the organic farming system is dependent on the cultivated crops, the succession of crops in the crop rotation links and crop cultivation technologies...|$|E
40|$|Under {{conditions}} of Organic Farming, we investigated whether direct seeding of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) into straw mulch from residues of precrop oats used for weed control enables at least occasional/opportunistic direct seeding in Organic Agriculture. Eight field trials {{were carried out}} at different study sites in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in 2008 - 2009 and 2009 - 2010. Direct seeding (DS) was performed into mulch layers of 0, 4 and 6 t ha- 1 of straw residues applied to the remaining stubble, simulating different yield levels of the precrop oats. LBS {{was used as a}} reference treatment, where straw was harvested, stubble tillage performed and seedbed prepared in fall and <b>oil</b> <b>radish</b> (Raphanus sativus) grown as winter cover crop. Mouldboard ploughing combined with conventional seedbed preparation was performed in early spring to V. faba. Compared with LBS, straw mulch with subsequent direct seeding suppressed especially dicotyledonous annuals significantly. DS treatments with straw reduced the abundance of this group by 81 and 85 % compared with LBS. Straw mulch resulted in effective suppression of photosensitive weeds such as Matricaria spp. and late germinating Chenopodium album. Grasses and perennial species occurred independent of the amount of straw. Compared with DS, the abundance of these weeds was reduced by 64 and 82 % in LBS treatment. The shoot dry matter production of faba bean was retarded by DS compared with LBS, but significant yield losses could be avoided with straw residues of at least 4 t ha- 1. Sufficient amount of straw of from the previous crop is a key criterion to facilitate organic no-till farming of faba bean in a suitable crop sequence when pressure of perennials and grasses is low...|$|E

The overwintered adult beetles appear and visit the flowers of Capsella bursa-postoris or sprouts of Nasturtium indicum {{from the middle of}} March. After copulation the female makes a hole in the pod wall with its beak and then turns backwards to place an egg into the pod. Oviposition is very active {{in the first half of}} April. Eggs are 0. 486 ± 0. 005 x 0. 290 ± 0. 007 mm in size. Larvae moult twice (Table 1, Figure 1), larva and pupa are as shown in Plate 8. Mature larvae fall to ground, bore into earth and make pupal chambers of which the wall is pasted internally with their viscous secretion. When immature larvae compelled to fall owing to the snapping of ripe pods, they also creep into earth, but are unable to complete the pupal chambers or unable to pupate even if they could complete major chambers. The duration of each developmental period is : 5 - 6 days for the eggs at the end of April, 5 - 6 days for the first stage larvae and 5 - 8 days for the second at the beginning of May, about 10 days for the third at the middle of May, 5 days for prepupal stage, and 5 days for the pupae. Newly emerged adults are easily distinguished by the coloration of scales which are more or less brownish; the feathery scales are faded in white and hairy ones in dark grey after several days. From the middle of May new adults appear and feed rather voraciously, but gradually disappear by the end of June. The periodical changes of the food plants are as shown in Figure 2. Rape is cultivated as a cource of <b>oil.</b> Cabbage, turnip, <b>radish</b> and chinese cabbage are winter crops and only the remainder after harvest of them are attacked by the pest. Whether the females deposit eggs into the seedpods of Nasturtium indicum has not been ascertained. (. b) The injury infested by C. albosuturalis. Seedpods of the cruciferous plants are injured slightly by the overwintered adults, which bore into pods to eat the seeds or to oviposit, more severely by the larvae which live on the seeds in the pods, and slightly by the newly emerged adults. Seedpods of the wild rape may be divided into four stages according to the state of the seeds, and the degree of injuries are compared among those stages. Materials were collected at Hikosan on May 16. Results are as shown in Table 2, Figures 4 and 5.

40|$|In 2015 the European Commission {{introduced}} new greening payments as part {{of their}} common agricultural practices to address environmental and sustainability issues. The payment is worth about 30 % of the total subsidies for European farmers. Sowing nitrogen fixing catch/cover crops in the off season (generally in fall and winter) is one way to achieve the prerequisite for the greening payments. Therefore it is expected that the proportion of catch/cover crops will increase from 2015 onwards at the expense of bare soil fields. In particular, with regard to more frequently occurring mild weather conditions during fall and winter, we assume that the extensive shift to catch/cover crops will {{have a significant impact on}} the carbon cycle of agricultural areas. In this study we aim to evaluate this change in agricultural practice on local and regional CO 2 fluxes and carbon budgets of the intensively used northern Rur catchment in Germany. In a preliminary study, we observed the daily courses of net CO 2 flux and soil respiration of three different catch/cover crops: greening mix, <b>oil</b> <b>radish,</b> and white mustard (Sinapis alba), by means of a net flux chamber and a soil respiration chamber and compared them against Eddy covariance flux data from fields cultivated with (i) winter barley (Hordeum vulgare), and (ii) without vegetation.

We especially used site data where comparisons of catch crop seasons and conventional seasons between different sites or years were possible. To allow an assessment of the change in carbon fluxes and budgets on regional scale, a land use comparison based on satellite images for the years 2014 to 2016 was applied. With these results, a first regional evaluation of the impact of the new greening policies on carbon fluxes and budgets for the northern Rur catchment will be carried out...|$|E
