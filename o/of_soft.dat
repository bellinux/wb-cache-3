5|$|A serious {{accident}} with radioactivity release {{occurred in the}} 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and the pipes. The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day. The highest exposure to a person was 1.25R of hard radiation and 4.7roentgen equivalent physical <b>of</b> <b>soft</b> radiation.|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium is similar to that <b>of</b> <b>soft</b> steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either of them. All actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more {{similar to those of the}} 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall {{in the range of}} 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as table beer are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead <b>of</b> <b>soft</b> drinks in some schools.|$|E

The normal clutch is three eggs for Brazza's martin, two for Mascarene martins on Madagascar and Mauritius, and two or three for those on Réunion.

5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was anoxic. However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was anoxic, and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains <b>of</b> <b>soft</b> tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E

5|$|In {{a further}} change of regulations, tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli now made three {{instead of two}} tyre compounds available for each Grand Prix. For the Australian Grand Prix, these were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for the race (of which one must be used) and an additional one for the third part of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead <b>of</b> <b>soft</b> tyres. The two Manor drivers chose the most conservative way, taking on four sets each of the medium and soft compounds.|$|E
