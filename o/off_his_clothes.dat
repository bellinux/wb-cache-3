5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler for calling her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes.</b> Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E
25|$|Pascal {{had another}} auspicious {{encounter}} {{when he was}} young while walking along the shore of the Mediterranean. A much older man, George Bernard Shaw, was swimming naked holding onto a buoy. A conversation ensued and Shaw dared the young Pascal on the shore to take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> and join him in the water. He was impressed when Pascal immediately did so, and this began their friendship. Shaw was impressed with Pascal's youthful enthusiasm for art and his bravado and invited him to come visit him one day when he was entirely broke. This chance meeting was {{to play a major role}} in Pascal's later career.|$|E

25|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} {{the members of}} The Dells, who recorded both the single featured in the music video and the version featured in the movie. In the music video the group is seen in a music video recording their song, interrupted by flashbacks including clips from the movie and album covers from both the Dells and the fictional group The Five Heartbeats. One of the flashbacks shows the lead singer singing and cleaning with a woman and then spontaneously stripping <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> as she does the same. Although black and white clips are shown of the fictional Five Heartbeats, none of the choreography is featured. Instead the audience witnesses an aged appearance of the Dells who stand still while singing the song and attempt to imitate the clapping and snapping portrayed in the movie.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, Duggan started a short feud with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase after Rhodes and DiBiase tried to {{convince}} Duggan to retire and let the young talent run the show. Soon after, Duggan would come out and announce {{that he would take}} Rhodes and DiBiase's advice and retire, but Jerry Lawler stopped him by convincing Duggan to stay. Duggan and Lawler then wrestled Rhodes and DiBiase on the August 25, 2008 edition of Raw, but lost the match. On the October 20 edition of Raw, Duggan confronted Santino Marella and Beth Phoenix during one of Marella's tirades against his three possible opponents at Cyber Sunday (Roddy Piper, Goldust, and The Honky Tonk Man). Upset at being interrupted, Marella took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> getting ready to fight Duggan. Yet before a fight could begin, Marella instructed Phoenix to throw the clothes in Duggan's face, a move that temporarily distracted Duggan. Marella then smashed a guitar over Duggan's head, ending the segment. Duggan would appear on Raws 800th episode during Kung Fu Naki's in-ring dance segment, which also involved various other members of the WWE roster.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in Sellers's {{flailing}} career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther, starring alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million {{at the box office}} upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor– Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, [...] "If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable." [...] With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a [...] "volatile and perplexing character [...] left a trail of misery in his private life". He also noted that Sellers had a [...] "compulsive personality and [...] an eccentric hypochondriac" [...] who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry {{at a time when he}} most needed the work. Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film, [...] "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium." [...] Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Revenge pranks are {{a common}} theme in the Sut Lovingood tales. In [...] "Parson John Bullen's Lizards," [...] for instance, Parson Bullen, a fire and {{brimstone}} preacher, beats Sut with a club after catching him in the bushes with a girl at a camp meeting. Later, when Bullen is preaching to a large crowd, Sut releases several lizards which crawl up Bullen's legs, prompting him to strip <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> in terror. Another target of Sut's revenge is Sicily Burns, a mountain woman who tricks Sut into drinking baking soda. In response, Sut causes a bull to wreak havoc at Sicily's wedding.|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 1971, Rîmaru {{was taken}} to Jilava prison in a van. He had to be dragged {{to the place of}} {{execution}} from the moment he left the van. Until he was dead, he was in a rage and vigorously tried to escape. The three officers charged with shooting him tied him to a post in the prison yard. Asked, in accordance with the law, if he had any last wishes, he said no. The men noticed him become more agitated, trying to bite <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> and twisting around the post. He yelled, [...] "Call my father, so he can see what's happening to me! Make him come! He's the only guilty one!" [...] and [...] "I want to live!" [...] Because of his constant movement, it was difficult to aim accurately and in the end, his backside was riddled with bullets (as he had turned all the way round). He was buried in the town cemetery; his grave remains unmarked.|$|E
60|$|Ralph arose to his feet, and {{the aristocratic}} bully slowly followed. Several persons were {{coming across the}} bridge now, and the young bridge tender ran to collect their tolls, leaving his late {{antagonist}} to brush <b>off</b> <b>his</b> sadly-soiled <b>clothes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Regaining her composure, {{she told}} Sanders {{to step into}} the circle, take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes,</b> and put his head between his thighs. As he did so, she took a sickle-knife and nicked his scrotum, saying, [...] "You are one of us now." [...] (This was later {{revealed}} to be false and Sanders was merely furthering his publicity) It was then that Sanders realised she was a witch. His Grandmother was a hereditary witch, a descendant of the Welsh chieftain Owain Glyndŵr, the last man (according to Sanders) to have called himself [...] "King of the Witches"; supposedly his grandmother let him copy her Book of Shadows when he was nine and taught him the rites and magic of Witches. He was taught clairvoyance first by scrying in inky water, then in his grandmother's crystal. Sanders claimed that following the Blitz, and a few months before her death at age 74, Mrs Bibby conferred upon him second- and third-grade initiations, involving ritual sex.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "And Cain spoke to Abel his brother," [...] a Midrash {{imagined}} the subject of their discussion. The Midrash taught that they divided the world between them. The first took {{the land and the}} second took the movables. The first told the second that he was standing on the first's land. The second retorted that the first was wearing the second's clothes. The second told the first to strip <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>clothes.</b> The first retorted that the second should fly off his ground. Out of this quarrel, as [...] reports, [...] "Cain rose up against his brother Abel." [...] Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in Rabbi Levi's name, however, that Cain and Abel quarreled because one said that the Temple would have to be built in his area, while the other claimed that {{it would have to be}} built in his. For [...] says, [...] "And it came to pass, when they were in the field," [...] and [...] "field" [...] refers to the Temple, as [...] equates the two when it says, [...] "Zion (that is, the Temple) shall be plowed as a field." [...] Out of this argument (in {{the words of}} [...] ), [...] "Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him." [...] Judah the son of Rabbi, however, said that their quarrel was about the first Eve. But Rabbi Aibu said that the first Eve had by then returned to dust. Rav Huna taught that Cain and Abel quarreled over an additional twin daughter who was born with Abel, whom each brother claimed for his own. Cain said that he would have her, because he was the firstborn, while Abel maintained that he would have to have her, because she was born with him.|$|E

60|$|He {{made his}} way across the country until he saw a small shed. He entered this, and finding some hay in the loft, {{stripped}} <b>off</b> <b>his</b> wet <b>clothes,</b> and crept deep into the hay to warm himself, for the water was cold, and he was shivering from head to foot.|$|R
60|$|So {{he pulled}} <b>off</b> all <b>his</b> <b>clothes</b> in such haste that he tore some of them, which was easy enough with such ragged old things.
