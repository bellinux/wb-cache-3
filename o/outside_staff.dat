2500|$|Production for {{the game}} began in 2014, {{including}} six months of pre-production. It included many of the staff from the original Nier. During production, the team took both fan and critic feedback on Nier and their later opinions on the game into account. The points they felt needed addressing ranged from character designs to gameplay to graphics. While improving on these points, they also carried over aspects that were well-received, such as the complexity of story and the game's music. The majority of development was handled by PlatinumGames at their offices in Osaka and Tokyo, while <b>outside</b> <b>staff</b> such as Yoko were also brought in. As Nier: Automata was a role-playing action game as opposed to Taura's previous pure action games, the development presented new challenges for him. While Taura handled the action combat system, designer Isao Negishi created the RPG elements. According to Negishi and programmer Ryo Onishi, a major difficulty was creating a title faithful to Nier, which required a shift away from the style of their earlier titles. While designing the game's RPG elements, the staff at PlatinumGames were at least partially inspired by [...] {{in the design of}} their sidequests, which they felt they {{would never be able to}} match.|$|E

50|$|Until World War I it was {{not unusual}} for a {{moderately}} sized mansion in England such as Cliveden to have an indoor staff of 20 and an <b>outside</b> <b>staff</b> of the same size, and in ducal mansions such as Chatsworth House the numbers could be far higher. In the great houses of Italy, the number of retainers was often even greater than in England; whole families plus extended relations would often inhabit warrens of rooms in basements and attics. It is doubtful that a 19th-century Marchesa would even know the exact number of individuals who served her. Most European mansions were also the hub of vast estates. A true estate (the medieval villa, French ville) always contains at least one complete village and its church. Large estates such as that of Woburn Abbey have several villages attached.|$|E

40|$|How does {{information}} technology change {{the organization of}} Japanese firms? We try {{to answer this question}} through analysis of Japan's video game industry, which is an exceptionally successful industry among the information-related industries in Japan. According to the interview survey, {{there are two types of}} firms in the Japanese video game industry: integrated firms and publisher firms. Integrated firms keep most development staff within the firms and produce game software using these employees. On the other hand, publisher firms have few in-house development staff and produce game software using <b>outside</b> <b>staff.</b> Integrated firms have similar characteristics to conventional Japanese firms such as less incentive system and stable labor relations, whereas the publisher firms not. Both types of firms are successful in the video game industry and have coexisted. To explain the coexistence of these two types of firms, we classified game software into two categories: technology-driven game and concept-driven game. While technology-driven games intensively use programming techniques such as 3 D modeling, concept-driven games need novel ideas or interesting stories above programming techniques. Econometric analysis using sales of game software titles shows that, in the case of technology-driven games, integrated firms have better performance and accumulation of production experience has a positive effect on sales. In the case of concept-driven games, however, accumulation of production has no effect on sales. This result suggests that the efficient firm organization depends on the type of the products in information-related industries. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe aim to {{introduce}} a field action {{set up in the}} prison field following the Paris attacks (07 / 01 / 2015) {{in order to create a}} talking and thinking space for new arrivals in jail. This action, based on prevention workshops (N= 7), has been hosted each time by a probation officer and a psychologist, allowing about forty incarcerated men to think about each one's place as a citizen. We used intergroup relations framework, specifically of social categorization metatheory (Abrams & Hogg, 2004; Tajfel & Turner, 1979, 1986; Turner et al., 1987), supplemented by theory of social partitions (Castel & Lacassagne, 2011, 2015). The methodology is based on empathy in relationship, identification and deconstruction of stereotypes and the need to think about collective beliefs and co-construction concept of "republican secularism". This is made through the solicitation of participants' personal, social and collective identities. Resorting to a mixed methodology, integrating support and moments contrasting with commonly used ones in workshops and talking groups, allowed to break habits underlying social roles. The failure to mention requirement of action and imprisonment reason allowed participants to put across a definition of identity out of their reality of incarcerated individuals. Joint coordination with <b>outside</b> <b>staff</b> of prison system ensured speaker's as well as participants' participation, which favoured trust and dialogue (participants' private lives were discussed and gave rise to convivial moments). Each workshop took place over a period of three half-days: a) Creation of framework (for the action) and first interaction on the problems of relationships (inside/outside jail); brainstorming about citizenship and its contexts; exchange about religious beliefs and republican values, especially secularism. Main thematic areas on which the participants worked, have been classified under three types of relationships: personal and interpersonal, intergroup, and institutional and societal. These types of elations led to relations improvement strategies: a/ significance of free thinking and taking ownership of decisions b/ usefulness of forbearance and of daily negotiation and accepting that one may not be always right, c/ questioning empathy and republican equality, resonating with Syrian migrants and d/ linking founding principles of religion and official documents of the Republic, leading to think about religious liberty and understanding acts of violence as a result of a radical interpretation and not as a specific religious belief. This action has been favourably assessed and welcomed, either by funders or by participants, leading to a renewal in 2016. Extending the target audience not only aids improvement but also intervention and research programs, analysing relations between prisoner categories (foreigners/natives) ...|$|E
