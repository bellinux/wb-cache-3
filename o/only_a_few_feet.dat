5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> of Taft and Díaz.|$|E
5|$|The Corinthians {{gained a}} corner kick early on, and Cardiff cleared. This was {{followed}} up by a further {{attack by the}} amateurs, but R.G. Jenkins' shot went straight to Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. Cardiff attacked twice in quick succession; both chances were squandered. A.H. Chadder, Frank Hartley and Jenkins moved up-field for Corinthian with some passing movement and played the ball through for Claude Ashton, but he shot wide of the post. Three corners followed for Cardiff, which were each stopped by Russell in goal for Corinthian stopped each chance. A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away from the goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players.|$|E
5|$|The River Brue {{flows through}} the Somerset Levels {{to the east of}} the Polden Hills. It rises in hills near the {{southern}} border of the county, flows through Bruton, where it is joined by the River Pitt, and on through Baltonsborough. The lower reaches have been diverted into a channel that joins the Parrett at Burnham-on-Sea in Bridgwater Bay. There is a raised bog in the central Brue valley and the surrounding area is a mosaic of swamps, meres and alder woodland. The River Parrett rises in the hills around Chedington in Dorset and flows northwestwards past Aller, Somerset, and through the Somerset Levels to Bridgwater, after which it becomes an estuary with its mouth at Burnham-on-Sea. The river has a tidal bore, similar to that in the River Severn. The Somerset Levels are <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> above sea level and liable to flooding. They are drained by ditches and channels that drain into the Parrett including the King's Sedgemoor Drain, just south of the Polden Hills.|$|E

5000|$|Leo LeBlanc (May 27, 1939 - April 2, 1995) was an American musician. He {{played the}} pedal steel guitar and dobro, {{primarily}} playing Country music. He was legally blind,and could <b>only</b> see <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand grenade, providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first grenade explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second grenade then landed <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the grenade, and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the grenade away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the grenade it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live grenade grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E
25|$|Inadequate {{ventilatory}} {{response to}} exertion was {{indicated by the}} fact that, despite resting values in the normal range, PetCO2 rose markedly with exertion even when the divers breathed air {{at a depth of}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Coal is {{also found}} in {{abundance}} close to Bulwell. Running as part of much larger seams criss-crossing the region, the coal lies underneath the layers of sandstone and is in places <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> beneath the surface. Coalmines in the area around Bulwell were therefore among the first in the county to operate on a commercial basis, with large-scale mining from around 1500 onward.|$|E
50|$|A {{training}} round / practice rocket {{was available}} for Blindicide. This used a blank 20 mm cartridge to produce a flash and a bang, but the round <b>only</b> fell <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> {{in front of the}} launcher.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "island" [...] is 1.2 mi {{long and}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> wide. <b>A</b> single street, Shelter Island Drive, runs {{the length of}} Shelter Island and also connects it to the {{mainland}} via a causeway lined with marine-related businesses.|$|R
50|$|The highway {{makes it}} to Lewisburg, and runs {{concurrently}} with US 431. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> away from that intersection, the highway intersects KY 107. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> hundred more <b>feet</b> after that, KY 106 breaks away from US 431, and follows Stacker Street into downtown Lewisburg.|$|R
25|$|The coffin {{was then}} interred {{in the far}} western end of the Nave, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from the entrance, in soil brought {{from each of the}} main battlefields, and covered with a silk pall. Servicemen from the armed forces stood guard as tens of {{thousands}} of mourners filed silently past. The ceremony appears to have served as a form of catharsis for collective mourning on a scale not previously known.|$|E
25|$|Broomsticks {{are treated}} as a major {{consumer}} product in the wizarding world. There are numerous manufacturers and models of brooms, including Cleansweeps and Comets, all of which vary in their capabilities. These range from expensive high-performance models to toy broomsticks for young children that fly <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> off the ground to family-sized broomsticks that seat multiple people and include a luggage compartment below the seating area.|$|E
25|$|The International Peace Garden {{is located}} at the border between Manitoba and North Dakota, about midway between the nearby {{communities}} of Boissevain, Manitoba and Dunseith, North Dakota. It has as its focal point the Peace Tower (actually four identical monuments 120 feet (36.6 m) tall set parallel <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> apart, two {{on each side of the}} border, giving the appearance of a double tower from most vantage points in the Garden).|$|E
50|$|According to The National Map, Lake Glory is not {{situated}} on any stream. However, {{it is located}} <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> from Roaring Creek. The reservoir has an elevation of 643 ft above sea level. The lake is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Catawissa.|$|R
50|$|Oval {{tracks are}} {{classified}} {{based upon their}} size, surface, and shape. Their size can range from <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> to over {{two and a half}} miles. Track surfaces can be dirt, concrete, asphalt, or a combination of concrete and asphalt. Some ovals {{in the early twentieth century}} had wood surfaces.|$|R
50|$|The station {{continued}} to be poorly patronized, as it was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> from the Franklin Avenue station, which was located at the busy intersection of Fulton Street and Franklin Avenue. Nevertheless, Dean Street was upgraded to handle six-car subway trains {{with the rest of}} the Franklin Avenue Line in 1924.|$|R
25|$|On {{the day of}} the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham, {{the celebrated}} scout, and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, {{discovered}} a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route, and they disarmed the assassin within <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> of Díaz and Taft. Both presidents were unharmed and the summit was held. Díaz was re-elected in 1910, but alleged electoral fraud forced him into exile in France and sparked the 1910 Mexican Revolution, initially led by Francisco I. Madero.|$|E
25|$|Later in the book, Yulius Fuchik {{was spotted}} by an American P-3C Orion shortly after {{launching}} four Lebed class hovercraft from her cargo deck. After an SA-7 surface-to-air missile launched {{from the ship}} failed to hit the Orion, the American plane retaliated with a Harpoon anti-ship missile and called in two F-15s to strafe the ship with their 20 mm cannons. The damaged Yulius Fuchik eventually reached the port of Keflavik and, after running aground during the approach, slowly settled to the bottom next to the quay in water <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> deeper than the draught of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T. Munford's 2nd Virginia Cavalry {{to cross the}} swamp and capture some of the Union guns abandoned during the bombardment. As the men and horses waded through water that was belly deep and fouled with debris, Jackson and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill crossed the river to perform a personal reconnaissance. A Union artillery shell exploded <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away from the generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge. He {{realized that this was}} not a place that he could make an opposed crossing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{financing}} {{of the project}} went slowly, with {{the cornerstone of the}} first building being dedicated by former Canadian prime minister Arthur Meighen in 1931. However, as with many projects of the time, financial difficulties would affect the project and in the end, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> of pier was built.|$|R
50|$|The {{small island}} {{is located in}} the Columbia River Gorge region. It was mostly barren , but {{features}} several douglas firs and willows, a basalt cliff, wildflowers, wild cherry trees, blackberry thickets, and a sandy beach. It is closer to the Oregon side of the river, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> from its shoreline.|$|R
5000|$|Oakwood was {{initially}} called [...] "O'Dell's Crossing" [...] for its main landowner, Ulysses S. O'Dell Sr. The O'Dell home place was located <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> from the railroad track. The name changed in 1896 because Southern Railway trains would {{stop on the}} way from Atlanta to Gainesville to get oak wood for their engines.|$|R
25|$|It was snowing and the {{airfield}} at Croydon {{was covered in}} dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia. The C-47A had just lifted from the runway at Croydon when the starboard wing dropped, then the aircraft turned {{to the left and}} the port wing dropped. The pilot was seen to apply full starboard aileron but the bank angle increased to 40 degrees with the port wing tip <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from the ground. As the aircraft reached the perimeter track of {{the airfield}}, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed. Eleven of the 18 passengers and one of the five crew died.|$|E
25|$|The back bay, roughly {{anything}} {{south of}} the Morro Bay State Park Marina, is very shallow. However, there is some slightly deeper water in the channels. The largest channel continues from the bay's main channel, winding its way towards Los Osos, on {{the southern end of}} the bay. The second largest breaks off from the largest about halfway to Los Osos and takes an extremely windy route to the sandspit. A few small channels on the landward side formed by runoff meet the largest channel as well. The narrow, unmarked channels are very hard to navigate and are filled with eel grass, which can snag the boat or clog the propeller. They are easiest to find at low tide, but if the tide is too low, the boat may run aground because the channels are <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> deeper than the surrounding water. An alternative to searching for the channels is to cross at very high tide.|$|E
25|$|In 1909, President William H. Taft {{agreed to}} meet with Mexican President Porfirio Díaz in El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican {{president}} and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. But the historic summit resulted in serious assassination threats and other security concerns for the then small Secret Service, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, BOI agents, U.S. marshals, and an additional 250 private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, were all called in by Chief John Wilkie to provide added security. On October 16, {{the day of the}} summit, Burnham discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham signaled a Texas Ranger, Private C.R. Moore, and the two men captured and disarmed the assassin within <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> of Díaz and Taft, preventing the shooting of both Presidents.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{exploration}} of the region occurred in the 1860s with extensive workings developed at the Homestake and Little Daisy Mines between 1904 and 1925. The Homestake mine stopped <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> from <b>a</b> high-grade ore body. This ore body was later discovered by Crown Butte Mines in 1989 and also in 1990 {{as a result of}} an intensive drilling campaign.|$|R
50|$|Fossil-bearing {{limestone}} boulders {{are sometimes}} {{found in the}} river with fossilized tree fern roots and imprints of the trunk. These represent long-extinct plant species which grew to an impressive height compared to their modern relatives which <b>only</b> reach <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet.</b> Millions of years ago these plants thrived in a warm and hospitable climate and gave rise {{to much of the}} Scottish coal deposits.|$|R
60|$|The incline of this upper {{portion of}} the precipice, to the length <b>only</b> of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet,</b> useless to <b>a</b> climber empty-handed, was {{invaluable}} now. Not more than half his weight depended entirely on the linen rope. Half a dozen extensions of the arms, alternating with half a dozen seizures of the rope with his feet, brought {{him up to the}} level of the soil.|$|R
25|$|On 27 August 1918, {{at about}} 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a {{civilian}} Mexican carpenter named Zeferino Gil Lamadrid attempted {{to pass through}} the border back to Mexico, without having the bulky parcel he was carrying with him inspected at the United States Customs house. As Gil Lamadrid passed the customs office, Customs Inspector Arthur G. Barber ordered him to halt, suspecting that Gil Lamadrid was smuggling weapons. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> away, Mexican customs officers led by Francisco Gallegos directed him to ignore the summons and stay put in Mexico. Gil Lamadrid became confused and hesitated as the two groups of customs agents shouted instructions to him. At this point Pvt. William Klint of the US 35th Infantry raised his Springfield rifle in an effort to force Gil Lamadrid to return to the US. In the midst of the ensuing commotion, a shot was fired, although by whom remains unclear, and the battle of Ambos Nogales commenced.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested. Many of those arrested {{reported}} that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the barrel of a gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> from the ground.|$|E
50|$|Compared to mud-pulse telemetry, {{electronic}} pulse telemetry is {{more effective}} in certain specialized situations, such as underbalanced drilling or when using air as drilling fluid. It is capable of transmitting data up to ten times faster. However, it generally falls short when drilling exceptionally deep wells, and the signal can lose strength rapidly in certain types of formations, becoming undetectable at <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand <b>feet</b> of depth.|$|R
50|$|Hope Island lies to {{the south}} of Kiket; Skagit Island <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet</b> {{to the south}}west. These islands can be said to divide Skagit Bay from Similk Bay. The {{shoreline}} of Kiket Island and vicinity has been called one of the best-studied areas of coastal Washington. Ecological studies were made in the last decades of the twentieth century, when the site was considered for a nuclear power plant.|$|R
25|$|From 1940 to 1941, {{work was}} done on the P series of rockets, which used {{propellant}} turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching <b>an</b> altitude of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>feet.</b> The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.|$|R
