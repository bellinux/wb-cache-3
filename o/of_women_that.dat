5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; they left their children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E

25|$|Elizabeth Clark cites early Christian {{writings}} by authors such as Tertullian, Augustine, and John Chrysostom {{as being}} exemplary {{of the negative}} view <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> has been perpetuated in church tradition. Until {{the latter part of}} the 20th century, only the names of very few women who contributed to the formation of Christianity in its earliest years were widely known: Mary, the mother of Jesus; Mary Magdalene, disciple of Jesus and the first witness to the resurrection; and Mary and Martha, the sisters who offered him hospitality in Bethany.|$|E
25|$|The PAIWD was {{formulated}} {{and promoted}} {{in the context}} of Morocco’s 1993 ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the Platform for Action established at the Beijing Conference on Women in 1995, and the Moroccan government’s subsequent commitment to developing a national strategy to address the status <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> year. Arising from this context, the PAIWD did not explicitly reference Islamic values, and was more closely related to a “development discourse” that formed a crucial element of Mohammad VI’s national agenda. The PAIWD’s main areas of focus were education, reproductive health, the involvement of women in development, and empowerment through legal reforms and a strengthening of political power.|$|E
25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena. This situation has led to the social and economic dependency <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E

25|$|Women {{moving out}} of the Victorian era and into the Edwardian era were {{starting}} to dress for a more active lifestyle. The evolving times brought a new fashion trend known as the “New Woman”. Active lives required less constricting clothing and required simpler and more streamlined clothing. The new woman was highly encouraged by women’s suffrage. Women that identified with this fashion movement were the type <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> were beginning to venture out of the domestic circle that they were told to maintain and beginning to pursue higher education, office jobs, and participating in active outdoor sports. The new and improved fashions allowed for women to swing a tennis racket, whack a golf ball, but the ideas of “proper” feminine attire reduced the progress of more practical sportswear.|$|E
25|$|In July 1974, Flynt first {{published}} Hustler {{as a step}} forward from the Hustler Newsletter, which was advertising for his businesses. The magazine struggled for the first year, partly because many distributors and wholesalers refused to handle it as its nude photos became increasingly graphic. It targeted working-class men and grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around three million. The publication of nude paparazzi pictures of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in August 1975 was a major coup. Hustler has often featured more explicit photographs than comparable magazines and has contained depictions <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> some find demeaning, such as a naked woman in a meat grinder or presented as a dog on a leash– though Flynt later said that the meat grinder image was a criticism of the pornography industry itself.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, good nutrition, and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E

25|$|The above {{primary sources}} of {{influence}} on women of Islam do {{not deal with}} every conceivable situation over time. This {{led to the development}} of jurisprudence and religious schools with Islamic scholars that referred to resources such as identifying authentic documents, internal discussions and establishing a consensus to find the correct religiously approved course of action for Muslims. These formed the secondary sources of influence for women. Among them are ijma, qiya, ijtihad and others depending on sect and the school of Islamic law. Included in secondary sources are fatwas, which are often widely distributed, orally or in writing by Muslim clerics, to the masses, in local language and describe behavior, roles and rights <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> conforms with religious requirements. Fatwas are theoretically non-binding, but seriously considered and have often been practiced by most Muslim believers. The secondary sources typically fall into five types of influence: the declared role or behavior for Muslims, both women and men, is considered obligatory, commendable, permissible, despised or prohibited. There is considerable controversy, change over time, and conflict between the secondary sources.|$|E
25|$|Womanist {{ethics is}} a {{religious}} discipline that examines the ethical theories concerning human agency, action, and relationship. At the same time, it rejects social constructions that have neglected {{the existence of a}} group <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> have bared the brunt of injustice and oppression. Its perspective is shaped by the theological experiences of African-American women. With the use of analytic tools, the effect of race, class, gender, and sexuality on the individual and communal perspective is examined. Womanist ethic provides an alternative to Christian and other religious ethics while utilizing the elements of critique, description, and construction to assess the power imbalance and patriarchy that has been used to oppress women of color and their communities. The publication of Katie Cannon's The Emergence of Black Feminist Consciousness was the first to directly speak on womanist ethics. In this article, Cannon argues that the perspectives of Black women are largely ignored in various religious and academic discourses. Jacquelyn Grant expands on this point by asserting that Black women concurrently experience the three oppressive forces of racism, sexism, and classism. Black feminist theory has been used by womanist ethics to explain the lack of participation of African-American women and men in academic discourse. Patricia Collins, credits this phenomenon to prevalence of white men determining what should or should not be considered valid discourse and urges for an alternative mode of producing knowledge that includes the core themes of Black female consciousness.|$|E

The group took their name from Mary Harris Jones, {{also known as}} [...] "Mother Jones", a famous mine union activist. The group chose the name {{because they wanted to}} support the miners' {{benefits}} and follow the same beliefs as Jones. The Daughters performed many of the same actions as other women supporters during the strike, including organizing places for supporters to stay, preparing food, and raising money for the miners.|$|E
50|$|Most {{countries}} in the European Union allow abortion on demand during the first trimester. After the first trimester, abortion is allowed only under certain circumstances, such as risk to woman's life or health, fetal defects or other specific situations that {{may be related to}} the circumstances of the conception or the woman's age. For instance, in Austria, second trimester abortions are allowed only if there is a serious risk to physical health <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> (<b>that</b> cannot be averted by other means); risk to mental health <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> (<b>that</b> cannot be averted by other means); immediate risk to life <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> (<b>that</b> cannot be averted by other means); serious fetal impairment (physical or mental); or if the woman is under 14 years of age. Some countries, such as Denmark, allow abortion after the first trimester for a variety of reasons, including socioeconomic ones, but a woman needs an authorization to have such an abortion.|$|R

500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{is noted}} both for its song and its {{accompanying}} music video, {{both of which}} are considered feminist odes to freedom. As author María José Coperiás Aguilar wrote in her book Culture and Power, the release of the song was in context of the anti-feminist or the [...] "backlash" [...] ideology dominant in the U.S., since the rise of the [...] "New Right" [...] in the 1980s and the government of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Aguilar went on to explain that the 1980s and the 1990s were characterized by a conservative reaction against the ‘excesses’ of the 1960s and 70s. This reaction was channeled mainly by the media's strong attacks against feminism, generally describing activists as [...] "tortured people with hairy legs", [...] "radical, bitter, man-hating, separatist and lesbian", accompanied by messages advocating a feminization <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> turned them into beautiful ornamental objects, and tended to increase the cultural differences between the sexes. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] appeared as a refutation of some of these reactionary premises. The title, Aguilar noted, seemed to raise the question of the urgency of a feminine voice to develop and emerge—a concern that recalled the tradition of French feminists like Hélène Cixous and Luce Irigaray.|$|E

Wollstonecraft, along with her British contemporaries Damaris Cudworth and Catharine Macaulay started to use the language of rights in relation to women, arguing that women should have greater opportunity because like men, they were moral and rational beings.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{the first}} of western territories or states to adopt women's {{suffrage}} placed Wyoming in the national spotlight. National suffragists in subsequent years found a potent symbol in Wyoming enfranchising women as states voted on the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granting suffrage to women. Carrie Chapman Catt, who {{was president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association, incorrectly claimed that Wyoming [...] "gave so much evidence of positive good to the community arising from the votes <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> she became the direct cause of the establishment of woman suffrage in all of the surrounding states." [...] Larson challenged such broad generalization noting that there is [...] "no short, simple, all-encompassing explanation for the West's priority in woman suffrage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Intersectionality is the {{examination}} of various ways {{in which people are}} oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality [...] "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>that</b> are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.|$|E
