5|$|The Indonesian {{literary}} scholar Ajip Rosidi {{writes that}} the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> in Kawan Bergeloet are meant as comedy. He considers only one story—"Piloe"—to have been intended as more serious or sad. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> use tropes previously seen in Kasim's Teman Doedoek, such as conflict arising from a misunderstanding, and the contents of some other stories are similar.|$|E
50|$|The climax is {{the turning}} point or highest point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>The</b> protagonist makes the single big {{decision}} that defines not only <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> but also who they are as a person. Freytag defines the climax as <b>the</b> third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five dramatic phases which occupies <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> can {{be traced}} to the Ilocano. <b>The</b> Ilocano version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> offers an {{explanation}} on why monkeys don't eat meat.

5|$|Critics have {{positively}} {{received some}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> within the collection, analyzing Anarky {{as a unique}} force for political commentary and discussion within DC Comics' storytelling. However, the expansive growth of the character's unique abilities and characterization has also fueled criticism as having overpowered the character beyond suspension of disbelief.|$|E

50|$|Local newscasts {{are never}} {{broadcast}} nationally. Stories from local stations that have national importance {{are taken from}} the local O&O, and a 'national reporter' re-does <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> often from a location hundreds or even thousands <b>of</b> miles from <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>The</b> national reporter always mentions their name and location where they are based at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> even though that location is often different from <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From its inception, {{the scripts}} {{for the series}} had been drafted and the {{broadcasts}} produced by Harvey's son Paul Harvey, Jr., who in later years of his father's career also acted as a substitute host. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>stories</b> were published in book form as <b>The</b> Rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Story</b> and More <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Story.</b> (On <b>the</b> back cover <b>of</b> More <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Story,</b> <b>the</b> book is said to contain [...] "True mysteries from history".)

5|$|Sector General is a {{gigantic}} multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from {{opposite sides of}} humanity's first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, but many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> feature types of patient that the builders did not anticipate. Initially most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> center round the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to the top level, Senior Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the emergency service which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is its most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and locations.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} sources may {{originally}} have been oral works. A number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> {{in the narrative}} parts of the Liber resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It {{is possible that the}} information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.|$|E
5|$|Stories of mythical Orcadian demons are {{recorded}} in the 16th-century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben, {{who may have been}} referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of Stronsay.

5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just like it was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with.

5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or a pariah. Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, the Dominion is {{invaded by}} the United Earth Directorate and Mengsk {{narrowly}} escapes capture with the reluctant help of Raynor.

Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> in the anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, no different from the Confederacy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{appearance}} <b>of</b> other tellings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> {{with local}} variations, from Nigeria, Thailand and Tibet, seems {{to call in}} question the purely Greek origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> <b>The</b> Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist Jataka tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since <b>the</b> main lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> in all three {{are the same as}} in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model.|$|R
5|$|In {{an age of}} {{classical}} Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise Dattaka Sutravritti {{which was based on}} an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka.
