25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>public</b> schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E
500|$|The new {{management}} group had two members, Highmore and Ellys, who were incompetent and Theophilus Cibber {{was known to}} be both arrogant and volatile. By the end of 1732, there were problems with the management of the theatre, which resulted in the failure of Charles Johnson's Caelia: or, The Perjured Lover on 4 December. The 8 March 1733 Grub-Street Journal seized on the event and used the failure to criticise the theatre's management: [...] "how insufficient the present managers of Drury-lane playhouse are to discharge their trust, as directors <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>public</b> entertainments." [...] The newspaper was not the only group concerned and many plays were soon cancelled.|$|E
500|$|Fenchurch Street station {{suffered}} a negative reputation under public ownership. By {{the end of}} the 1980s, the former LTSR line was carrying over 50,000 passengers a day on a 50-year old infrastructure. The persistent overcrowding and uncleanliness on trains led to it being dubbed [...] "the misery line". In 1989 Sir Robert Reid called the service from Fenchurch Street [...] "wholly unacceptable", while Teresa Gorman, Member of Parliament for Billericay, subsequently called it [...] "one of the disgraces <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>public</b> railway service for many years". Between 1982 and 1992 the station was operated by Network SouthEast, one of British Rail's three passenger business sectors, before being handed over to a business unit in preparation for privatisation.|$|E

This editorial describes the curation of five commentaries resulting from the recent international conference ‘Science in Public: Research, Practice, Impact’. The commentaries reveal the issues science communicators may face in implementing public engagement with science that has an impact; from planning and co-producing projects with impact in mind, to organising and operating activities which meet the needs <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>publics,</b> and finally measuring and evaluating the effects on scientists and publics in order to ‘capture impact’...|$|R

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, as {{nationalism}} became a radical {{force on the}} Romanian political stage, issuing calls for ethnocracy, Perpessicius joined intellectuals who called for moderation. In a 1931 piece for Cuvântul, he reacted against nationalist arguments: [...] "The fashion of good Romanians is making a rather furious comeback. You all know the heresy: one claims that native inhabitants are separated into good and bad, into plagued and pleasant-smelling, less so for their intentions or actions, but rather for {{the point of view}} adopted by the esteemed censors <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>public</b> and national life. [...] And how much longer do they plan to confront us with this self-sufficient nonsense? Will the mystification never cease? Will common sense never descend among the concrete walls of the office where they forge nationality certificates? No good Romanians but just humans, just humans, gentlemen, and it would suffice." [...] Literary historian Z. Ornea, who likens this [...] "lucid-democratic" [...] text with one issued a year earlier by Viaţa Românească magazine, notes that both appeals failed to prevent the [...] "totalitarian debauchery" [...] of the subsequent decade, when the Iron Guard emerged as a force.|$|E

40|$|If {{the twentieth}} century has been {{dominated}} by discussions of the public, public life, and the public sphere, Contemporary Publics argues that, in the twenty-first century, we must complicate the singularity of that paradigm and start thinking <b>of</b> <b>our</b> world in terms of multiple, overlapping, and competing publics. In three distinct streams—art, media and technology, and the intimate life—this volume offers up the intellectual and political significance of thinking through the plurality <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>publics.</b> “Countering Neoliberal Publics: Screen and Space,” explores how different artistic practices articulate the challenges and desires of multiple publics. “Making and Shaping Publics: Discourse and Technology” showcases how media shape publics, and how new and emerging publics use these technologies to construct identities. “Commodifying Public Intimacies” examines what happens to the notion of the private when intimacies structure publics, move into public spaces, and develop value that can be exchanged and circulated...|$|R
