5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical <b>opalescence</b> from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1852 {{paper on}} the [...] "Refrangibility" [...] (wavelength change) of light, George Gabriel Stokes {{described}} the ability of fluorspar and uranium glass to change invisible light beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum into blue light. He named this phenomenon fluorescence : [...] "I am almost inclined to coin a word, and call the appearance fluorescence, from fluor-spar , as the analogous term <b>opalescence</b> {{is derived from the}} name of a mineral." [...] The name was derived from the mineral fluorite (calcium difluoride), some examples of which contain traces of divalent europium, which serves as the fluorescent activator to emit blue light. In a key experiment he used a prism to isolate ultraviolet radiation from sunlight and observed blue light emitted by an ethanol solution of quinine exposed by it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{line that}} rises {{up from the}} nuclear/quark matter {{transition}} and then bends back towards the T axis, with its end marked by a star, is the conjectured boundary between confined and unconfined phases. Until recently it was also {{believed to be a}} boundary between phases where chiral symmetry is broken (low temperature and density) and phases where it is unbroken (high temperature and density). It is now known that the CFL phase exhibits chiral symmetry breaking, and other quark matter phases may also break chiral symmetry, so {{it is not clear whether}} this is really a chiral transition line. The line ends at the [...] "chiral critical point", marked by a star in this figure, which is a special temperature and density at which striking physical phenomena, analogous to critical <b>opalescence,</b> are expected.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} French preparation involves {{placing a}} sugar cube {{on top of}} a specially designed slotted spoon, and placing the spoon on a glass filled with a measure of absinthe. Iced water is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and star anise) come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky <b>opalescence</b> is called the [...] (Fr. opaque or shady, IPA [...] ). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that [...] "blossom" [...] or [...] "bloom," [...] and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and {{is often referred to as}} the French Method.|$|E

The difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great, and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to Mr. Cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace.|$|E

60|$|When {{early that}} same {{afternoon}} Courtier, leaning on a stick, passed from his room out {{on to the}} terrace, he was confronted by three sunlit peacocks marching slowly across a lawn towards a statue of Diana. With incredible dignity those birds moved, as if never in their lives had they been hurried. They seemed indeed to know that when they got there, {{there would be nothing}} for them to do but to come back again. Beyond them, through the tall trees, over some wooded foot-hills of the moorland and a promised land of pinkish fields, pasture, and orchards, the prospect stretched to the far sea. Heat clothed this view with a kind of <b>opalescence,</b> a fairy garment, transmuting all values, so that the four square walls and tall chimneys of the pottery-works a few miles down the valley seemed to Courtier like a vision of some old fortified Italian town. His sensations, finding himself in this galley, were peculiar. For his feeling towards Miltoun, whom he had twice met at Mrs. Noel's, was, in spite of disagreements, by no means unfriendly; while his feeling towards Miltoun's family was not yet in existence. Having lived from hand to mouth, and in many countries, since he left Westminster School, he had now practically no class feelings. An attitude of hostility to aristocracy because it was aristocracy, was as incomprehensible to him as an attitude of deference.|$|E

50|$|Visible light cannot {{pass through}} large {{thicknesses}} of the opal. This {{is the basis}} of the optical band gap in a photonic crystal. The notion that opals are photonic crystals for visible light was expressed in 1995 by Vasily Astratov's group. In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin lamellae inside the opal during solidification. The term <b>opalescence</b> is commonly and erroneously used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which is correctly termed play of color. Contrarily, <b>opalescence</b> is correctly applied to the milky, turbid appearance of common or potch opal. Potch does not show a play of color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opalescence</b> {{is a type}} of dichroism seen {{in highly}} {{dispersed}} systems with little opacity.

50|$|Examples are {{the blue}} sky in the daytime and the yellowish-red sky at sunset. Another example {{can be made by}} adding a few {{droplets}} of milk to a glass of water.

50|$|Due to {{the random}} character, {{techniques}} dedicated to evaluate chemokinesis are partly different from methods used in chemotaxis research. One {{of the most}} valuable ways to measure chemokinesis is computer-assisted (see, e.g., Image J) checker-board analysis, which provides data about migration of identical cells, whereas, in Protozoa (e.g., Tetrahymena), techniques based on measurement of <b>opalescence</b> were also developed.|$|E
50|$|Critical <b>opalescence</b> is a {{phenomenon}} which arises {{in the region of}} a continuous, or second-order, phase transition. Originally reported by Charles Cagniard de la Tour in 1823 in mixtures of alcohol and water, its importance was recognised by Thomas Andrews in 1869 following his experiments on the liquid-gas transition in carbon dioxide, many other examples have been discovered since. The phenomenon is most commonly demonstrated in binary fluid mixtures, such as methanol and cyclohexane. As the critical point is approached, the sizes of the gas and liquid region begin to fluctuate over increasingly large length scales. As the density fluctuations become of a size comparable to the wavelength of light, the light is scattered and causes the normally transparent liquid to appear cloudy. Tellingly, the <b>opalescence</b> does not diminish as one gets closer to the critical point, where the largest fluctuations can reach even centimetre proportions, confirming the physical relevance of smaller fluctuations.|$|E

50|$|The {{critical}} point {{is described by}} a conformal field theory. According to the renormalization group theory, the defining property of criticality is that the characteristic length scale {{of the structure of}} the physical system, also known as the correlation length ξ, becomes infinite. This can happen along critical lines in phase space. This effect is the cause of the critical <b>opalescence</b> that can be observed as binary fluid mixture approaches its liquid-liquid {{critical point}}.|$|E

50|$|In {{any system}} {{containing}} liquid and gaseous phases, {{there exists a}} special combination of pressure and temperature, known as the critical point, at which the transition between liquid and gas becomes a second-order transition.

At that time he introduced equations which presently bear his name.|$|E
50|$|Slocum Stone is a {{silicate}} glass {{which shows}} traces of sodium, magnesium, aluminum and titanium.
