5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the Little Ice Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E

5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential <b>of</b> <b>solar</b> energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day.

40|$|Abstract. Many studies {{reported}} that {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} have more significant capacitance characteristics than the silicon solar cell. In this study, it was found the capacitance characteristics <b>of</b> dye-sensitized <b>solar</b> cell changes with the imposed bias voltage. The bias voltage is indispensable in the standard measurement for the conversion efficiency <b>of</b> dye-sensitized <b>solar</b> cell. The influence of changed capacitance during the measurement on the conversion efficiency <b>of</b> dye-sensitized <b>solar</b> cells was investigated. The analysis on the EIS spectra and equivalent circuit shows that the capacitance <b>of</b> dye-sensitized <b>solar</b> cells is small and the deviation cell I-V characteristics from the steady-state value is minor when the applied bias is small; while under a condition with a large applied bias, the capacitance characteristics <b>of</b> dye-sensitized <b>solar</b> cell grew rapidly and the I-V characteristics deviated from the steady-state value significantly increased. This phenomenon is helpful for the accurate measurement of the quantum conversion efficiency and photoelectric conversion efficiency <b>of</b> dye-sensitized <b>solar</b> cells...|$|R

2500|$|The Nice (...) [...] {{model is}} a {{scenario}} for the dynamical evolution <b>of</b> the <b>Solar</b> System. It is named for {{the location of the}} Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, where it was initially developed, in Nice, France. It proposes the migration of the giant planets from an initial compact configuration into their present positions, long after the dissipation of the initial protoplanetary gas disk. In this way, it differs from earlier models <b>of</b> the <b>Solar</b> System's formation. This planetary migration is used in dynamical simulations <b>of</b> the <b>Solar</b> System to explain historical events including the Late Heavy Bombardment <b>of</b> the inner <b>Solar</b> System, the formation of the Oort cloud, and the existence of populations <b>of</b> small <b>Solar</b> System bodies including the Kuiper belt, the Neptune and Jupiter trojans, and the numerous resonant trans-Neptunian objects dominated by Neptune. Its success at reproducing many of the observed features <b>of</b> the <b>Solar</b> System means that it is widely accepted as the current most realistic model <b>of</b> the <b>Solar</b> System's early evolution, although it is not universally favoured among planetary scientists. Later research revealed a number of differences between the original Nice model's predictions and observations <b>of</b> the current <b>Solar</b> System, for example the orbits of the terrestrial planets and the asteroids, leading to its modification.|$|R
