25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the Royal Navy had two classes of <b>offshore</b> <b>patrol</b> vessel, the Island-class, and the larger Castle-class. However, in 1997, a decision was taken to replace them; this decision {{came in the form of}} three much larger <b>offshore</b> <b>patrol</b> vessels, the River-class. Unusually, the three River-class ships were owned by Vosper Thorneycroft, and leased to the Royal Navy until 2013. This relationship was defined by a ground-breaking contractor logistic support contract which contracts the ships' availability to the RN, including technical and stores support. A modified River-class vessel, , was commissioned in July 2007 and became the Falkland Islands guard-ship. In November 2013, it was announced that in order to sustain shipbuilding capabilities on the Clyde, five new ocean-going patrol vessels with Merlin-capable flightdecks would be ordered for delivery from 2017. These ships will replace the four existing River Class ships. In October 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced the names of the first three ships as HMS Forth, HMS Medway and HMS Trent. The fourth and fifth ships were ordered in December 2016, these will be named HMS Spey and HMS Tamar respectively.|$|E
25|$|Planning for the Armidale class {{began in}} 1993, as {{a plan to}} replace the , which was due for {{retirement}} in 1998. This evolved into a joint program with Malaysia to construct an <b>offshore</b> <b>patrol</b> craft. When Malaysia pulled out, the plan was scrapped, and the Fremantles underwent a life-extending refit. The cost of maintaining the aging vessels prompted the Department of Defence to create the Replacement Patrol Boat program, which received the procurement project designation SEA 1444.|$|E

25|$|The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 {{announced}} a further purchase {{of two new}} Batch 2 ships at an undisclosed date in the future, and a total fleet of 'up to six' <b>offshore</b> <b>patrol</b> vessels.

The three Batch 1 ships without flight decks would be withdrawn in favour of the newer ships. The defence review also suggested that the ships could be used to increase the Royal Navy’s ability to defend UK interests at home and abroad.|$|E
25|$|The premise for {{the coast}} guard was that its largest <b>offshore</b> <b>patrol</b> vessels, the Nordkapp-class, would be {{equipped}} with helicopters. A 1976 commission considered the options and concluded that three rotorcraft met the criteria: the Westland Lynx, the Sikorsky S-76 and the Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk. It recommended the Seahawk, citing its supreme range, de-icing and cabin space. It was also suitable as to provide a unified helicopter fleet for the Air Force. The Navy preferred the Lynx, emphasizing its low cost, manoeuvrability, that most North Sea-countries were purchasing it and that it already was in British service. The Seahawk would not be operational until 1984. Parliament approved the purchase of six units in 1978.|$|E

5000|$|German Navy {{submarines}} began {{operating in}} American coastal waters. By March 1942 fity-three ships had been sunk in the North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier. As a result, the Commander of the North Atlantic Naval Coastal Frontier requested the Army's Eastern Defense Command to undertake <b>offshore</b> <b>patrols</b> with all available aircraft.The first patrols were performed by elements of I Bomber Command, {{which would be}} the primary AAF command involved in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) in early 1942, with assistance from I Air Support Command.

[...] It soon became apparent that if the AAF were to continue with the ASW mission, its units would have to be organized under a specially trained and equipped command.|$|R
