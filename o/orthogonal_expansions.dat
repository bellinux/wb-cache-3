25|$|Sturm–Liouville {{theory is}} a theory of a special type of second order linear {{ordinary}} differential equations. Their solutions are based on eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of linear operators {{defined in terms of}} second-order homogeneous linear equations. The problems are identified as Sturm-Liouville Problems (SLP) and are named after J.C.F. Sturm and J. Liouville, who studied such problems in the mid-1800s. The interesting fact about regular SLPs is that they have an infinite number of eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenfunctions form a complete, orthogonal set, which makes <b>orthogonal</b> <b>expansions</b> possible. This is a key idea in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. SLPs are also useful in the analysis of certain partial differential equations.|$|E

Based on twice <b>orthogonal</b> <b>expansion</b> in the stochastic process and the expression of uncorrelated random vectors by use of orthogonal functions originate from a single source random variable, a method of triple <b>orthogonal</b> <b>expansion</b> for a stochastic process is put forward,which can simulate a stochastic process with only one random variable.

5000|$|A key {{aspect of}} GFLM is {{estimation}} and inference for the smooth parameter function [...] {{which is usually}} obtained by dimension reduction of the infinite dimensional functional predictor. A common method is to expand the predictor function [...] in an orthonormal basis of L2 space, the Hilbert space of square integrable functions with the simultaneous expansion of the parameter function in the same basis. This representation is then combined with a truncation step to reduce {{the contribution of the}} parameter function [...] in the linear predictor to a finite number of regression coefficients. Functional principal component analysis (FPCA) that employs the Karhunen-Loève expansion is a common and parsimonious approach to accomplish this. Other <b>orthogonal</b> <b>expansions,</b> like Fourier expansions and B-spline expansions may also be employed for the dimension reduction step. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) can be used for selecting the number of included components. Minimization of cross-validation prediction errors is another criteria often used in classification applications. Once the dimension of the predictor process has been reduced, the simplified linear predictor allows to use GLM and quasi-likelihood estimation techniques to obtain estimates of the finite dimensional regression coefficients which in turn provide an estimate of the parameter function [...] in the GFLM.|$|E

Combined with a unified conjugacy scheme furnished in our earlier article it allows, via a suitable embedding, to associate a differential-difference `Laplacian' L with the initially given orthogonal system of eigenfunctions of L, so that the resulting extended conjugacy scheme has the natural classical shape. This means, in particular, that the related `partial derivatives' decomposing L are skew-symmetric in an appropriate L^ 2 space and they commute with Riesz transforms and conjugate Poisson integrals.

40|$|Abstract. An <b>orthogonal</b> <b>expansion</b> {{method for}} {{earthquake}} ground motion {{was introduced in}} the first part of the paper. In the method, seismic acceleration process is represented as a linear combination of deterministic functions modulated by 10 uncorrelated random variables. In the second part of the paper, the recently developed probability density evolution method (PDEM) is employed to study linear random response of structures subjected to the external excitations. In the PDEM, a completely uncoupled one-dimensional governing partial differential equation, the generalized density evolution equation, is derived first with regard to evolutionary probability density function of the stochastic response for nonlinear structures. The solution of this equation can put out the instantaneous probability density function. So it is natural to combine the PDEM and the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>expansion</b> of seismic ground motion to study the linear random earthquake response. Finally, combining an example of a linear frame structure subjected to non-stationary ground motions, this paper validate the proposed approach and expounds the application of this method...|$|R
