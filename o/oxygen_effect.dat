40|$|The {{presence}} of oxygen in tumours has substantial impact on treatment outcome; relative to anoxic regions, well-oxygenated cells respond better to radiotherapy {{by a factor}} 2. 5 - 3. This increased radio-response {{is known as the}} oxygen enhancement ratio.

This is fitted to a range of experimental oxygen curves from literature and shown to describe them well, yielding a single robust term for oxygen interaction obtained.

The correlation allows prediction of the final precipitation pattern by measur ing of the initial resistivity pattern prior to any thermal donor annihilation by thermal processing.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{investigated}} the production of free radicals induced by swift ions during the radiolysis of oxygenated water and analyzed the underlying mechanisms in detail. To this aim, we simulated, by Monte-Carlo, the irradiation of water by projectiles with LET values ranging from 1 to 300 keV/μm for a partial pressure of oxygen in air from 0 to 750 mmHg, and for times up to 10 μs after ion impact. For low-LET radiation, we observed an increase in production of (HO 2 radical dot + O 2 radical dot−) with oxygen pressure and a saturation. At 1 μs, the saturation occurred at a pressure of 20 – 30 mmHg and the maximal yield amounted to 0. 3 μmol L− 1 per Gray. For the same conditions, we observed similar trends for high-LET ions, but we observed {{a significant reduction in}} the yield values and an attenuation of the saturation behavior.

Its physicochemical properties (electron configuration of a molecule, reactive capacity, features) are analyzed, and enzymic and nonenzymic ways of singlet oxygen generation in body are specified.

The relation of singlet oxygen and photodynamic effect is described. There is organized the data on molecular and cell mechanisms of singlet <b>oxygen</b> <b>effect</b> of biological systems.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are resistant to standard treatments, partly due to cancer stem cells (CSCs) localised in hypoxic niches. Compared to X-rays, carbon ion irradiation relies on better ballistic properties, higher relative biological effectiveness {{and the absence of}} <b>oxygen</b> <b>effect.</b> Hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α (HIF- 1 α) is involved in the resistance to photons, whereas its role in response to carbon ions remains unclear. Methods: Two HNSCC cell lines and their CSC sub-population were studied in response to photons or carbon ion irradiation, in normoxia or hypoxia, after inhibition or not of HIF- 1 α. Results: Under hypoxia, compared to non-CSCs, HIF- 1 α is expressed earlier in CSCs. A combined effect photons/hypoxia, less observed with carbon ions, results in a synergic and earlier HIF- 1 α expression in both subpopulations. The diffuse ROS production by photons is concomitant with HIF- 1 α expression and essential to its activation. There is no <b>oxygen</b> <b>effect</b> in response to carbon ions and the ROS localised in the track might be insufficient to stabilise HIF- 1 α. Finally, in hypoxia, cells were sensitised to both types of radiations after HIF- 1 α inhibition. Conclusions: Hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 α plays a main role in the response of CSCs and non-CSCs to carbon ion and photon irradiations, which makes the HIF- 1 α targeting an attractive therapeutic challenge...|$|E

40|$|Fundamental {{aspects of}} the {{reduction}} of tetrazolium salts were investigated and, in particular, the role of oxygen in the reduction. It was found that oxygen had a competitive inhibitory effect on the reduction of (Tetra) Nitro BT mediated by NADH and phenazine methosulphate. This competitive effect, under aerobic conditions, could be reversed by using tetrazolium concentrations of 5 mM. Oxygen {{did not have a}} significant effect on BPST reduction, whereas the inhibitory effect of oxygen on the reduction of Neotetrazolium was not reversed by increasing the tetrazolium concentration. The <b>oxygen</b> <b>effect</b> on Nitro BT reduction was considerably less when macromolecular substances such as albumin or polyvinyl alcohol were added to the medium. This may be due to increased Nitro BT concentrations being built up at the surface of macromolecules due to the nonpolar components of the Nitro BT molecule. When demonstrating glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase activity in vitro or in tissue sections with the use of Nitro BT, oxygen also had a direct inhibitory effect, even when azide was added to the medium for the inhibition of flavoprotein-mediated electron transfer to oxygen. Again, this direct inhibition of Nitro BT reduction by oxygen could be excluded by using a high Nitro BT concentration. Macromolecules present in the incubation medium or in tissue sections counteracted the <b>oxygen</b> <b>effect.</b> It is concluded that the maximum reaction rate and optimum localization of dehydrogenases is obtained when histochemical media are used containing 5 mM (Tetra) Nitro BT and 20 % polyvinyl alcoho...|$|E

We used isolated human fetal airway smooth muscle (fASM) cells from 18 - 20 post-conceptual age lungs (canalicular stage) to examine <b>oxygen</b> <b>effects</b> on intracellular Ca(2 +) ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) and cellular proliferation. fASM cells expressed substantial smooth muscle actin and myosin and several Ca(2 +) regulatory proteins, but not fibroblast or epithelial markers: profiles qualitatively comparable to adult human ASM. Fluorescence Ca(2 +) imaging showed robust [Ca(2 +) ](i) responses to 1 µM ACh and 10 µM histamine (albeit smaller and slower than adult ASM), partly sensitive to zero extracellular Ca(2 +). Compared to adult, fASM showed greater baseline proliferation. Based on this validation, we assessed fASM responses to 10 % hypoxia through 90 % hyperoxia, and found enhanced proliferation at 60 %: effects accompanied by appropriate changes in proliferative vs. apoptotic markers and enhanced mitochondrial fission at > 60 % oxygen. [Ca(2 +) ](i) responses to ACh were enhanced for 60 % oxygen. These results suggest that hyperoxia has dose-dependent effects on structure and function of developing ASM which could have consequences for airway diseases of childhood.
