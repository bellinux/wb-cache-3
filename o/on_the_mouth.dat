5|$|A {{positive}} {{development for the}} Allies during this time was the appearance of another Spanish force in the region. The Spanish Regency at Cádiz had sent General Joaquín Blake, with the two divisions of Zayas and Lardizábal, by sea to Ayamonte <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Guadiana. Landing on 18 April, Blake's army moved to join General Francisco Ballesteros at the Spanish town of Xeres.|$|E

Serious and little interested in athletic activities, he was called El Viejo by his classmates.|$|E

5|$|The yucca, Yucca whipplei, is pollinated {{exclusively}} by Tegeticula maculata, a yucca moth {{that depends on}} the yucca for survival. The moth eats the seeds of the plant, while gathering pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> parts when the moth moves to the next flower. The yucca provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.|$|E
5|$|In acute poisoning, typical {{neurological}} {{signs are}} pain, muscle weakness, numbness and tingling, and, rarely, symptoms associated with {{inflammation of the}} brain. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms. Lead's effects <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> include astringency and a metallic taste. Gastrointestinal problems, such as constipation, diarrhea, poor appetite, or weight loss, are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause shock (insufficient fluid in the circulatory system) due to loss {{of water from the}} gastrointestinal tract. Hemolysis (the rupture of red blood cells) due to acute poisoning can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine. Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output. People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{base for}} the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea was Wilhelmshaven {{on the western side}} of the Jade Bight; the port of Cuxhaven, located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Elbe, was also a major base in the North Sea. The island of Heligoland {{provided}} a fortified forward position in the German Bight. Kiel was the most important base in the Baltic, which supported the forward bases at Pillau and Danzig. The Kaiser Wilhelm Canal through Schleswig-Holstein connected the Baltic and North Seas and allowed the German Navy to quickly shift naval forces between the two seas. In peacetime, all ships on active duty in the High Seas Fleet were stationed in Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, or Danzig. Germany possessed only one major overseas base, at Kiautschou in China, where the East Asia Squadron was stationed.|$|E

25|$|The kiss on {{the lips}} can be {{performed}} between two friends or family. This move aims to express the affection that you have for a friend. Unlike kissing for love, a friendly kiss has no sexual connotation. The {{kiss on the}} lips is a practice {{that can be found}} in the time of Patriarchs (Bible). In Ancient Greece, the kiss <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> was used to express a concept of equality between people of the same rank. In the Middle Ages, the kiss of peace was recommended by the Catholic Church. The kiss on the lips was also common among knights. The gesture has again become popular with young people, particularly in England.|$|E
25|$|Lucius Volumnius {{hurried back}} to Samnium because the proconsulships of Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were about to expire. Meanwhile, the Samnites raised new troops and raided Roman territories and allies in Campania around Capua and Falernium. Lucius Volumnius headed for Campania and was {{informed}} that the Samnites {{had gone back to}} Samnium to take their loot. He caught up with their camp and defeated a force which was made unfit to fight by the burden of their loot. The Samnite commander, Staius Minatius, was attacked by the prisoners of the Samnites and delivered to the consul. The senate decided to establish the colonies of Minturnae <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the River Liris and Sinuessa further inland, in the former territory of the Ausoni.|$|E
25|$|By this time, the Royal Navy was {{building}} a naval base and dockyard in Bermuda. It had begun buying land, mostly at the West End of Bermuda, notably Ireland Island, following American independence, permanently establishing itself in the colony in 1795. The development of the intended site was delayed by a dozen years as a suitable passage through the surrounding reefline needed to be located. Until then, the Royal Navy operated from the old capital in the East End, St. George's. Bermuda replaced Newfoundland initially as the winter base of the North America and West Indies Squadron, and then as its year-round headquarters, naval station, and dockyard, with its Admiralty House at Mount Wyndham, in Bailey's Bay, and then at Spanish Point, opposite Ireland Island <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Great Sound.|$|E

25|$|He was {{probably}} born in 522 BC or 518 BC (the 65th Olympiad) in Cynoscephalae, {{a village in}} Boeotia, not far from Thebes. His father's name is variously given as Daiphantus, Pagondas or Scopelinus, and his mother's name was Cleodice. It is told that he was stung <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> by a bee in his youth {{and this was the}} reason he became a poet of honey-like verses (an identical fate has been ascribed to other poets of the archaic period). Pindar was about twenty years old in 498 BC when he was commissioned by the ruling family in Thessaly to compose his first victory ode (Pythian 10). He studied the art of lyric poetry in Athens, where his tutor was Lasos of Hermione, and he is also said to have received some helpful criticism from Corinna.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the {{neighbourhood}} now known as the historic city centre (see below), <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Guanabara Bay. The city's centre of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighbourhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905. Botafogo's natural beauty, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, the luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town (although this reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade).|$|E
25|$|According to the Malay Annals, {{after they}} had sacked Singapura, the Majapahit army {{abandoned}} the city and returned to Java. The city would have been ruined and greatly depopulated. The rivalry between the courts of Javanese and Malay in the region nevertheless was renewed few years later when the last king Iskandar Shah, founded his new stronghold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Bertam river in {{the west coast of}} Malay peninsula. Within decades, the new city grew rapidly to become the capital of Melaka Sultanate and emerged as the primary base in continuing the historic struggles of Singapura and Srivijaya, against their Java-based nemeses. By the mid 15th century, Majapahit found itself unable to control the rising power of Melaka that began to gain effective control of Melaka straits and expands its influence to Sumatra. Singapura was also absorbed into its realm and once served as the fiefdom of Melakan Laksamana (or admiral).|$|E
