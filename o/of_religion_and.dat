5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted as representative <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, {{necessary for a}} better understanding of theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and that few people have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E

5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged their followers to do so.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, the Roman Catholic Church, while {{supportive}} of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that {{aspects of the}} mandate covering contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization violated the First Amendment right to free exercise <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> conscience.

5|$|Lithuania {{was ruled}} {{during the early}} 13th century {{by a number of}} dukes and princes {{presiding}} over various fiefdoms and tribes. They were loosely bonded by commonalities <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> tradition, trade, kinship, joint military campaigns, and the presence of captured prisoners from neighboring areas. Western merchants and missionaries began seeking control of the area during the 12th century, establishing the city of Riga, Latvia in 1201. Their efforts in Lithuania were temporarily halted by defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, but armed Christian orders continued to pose a threat. The country had also undergone incursions by the Mongol Empire.|$|E

Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of the musical performances, with some complaining of the tangential relationship between the numbers and religion, and others appreciating that the Glee versions brought new meaning to the songs.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north.

Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> <b>and</b> discrimination.|$|E

5|$|The {{place name}} Orange has a {{separate}} etymology. The Roman-Celtic settlement {{was founded in}} 36 or 35 BC and originally named Arausio, after a Celtic water god. The Principality of Orange was named for this place {{and not for the}} color. Some time after the sixteenth century, though, the color orange was adopted as a canting symbol of the House of Orange-Nassau. The color eventually came to be associated with Protestantism, due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars <b>of</b> <b>Religion</b> <b>and</b> the Dutch Eighty Years' War.|$|E
5|$|Three core {{principles}} {{establish a}} basis for Bahá'í teachings and doctrine: the unity of God, the unity <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> <b>and</b> the unity of humanity. From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform the character of humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|E
