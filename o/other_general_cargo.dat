40|$|About 63 % of the world's {{shipping}} {{accidents are}} recurrentthey occur to ships {{that have already}} experienced at least one prior accident. Therefore, reducing recurrent accidents can contribute significantly to maritime safety. We study the factors affecting both first and recurrent accidents, {{by focusing on the}} duration between two accidents. Cox proportional hazard models are applied to ship accident data from 1996 to 2015, and the results identify which ships have a high risk of recurrent accidents, based on ship attributes, ship supply and market conditions, shipbuilding country, previous accident type, and ship type. The recurrent rate is high when the ship involved in the accident is old, small, flies a flag of convenience, and has no detention record. In addition, the accident risk increases when the shipping market faces a high bunker price, overcapacity in supply, a high time charter rate, or low newbuilding price. On the other hand, ships built in China and Japan have lower recurrent accident rates than those built elsewhere, although ships built in China have earlier first accidents than do <b>others.</b> <b>General</b> <b>cargo</b> ships have the highest recurrent accident rate, followed by dry bulkers, container ships, and tankers, in that order.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the evaluation method of berth capacity for <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> in port.

It described the traditional evaluation method and new evaluation method with a sample case using real data of the <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> berth. The results of the study revealed some problems for traditional evaluation method of <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> handling capacity. Traditional calculation method does not reflect real situation for the <b>general</b> <b>cargo</b> berth capacity. Also, it does not reflect individual circumstances in terms of input parameter like berth occupancy rate, an annual working day and daily working hour.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, A.P. Moller considered possibilities of going into liner trade business. The tramp trade, where vessels sailed from port to port depending on the demand, was expected to lose ground to liners in time. On 12 July 1928, the vessel LEISE MÆRSK left Baltimore on its first voyage from the American East Coast via the Panama Canal to the Far East and back. The cargo consisted of Ford car parts and <b>other</b> <b>general</b> <b>cargo.</b> This heralded the start of Maersk's shipping services. Maersk Line began to grow in 1946 after the Second World War by transporting goods between America and Europe before expanding services in 1950. On 26 April 1956, ocean-borne container transport was introduced with the shipment of a Sea-Land container aboard the SS Ideal X from Port Newark, New Jersey, to Houston, Texas. In 1967, Anglo carrier P&O was part of the first European initiative, a pooling of liner services from four companies, into the new company Overseas Containers Limited (OCL). Both Sea-land and P&O would later be taken over by Maersk Line as it expanded operations between 1999 and 2005.|$|E
40|$|In this project, the {{positioning}} of the port of Antwerp is analysed in four subsequent geographical levels: the global scale, continental Europe, the Hamburg-Le Havre range and finally a comparison between Antwerp and Rotterdam. In order to evaluate {{the positioning}} of the ports, we integrate a strategic positioning analysis that incorporates several growth-share matrixes using the BCG-framework, diversification, shift-share and market concentration analyses. The project also implements explanatory factors. The transition from the former superiority of the Triad to the current dominance of Asia was the main result of the global analysis. The Hamburg-Le Havre range remained the largest port range in continental Europe and {{the positions of the}} port ranges have stayed remarkably stable, both in container as well as in total traffic. Within this range, there was a convergence trend in market shares of the 'big four' (Rotterdam, Antwerp, Bremen and Hamburg). The traffic group of containers has risen significantly in portfolio share in almost all ports, which replaced the portfolio share of <b>other</b> <b>general</b> <b>cargo.</b> The ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp are top container ports on all investigated market segmentations. However, although they were considered each other’s greatest competitors in the past, they have now changed their policy to enhance cooperation between each other. status: accepte...|$|E
