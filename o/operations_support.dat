5|$|Crusader (AV2767) was an Australian Army amphibious <b>operations</b> <b>support</b> ship of World War II. She was {{launched}} {{shortly before the}} war ended and entered service in late 1945. From 1945 to 1947 she was mainly used to return Australian Army equipment from the islands off New Guinea. She was also loaned to the Australian Shipping Board in early 1947 and transported earth moving equipment and timber between Melbourne and Tasmania. However, the Army did not need a ship with Crusaders capabilities after the war, and she was sold in 1947 to the Queensland Cement and Lime Company which operated her as a coral barge on the Brisbane River until the mid-1980s. The ship was scuttled in 1986 and subsequently became a popular dive wreck.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the {{delivery}} of Australia's first C-17s, RAAF personnel received training on the aircraft in the United States. From May 2006 a group of pilots and loadmasters led by Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the commanding officer designate of No. 36 Squadron, undertook conversion training with the USAF's C-17 units at Altus Air Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base. A group of 48 technical personnel also received training at Charleston and McChord Air Force Base from September that year. No. 36 Squadron began a period of intensive training once Corbould delivered A41-206 to Amberley on 7 December 2006, and the unit achieved initial operating capability status in September 2007. Also in 2007, the RAAF's No. 1 Air <b>Operations</b> <b>Support</b> Squadron was expanded by 80 personnel to provide air load teams to support the Globemasters. A project to acquire the equipment needed to allow the RAAF's C-17s {{to be used in}} the aeromedical evacuation role and develop associated crew procedures began in late 2007. The first Globemaster aeromedical evacuation sortie was flown on 5 September 2008, the day after the type was certified to operate in this role. On 8 December 2008, Corbould led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a training flight over South East Queensland to mark the second anniversary of the entry of the Globemaster into service. A team of USAF trainers was posted to Amberley until the RAAF had sufficient C-17 pilots who were qualified to instruct others. The RAAF began training new C-17 pilots in early 2010 after the flight simulator was delivered, and the first Australian-trained pilots graduated in early May that year. No. 36 Squadron achieved final operating capability status in December 2011. The components for a simulated C-17 cargo compartment were delivered to Amberley in early 2013, and this facility was commissioned in November that year. The simulator is used to train air movements and medical staff as well as to develop and trial new cargo carrying techniques for the C-17s. The first Australian-trained Globemaster loadmasters graduated in mid-2014. The final element of C-17 aircrew training to be routinely conducted in the United States was the course to qualify co-pilots as aircraft captains. This course was relocated to Australia in mid-2017.|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{companies}} face {{a situation}} where information systems are increasingly integrated. The old distinction between administrative systems and <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> systems is slowly vanishing. A growing problem is how information and related technology should be governed when systems are merged. This paper uses the principles of IT governance to evaluate the governance maturity of administrative systems and <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> systems at an electric utility. The COBIT maturity model is {{used to assess the}} performance of ten IT processes. Results show that administrative systems are better documented and formalized, while <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> systems’ processes for information security, availability, and change management are generally more mature. Knowledge of these differences in IT governance maturity can serve as valuable support for decision-making regarding the integration of information systems and organizations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A human {{interface}} toolkit is proposed {{for helping the}} user to develop <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> system of complex industrial system such as Nuclear Power Plant (NPP). With a friendly graphical interface, this integrated tool includes a database, a procedure editor and a procedure executor. A three layer hierarchy is adopted to express the complexity of operation procedure, which includes mission, process and node. There are 10 kinds of node: entrance, exit, hint, manual input, detector, actuator, data treatment, branch, judgement and plug-in. The <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> system will sense and actuate the actual industrial systems with the interface based on IVI-COM (Interchangeable Virtual Instru-mentation-Component Object Model) technology. A prototype system of this {{human interface}} toolkit has been developed is applied to develop a simple <b>operation</b> <b>support</b> system for a simulated NPP...|$|R
