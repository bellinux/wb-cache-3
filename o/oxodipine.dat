40|$|The two novel dihydropyridines, <b>oxodipine</b> and {{elgodipine}} greatly depressed the KCl-induced {{contraction of}} rabbit aorta and decreased the cardiac force of contraction of rat ventricular strips with lower potency. Both compounds markedly shortened cardiac action potentials. In rat cultured neonatal ventricular myocytes, <b>oxodipine</b> and elgodipine decreased the L-type Ca 2 + current (I-CaL) with IC 50 of 0. 24 and 0. 33 mu M respectively while <b>oxodipine</b> was slightly more potent on the T-type Ca 2 + current (I-CaT) than elgodipine (IC 50 = 0. 41 vs. 2. 18 mu M) Both compounds were less potent in inhibiting I-CaL of adult cardiomyocytes. <b>Oxodipine</b> exhibited mostly a tonic block of both currents while elgodipine induced mainly a use-dependent block. <b>Oxodipine</b> and elgodipine increased {{by at least}} one order of magnitude their inhibitory potency on I-CaT and I-CaL when the cells were partially depolarized. We conclude that the mechanisms of inhibition of Ca 2 + channels by these two dihydropyridines are different and suggest that the underlying mechanism of vascular selectivity is the voltage-dependent block of I-CaL, with the use-dependent inhibition of Ca 2 + currents by elgodipine further contributing to this selectivity.

40|$|Subchronic {{effects of}} <b>oxodipine,</b> a {{calcium channel blocker}} {{affecting}} the adrenal gland of the dog, are described. Thirteen wk of treatment at a high dose (24 mg/kg/day) of <b>oxodipine</b> resulted in drug-induced thickening of the zona glomerulosa and increased stimulation of its secretory activity. It is postulated that subchronic administration of <b>oxodipine</b> at this dosage resulted in a decrease in blood pressure, with unin-terrupted stimulation of the adrenal zona glomerulosa to release aldosterone, causing {{an increase in the}} width of this portion of the gland involving cellular hyperplasia. Support for this indirect effect is found in the increased presence of renin granules in the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Keywords.

40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{effects of}} d-myo-inositol 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentakisphosphate (InsP 5) and d-myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6), which represent the main cellular inositol polyphosphates, were studied on L-type Ca 2 + channels in single myocytes of rat portal vein. Intracellular infusion of InsP 5 (up to 50 μm) or 10 μm InsP 6 had no action on Ba 2 + current, whereas 50 μm InsP 6 or 10 μm InsP 5 plus 10 μm InsP 6 (InsP 5, 6) stimulated the inward current. The stimulatory effect of InsP 5, 6 was also obtained in external Ca 2 +-containing solution. The stimulated Ba 2 + current retained {{the properties of}} L-type Ba 2 + current and was <b>oxodipine</b> sensitive. PKC inhibitors Ro 32 - 0432 (up to 500 nm), GF 109203 X (5 μm) or calphostin C (100 nm) abolished the InsP 5, 6 -induced stimulation. Neither the PKA inhibitor H 89 (1 μm) nor the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (500 nm) or cypermethrin (1 μm) prevented or mimicked the InsP 5, 6 -induced stimulation of Ba 2 + current. However, InsP 5 or InsP 6 could mimic some effects of protein phosphatase inhibitor so as to extend after washing-out forskolin the stimulatory effects of the adenylyl cyclase activator on Ba 2 + current. These results indicate that InsP 5 and InsP 6 may act as intracellular messengers in modulating L-type Ca 2 + channel activity and so could be implicated in mediator-induced contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells...|$|E
