40|$|Abstract. The study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} ownership structure on firm performance. We distinguish between family firms, firms controlled by partnerships of individuals, concern controlled firms, and firms where blockholders have less than 50 % of the vote. The empirical work analyzes data on 280 Israeli firms and employs the technique of Data Envelopment Analysis. It is found that ownermanager firms are less efficient in generating net income than firms managed by a professional (non-owner) manager, and that family firms run by their owners perform (relatively) the worst. This {{evidence suggests that the}} modern form of business organization, namely the <b>open</b> <b>corporation</b> with disperse ownership and non-owner managers, promotes firm performance. Key words: firm performance, ownership structure, family firms, owner-managers 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{issues relating to}} the most appropriate form of corporation ownership including organizational and cultural systems that will maximize the firm's value to society whilst maintaining a more sustainable market value. The paper argues that the maximization of firm value to society may be more readily achieved through a closed corporation type formation with better rights protection for all internal stakeholders, such as an employee-owned corporation or a limited liability partnership similar to Scott Bader Commonwealth and John Lewis Partnership, rather than a publicly-owned <b>open</b> <b>corporation</b> with large ‘moral debt’ claims, conflicts of interest, and agency costs. The four main perceived theoretical arguments against a closed corporation are: The horizon problem; the common-property problem; the non-transferability problem; and the control problem. Our analysis demonstrates how the Scott Bader Commonwealth and the John Lewis Partnership {{with support from the}} capital markets evolved successful solutions to the above theoretical issues. In other words, closed corporations such as Scott Bader Commonwealth and John Lewis Partnership with their better organizational and cultural systems can be considered to be more just at distributing residual and ‘moral debt’ claims than open corporations and thus are better at maximizing their value to society...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} three papers undertaken {{as part of}} a PhD by publication or 'Three-Paper PhD', {{in addition}} to an introduction and conclusion. The introduction outlines the concept of Openness for Privacy, which describes a class of technological, social and policy approaches for addressing the challenges of personal data. Various manifestations of this concept are investigated in the three papers. The first paper explores the idea of 'open data for privacy', in particular the potential of machine-readable privacy notices to provide transparency and insight into organisations' uses of personal data. It provides an empirical overview of UK organisations' personal data practices. The second paper examines services which give individuals transparency and control over their digital profiles, assessing the potential benefits to industry, and the empowering potential for individuals. The first part is a user study, which tests how consumer responses to personalised targeting are affected by the degree of transparency and control they have over their profiles, with implications for digital marketing and advertising. The second part draws from qualitative data, and theoretical perspectives, to develop an account of the empowering potential of these services. The third paper concerns Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs), a regulatory tool included in the European Union's proposed general data protection regulation reform. It assesses the potential of PIAs through concepts from regulatory theory, namely, meta-regulation and the <b>open</b> <b>corporation,</b> and outlines implications for regulators, civil society and industry. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Art??culo de la secci??n: DocumentosEl documento, procedente del Archivo de dicha Hermandad, est?? fechado en 1545 y las modificaciones que se a??aden, en 1556. La fundaci??n de esta Hermandad corresponde, pues, a los momentos de implantaci??n de este tipo de asociaciones en el reino de Granada, reci??n conquistado por la Corona castellana. Es un texto de car??cter legal, a trav??s del cual se dise??a el funcionamiento de la nueva Hermandad, quiz??s la m??s importante de Granada. Se trata de una corporaci??n abierta (sin limitaci??n en el n??mero de sus miembros), de penitencia y de naturaleza ben??fico-religiosa. La trascripci??n del documento se acompa??a de un an??lisis introductorio. El texto comienza con el ??ndice de cap??tulos y un interesante pre??mbulo referente a su naturaleza y fundaci??n. Siguen los cap??tulos, que se yuxtaponen sin un orden tem??tico l??gico. Su contenido puede agruparse en bloques: requisitos y forma de ingreso, organizaci??n y gobierno de la hermandad, celebraci??n de cultos, obligaciones contra??das por los hermanos, beneficios materiales y espirituales que reciben y disposiciones sancionadoras por incumplimiento de las reglas. El texto concluye con la aprobaci??n eclesi??stica correspondiente. The document, {{from the}} Archive of the said Brotherhood, is dated in 1545 and the {{modifications}} {{to it in}} 1556. The foundation of this Brotherhood corresponds, therefore, to the time in which this type of associations was being introduced into the Kingdom of Granada, recently conquered by the Crown of Castille. It is a text of legal character, by which {{the activity of the}} new Brotherhood, perhaps the most important of its kind in Granada, is regulated. This was an <b>open</b> <b>corporation</b> (with no limitation on the number of its members) of a charitable and religious nature and dedicated to penitence. The transcription of the document is accompanied by an analytical introduction. The text begins with the index of chapters and an interesting preamble concerning its nature and foundation. The chapters which follow are placed one beside the other with no logical thematic order. The contents may be grouped together in blocks: requirements for and means of admittance, organization and government of the Brotherhood, the celebration of religious ceremonies, duties acquired by the brothers, material and spiritual benefits and disciplinary rules. The text concludes with the corresponding ecclesiastical approval...|$|E
