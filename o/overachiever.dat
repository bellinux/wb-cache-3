40|$|Thesis (MA(Sielkunde)) [...] PU vir CHOThis {{investigation}} explored {{differences between}} academically underachieving and overachieving pupils {{in relation to}} motivation and personality in a Transvaal secondary school. The hypothetical concept was that underachievers and <b>overachievers</b> would differ greatly and significantly with regard to personality and motivational traits. From a population of 565 pupils three experimental groups were compiled, viz: a control group, a group of underachievers {{and a group of}} <b>overachievers,</b> each consisting of thirty subjects. As criterion for the academic achievement of the subjects, their academic achievement in school for 1975 was used and the experimental groups were compiled in such a way, that the underachievers and <b>overachievers</b> reflect the greatest discrepancy between academic achievement and IQ. The relationship between the verbal and non-verbal average score of each experimental group for the IQ Test, was investigated. This did not differ significantly. The relationship between IQ and academic achievement was also investigated. In the case of the underachievers and over- achievers significant differences in relation to I IQ and academic achievement were found. Personality and motivation were measured by two tests: the HSPQ and the Pauli Test. Statistical methods used were the t-Test and the Chi-square Test. The latter were used for the significance of differences between underachievers and <b>overachievers</b> with regard to motivation and personality. In main the results of this investigation did not underline the findings of most other investigators. For all three experimental groups the personality traits disclosed by the HSPQ were basically the same. However, the underachievers and <b>overachievers</b> did differ significantly with regard to intelligence and Factor I "Sensitivity" (5 % level of significance). The <b>overachievers</b> tend to be more sensitive than the underachievers. Most investigators report a positive relationship between introversion - extroversion and overachievement and underachievement. This was not found in this investigation. The same can be started with regard to self-concept and creativity. The Pauli Test did not produce results which differentiate significantly between underachievers and <b>overachievers.</b> However, certain conclusions could made: it seems as if <b>overachievers</b> (in this investigation) were better motivated than underachievers. The findings of the HSPQ and Pauli Tests were used for a cumulative profile in which the main personality differences between underachievers and <b>overachievers</b> were underlined. Master...|$|R

2500|$|The {{increased}} media exposure {{was difficult}} for Fox, who acknowledged being shy and insecure, to adjust to. It also positioned her as a potential role model, and later led to her being typecast. She stated that people sometimes avoided her to remain out of the media's spotlight, {{and that she was}} a different role model for girls that maybe America was not comfortable with. She rejected the notion of preaching to kids about appropriate behaviors, or about what women should be, but said that she could make young girls feel [...] "strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for what they think is right." [...] Fox viewed her constant references to sex as feminist commentary and not simply headline-seeking, and wanted women and young girls to believe that it was okay to feel sexy and find power in that. She did not view being typecast as attractive as bad and felt that it can enable her to surprise people when she gives a good performance in a film, and inspire her to be an <b>overachiever,</b> but said she is interested in portraying less sexualized characters. MTV's Craig Flaster said that although Fox has [...] "been typecast as the big-budget sex symbol", she has shown comedic range.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate mediating factors related to academic underachievement. This investigation examined differences in self-efficacy, use of self-regulatory strategies, attributions, motivational orientation, teacher perceptions of students' motivation, and academic performance among underachieving, normal achieving, and overachieving students in the fourth, sixth, and eighth grades. Students completed questionnaires assessing self-efficacy, use of self-regulatory strategies, attributions for academic performance outcomes, and motivational orientation in the classroom. Teachers completed ratings of these students' motivation for school-related tasks. Reading grades were used as a measure of academic performance. MANOVA procedures were used to analyze all dependent variables (simultaneously) in order to determine whether underachievers, normal achievers, and <b>overachievers</b> could be differentiated along these variables. Follow-up analyses explored which of the dependent variables were important for group separation. MANOVA procedures were also used to determine whether underachievers at each of three grade levels could be differentiated on the basis of these same variables. Follow-up analyses examined specific dependent variables that discriminated between younger and older underachievers. Results indicated that underachievers, normal achievers, and <b>overachievers</b> were differentiated on the basis of the variables under investigation. Over-achievers demonstrated significantly higher self-efficacy for academic tasks than either underachievers or normal achievers. <b>Overachievers</b> and normal achievers (in comparison to underachievers) reported greater use of self-regulatory strategies and demonstrated a significantly greater intrinsic-motivational orientation. The low reliability of the measure of school-related attributions utilized within the present study precluded analysis of this variable. <b>Overachievers</b> received the highest-teacher ratings of motivation while normal achievers received significantly higher ratings than underachievers. <b>Overachievers</b> similarly demonstrated the highest-academic performance followed by the normal achievers. With respect to developmental trends among underachievers along the dependent variables, self-efficacy, use of self-regulatory strategies, intrinsic-motivational orientation, and teacher ratings of students' motivation tended to increase from the fourth to sixth grades and decrease from the sixth to eighth grades. Older underachievers demonstrated significantly lower-academic performance than younger underachievers...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the number of personal problems of underachievers at the junior high school level is greater than the number of personal problems of average and <b>overachievers.</b> The variables of school, grade, sex, and intelligence were also examined in relationship to personal problems. [...] During the months of February, March, and April, the data were collected for the study by means of a standardized test and teacher-made tests. On the basis of these results for the population of 455 junior high school students on the Trinity South Shore, ninety were randomly selected for the study. These students, who represented the population, fell into three distinct groups: thirty <b>overachievers,</b> thirty average achievers, and thirty underachievers. In May, the sample of students was given the Mooney Problem Check List. [...] The data collected from the Check Lists were treated first in a descriptive manner and then by statistical analysis. The t-test of the difference between means for independent samples was used to test the difference between achievement groups, and also for areas of adjustment, grades, and sex. The Pearson product-moment correlation was used to investigate the relationship of intelligence to personal problems. [...] The major findings of the study suggested that underachievers did not have significantly more problems than did the average achievers, except for the students at the below average level of intelligence where underachievers expressed more problems than did average achievers. Results of the study showed no significant difference in the number of problems of <b>overachievers</b> and underachievers for either level of intelligence. As for <b>overachievers</b> and average achievers, there was no significant difference in the number of problems of both groups, except for the students at the above average level of intelligence where the <b>overachievers</b> expressed more problems. [...] Related findings in the study revealed that students had more problems concerning 'School' than they did for any other area of adjustment. The results also suggested that there was no significant difference in the number of problems of either grade, sex, or level of intelligence. [...] For the field of guidance and counseling, the results of the investigation suggested that, in general, the number of personal problems of students is not significantly related to academic achievement or underachievement.
