40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{bachelor}} thesis is comparing taxes <b>on</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> between Denmark and the Czech Republic. Denmark {{is one of the}} most developed economics in the world and assigns great importance to protection and maintenance of the environment, which is obvious from the Danish tax system. High taxes <b>on</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> increase acquisition price of a car in Denmark, which is including taxes a lot more expensive than the same car in the Czech Republic. The Danish tax system is briefly mentioned in the first chapter of the thesis, with further detailed description of the taxes payed by owners of passenger cars and other <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Denmark. The second chapter offers summary of the Czech tax system and taxes <b>on</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Czech Republic. The practical part of the bachelor thesis is focused on comparison of taxes, which one has to pay when buying a car in Denmark and in the Czech Republic.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically {{estimate}} the effect of alcohol advertising <b>on</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fatalities. The concept of an industry level advertising response function is developed and other empirical issues in estimating the effects of advertising are reviewed. The data set consists of quarterly observations, from 1986 to 1989, for 75 advertising markets in the United States and includes 1200 observations. Since <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fatalities and alcohol advertising are jointly determined, Two Stage Least Squares is used in the estimation. Reduced form fatality models and advertising models are also estimated to predict the effect of changes in the price of advertising. The regression results show that alcohol advertising has a significant and positive effect <b>on</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fatalities. The data and regression results are used to estimate the effects of two policy options. The first option is to ban all broadcast alcohol advertising. The data indicate that if a ban on broadcast alcohol advertising did not also include bans on other types of alcohol marketing, the effect <b>on</b> <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fatalities might be in the range of 2000 to 3000 lives saved per year. The second policy is the elimination of the tax deductibility of alcohol advertising. This policy could reduce alcohol advertising by about 27 percent, reduce <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> fatalities by about 2300 deaths per year and raise about $ 336 million a year in new tax revenue. ...|$|R
