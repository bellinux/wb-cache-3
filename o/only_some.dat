5|$|A {{drawing method}} found by Kazimierz Zarankiewicz has been conjectured {{to give the}} correct answer for every {{complete}} bipartite graph, and the statement that this is true {{has come to be}} known as the Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture. The conjecture remains open, with <b>only</b> <b>some</b> special cases solved.|$|E

The convictions of those who are thus locally convinced are taken on trust and believed by the masses everywhere.|$|R

5|$|Many {{people still}} walk between the 'inner' and 'outer' fences, {{due to a}} number of natural and {{man-made}} gaps in the outer fence and the natural hedges. Although the site is monitored, <b>only</b> <b>some</b> of the 'gaps' are resecured.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was {{not dangerous}} {{to life on}} Earth. Even if it had headed towards lower parts of the atmosphere it would have heated {{so much that it}} would have exploded high above the ground and <b>only</b> <b>some</b> small particles (meteorites) eventually might have made it to Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (with female parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, <b>only</b> <b>some</b> bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in September 1945, Lieutenant-Colonel G. Archey of the British Military Administration {{took over}} Directorship of the Library and museum on 6 September. The Library only suffered minimal losses and damages {{during the three}} and a half years of Japanese Occupation, as the Japanese preserved the Library well due to its respected reputation in academia. Compared to other libraries in Malaya which lost nearly half of their collections, <b>only</b> <b>some</b> 500 reference books were looted according to a stocktake done after the war.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} was budgeted for two weeks of {{post-production}} photography, late 1976 saw three separate shoots for the final segment, but <b>only</b> <b>some</b> of this material was used. The narration that ends the film, featuring the joke about 'we all need the eggs', was conceived and recorded only two hours before a test screening.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened <b>only</b> <b>some</b> 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation exists between the sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but <b>only</b> <b>some</b> (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000–600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for <b>only</b> <b>some</b> 32,000 soldiers. On 1 August 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that in the {{original}} Akkadian, Ú-a-a-te is used to refer to the first names of both Yauta ibn Hazail (son of Hazael) and Uayte ben Birdadda (son of Birdadda). The latter is also sometimes referred to as Ia-u-ta- and in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal, the two spellings were confused, with both written Ú-a-a-te. The transliteration of the original Akkadian into English is highly unstable and <b>only</b> <b>some</b> of the alternate spellings appear in this article.|$|E

5|$|London possessed {{advanced}} fire-fighting {{technology in}} the form of fire engines, which had been used in earlier large-scale fires. However, unlike the useful firehooks, these large pumps had rarely proved flexible or functional enough to make much difference. <b>Only</b> <b>some</b> of them had wheels; others were mounted on wheelless sleds. They had to be brought a long way, tended to arrive too late, and had limited reach, with spouts but no delivery hoses.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thousands}} of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes, and the survival rate {{of works by}} the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has <b>only</b> <b>some</b> 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, {{but there are still}} anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.|$|E
5|$|Paint-like gels (which are {{dispensed}} from {{pipes and}} can be transported through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them. Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface, and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals. Only one type of gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time <b>only.</b> <b>Some</b> surfaces, such as grilles, cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or wash away gels, returning the surface or object to its normal state.|$|E

Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Fort Blakely {{happened}} {{six hours}} after Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox. In {{the course of}} the battle, Brigadier General St. John Richardson Liddell was captured and surrendered his men. Out of 4,000 soldiers originally, Liddell lost 3,400 that were captured in this battle. About 250 were killed and <b>only</b> <b>some</b> 200 men escaped. The successful Union assault can be attributed in large part to African-American forces.|$|E
