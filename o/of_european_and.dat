Almost 80,000 Texans claim African and European heritage, and make up 0.3 percent of the population. People <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> Native American heritage number over 108,800 (close {{to the number of}} Native Americans), and make up 0.5 percent of the population. People <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> Asian heritage number over 57,600, and form just 0.2 percent of the population. People of African and Native American heritage were even smaller in number (15,300), and make up just 0.1 percent of the total population.|$|E

5|$|The Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos {{are located}} in Santa Cruz {{department}} in eastern Bolivia. Six of these former missions (all now secular municipalities) collectively were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990.

5|$|Two other Chroogomphus {{species with}} a {{morphology}} and coloration similar to C.vinicolor include C.rutilus and C.ochraceous. C.vinicolor is most reliably distinguished from these {{on the basis}} of having thick-walled cystidia (up to 5–7.5μm at the widest part). The other two species have been separated {{on the basis of}} color, with C.ochraceous having brighter colors (yellowish-orange to ochraceous) than C.rutilus. Molecular analyses <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> North American collections suggest that C.rutilus is restricted to Europe, C.ochraceous only occurs in North America, and that cap coloration cannot be reliably used for species determination.|$|E
5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1899, the German {{government}} took formal control, establishing a protectorate. A treaty with Spain, signed on 30 July, ensured German control over several other island {{groups in the}} Pacific, and these {{were added to the}} protectorate of German New Guinea. The economic life of German New Guinea's small population <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> Asian settlers, {{as well as that of}} its Melanesian population, relied heavily on the export of copra and the import of goods and services. It remained a modest outpost, and by August 1914 only 1,273 Europeans lived in the colony, while there was also a small but significant number of Japanese, Chinese and Malays.|$|E
50|$|Indians in {{the north}} {{typically}} had prior experience <b>of</b> <b>Europeans,</b> <b>and</b> there was little conflict between {{the police and the}} native population. Police were not popular with the Indians, and often blamed for government policies. Few crimes committed.

Again, few crimes committed; informal justice (making up laws) used with Inuit.|$|R

5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as a defense of the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between civilization and barbarism mirrors Latin America's {{difficulties in the}} post-Independence era. Literary critic Sorensen Goodrich argues that although Sarmiento {{was not the first}} to articulate this dichotomy, he forged it into a powerful and prominent theme that would impact Latin American literature. He explores the issue of civilization versus the cruder aspects of a caudillo culture of brutality and absolute power. Facundo set forth an oppositional message that promoted a more beneficial alternative for society at large. Although Sarmiento advocated various changes, such as honest officials who understood enlightenment ideas <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> Classical origin, for him education was the key.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960) a focused {{effort was made to}} increase access to education and paid employment working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, ylang-ylang, coconut oil and coffee remain the principal economic activity of the region beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although mining is also a source of income.|$|E

5|$|When Cleveland {{took office}} {{he faced the}} {{question}} of Hawaiian annexation. In his first term, he had supported free trade with Hawai'i and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in Pearl Harbor. In the intervening four years, Honolulu businessmen <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>and</b> American ancestry had denounced Queen Liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government. In early 1893 they overthrew her, set up a republican government under Sanford B. Dole, and sought to join the United States. The Harrison administration had quickly agreed {{with representatives of the}} new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval. Five days after taking office on March 9, 1893, Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman James Henderson Blount to Hawai'i to investigate the conditions there.|$|E
