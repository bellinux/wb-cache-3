5|$|The 1925 {{draft plan}} for the {{establishment}} of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to be replaced by US41. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41 In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington. When the system was announced on November 11, 1926, US41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15. The <b>original</b> <b>map</b> showed US41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette, but the US41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.|$|E

The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The <b>original</b> <b>map</b> of the show's setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters' residence.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{trunkline}} highway designated {{along the path}} of the modern US41 was M-15, in use as far back as 1919. The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the US Highway System would have replaced M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to follow the route that US41 follows today. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been just US2. The next segment between Rapid River and Covington was planned as US102 while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was planned as US41. In between Powers and Covington, US41 was planned to follow US2 west to Iron Mountain and then route of the modern US141 between Powers and Covington.

Ye Sheng also recorded Yan Jie (嚴節)'s colophon to the map (1452). According to Yan Jie, the Guanglun Jiangli Tu was created in 1360.

500|$|Caroline Street, {{along with}} Margaret, William, Thomas, and Emma streets, were named for {{siblings}} of John Whitehead, who—in 1819—became stranded on Key West after a shipwreck and {{took note of}} the island's strategic geography. Whitehead's brother, William, surveyed the city of Key West in 1829. The <b>original</b> <b>map</b> from William Whitehead's survey shows the northwestern corner of the island, bounded by present-day Angela Street, designated as [...] "town plot". This plot was {{the only part of}} the island which had a grid-like pattern of streets: five running southwest to northeast, including the path of Caroline Street, at least a dozen oriented from southeast to northwest, and Front Street, which borders the extreme northwestern coast of the island. Therefore, Caroline was cleared by 1829 at the latest, making it among the oldest streets in either the city or the island of Key West. When it received its name, however, is unclear.|$|E

The Indian was added by the Frasers to the <b>original</b> <b>map</b> design concept endorsed by the OTMA. Swiatek and Breen noted that the Indian's [...] "position has been irreverently compared to that of a traffic policeman demanding 'Halt!'" [...] Such statements were made from the time of issue; The Numismatist in November 1926 stated that the Indian's left hand [...] "is upraised as if warning the people of the East of the perils and hardship of the Trail". Meeker's 1928 obituary in The New York Times averred that the Indian was [...] "standing with hands upraised to stop the white man's progress westward". The Native American wears a headdress, has a blanket and bow, and is superimposed on a map of the United States, with a line of Conestoga wagons heading west. The design is carried to the rim of the coin; Hudson Bay is visible in the upper right.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2001, the Marion E. Wade Center, {{formerly}} {{housed in}} Buswell Library, moved {{to its new}} purpose-built home. Established in 1965 by professor of English Clyde S.

2500|$|A few {{features}} of the map call for special mention. The scale to which the map purports to be drawn is 16⅞ inches to the Dutch mile, or 3⅝ inches to the English mile. This makes the distance from Beeren Island to Moenemin's Castle, which on the <b>original</b> <b>map</b> is equal to 67½ inches, exactly 4 Dutch miles, or the extent of territory allowed {{on one side of}} a navigable river by the [...] of the Charter of Freedoms and Exemptions. As a matter of fact, however, the distance between these two points is not 4 Dutch miles, or 18.44 English miles, but about 22½ miles, so that the actual scale of the map is only 3inches to the mile. The central and lower portions of the river are fairly accurately drawn, but the upper part is wrong. Especially puzzling is the wide creek designated as Renselaers Kill, which would seem to represent the Mohawk River but does not occupy the right position. Perhaps the most plausible explanation of this error is that the compiler, at about that point, joined two separate maps and, from his unfamiliarity with the topography of the locality, failed to connect the south branch of the Mohawk, indicated on the one map at the falls, with the outlet marked on the other map, and then, from some statement regarding the direction of the river, continued this outlet straight into the country. It will be noticed that of most creeks only the mouths are indicated and that of others, which are traced for some distance into the country, the direction bears as a rule no relation to the configuration of the ground, which was probably sketched in from some high point after the survey of the shore line and the islands had been completed. Up to 1636, but three farms existed in the colony. The castles faintly shown near the names of Godijns Burg, Renselaers Burg, De Laets Burg, etc. represent therefore no actual settlements, but merely indicate the places where the patroon intended that farms should be established. At the time the map was drawn, the land bought for the colony of Rensselaerswyck was almost entirely limited to that {{on the west side of}} the river; all that was owned on the east side was a small tract opposite Fort Orange. Curiously enough, the name Rensselaerswyck has been so placed as to cover exactly this territory belonging to the colony.|$|E
