500|$|Melua {{opened up}} about the {{breakdown}} years later {{in an interview with}} The Independent, saying that it ended up being {{one of the best things}} that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to squash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. [...] "....It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|Lori Grimes accuses Andrea of {{participating}} {{very little in}} household tasks. Kirkman avouched that since the initiation of the zombie apocalypse, many of the characters have reverted to traditional gender roles; [...] "Lori is really just aggravated over {{a lot of things}} and she's lashing out. She was serious and she wants Andrea to pull her weight; certain people are stuck with certain tasks and to a certain extent people are retreating back into traditional gender roles because of how this survival-crazy world seems to work. Lori has a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on so she's definitely going to be behaving somewhat irrationally at times as she tries to cope with the pregnancy and the conflict between Rick and Shane as well as dealing with the fact that Rick was out on the road again. She's going through a lot of stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{started the}} 1998–99 season in fine form, and claimed his first ever hat-trick in a 3–0 win over Port Vale at Vale Park on 22 August. Despite having {{recently}} signed a long-term contract, his form and goal record led to constant rumours {{of a big}} money move {{to a host of}} Premier League clubs. West Brom eventually issued a [...] "hands-off" [...] warning to other clubs. He claimed further hat-tricks against Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town, and finished the season with 32 goals in 45 games. This tally left him as the country's top-scorer. He was named on the PFA Team of the Year for the First Division. He then submitted a written transfer request, and his spokesman told the press that there have [...] "been a number <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on behind the scenes which have unsettled him recently". In particular, his £1,400 a week salary was compared with the £5,000 a week salary of under-performing teammate Fabian de Freitas.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on and he kind of lost focus. It’s not like Here I Stand wasn’t a good album. I just feel like he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers". The remix version featuring Plies made its way onto {{the internet in}} late November, {{a few days before the}} song's radio and digital release.|$|E
500|$|West {{collaborated with}} American film score {{composer}} Jon Brion, {{who served as}} the album's co-executive producer for several tracks. West had been exposed to Brion's work while watching the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, for which Brion had composed music. West was also listening to songs Brion had produced for When the Pawn..., the second studio album of alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple, another one of West's favorite musicians and sources of musical inspiration for the album. Although Brion had no prior experience in creating hip-hop records, he and West found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and vision to one specific genre. When questioned if his presence made Late Registration any less hip-hop, Brion replied, [...] "There are colors and ideas that make [...] different from average hip-hop, but Kanye is already different from the average hip-hop guy. He's got this sense of pop record-making which is really solid, and he likes tracks with a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on in them — which is not necessarily common for hip-hop. He was already barking up that tree. This is definitely not just a hip-hop album. But it is also by no means overtly arty, or non-hip-hop. I don't think it's a weird record by any means." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} [...] "Batman in Gotham" [...] design philosophy, Batman's {{arsenal of}} moves and actions were expanded. Although the team {{developed}} several ideas for new moves, gadgets and abilities, they only went forward with those that they felt would be authentic to Batman. They also chose to have Batman start the game {{with access to the}} gadgets unlocked in Arkham Asylum, to convey the impression that Batman is fully prepared for the inevitability <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> wrong in Arkham City. The studio reviewed the play and combat systems used in Arkham Asylum, and built the new moves as natural extensions of the existing system as a means to [...] "add even more depth and gameplay instead of changing them fundamentally". The number of animations were doubled to reflect the larger arsenal of moves at the player's disposal. The X-ray-like [...] "Detective Vision" [...] mode used to highlight certain objects in-game was redeveloped for Arkham City because it was considered to be too useful in Arkham Asylum, resulting in some players using it throughout almost the entire game; the visual effect also obscured the game's design aesthetic. One idea was to introduce a time limit on its use, but it was considered that Batman [...] "wouldn't make a gadget like that". Instead, the mode was designed to be difficult to use in certain situations such as obscuring navigational information, and combat where enemy strikes will blur the screen when [...] "Detective Vision" [...] is active. Rocksteady art director David Hego described the new [...] "Detective Vision" [...] as an [...] "augmented reality mode".|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think I {{shall have}} to give it a little {{publicity}} too,' said Woodhouse. 'We can't have this kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on, you know.' His face was set and quite white. Pallant's, on the other hand, was black, and I know that my very stomach had turned with rage. Ollyett was dum.|$|R

5000|$|... “We didn’t {{know what}} to call it, but it {{definitely}} wasn’t a rap record anymore. It had more of a dance kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> through it. And it {{had a little bit}} of techno to it. When we released it in 1984, the phrase ‘garage’ came out, then ‘house’ came out, and someone called it ‘The Granddaddy of all House Records’, so we knew we had something different and new.” ...|$|R
500|$|Ki reached number 26 on the Finnish Top 40 {{and number}} 179 on the French Top 200, and {{appeared}} on the UK Indie and UK Rock charts. It sold 800 copies in its first week of release in the United States, and debuted at number 69 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. Critical reception of the album was generally positive. Jon Wiederhorn of Revolver said the album is [...] "well worth a listen" [...] and praised the heavier tracks such as [...] "Disruptr" [...] and [...] "Heaven's End", saying, [...] "Townsend mostly contains his rage, but he's at his best when he loses it." [...] Martin Popoff of Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles found the album to have an [...] "odd identity", with [...] "all sorts <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on just under the surface" [...] that rewarded multiple listens. David E. Gehlke of Blistering was less impressed, and found the album inconsistent. Gehlke described [...] "Winter" [...] as [...] "lush and gorgeous", but felt that the album [...] "fails to hit the mark" [...] at other points, such as [...] "Ain't Never Gonna Win" [...] and [...] "Trainfire". Tyler Munro of Sputnikmusic said Ki showed Townsend [...] "at his loosest and most dynamic", and praised Townsend's and Dorval's vocals, but felt the album was held back by musical repetition and its extended guitar jams. Greg Prato of Allmusic gave the album a moderate review, admiring Townsend's unpredictability but feeling the album was not [...] "the most gripping or groundbreaking album" [...] in Townsend's collection. Daniel Cairns of Chronicles of Chaos praised Ki as [...] "a difficult, unusual collection of music" [...] that [...] "also might just be Townsend's best yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin {{said when}} it comes to Lisa and Phil, [...] "there's always going to be drama [...] there's going to be fireworks" [...] as Phil [...] "isn't Lisa’s {{favourite}} person" [...] and [...] "in true Lisa and Phil fashion, it will be quite explosive." [...] Lisa sees Phil as the person that [...] "triggers episodes <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> wrong for her" [...] and the one who has [...] "caused all of the problems going on her life", caused by him taking Louise away from her, that leads to her wariness around him as she knows [...] "what he’s capable of doing." [...] Benjamin believes Lisa and Phil will never [...] "be the best of friends or see eye-to-eye", but Louise should be the person they put first and be adults for. Lisa sees Sharon as [...] "the right woman for Phil" [...] and regards her as [...] "lovely", so she needs Sharon as an [...] "ally" [...] in order to help her relationship with Louise, but knows Sharon is [...] "no fool", who [...] "will stand her ground." [...] Benjamin added Lisa [...] "feels very guilty" [...] about leaving Louise and being excluded from her life, but her [...] "driving force is her unconditional love for her child", but has [...] "hard times ahead with Louise, explaining why she hasn’t been there. I think she just hopes her daughter will need her and see she’s better off having her mum in her life." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lemuel saw her wavering, and {{the wish}} to show 'Manda his {{superior}} power triumphed over every other interest and impulse in him. He got upon his feet. [...] "There is no use in this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on any longer. I came here because I thought I was wanted. If it's a mistake, it's easy enough to mend it, and it's easy not to make it again. I wish you good evening." ...|$|R

60|$|He sang {{this time}} as if nobody loved him. As a song, {{it was not a}} very pathetic song, being all about coons {{spooning}} in June under the moon, {{and so on and so}} forth, but Gussie handled it in such a sad, crushed way that there was genuine anguish in every line. By the time he reached the refrain I was nearly in tears. It seemed such a rotten sort of world with all that kind <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on in it.|$|R

6000|$|Prothero's {{interest}} in this question presently swamped his petty personal resentments. [...] "I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "one might have rather a lark with money like that.

You might run a tremendously revolutionary paper. A real upsetting paper. How many thousands is it?" ...|$|E
60|$|No wonder Lady Barbara was displeased; {{and that}} was the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> wrong--nay, worse than before the going to Bournemouth. Lady Barbara was seeking for a governess, but such a lady as she wished for was not to be found in a day; and in the meantime she was resolved to do her duty by her niece, and watched over her behaviour, and gave her all the lessons that she did not have from masters.|$|E

60|$|From {{where he}} stood, outside the barrier which {{separated}} {{visitors to the}} office from the workers within, Jimmy could see a vista of efficient-looking young men with paper protectors round their cuffs working away at mysterious jobs which seemed to involve {{the use of a}} great deal of paper. One in particular was so surrounded by it that he had the appearance of a bather in surf. Jimmy eyed these toilers with a comfortable and kindly eye. All this industry made him feel happy. He liked to think of this sort <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> <b>going</b> on all round him.|$|R
60|$|For the moment, {{it seemed}} as if the surging crowd {{streaming}} down must carry all before it; but the steadiness with which the 9th Soudanese moved into their place on the flank of the line, and the other regiments remained, as if on parade, soon reassured him. The terrible slaughter that was taking place in the ranks of the Dervishes soon showed that, in that quarter at least, there was no fear <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> wrong; but he could not but look anxiously towards the great mass of men approaching from the north.|$|E
6000|$|... "That I don't {{pretend to}} say. If I could see that, I should {{say it was}} a certainty, but I own the absence of motive is the weak point of my idea.

No doubt that idea must have occurred to yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{evening after}} the guinea cheque had been despatched, things were further brightened {{by the arrival}} of a letter of atrociously jellygraphed advices from Messrs. Danks and Wimborne. They all {{referred}} to resident vacancies for which Lewisham was manifestly unsuitable, nevertheless their arrival brought an encouraging assurance <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>going</b> on, of shifting and unstable places in the defences of the beleaguered world. Afterwards, with occasional endearments for Ethel, he set himself to a revision of his last year's note-books, for now the botany was finished, the advanced zoological course--the last lap, as it were, for the Forbes medal--was beginning. She got her best hat from the next room to make certain changes in the arrangement of its trimmings. She sat in the little chair, while Lewisham, with documents spread before him, sat at the table.|$|E
