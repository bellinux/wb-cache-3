A subsequent flyby of Pluto was impossible, because the close approach of Titan meant it was also on a trajectory that slingshotted it upwards out of the ecliptic.

50|$|The use {{of nuclear}} energy is a {{controversial}} issue in Dutch politics. The first commercial nuclear plant in the Netherlands, Dodewaard, was decommissioned in 1997 after only 28 years of service. This decision was taken {{against the background of}} political opposition to nuclear energy. In 1994, government and parliament decided to close down the Borssele plant as of 2004. However, due to legal action by owners and employees of the plant and changes in government policy in 2002, the decommissioning was delayed until 2013, meaning the plant would exactly fulfill its originally intended life span of 40 years. In recent years nuclear energy has become less controversial in the Netherlands and is increasingly viewed as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>possibilities</b> to reduce CO2 emissions and increase national energy self-reliance. As a result, the Dutch government decided in 2006 that Borssele would remain operational until 2033. In June 2006, the government made a contract ("Borssele-convenant") with the owners of the plant, Delta and Essent. Delta and Essent commit themselves to pay 250 Mio Euro into a 'fonds voor duurzame energie' (fund for the R&D of renewable energy) from their windfall profits being generated by the prolongation of the operating time.|$|E

50|$|The {{educational}} role of sparring is {{a matter}} of some debate. In any sparring match, precautions of some sort must be taken to protect the participants.

For example, if one were to always spar with heavily padded gloves, one might come to rely on techniques that risk breaking bones in one's hand. Many schools recognize this problem but value sparring nonetheless because it forces the student to improvise, to think under pressure, and to keep their emotions under control.|$|R

40|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> {{the main}} {{characteristics}} of a smart grid is the availability of large volumes of data, for example, gained from sensors. This data can be utilized {{as a tool to}} estimate the state of the system as a whole or any component within the system.

Furthermore, the future smart grid is expected to have high levels of reliability. This can be achieved by integrating the condition monitoring systems with maintenance management, wherein the focus is shifted from corrective maintenance to predictive condition-based maintenance. This chapter introduces the concept of reliability-centered asset management (RCAM). The RCAM approach provides the possibility of both qualitative and quantitative analysis toward optimal maintenance strategy. Furthermore, various issues with condition monitoring in smart grids have been discussed along with some literature that suggest possible solutions for these issues.
