5|$|Since the redevelopments to Celtic Park and Hampden Park were {{completed}} in the late 1990s, Ibrox has had the smallest capacity {{of the three major}} stadiums in Glasgow. Rangers have since explored <b>options</b> <b>to</b> increase capacity. After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland Stand. A report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three <b>options</b> <b>to</b> further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were shelved by October 2008, however, due to the late-2000s financial crisis.|$|E
