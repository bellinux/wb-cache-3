40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>charging</b> {{of electric}} <b>vehicles</b> with <b>charging</b> power of 3, 7 kW, in connection {{to an apartment}} building in Sweden. Also the power consumption of six electric vehicles are investigated. The charging-simulations of the electric vehicles were performed with the electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> model (Grahn-Munkhammar) in MatLab. To simulate general energy use for a housing complex, the measured energy consumption per year for a building with 24 apartments was used. Three different systems with charging over a year were simulated. One system included six different models of electric vehicles, another system included six Tesla model S and yet another one included six Mitsubishi Outlanders. The simulations of electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> resulted in a charging pattern with a considerable variability and an aggregation effect with a value over 20 % for all three systems. Results show that electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> adds to the power peaks of the apartment building. However, according to the model, the aggregation effect implies that effect values of total electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> were not harmful to an apartment building with a fuse of 63 A...|$|R

A cannopy will be added over the airport's roadways at the terminal building and the parking garage, that will better shelter passengers from the elements. It will also reduce maintenance costs associated with plowing, icing, and repairing the roadway. This includes solar pannels, ability to store rainwater, and colorful lighting for aesthetic purposes.|$|R
40|$|With an {{electrified}} passenger transportation fleet, {{carbon dioxide}} emissions could be reduced significantly depending on the electric power production mix. Increased electric power consumption due to electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> demands of electric vehicle fleets may be met by increased amount of renewable power production in the electrical systems. With electric vehicle fleets in the transportation system {{there is a need}} for establishing an electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure that distributes this power to the electric vehicles. Depending on the amount of electric vehicles in the system and the <b>charging</b> patterns, electric <b>vehicle</b> integration creates new quantities in the overall load profile that may increase the load peaks. The electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> patterns are stochastic since they are affected by the travel behavior of the driver and the charging opportunities which implies that an electric vehicle introduction also will affect load variations. Increased load variation and load peaks may create a need for upgrades in the grid infrastructure to reduce losses, risks for overloads or damaging of components. However, with well-designed incentives for electric vehicle users and electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging,</b> the electric <b>vehicles</b> may be used as flexible loads that can help mitigate load variations and load peaks in the power system. The aim with this doctoral thesis is to investigate and quantify the impact of electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> on load profiles and load variations. Three key factors are identified when considering the impact of electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> on load profiles and load variations. The key factors are: The charging moment, the charging need and the charging location. One of the conclusions in this thesis is that the level of details and the approach to model these key factors impact the estimations of the load profiles. The models that take into account a high level of mobility details will be able to create a realistic estimation of a future uncontrolled charging behavior, enabling for more accurate estimates of the impact on load profiles and the potential of individual charging strategies and external charging strategies. The thesis reviews and categorizes electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> models in previous research, and furthermore, introduces new electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> models to estimate the charging impact based on charging patterns induced by passenger car travel behavior. The models mainly consider EVC related to individual car travel behavior and induced charging needs for plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles. Moreover, the thesis comments on dynamic electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> along electrified roads and also on individual charging strategies. QC 20140924 </p...|$|R
