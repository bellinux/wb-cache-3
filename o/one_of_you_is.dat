500|$|On 9 October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot Yousafzai as {{she rode}} {{home on a}} bus after taking an exam in Pakistan's Swat Valley. The masked gunman shouted [...] "Which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> Malala? Speak up, {{otherwise}} I will shoot you all", and, on her being identified, shot at her. She was hit with one bullet, which went through her head, neck, and ended in her shoulder. Two other girls were also wounded in the shooting: Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan, {{both of whom were}} stable enough to speak to reporters and provide details of the attack.|$|E
2500|$|Whichever <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> {{elected in}} November [...] you {{mentioned}} those three electoral votes in Wyoming and how critical they've {{turned out to}} be. But what they're a sign of also is that you're going to inherit a very deeply divided electorate, economically, politically, you name it. How will you set out, Mr. Vice President, {{in a way that}} you weren't able to in these past four years, to bridge that divide? ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{boarded the}} shuttlecraft. The shuttle ride {{began with a}} battle between the Enterprise and Klingon vessels. The shuttle then {{returned}} through the temporal rift to present-day Las Vegas. The shuttle landed at the Las Vegas Hilton {{right next to the}} [...] "motion simulators" [...] shuttles the visitors were originally waiting to enter when they were [...] "beamed off" [...] {{at the start of the}} story. Captain Picard thanked the crew for restoring his existence. He said, [...] "While only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> my ancestor, each of you hold that same opportunity for the future. Guard it well." [...] Typically a custodian led the group to an elevator and then out to the Deep Space Nine Promenade and Quark's Bar. When the custodian led the group to the elevator, there was a television set which showed a [...] "news" [...] report where the military mentions that the shuttles over Las Vegas were weather balloons.|$|E
6000|$|... "I noticed yesterday, when Jessie and I <b>were</b> playing tennis, <b>you</b> fellows <b>were</b> so busy {{talking to}} the girls you forgot all about your games," [...] {{retorted}} Dave. [...] "And <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> spouting poetry, about 'eyes divine,' or something like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, this'll do," [...] she said, calmly. [...] "I {{just thought}} I'd call {{and put it}} up to you. I guess <b>you</b> people <b>are</b> all right. But a girl has feelings, you know. I've heard <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> a Southerner--I wonder which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> it is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{my belief}} that no decent gentleman in Exeter would look at you again if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to go and live among them at Nuncombe Putney while all this is going on. No, no. Let <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> saved out <b>of</b> it, at least." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lamont Shadowskeedeeboomboom {{returned}} in Mad #14 (August 1954) to guest-star in [...] "Manduck the Magician", a spoof by Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder of the Mandrake the Magician comic strip. In this story, Lamont Shadowskeedeeboomboom lures Manduck and Loathar {{to his home}} on the pretense of wanting to buy 100 cases of Manduck's snake oil; in reality, he has learned that Manduck also has [...] "the secret power to cloud men's minds, and {{so in order to}} keep [...] secret exclusive", he intends to destroy Manduck. A battle of hypnotic gesturing ensues, during which Loathar somehow also has the power. Each character turns himself or {{one or two of the}} others into one of the other characters, culminating in three Manducks who all gesture hypnotically, causing a massive explosion that leaves only one Manduck who may or may not be the real one. Manduck's girlfriend, Narda, declares that whomever he really is, [...] "Only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> dear to my heart and that one is... the one with the most loot!" [...] This story was reprinted in Mad Strikes Back! (ibooks, New York, 2002, [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|The Quran {{accepts the}} {{distinction}} between slave and free {{as part of the}} natural order and uses this distinction as an example of God's grace, regarding this discrimination between human beings as in accordance with the divinely established order of things. [...] "The Qur'an, however, does not consider slaves to be mere chattel; their humanity is directly addressed in references to their beliefs, their desire for manumission and their feelings about being forced into prostitution. In one case, the Qur'an refers to master and slave with the same word, rajul. Later interpreters presume slaves to be spiritual equals of free Muslims. For example, verse 4:25 urges believers to marry 'believing maids that your right hands own' and then states: [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> as the other," [...] which the Jalaalayn interpret as [...] "You and they are equal in faith, so do not refrain from marrying them." [...] The human aspect of slaves is further reinforced by reference to them as members of the private household, sometimes along with wives or children. Pious exhortations from jurists to free men to address their slaves by such euphemistic terms as [...] "my boy" [...] and [...] "my girl" [...] stemmed from the belief that God, not their masters, was responsible for the slave's status.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to ask}} {{you three}} young gents a few questions," [...] said he, as the boys came up. [...] "Fust, which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> Richard Rover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you came}} over, the two <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> and hunted up the girl. The idea <b>was</b> that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> to marry her, {{and the other}} have {{a share of the}} plunder. For some reason, Woodley was chosen as the husband. Why was that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was {{there ever}} sech a wedding journey!" [...] said Polly Ann, {{as we sat}} about the fire, for the {{mountain}} air was chill. [...] "And Tom and Davy as grave as parsons. Ye'd guess <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> Rutherford himself, and the other Mr. Boone." ...|$|R
2500|$|Since Saide Barre and his {{followers}} had a deep hatred towards Oromo, he asked the captured which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> Christian and which are Muslim. The Muslim Oromo refused to differentiate themselves from fellow Oromo (OLF is Secular), as a result all were executed and thrown in a mass grave April 15, 1980. The day is now commemorated by Oromos as Guyyaa Goota Oromo/Oromo Hero's Day.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Catch you forgetting anything!' exclaimed Carker, still {{turning over}} his papers. 'If Mr Paul {{inherits}} your memory, he'll be a troublesome customer in the House. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> enough.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, oh; so <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> {{father of}} the lad who brought the donkey, and the other the owner of it; and you neither of you knew {{what was in the}} kishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Each <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> clearly {{entitled}} {{to one hundred}} pounds a year by common law": such had been the important whisper made by Finney into the ears of Abel Handy, and by him retailed to his eleven brethren.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O kings!' she said, turning towards them, 'if <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> killed to-day, {{the rest}} would fly; {{but this man}} put his trust in me, and had his head cut off three times. Because he has done this, I will marry him rather than <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> who have come hither to wed me, for many kings here sought to free me from the spells, but none could do it save Ian the fisher's son.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And which <b>of</b> <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> {{staying here}} along with her, dears?" [...] said Matilda. [...] "She'll <b>be</b> wanting <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> with her, any ways." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "War!" [...] cried Father Knickerbocker, {{rising to}} his full height, stern and majestic and {{shouting}} in a stentorian tone that echoed through the great room. [...] "War! War! To your places, every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you!</b> <b>Be</b> done with your idle luxury! Out with the glare of your lights! Begone you painted women and worthless men! To your places every man <b>of</b> <b>you!</b> To the Battery! Man the guns! Stand to it, every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> for the defence of America--for our New York, New York--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then the Eldest Magician {{stood up}} and shouted, 'Ho! beasts, birds, and fishes, that I took between my hands at the Very Beginning and taught the play that you should play, which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> playing with the Sea?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My plot {{has worked}} well. Already <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> dead, {{and for you}} a fate is {{reserved}} that is worse than death. You are henceforth a penniless outcast, left at forty-two to the tender mercies of the wide world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll explain," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "One of {{you don't}} need any explanation, {{but this is}} for the other one. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> Wade Williams of Chatham County, Kentucky. You murdered your wife on May 5, two years ago, after ill-treating and abusing her {{continually}} for five years. I have the proper papers in my pocket for taking you back with me, and you are going. We will return on the fruit steamer that comes back by this island to-morrow to leave its inspectors. I acknowledge, gentlemen, that I'm not quite sure which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> Williams. But Wade Williams goes back to Chatham County to-morrow. I want you to understand that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he said. [...] "I {{presume that}} your visit this morning <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> courtesy. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> acquainted with Mr. Fielding?" ...|$|R
6000|$|SMITHERTON. [...] "You <b>are</b> all mad--every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> I <b>am</b> as {{positive}} that yesterday was Sunday as I am that I sit upon this chair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I sprained {{my ankle}} the day I {{followed}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> boys--that <b>is,</b> I {{suppose it was}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> your crowd. I mean the chap who fell over the cliff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> wrong, and you'd better rest easy, for you won't {{find out}} {{the best part of}} it, try as you may." [...] And Mrs. Pecq {{actually}} chuckled as she, too, worked away at some bits of muslin, with her back turned to the very unsocial-looking group.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If you {{had said}} you were {{in no mood for}} talking before, I should perhaps have been in no mood for lighting,' said the voice. 'Hows'ever as it's the poor horse that's damaged and not you, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> welcome to the light at all events--but it's not the crusty one.' ...|$|E
60|$|In a Word, this Opera of the Cloven-Foot {{has been}} acted {{all over the}} Christian World, ever since Judas betray'd the Son of God with a Kiss; nay, our Saviour says expresly of him, <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> a Devil; and the sacred Text says in another Place, The Devil enter'd into Judas.|$|E
6000|$|... "If ever I get {{the chance}} to have <b>you</b> tried, every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>be</b> hung for mutiny and murder!" [...] cried Captain Blossom, and then fired in return.|$|R
30|$|Family meals {{were defined}} for the {{participants}} as “a meal where you sat down with your child (the one in the study with <b>you)</b> and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> eating, regardless <b>of</b> what type of food was served.” We defined family meals this way because we hypothesized {{that it is not}} the act of eating that provided the potentially protective effect of family meals, rather it is the time that parents and children spend together. Therefore, it was less important that everyone at the meal ate something.|$|R
5000|$|Her book, Lace, was {{published}} by Simon & Schuster and {{is reported to be}} the original source for the marketing tag line, [...] "Which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> bitches <b>is</b> my mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now,' said she, 'everybody {{is to keep}} eyes to the front. I {{am going}} to be very busy back here for a few minutes, but not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> to peek. I shall know if you do, and I shall see to it that you never forget it as long as you live.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] I said. [...] "People are ruined every day, but there's no use {{making a}} fuss about it. Let me {{inform you that}} this ground on which you walk is my ground, and that the sooner you take {{yourself}} off it the better pleased I shall be. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> quite trouble enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{commented on}} their {{dialogue}} severely. [...] "See how you all treat {{an event that}} is wonderful enough to convulse the National Academy of Science. I {{do not believe the}} psychic's hands have moved an inch, and yet, unless some <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> false to his trust, the miraculous has happened--Are you there, 'Wilbur?'" [...] I queried of the mystic presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that," [...] he said, [...] "for he who lies at the hospital, {{providing}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not he, or he you, maintains as sturdily as do <b>you</b> that he <b>is</b> not Leopold.

60|$|Charlie Ward. No; but that's {{the very}} thing, you're not <b>one</b> <b>of</b> ourselves. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> not {{born on the}} road, reared on the road, married on the road like us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then put {{the ship}} about and steer there yourself," [...] said Lozelle, [...] "and I promise you this, that {{within two hours}} every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> dead {{at the bottom of}} the sea." ...|$|R
