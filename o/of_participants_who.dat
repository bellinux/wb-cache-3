Because the pseudo-groups were isolated from coordination effects (since the participant's confederates did not physically pull the rope), Ingham proved that communication alone did not account for the effort decrease, and that motivational losses were the more likely cause of the performance decline.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{movement}} tasks of judo throwing techniques in instructing novices. Participants were 28 high school students who attended judo classes. The l 9 movement tasks were selected to analyze from integral parts of throwing techniques: ouchi-gari,tai-otoshi, seoi-nage, and harai-goshi. Visual instructions proceeded about movement processes of throwing techniques in the first class and about each movement tasks of throwing techniques in the 2 nd class followed by the practices <b>of</b> throwing techniques. <b>Participants</b> were evaluated whether their performances of the movements were correct or not in practices of throwing techniques. Binomial tests were conducted and the results demonstrated as follows. The number <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> performed correctly was more than that <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> performed incorrectly in l 2 movement tasks. This indicated that novices would not have difficulty learning the skills of these movements and visual instruction would be effective in improving them.

25|$|To {{return to}} the Original Imitation Game, he states only that player A is to be {{replaced}} with a machine, not that player C is to {{be made aware of}} this replacement. When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation. As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test. An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> knew and did not know about computers being involved.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Home Office {{issued a}} report on {{research}} examining the level {{and nature of the}} use of khat by Somalis in four English cities; Birmingham, Bristol, London and Sheffield. It found that 38 per cent of the respondents had ever used khat in their lifetime, with 58 per cent of men and only 16 per cent of women reporting having ever used it. 34 per cent of the overall sample indicated that they had chewed khat the month before, with 51 per cent all men in the study and 14 per cent of the women having done so. Some reported family tensions arising from their khat use. 49 per cent of those surveyed were in favour of banning khat, with 35 opposed, but the report suggested that this would not be effective. Three quarters <b>of</b> <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> had used khat reported having suffered health effects, although these were mostly mild in nature, with the most common symptoms respondents associated with khat use being sleeping difficulties, loss of appetite, and an urge to chew more khat. The study concluded that most of the participants who were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. In January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs also again cited insufficient evidence that the plant caused serious health or societal problems to warrant governmental control.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{construct}} of forgiveness within the context of a reversal theory framework. A sample of 262 undergraduate students, ranging in age from 18 to 25 years and including 122 males and 140 females, completed the Motivational Style Profile (MSP), the Enright Forgiveness Inventory (EFI), the Willingness to Forgive Scale (WFS), and a Time-Factor Questionnaire (TFQ) that was designed for this study. The forgiveness ratings <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> achieved high-dominance in arousal-avoidance were compared to those <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> achieved high-dominance in arousal-seeking. Similarly, the forgiveness ratings <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> achieved high-dominance in autic sympathy were compared to those <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> <b>who</b> achieved high-dominance in autic mastery. Despite differential expectations, there were no significant differences between these groups on the measures of forgiveness. Numerous conceptual and methodological factors that might account for the findings were identified. With respect to the methodological issues pertaining to the MSP, the high inter-correlations between the MSP subscales rendered it difficult to identify distinct factors. There were also methodological concerns related to the measures that were used to assess forgiveness. For example, the number <b>of</b> times <b>participants</b> selected forgiveness solutions as problem-solving strategies on each of the WFS subscales was too low to be useful. The one robust finding in this study came from the addition of the TFQ, which added the dimension of time to the WFS scenarios. The participants consistently indicated that they would be increasingly likely to forgive with the passage of time. Dept. of Psychology.
