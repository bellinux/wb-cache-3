5|$|The {{causes of}} vampiric {{generation}} were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly {{a dog or}} a cat, was feared {{to become one of}} the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, <b>or</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} many {{governmental}} and nongovernmental efforts to reduce poverty and its effects. These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus. They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, people who are autistic, immigrants, <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> are homeless. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as advocacy, education, social work, legislation, direct service or charity, and community organizing.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} {{that a person is}} fearful of social {{encounters}} with unfamiliar others, some people may experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending {{on the nature of the}} antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety.

25|$|Cousin {{marriage}} is marriage between cousins (i.e. people with common grandparents <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> share other fairly recent ancestors). Opinions and practice vary widely across the world. In some cultures and communities, cousin {{marriage is}} considered ideal and actively encouraged; in others, it {{is subject to}} social stigma. Cousin marriage is common in the Middle East, for instance, where it accounts for over half of all marriages in some countries. In some countries outside that region, it is uncommon but still legal. In others, {{it is seen as}} incestuous and is legally prohibited: it is banned in China and Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, and 24 of the 50 United States. Supporters of cousin marriage where it is banned may view the prohibition as discrimination, while opponents may appeal to moral or other arguments. Worldwide, more than 10% of marriages are between first or second cousins.|$|E
25|$|As Tsubasa is {{connected}} with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar. Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style {{which leads to the}} characters have longer limbs. Another similarity between both the series is the use of one-eyed characters <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> lost their sight, which is meant to express the feelings from them. The characters of Fai D. Flowright and Kurogane were created in order to have adult characters who would side with Syaoran, who was much younger and was still in development during the series' start. As a result of the manga being aimed at young male demographic, characters are designed to appeal of them such as Syaoran who appears as an action hero. In order to make fights more entertaining Clamp decided to include yells of fighting techniques {{for the first time in}} a manga of them. Although Kurogane was the only character who did this at first, the authors also planned to make Syaoran do this.|$|E

25|$|Infection in {{otherwise}} healthy adults {{tends to be}} more severe. Treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g. acyclovir or valacyclovir) is generally advised, {{as long as it is}} started within 24–48 hours from rash onset. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. Antiviral medicines do not kill the virus but stop it from multiplying. Adults are advised to increase water intake to reduce dehydration and to relieve headaches. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are recommended, as they are effective in relieving itching and other symptoms such as fever or pains. Antihistamines relieve itching and may be used in cases where the itching prevents sleep, because they also act as a sedative. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those adults who are more prone to develop complications. These include pregnant women <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have a weakened immune system.|$|E
25|$|The tourism {{has been}} a mixed blessing for the {{historic}} center as commercial establishments open, helping the economy, but also push residents out. In the historic center, there are over 860 retail businesses, mostly restaurants, about 200 of which were established {{in the last five}} years. Residents attribute the growth to Mexico City’s promotion of the area tourism in general as well as the opening of commercial centers in the borough. While the growing business helps the economy, resident groups fear that the area will lose its current character, as many businesses are opening in formerly residential buildings, with questionable legal basis. Currently, most of the borough, especially in historic center, is residential with older adults. Property prices are high, leading to sales not to new families but rather to larger commercial interests, squeezing out smaller businesses along with residents. Neighborhood groups have formed to confront the changes and preserve the historic value of the area. Another serious problem for the area is the traffic jams and serious lack of parking in the historic center. The quantity of cars and the lack of traffic patrols have meant the proliferation of “franeleros” <b>or</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> illegally take possession of public areas such as streets to charge for parking.|$|E

Because the existence of two portable shrines in one area would cause conflict among gods, Takushiki sent Shizune to another region as a child. The foreign gods and their creatures from that region, mononokes, followed Shizune into Izuna's homeland.|$|E
