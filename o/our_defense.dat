For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate <b>our</b> <b>defense</b> we wish to remember this first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

40|$|Tor is {{susceptible}} to traffic correlation attacks in which an adversary who observes flows entering and leaving the anonymity network can apply statistical techniques to correlate flows and de-anonymize their endpoints. While an adversary may not be naturally positioned to conduct such attacks, a recent study shows that the Internet’s control-plane can be manipulated to increase an adversary’s view of the network, and consequently, improve its ability to perform traffic correlation. This paper explores, in-depth, the effects of control-plane attacks on {{the security of the}} Tor network. Using accurate models of the live Tor network, we quantify Tor’s susceptibility to these attacks by measuring the fraction of the Tor network that is vulnerable and the advantage to the adversary of performing the attacks. We further propose defense mechanisms that protect Tor users from manipulations at the control-plane. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that by leveraging existing trust anchors in Tor, defenses deployed only in the data-plane are sufficient to detect most control-plane attacks. <b>Our</b> <b>defenses</b> do not assume the active participation of Internet Service Providers, and require only very small changes to Tor. We show that <b>our</b> <b>defenses</b> result in a more than tenfold decrease in the effectiveness of certain control-plane attacks...|$|R

You have to make a judgment on how much is enough." [...] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary to national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.|$|E

40|$|Rowhammer is a {{hardware}} bug {{that can be}} exploited to implement privilege escalation and remote code execution attacks. Previous proposals on rowhammer mitigation either require hardware changes or follow heuristic-based approaches (based on CPU performance counters). To date, there exists no instant protection against rowhammer attacks on legacy systems. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of two practical and efficient software-only defenses against rowhammer attacks. <b>Our</b> <b>defenses</b> prevent the attacker from leveraging rowhammer to corrupt physically co-located data in memory that is owned by a different system entity. <b>Our</b> first <b>defense,</b> B-CATT, extends the system bootloader to disable vulnerable physical memory. B-CATT is highly practical, does not require changes to the operating system, and can be deployed on virtually all x 86 -based systems. While B-CATT is able to stop all known rowhammer attacks, it does not yet tackle the fundamental problem of missing memory isolation in physical memory. To address this problem, we introduce <b>our</b> second <b>defense</b> G-CATT, a generic solution that extends the physical memory allocator of the OS to physically isolate the memory of different system entities (e. g., kernel and user space). As proof of concept, we implemented B-CATT on x 86, and <b>our</b> generic <b>defense,</b> G-CATT, on x 86 and ARM to mitigate rowhammer-based kernel exploits. Our extensive evaluation shows that both mitigation schemes (i) can stop available real- world rowhammer attacks, (ii) impose virtually no run-time overhead for common user and kernel benchmarks as well as commonly used applications, and (iii) do not affect {{the stability of the}} overall system.

2500|$|The {{automatic}} cuts of $1.2 trillion {{resulting from}} {{the absence of a}} deal from the supercommittee over ten years would be split equally between security and non-security programs, and include $500 billion in cuts to the Department of Defense. [...] The FY2013 defense budget would be reduced 11%, from $525 billion to $472 billion, after already having been cut from $571 billion in the first installment of cuts in the Budget Control Act. [...] Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta initially gave the total cut figure as 23%. [...] The planned cuts include reductions in troop levels, a modest limit in pay raises for soldiers starting in 2015, an increase in health fees for veterans, delays in the construction of new naval ships and in the purchasing of new fighter aircraft such as the F-35, and the possibility of a round of base closings within the United States, but cuts to special operations, cyberwarfare, and intelligence programs were avoided. [...] Initial reports had also suggested that the number of carrier battle groups might be reduced from 11 to 10, although it was later determined that the number of aircraft carriers would not in fact be cut. [...] Some Republicans in Congress advocated reversing the cuts to the military, citing the effect on national security, and Secretary Panetta has opposed the cuts, calling them [...] "devastating" [...] and raising [...] "substantial risk {{of not being able to}} meet <b>our</b> <b>defense</b> needs." [...] President Obama has promised to veto any legislation seeking to avoid the cuts, and House Speaker John Boehner also indicated his commitment to following the cuts in the Budget Control Act. According to the Center for American Progress, several Presidents have significantly reduced defense spending after wars, without compromising national security. Defense spending in 2011 remained high by historical standards, adjusted for inflation.|$|E

Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint against Chris Broad with the International Cricket Council on 9 March 2009. Ijaz Butt, the head of Pakistan Cricket Board accused Broad of lying.
