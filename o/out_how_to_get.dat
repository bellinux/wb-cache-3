Intelligence is required for robots to handle tasks such as object manipulation and navigation, with sub-problems such as localization, mapping, and motion planning. These systems require that an agent is able to: Be spatially cognizant of its surroundings, learn from and build a map of its environment, figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from one point in space to another, and execute that movement (which often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object).|$|E

500|$|It was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode to be written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, [...] "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy {{a long time to}} figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the life he was living, and I {{think a lot of people}} feel like that."

500|$|The {{character}} Tom Haverford also undergoes {{changes during}} the final episodes of the season, in which the character begins to consider leaving his city hall position to pursue his own business ambitions. The storyline is advanced particularly strongly in [...] "The Bubble", when Tom becomes frustrated with an assignment by Chris, and culminates in the season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian", in which he ultimately quits the parks department to form an entertainment company. [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] ends with several cliffhanger twists including Tom's departure from city hall, Leslie being approached to run for office, {{and the arrival of}} Ron's first ex-wife Tammy, although the actress who will play her was not revealed. Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, but the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet when the episodes broadcast.

Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then you have all summer to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> yourself out of it".

A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot take no for an answer, so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight gets Stanley to the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him back upstairs.|$|E
500|$|... "Simpson Tide" [...] {{was one of}} two season nine episodes {{that was}} {{executive}} produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who together were the showrunners for the third and fourth seasons. Although Jean would later return to run the show the following season, it was the last episode that Reiss received an executive producer credit for. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, the episode writers, were working on Jean and Reiss's show The Critic at the time, and pitched an episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserve. Although the episode is partly based on the film Crimson Tide, the original episode pitch was made before the film was released. After the release of the film, the writers decided to start incorporating things from the movie in the script. In the original draft, Bart sneaked on board the submarine with Homer. They were trying to do it [...] "for the comedy of it", but could not get the draft to work, so it was cut. It was difficult for them to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the captain off of the sub and they eventually decided to have him shot out of the torpedo tube, which in the DVD commentary, Al Jean says that Steiger claimed that he really did get stuck in a torpedo tube once.|$|E
500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us out of here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E

[...] Peter Travers gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, calling attention to Anderson's [...] "deadpan comic brilliance" [...] and writing that [...] "Smith nails the obsessive verbal wrangling of smart, stalled twentysomethings who can't figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their ideas into motion." ...|$|E

When asked about how challenging it was to keep Diana in the dark he said [...] "Very challenging because I didn’t want to cheat. I had to storyboard all of it just to make sure that she was truly a silhouette. At first I was working with a storyboard artist. He would draw her with a rim light on her and I was like, “No, we can’t shoot it like that because that’s cheating.” So I had to do my own storyboards and really figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> we could always keep her as a true silhouette. When she grabs Bret, I had to think about, “If he uses his flashlight like this to bang on the handle, if she grabs him when he’s up here, then the flashlight is pointed backwards creating a silhouette so that she can actually grab him.” It was really hard <b>to</b> figure <b>out</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her on film."

Theoretically, it should have been the easiest of tasks, but in practice there were plenty of obstacles to success. He tried the lower windows, but they were firmly fixed. There had been a time when one of them would yield to a hard kick and fly bodily out of its frame, but somebody had been caught playing that game not long before, and Jim remembered with a pang that not only had the window been securely fastened up, but the culprit had had a spell of extra tuition and other punishments which had turned him for the time into a hater of his species. His own fate, he knew, would be even worse, for a prefect is supposed to have something better to do in his spare time than breaking into pavilions. It would mean expulsion perhaps, or, at the least, the loss of his prefect's cap, and Jim did not want to lose that. Still the thing had to be done if he meant to score any marks at all in the forthcoming exam. He wavered a while between a choice of methods, and finally fixed on the crudest of all. No one was likely to be within earshot, thought he, so he picked up the largest stone he could find, took as careful aim as the dim light would allow, and hove it. There was a sickening crash, loud enough, he thought, to bring the whole School down on him, followed by a prolonged rattle as the broken pieces of glass fell to the ground.|$|R

40|$|Economics is {{the means}} by which a culture is allowed to express its values. Space {{exploration}} and colonization of the planets has been assumed only fundable by governments, or rich individuals governments. However, by a judicious program of leveraging skills and human networks, it is possible to develop the resources necessary over a 20 to 30 year period. This paper discusses the approach of looking at activist groups for interplanetary exploration and colonization from the perspective of economic development theory. The development of an economic infrastructure for the Mars Society group is also crucial for its long-term viability. While tremendous technical work has been done that lays <b>out</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Mars, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> terraform it, and some minor economic analyses have been done of businesses that could potentially result, we need to fill in a gap – how do we get from where we are now to a colony which is self sustaining? Money. How do we create it? BACKGROUND I have a long-standing interest in space colonization, starting from an assumption in childhood that I would be traveling to Mars and the Moon as a matter of course. But also, in my life I became affected by the huge problems of human lives in much of the world here on Earth. Two years ago I started a private company (my third) with the mission of country development in the former USSR. For over 5 years I have been active with plans for economic development in an effort to contribute in some way to alleviating the human suffering that is attendant on such economic collapse as occurred in the USSR {{at the time of its}} breakup. I have wrestled very directly with the issues regarding <b>how</b> <b>to</b> actually help groups of people effectively. This is not a simple matter, and it is one that has become visibly more complex over the 2 years I have spent operating a company with development goals that employs people in that region. Economics rests on a foundation of social bonds and politics – facts not as well appreciate by many Americans, living as we do in a milieu that is sound on both counts...|$|R
