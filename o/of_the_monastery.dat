5|$|Symeon {{was born}} into the Byzantine nobility and given a {{traditional}} education. At age fourteen he met Symeon the Studite, a renowned monk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Monastery</b> of Stoudios in Constantinople, who convinced him to give his own life to prayer and asceticism under the elder Symeon's guidance. By {{the time he was}} thirty, Symeon the New Theologian became the abbot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Monastery</b> of St. Mammas, a position he held for twenty-five years. He attracted many monks and clergy with his reputation for sanctity, though his teachings brought him into conflict with church authorities, who would eventually send him into exile. His most well known disciple was Nicetas Stethatos who wrote the Life of Symeon.|$|E
5|$|The islet in {{the left}} foreground, today known as Riddarholmen ("Knights' Islet"), was during the medieval era known as Gråmunkeholmen ("Greyfriars Islet") after the Franciscan monastery located there and in the {{painting}} represented as a building with stepped gables and a tall turret {{at the far side}} of the islet. Together with other similar institutions, the monastery was closed by the king following the Reformation although the building was used as a hospital until the mid 16th century. The turret <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> was replaced by the cast iron spire of Riddarholm Church in the 19th century, but the remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> still exist inside the church and under the surrounding buildings.|$|E

5|$|A {{new church}} was needed because the old church needed {{significant}} repair {{and also because}} the growth of Brynsiencyn meant that more people lived there than in Llanidan itself.

5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monastery,</b> who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monastery.</b>|$|E

5|$|Claudius was a heretic in {{the view}} of Dungal and Jonas of Orléans, who later wrote to refute some of his teachings {{at the request of the}} emperor.

He was dead by the time Dungal finished his Responsa contra peruersas Claudii Taurinensis episcopi sententias late in 827, so it can be presumed that he died that year.|$|E

5|$|In 1308, King Denis {{granted a}} charter, the Foral, giving the royal land to 54 {{families}} of Varzim; these had {{to found a}} municipality known as Póvoa around Praça Velha, siding Varzim Old Town, controlled by the knights. In 1312, King Denis donated Póvoa to his bastard son, Afonso Sanches, Lord of Albuquerque, who included it in the patrimony <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Monastery</b> of Santa Clara, which he had just founded in Vila do Conde. In 1367, King Ferdinand I confirmed the charters, privileges and uses of Póvoa de Varzim. These were again confirmed by John I in 1387. But the domain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>monastery</b> over the town grew stronger and the people asked King Manuel I to end the situation. In 1514, during the era of charter reform, the King granted a new charter to Póvoa de Varzim. Besides the town hall and square, the town gained a pillory, granted significant self-government, and involved itself in the Portuguese discoveries.|$|E
