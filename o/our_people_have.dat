And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> had.|$|E

25|$|We, the Hebrews, {{descendants}} of the ancient Hebrew nation, who remained alive on God's earth despite that great calamity that <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> experienced, have come together in the Hebrew Committee of National Liberation. The Jews today {{who live in the}} European hell together with the Jews in the Land of Israel constitute the Hebrew nation—there isn't another nation to which they owe their allegiance but the Hebrew nation. We must state it clearly: the Jews in the United States do not belong to the Hebrew nation. These Jews are Americans of Hebrew descent.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then we {{came out}} again. Twenty-three of <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been killed, and eight carried off; at least, we cannot find the bodies. The white officer {{and one of his}} {{soldiers}} have gone, also." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 438, The Empress Eudocia {{removed the}} ban on Jews' praying at the Temple site and {{the heads of the}} Community in Galilee issued a call [...] "to the great and mighty people of the Jews": [...] "Know {{that the end of the}} exile of <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>has</b> come"! ...|$|R
2500|$|Admiral Jonathon Band said, [...] "I {{would not}} agree at all {{that it was not}} our finest hour.

[...] It was also stated during the conference that although all British armed forces personnel receive training in what to do in the event of being captured, only that for pilots and special forces personnel specifically included training in hostage scenarios, {{and that there was no}} equivalent of the US [...] "Code of the U.S. Fighting Force".|$|E
2500|$|... "The city is {{stagnant}} {{and only}} very slowly are people {{coming out of}} hiding. I shall soon begin some punitive measures on Boxers. China seems a ruined country. We may all have to leave. Our people from {{the country and the}} region of Shantung come with horrible stories of Boxer cruelties. Our churches are simply wiped out. Only a small remnant will remain. We must reconstruct as best we can. We find buried silver in good quantities and plenty of grain, so that <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> plenty to eat and to wear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Monument of Justice Radha Binod Pal: This newer {{monument}} {{was erected}} at Yasukuni Shrine in 2005. It honours Indian Bengali judge Radha Binod Pal, the lone justice on the International Military Tribunal for the Far East's trials of Japanese war crimes committed during World War II {{to find all}} the defendants not guilty. On April 29, 2005, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told his counterpart Koizumi Junichiro that [...] "the dissenting judgement of Justice Radha Binod Pal is well-known to the Japanese people and will always symbolise the affection and regard <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> for your country." ...|$|E

60|$|When we were {{come to the}} Penny ferry our consort had {{discharged}} her cargo, {{and there}} were forty or fifty men, I should say, engaged in driving the sheep and transporting the grain out of harm's way, for, save as to a few sentinels, <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> no force stationed at that place.|$|R
60|$|However, no {{explanation}} {{of such a}} system can make it seem quite rational {{to a person who}} has been used to a more rational system.

2500|$|Traditionally, the {{leadership}} was grouped with each family having a siy̓ám̓, which loosely translates as [...] "highly respected person". [...] This person would {{act in the}} best interest of his family and make decisions based on the group consensus of the family he represented. The siy̓ám̓ has been described as [...] "...the best talker – not chairman, (<b>our</b> <b>people)</b> <b>have</b> no chairman – but man who says the most wise things". The siy̓ám̓ was usually chosen by factors which included his status and respect within the community, the village and other indigenous nations, and how much he exemplified the characteristics of a noble person, such as humility, respect, generosity, and wisdom.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the twentieth}} Zionist Congress, held in Zurich in August 1937, the Peel Commission's plan was {{discussed}} and rejected {{on the ground}} that a larger part of Palestine should be assigned to them. According to Masalha, compulsory transfer was accepted as morally just by a majority although many doubted its feasibility. Partition, however, was not acceptable for Ussishkin, head of the Jewish National Fund, who said, [...] "The Arab people have immense areas of land at their disposal; <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> nothing except a grave's plot. We demand that our inheritance, Palestine, be returned to us, and if {{there is no room for}} Arabs, they have the opportunity of going to Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Turkish governments {{showed no}} {{interest}} in their duties towards their citizens and turned a deaf ear to all complaints and suggestions. Things got {{so far out of}} hand that no one was satisfied with the situation in Turkey in Europe. It became unbearable for the Serbs, the Greeks and for the Albanians, too. By the grace of God, I have therefore ordered my brave army to join in the Holy War to free our brethren and to ensure a better future. In Old Serbia, my army will meet not only upon Christian Serbs, but also upon Muslim Serbs, who are equally dear to us, and in addition to them, upon Christian and Muslim Albanians with whom <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> shared joy and sorrow for thirteen centuries now. To all of them we bring freedom, brotherhood and equality." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{he might}} have {{something}} to carry back to England, and not being minded to take on board a load of sand, Captain Nelson asked that the Phoenix be laden with cedar logs and such clapboards as <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> made.

6000|$|Frequent depredations had of late {{been made}} on our {{frontier}} settlements by what Washington termed [...] "certain banditti of Indians" [...] from the north-west side of the Ohio. Some of <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been massacred and others carried into deplorable captivity. The Indians of the Wabash and the Miami rivers, who were the present aggressors, were numerous, warlike, and not deficient in discipline.|$|R
2500|$|At a CELAC {{meeting in}} 2015, Raúl Castro {{gave a speech}} {{claiming}} [...] "Cuba will continue to defend the ideas for which <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> assumed the greatest sacrifices and risks." [...] In that speech, he detailed the history of Cuba's foreign relations. Throughout the speech, he condemned the United States' history of manifest destiny, detailing a basic history of American and Cuban relations. After talking about the United States' policy in Cuba, {{he went on to}} condemn the United States' assistance in installing the [...] "terrible dictatorships in 20 countries, 12 of them simultaneously," [...] referring to the United States' supporting of Latin American dictatorships. Following that, Castro detailed Cuba's history following the Cuban Revolution. But despite his prior backlash against the United States, Castro summarized his speech by praising the recent improvements in American-Cuban relations, and wondered why [...] "the countries of the two Americas, the North and the South, fight together against terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime, without politically biased positions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Macmillan led the Conservatives {{to victory}} in the 1959 general election, {{increasing}} his party's majority from 67 to 107 seats. The campaign {{was based on the}} economic improvements achieved as well as the low unemployment and improving standard of living; the slogan [...] "Life's Better Under the Conservatives" [...] was matched by Macmillan's own remark, '"indeed let us be frank about it– most of <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> never had it so good," [...] usually paraphrased as [...] "You've never had it so good." [...] Such rhetoric reflected a new reality of working-class affluence; {{it has been argued that}} [...] "the key factor in the Conservative victory was that average real pay for industrial workers had risen since Churchill's 1951 victory by over 20 per cent". The scale of the victory meant that not only had the Conservatives won three successive general elections, but they had also increased their majority each time. And it sparked debate as to whether Labour (now led by Hugh Gaitskell) could win a general election again. The standard of living had risen enough that workers could participate in a consumer economy, shifting the working class concerns away from traditional Labour Party views.|$|E
2500|$|Diệm's {{government}} also encouraged {{the development of}} handicraft, industry, and commerce. In October 1957, Diệm established Center for technological development for investment, instruction, cooperation and support private technological activities to gradually diminish the role of foreign capitalists, especially French capitalists in industry and to enhance the role of indigenous capitalists in RVN economy. In 1961, Diệm suggested the second 5-year plan (1962–1966) to continue the first 5-year plan. During the first Republic of Vietnam, some indigenous industrial zones or factories were founded, such as: paper factory Cogido in An Hảo (1961), Textile factories Vinatexco and Vimytex, glassware factory Khánh Hội, Cement factories Hà Tiên and Thủ Đức, Hydroelectric power factory Đa Nhim (1961), Đà Lạt nuclear research centre (1963), Biên Hòa industrial zone (1963)... During 1956–1960, Diệm built a relatively stable RVN with a stable economy along with the development in infrastructure and people's standards of living due to export of home comforts. Nevertheless, Diệm also admitted the dependence of RVN's economy on the US assistance: [...] "Today, {{the country is not}} self-sufficient. We can say that foreign assistance is a kind of compensation for the services <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> provided to the free world to protect SEA market, and to fight against manipulations of international communism".|$|E

[...] Djérou was speaking in eastern Chad.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of schools in the {{neighboring}} towns which some students from Egede also attend. They are all in the attempt to gain knowledge. It is quite obvious how <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> benefited from the education that has this long history. It has enabled many Egede people to accept civilization at the earliest time and thus gained influence and affluence far and wide. It helped <b>our</b> <b>people</b> to embrace the fact of life and fend for their well-being through sincere efforts.|$|R
60|$|Sergeant Corney and I gave no heed to {{what was}} going on around us until we had bound up the general's knee in such a manner that there was no longer danger he would bleed to death, and when this had been done I noted that <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> taken shelter behind the trees, where they could strike a blow in their own defence.|$|R

60|$|Surely {{this time}} they were making a grievous mistake, for the fire from the front was {{continued}} with vigor as I understood full well before we were a dozen yards from the guard-house, for then a cannon ball came so near to me that I could feel the wind of it, and I started back in surprise as if <b>having</b> supposed that <b>our</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> been firing blank cartridges.|$|R
