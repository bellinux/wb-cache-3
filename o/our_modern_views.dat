40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} a peculiar conflict that occurs {{in the process of}} music performance, a conflict that exists between the body and the mind. What I call “executive mismatch,” this conflict tends to occur when music performance is treated only as an art, and not also as a kind of a sport; that is, when music is valued only for its artistic expression and representation, and not also for its kinetic essence. Executive mismatch happened, for example, during the second quarter of the nineteenth century, a critical time that shaped <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> <b>views</b> on how the piano should be played. While many – among them Liszt, Thalberg, Chopin, and Mendelssohn – managed to find their rightful places in this process of development, individuals like Schumann struggled for theirs. Focusing on this influential but overlooked nineteenth-century dilemma, this dissertation examines the inharmonious collaboration between kinetics and aesthetics as evident in pedagogical writings, training materials, witness accounts, and compositions. This dissertation argues that musical performance mandates a proper matching of the body and the mind, and it does so at two levels. First, it argues historically that Schumann’s famous hand injury was as much about the executively mismatched world he lived in as about biographical details. His pursuit of a performing career was always doomed to end badly, whether or not he tried to use machines to accelerate progress. Accordingly, his injury was unlikely to be self-inflicted, nor was it entirely medical/pathological by nature. Second, it argues that executive mismatch, which found perfect expressions in Schumann’s life and in early nineteenth- century pianism, still influences our modern world through performers, music-score editors, and researchers. published_or_final_versionMusicDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Locke is undoubtedly the most influential of the classic property theorists, and Locke used this narrative approach in his famous discussion of property in the Second Treatise of Government.

40|$|Draft {{version of}} a contribution, {{initially}} presented at HaPoP- 3 in Paris, 2016. Today, we could hardly imagine using a computer without an operating system, it shapes and frames how we access the computer and its peripherals and supports our interaction with it throughout. But when the first computers were developed after World War II {{there was no such}} thing. In fact, only about a decade after the birth of digital computing did the first attempts at some kind of operating systems appear. It took another decade before the idea became widely accepted and most computers would be rented out or sold with an operating system. With the development of ambitious operating systems during the mid 1960 s, such as OS/ 360 for the IBM machines or Multics for an integrated time-sharing system, a more systematic framework was formulated that has determined <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> <b>view</b> of the operating system. Especially the emergence of time-sharing systems has traditionally been seen as {{a turning point in the}} development of operating systems. In the history of computing this has become a classic point of passage because of the sometimes fierce discussions between the proponents of time-sharing and the defenders of batch-processing in the late 1960 s. Important as these discussions were for thinking about the use and about the users of the computer, the emphasis on this transition has biased the view on early computer systems. As a matter of fact, the period between roughly 1954 and 1964 cannot be merely discounted as " empirical " or " prehistoric ", nor as the time of batch-processing systems. Rather a variety of systems were developed and the very idea(s) of an operating system had to be created from scratc...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} {{the theme of}} blindness in the Gospel of Mark. The two main questions asked are: 1) “What is Mark’s view on blindness?” and 2) “How does the Gospel of Mark’s view on blindness inform the current discourse of disability studies {{and how can we}} interpret Mark’s view on blindness today?” By the methods of metaphor analysis and character analysis, four passages of the Gospel are studied (Mark 4 : 10 - 12; 8 : 14 - 21; 22 - 26; 10 : 46 - 52). The analysis concludes that blindness is depicted by the author of the Gospel as a disability which also consist of a lack of cognitive ability and a hopeless state that is in need of healing.   The depiction of blindness in Mark originates out of the authors use of blindness as a metaphor for lack of cognitive ability (Mk 4 : 12; 8 : 18) and the lack of characterization of the blind man at Bethsaida (8 : 22 - 23). This view on blindness is, in comparison to a <b>modern</b> <b>view,</b> difficult, as it marginalizes persons with blindness as inconsiderate and not fully human. The view of blindness is somewhat nuanced, however, by the fuller characterization of Bartimaeus (10 : 46 - 52). The essay then discusses, in dialogue with disability studies, the complexity of Mark’s uses of blindness as a metaphor and of the difficulties of <b>our</b> <b>modern,</b> often generalized, <b>views</b> of blindness in antiquity and how the view of blindness in Marks gospel both constructs and deconstructs blindness as a disability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this last}} century {{a lot of}} world-conflicts not only crossed and damaged people and their life, but also {{influenced}} our culture and <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> <b>view</b> of the Others and the world. Even if Today apartheid doesn’t exist there are, in our society, {{many different types of}} Others that arise from and must struggle with segregation, religious discrimination, cultural racism, discrimination based on social status or racial belonging: that cannot be seen as a separated or better behavior than before so why we think to be into the so called “modern and civilized world”? Who manipulated our view? in which ways? How is the context in which we live relevant for the creation of cultural racism and cultural stereotypes about the Others? History is often red as a tale of western dominance and colonialism, but how we can understand other world conceptions and cultures if we are totally blinded by this reading? History has delineate how the Western societies have trying to say “we are the best because we are westerns, white and christians” but how we can understand other world conceptions and cultures if we are totally obscured by this thinking?	 Western perceptions of culture include a complete view about the power-interactions that are inside the social structure. Institutions like schools, universities and major social structures like welfare systems mirror these interactions and perpetuate the image that nation states want to create for themselves. Scholars have tried to understand and analyze why such phenomena have such {{an important role in the}} social structure, but what we described above is just one of the countless faces and interpretations of history: every culture has its own unique way to interpret historical events, highlighting some more than others, so the narrative can vary wildly from case to case. In this critical historical moment problems about Othering and the correlated view about culture and identity are really important to understand, both to create a better interaction between cultures (as we all live in a multicultural context) and because recognizing these differences can help changing of the social structure and consequently the discourse of power into the Nation. In this project we will consider the importance of being aware of cultural racism and of the interactions that exist between our perceived identity and the Others. The Danish political scene and media usually draw immigrants as “medieval muslims with an undemocratic mindset” (Kubliz 2010) and this discourse has created a certain stereotype among the Danish public opinion and a general not-positive perception of the Others. The aim of this project is to show how interactions expresses and reproduces underlying social-cultural representations of others in the specific context...|$|R

Nevertheless, the growing field of theological anthropology has yet to fully avail itself of philosophy’s and theology’s renewed attention to the theme of love. The Introduction to this special issue proposes the phrase ‘in the image of Love’ as an invitation to examine the relation between theological anthropology and love throughout the history of Christian thought. Guided by this motif, the issue’s contributors consider ten historical thinkers on love and the human in relation to their philosophical conversation partners at the time. The volume thus has a genealogical dimension, delving into often forgotten layers beneath <b>our</b> current, late <b>modern</b> <b>view</b> of the human/love. It thereby assists future theological anthropological discussions in the much-needed task of both integrating the crucial theme of love and formulating more historically grounded perspectives.

6000|$|Such being {{their general}} {{idea of the}} gods, we can now easily {{understand}} the habitual tone of their feelings towards what was beautiful in nature. With us, observe, {{the idea of the}} Divinity is apt to get separated from the life of nature; and imagining our God upon a cloudy throne, far above the earth, and not in the flowers or waters, we approach those visible things with a theory that they are dead; governed by physical laws, and so forth. But coming to them, we find the theory fail; that they are not dead; that, say what we choose about them, the instinctive sense of their being alive is too strong for us; and in scorn of all physical law, the wilful fountain sings, and the kindly flowers rejoice. And then, puzzled, and yet happy; pleased, and yet ashamed of being so; accepting sympathy from nature which we do not believe it gives, and giving sympathy to nature, which we do not believe it receives,--mixing, besides, all manner of purposeful play and conceit with these involuntary fellowships,--we fall necessarily into the curious web of hesitating sentiment, pathetic fallacy, and wandering fancy, which form a great part of <b>our</b> <b>modern</b> <b>view</b> of nature. But the Greek never removed his god out of nature at all; never attempted for a moment to contradict his instinctive sense that God was everywhere. [...] "The tree is glad," [...] said he, [...] "I know it is; I can cut it down: no matter, there was a nymph in it. The water does sing," [...] said he; [...] "I can dry it up; but no matter, there was a naiad in it." [...] But in thus clearly defining his belief, observe, he threw it entirely into a human form, and gave his faith to nothing but the image of his own humanity. What sympathy and fellowship he had, were always for the spirit in the stream, not for the stream; always for the dryad in the wood, not for the wood. Content with this human sympathy, he approached the actual waves and woody fibres with no sympathy at all. The spirit that ruled them, he received as a plain fact. Them, also, ruled and material, he received as plain facts; they, without their spirit, were dead enough. A rose was good for scent, and a stream for sound and coolness; for the rest, one was no more than leaves, the other no more than water; he could not make anything else of them; and the divine power, which was involved in their existence, having been all distilled away by him into an independent Flora or Thetis, the poor leaves or waves were left, in mere cold corporealness, {{to make the most of}} their being discernibly red and soft, clear and wet, and unacknowledged in any other power whatsoever.|$|R

Since independence they have faced appropriation into western design and the changing fashions of a modernizing society but have maintained their integrity and indeed are thriving with a new generation of young designers. The interactions between purpose and product also highlight important questions. Uzbek textiles will serve as a case study of an ‘ethnic’ textile which has survived and thrived without western aid. This, and the widespread use of ikat patterns in western design in the last ten years raise issues of cultural appropriation and superiority.
