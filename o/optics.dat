5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in <b>optics.</b> He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on <b>optics</b> helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his <b>Optics),</b> in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of <b>optics</b> and presented excellent explanations of early <b>optics</b> experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the <b>Optics</b> convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.|$|E

5|$|The {{upcoming}} {{generation of}} extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will require sophisticated adaptive <b>optics</b> {{in order to}} be used to their full capability. Because the WHT has an advanced adaptive <b>optics</b> system already operating, it is receiving attention from the various ELT programs. The European Southern Observatory's European-ELT (E-ELT) project has begun a programme to utilise the WHT as a test-bed for its adaptive <b>optics</b> system, and will receive several nights per year for on-sky testing. The project involves construction of new optical experiments at one of the Nasmyth foci, and is called CANARY. CANARY will demonstrate the multi-object adaptive <b>optics</b> (MOAO) required for the EAGLE instrument on the E-ELT.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his education, {{he served as}} a professor of physics and electrical engineering at the University of Southern California beginning in 1966, specializing in the theoretical physics of nonlinear <b>optics</b> and quantum <b>optics,</b> and co-founded the Center for Laser Studies at that institution. He rose to become chairman of the physics department in 1972, and then dean of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in 1976. He was engaged as a public speaker on science, including hosting a series of educational television programs on CBS. He was also outspoken on campus issues, and was designated the university's spokesperson during a scandal over preferential treatment of athletes.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive <b>optics</b> have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive <b>optics</b> versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive <b>optics</b> can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

5|$|The first scientifically useful {{observation}} of Neptune from ground-based telescopes using adaptive <b>optics,</b> was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its {{spring and summer}} season and {{has been shown to}} be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with adaptive <b>optics</b> are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.|$|E
5|$|The major {{end uses}} for {{germanium}} in 2007, worldwide, were estimated to be: 35% for fiber-optics, 30% infrared <b>optics,</b> 15% polymerization catalysts, and 15% electronics and solar electric applications. The remaining 5% went into such uses as phosphors, metallurgy, and chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|The random {{selection}} of ninety-one {{stars in the}} Upper Scorpius association provided a sample of stars to be observed using the Near Infrared Imager and Spectrometer (NIRI) and Altitude conjugate Adaptive <b>Optics</b> for the Infrared (ALTAIR) adaptive <b>optics</b> system at the Gemini Observatory. Among the ninety stars selected for direct imaging was the star HIP 78530, which was first imaged by the camera on May 24, 2008. This initial image revealed {{the presence of the}} same faint object within the vicinity of HIP 78530.|$|E

5|$|After the {{problems}} with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective <b>optics.</b> The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools. SM1 flew aboard Endeavour in December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive <b>optics</b> (AO).|$|E
5|$|Following Galileos planned {{destruction}} in Jupiter's atmosphere in September 2003, new observations of Io's volcanism came from Earth-based telescopes. In particular, adaptive <b>optics</b> imaging from the Keck telescope in Hawaii and imaging from the Hubble telescope have allowed astronomers to monitor Io's active volcanoes. This imaging has allowed scientists to monitor volcanic activity on Io, {{even without a}} spacecraft in the Jovian system.|$|E
5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on <b>optics.</b> During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{accommodates}} five science instruments {{at a given}} time, {{plus the}} Fine Guidance Sensors, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for science (astrometry). Early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions. COSTAR was strictly a corrective <b>optics</b> device rather than a true science instrument, but occupied {{one of the five}} instrument bays.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Juno was imaged by the Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory at {{visible and}} near-IR wavelengths, using {{adaptive}} <b>optics.</b> The images spanned a whole rotation period and revealed an irregular shape {{and a dark}} albedo feature, interpreted as a fresh impact site.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} times, {{rather than}} making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of <b>optics</b> in his Book of <b>Optics</b> in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed {{to figure out how}} to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.|$|E
5|$|It {{has always}} been {{important}} for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected <b>optics</b> produced numerous remarkable images.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is used {{in various}} superconducting materials. These superconducting alloys, also {{containing}} titanium and tin, are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners. Other applications of niobium include welding, nuclear industries, electronics, <b>optics,</b> numismatics, and jewelry. In the last two applications, the low toxicity and iridescence produced by anodization are highly desired properties.|$|E
5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film <b>optics</b> technology. In such systems, the visible spectrum is broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{also studied}} other fields, however; and {{was guided by}} Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon's views {{on the value of}} {{experimental}} science. Where Peckham met Bacon is not known, {{but it would have been}} at either Paris or Oxford. Bacon's influence can be seen in Peckham's works on <b>optics</b> (the Perspectiva communis) and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|The Corrective <b>Optics</b> Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) {{system was}} {{designed}} to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration. To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, {{one of the other}} instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the High Speed Photometer to be sacrificed. By 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective <b>optics.</b> COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum. The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.|$|E
5|$|The high {{non-linearity}} of {{lithium niobate}} {{also makes it}} useful in non-linear <b>optics</b> applications. It is used extensively in telecommunication products such as mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{instrument}} is a refractor of 12.4inches clear aperture and of 15ft. focal length. The <b>optics</b> are by John A. Brashear of Pittsburgh and the mechanical parts by the Warner & Swasey Company of Cleveland. Eyepieces provide magnification ranging from 130 to 720 power.|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{formerly}} {{used as an}} alloying element in TIG welding electrodes, as a material in high-end <b>optics</b> and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in gas mantles, but these have become marginal uses. It has been suggested {{as a replacement for}} uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors, and several thorium reactors have been completed.|$|E
25|$|Classical <b>optics</b> {{is divided}} into two main branches: {{geometrical}} (or ray) <b>optics</b> and physical (or wave) <b>optics.</b> In geometrical <b>optics,</b> light is considered to travel in straight lines, while in physical <b>optics,</b> light is considered as an electromagnetic wave.|$|E
