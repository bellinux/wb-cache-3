25|$|The BJT {{remains a}} device that excels in some applications, such as {{discrete}} circuit design, due to the very wide selection of BJT types available, and because of its high transconductance and <b>output</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to MOSFETs.|$|E
5000|$|Limited {{output power}} — if high power output is desired, an op-amp {{specifically}} designed for that purpose must be used. Most op-amps are designed for low power operation and are typically only able to drive <b>output</b> <b>resistances</b> down to 2 kΩ.|$|R

25|$|The source-to-body and drain-to-body {{junctions}} are {{the object}} of much attention because of three major factors: their design affects the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the device, lowering <b>output</b> <b>resistance,</b> and also {{the speed of the}} device through the loading effect of the junction capacitances, and finally, the component of stand-by power dissipation due to junction leakage.|$|E
25|$|Note: Tabulated {{formulas}} in Table 2 {{make the}} h-equivalent circuit of the transistor from Figure6 agree with its small-signal low-frequency hybrid-pi model in Figure7. Notation: r = base resistance of transistor, rO = <b>output</b> <b>resistance,</b> and gm = transconductance. The negative sign for h21 reflects the convention that I1, I2 are positive when directed into the two-port. A non-zero value for h12 means the output voltage affects the input voltage, that is, this amplifier is bilateral. If h12 = 0, the amplifier is unilateral.|$|E
25|$|Microphones have an {{electrical}} characteristic called impedance, measured in ohms(Ω), {{that depends on}} the design. In passive microphones, this value describes the electrical resistance of the magnet coil (or similar mechanism). In active microphones, this value describes the <b>output</b> <b>resistance</b> of the amplifier circuitry. Typically, the rated impedance is stated. Low impedance is considered under 600Ω. Medium impedance is considered between 600Ω and 10kΩ. High impedance is above 10kΩ. Owing to their built-in amplifier, condenser microphones typically have an output impedance between 50 and 200Ω.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{sophisticated}} current mirrors that have higher <b>output</b> <b>resistances</b> than the basic mirror (more closely approach an ideal mirror with current output independent of output voltage) and produce currents less sensitive to temperature and device parameter variations and to circuit voltage fluctuations.

25|$|Lower output resistance: For analog operation, good gain {{requires}} a high MOSFET output impedance, {{which is to}} say, the MOSFET current should vary only slightly with the applied drain-to-source voltage. As devices are made smaller, {{the influence of the}} drain competes more successfully with that of the gate due to the growing proximity of these two electrodes, increasing the sensitivity of the MOSFET current to the drain voltage. To counteract the resulting decrease in <b>output</b> <b>resistance,</b> circuits are made more complex, either by requiring more devices, for example the cascode and cascade amplifiers, or by feedback circuitry using operational amplifiers, for example a circuit like that in the adjacent figure.|$|E

2500|$|Figure3 shows a bipolar {{current mirror}} with emitter {{resistors}} {{to increase its}} <b>output</b> <b>resistance..</b> That is, the resistors RE cause negative feedback that opposes change in current. In particular, any change in output voltage results in less change in current than without this feedback, which means the <b>output</b> <b>resistance</b> of the mirror has increased. [...] Transistor Q1 is diode connected, {{which is to say}} its collector-base voltage is zero. Figure4 shows the small-signal circuit equivalent to Figure3. Transistor Q1 is represented by its emitter resistance rE ≈ VT/IE (VT = thermal voltage, IE = Q-point emitter current), a simplification made possible because the dependent current source in the hybrid-pi model for Q1 draws the same current as a resistor 1/gm connected across r. The second transistor Q2 is represented by its hybrid-pi model. Table 1 below shows the z-parameter expressions that make the z-equivalent circuit of Figure2 electrically equivalent to the small-signal circuit of Figure4.|$|E
5000|$|These {{processes}} also {{ensured that}} industrialization was minimal (although factories had first been opened during the Phanariotes): most revenues {{came from a}} highly productive agriculture based on peasant labour, and were invested back into agricultural production.

5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively.

2500|$|The {{negative}} feedback introduced by resistors RE {{can be seen}} in these parameters. For example, when used as an active load in a differential amplifier, I1 ≈ −I2, making the output impedance of the mirror approximately R22 -R21 ≈ 2 β rORE /(rπ + 2RE) compared to only rO without feedback (that is with RE = 0 Ω) [...] At the same time, the impedance on the reference side of the mirror is approximately [...] R11−R12 ≈ , only a moderate value, but still larger than rE with no feedback.

2500|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the MOSFET has {{continually}} been scaled down in size; typical MOSFET channel lengths were once several micrometres, but modern integrated circuits are incorporating MOSFETs with channel lengths {{of tens of}} nanometers.

Intel began production of a process featuring a 32nm feature size (with the channel being even shorter) in late 2009. The semiconductor industry maintains a [...] "roadmap", the ITRS, [...] which sets the pace for MOSFET development.

50|$|The {{effect of}} channel-length {{modulation}} upon the MOSFET <b>output</b> <b>resistance</b> varies {{both with the}} device, particularly its channel length, and with the applied bias.

In shorter MOSFETs additional factors arise such as: drain-induced barrier lowering (which lowers the threshold voltage, increasing the current and decreasing the <b>output</b> <b>resistance),</b> velocity saturation (which tends to limit the increase in channel current with drain voltage, thereby increasing the <b>output</b> <b>resistance)</b> and ballistic transport (which modifies the collection of current by the drain, and modifies drain-induced barrier lowering so as to increase supply of carriers to the pinch-off region, increasing the current and decreasing the <b>output</b> <b>resistance).</b> Again, accurate results require computer models.|$|E

The first method uses several reference resistors covering the sensor resistance range; the second method uses two-point calibration.
