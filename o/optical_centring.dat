We define the camera calibration matrix and rotational homographies, and solve the Orthogonal Procrustes problem. We also describe the axis-angle parametrisation, points on the unit sphere, and spherical coordinates. 1 Image Plane and Image Grid The image plane is the 3 D plane where the image sensor is located, see figure 1. By the image grid we instead mean the grid of image pixels grabbed by the sensor. Whereas the image plane has physical dimensions, {{the dimensions of the}} image grid are measured in numbers of pixels. The camera coordinate system (CCS) is a 3 D coordinate system centred in a point known as the <b>optical</b> <b>centre,</b> see figure 1. In the ideal pin-hole camera, the <b>optical</b> <b>centre</b> is the pin hole, and for the ideal thin lens camera, the <b>optical</b> <b>centre</b> is the centre of the lens. Conversions between CCS coordinates and image grid coordinates (hereafter image coordinates) are performed using the camera calibration matrix. The camera calibration matrix K is a 3 × 3 matrix which maps a point X ∈ R 3 in the CCS to image coordinates according to: x ̃ ∼ KX.

40|$|Abstract. Use of a {{transmission}} electron microscope to irradiate silicon carbide samples has been demonstrated as a useful additional characterisation technique. The photoluminescence spectra of crystal defects introduced in this way {{have been found to}} be extremely rich in detail, involving more than 50 zero phonon lines. It is perhaps disappointing that relatively few of these <b>optical</b> <b>centres</b> have been identified conclusively. Indeed, controversy exists over most of the interpretations that have been advanced. As a step towards clarifying this situation we have been studying many of the more important photoluminescent systems by investigating the dependence of the results on the sample n- and p-doping levels, their stoichiometry, the source of supply, the electron dose, the subsequent annealing history, and by exploiting two new aspects of the technique that will be introduced here.

40|$|Current {{approaches}} to large-scale visual reconstruction {{would benefit from}} a statisti-cal model of multiple-view projection. In particular, global constraints based on scene-clutter and occlusion are required. This work presents a new statistical model, starting from the simplest example of a random scene, viewed by two cameras. It has previ-ously been shown that, if the scene is modelled as a Poisson process of identical objects, then the distance to a visible object follows an exponential distribution. But this is not qualitatively realistic, because the mode of the exponential is at zero, implying that the <b>optical</b> <b>centre</b> is fully amid the clutter. Real range-data, in contrast, follows a two-tailed distribution along each ray. A more realistic visibility density is proposed, in which the <b>optical</b> <b>centre</b> is displaced from the Poisson scene by a Gaussian shift. This means that the distance to an un-occluded object is now distributed according to the convolution of the exponential and Gaussian distributions, which has a variable mode. This distribu-tion is re-parameterized along the corresponding epipolar line in another view, via the appropriate Jacobian. The resulting correspondence density gives the prior probability of a binocular match. The parameters of the density are estimated from a data-set of out-door laser range-scans. This {{makes it possible to}} generate full 3 D Poisson models that are statistically consistent with the real data. These synthetic scenes are used to further investigate the correspondence density, by Monte Carlo simulation. ...|$|R
