40|$|AbstractThis paper {{argues that}} {{computational}} grids {{can be used}} for far more types of applications than just trivially parallel ones. Algorithmic optimizations like latency-hiding and exploiting locality can be used effectively to obtain high performance <b>on</b> <b>grids,</b> despite the relatively slow wide-area networks that connect the grid resources. Moreover, the bandwidth of wide-area networks increases rapidly, allowing even some applications that are extremely communication intensive to run <b>on</b> a <b>grid,</b> provided the underlying algorithms are latency-tolerant. We illustrate large-scale parallel computing <b>on</b> <b>grids</b> with three example applications that search large state spaces: transposition-driven search, retrograde analysis, and model checking.

40|$|Community Climate System Model (CCSM) is a Multiple Program Multiple Data (MPMD) {{parallel}} {{global climate}} model comprising atmosphere, ocean, land, ice and coupler components. The simulations have a time-step {{of the order}} of tens of minutes and are typically performed for periods {{of the order of}} centuries. These climate simulations are highly computationally intensive and can take several days to weeks to complete on most of today’s multi-processor systems. Executing CCSM <b>on</b> <b>grids</b> could potentially lead to a significant reduction in simulation times due to the increase in number of processors. However, in order to obtain performance gains <b>on</b> <b>grids,</b> several challenges have to be met. In this work, we describe our load balancing efforts in CCSM to make it suitable for grid enabling. We also identify the various challenges in executing CCSM <b>on</b> <b>grids.</b> Since CCSM is an MPI application, we also describe our current work on building a MPI implementation for grids to grid-enable CCSM. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Computational grids {{promise to}} deliver a vast {{computer}} power as transparently as the electric power grid supplies electricity. Thus, applications need to be automatically and transparently deployed <b>on</b> <b>grids,</b> in particular MPI parallel applications. However, deploying such applications <b>on</b> a <b>grid</b> is complex: the user must select compute nodes manually, launch processes on distributed, heterogeneous nodes, and configure the MPI library so it can adapt to its grid environment. Our objective is to hide the complexity of application deployment <b>on</b> computational <b>grids.</b> This paper proposes a software archi-tecture designed to automatically deploy MPI applications <b>on</b> a <b>grid.</b> It also introduces a description and packaging model of MPI applications. Finally, the paper shows how the MPI library can be automatically configured with network topology information to opti-mize collective operations...|$|R
