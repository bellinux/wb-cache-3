25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is {{the process}} for producing ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called pyrolysis gasoline. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene and xylenes).|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, an alkyne is an {{unsaturated}} hydrocarbon containing {{at least one}} carbon—carbon triple bond. The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other functional groups form a homologous series with the general chemical formula n2n−2. Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name acetylene also refers specifically to C2H2, known formally as ethyne using IUPAC nomenclature. Like <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> alkynes are generally hydrophobic but {{tend to be more}} reactive.|$|E
25|$|Syngas, {{a mixture}} of carbon monoxide, {{hydrogen}} and <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> is produced by partial combustion of biomass, that is, combustion with an amount of oxygen that {{is not sufficient to}} convert the biomass completely to carbon dioxide and water. Before partial combustion, the biomass is dried, and sometimes pyrolysed. The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.|$|E

25|$|Often mid-stream {{and well}} head gases require removal {{of many of}} the various {{hydrocarbon}} species contained within the natural gas. Some of these gases include heptane, pentane, propane and <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with molecular weights above Methane (CH4) to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission. Typically, natural gas compressors require 950 to 1050BTU per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational name plate specifications.|$|E
25|$|Many oils can be {{recovered}} from open water surfaces by skimming devices. Considered a dependable and cheap way to remove oil, grease and <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from water, oil skimmers can sometimes {{achieve the desired}} level of water purity. At other times, skimming is also a cost-efficient method to remove most of the oil before using membrane filters and chemical processes. Skimmers will prevent filters from blinding prematurely and keep chemical costs down because there is less oil to process.|$|E
25|$|Processes in {{the upper}} {{atmosphere}} contribute up to 90% of the total formaldehyde in the environment. Formaldehyde is an intermediate in the oxidation (or combustion) of methane, {{as well as of}} other carbon compounds, e.g. in forest fires, automobile exhaust, and tobacco smoke. When produced in the atmosphere by the action of sunlight and oxygen on atmospheric methane and <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> it becomes part of smog. Formaldehyde has also been detected in outer space (see below).|$|E

25|$|Methane is {{important}} for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator. Compared to <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuels, methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's heat of combustion is lower than any <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> but {{the ratio of the}} heat of combustion (891 kJ/mol) to the molecular mass (16.0 g/mol, of which 12.0 g/mol is carbon) shows that methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon, produces more heat per mass unit (55.7 kJ/g) than <b>other</b> complex <b>hydrocarbons.</b> In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking. In this context it is usually known as natural gas, which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter, or 1,000 BTU per standard cubic foot.|$|R
50|$|Methanol {{is used as}} a fuel {{because it}} is {{naturally}} hydrogen dense (a hydrogen carrier) and can be steam reformed into hydrogen at low temperatures compared to <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fuels. Additionally, methanol is naturally occurring, biodegradable, and energy dense.|$|R
25|$|Like <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its vapor phase and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present. Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4% by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2008–2010 new {{infrared}} spectroscopic observations with {{a higher}} signal-to-noise ratio revealed additional spectral features. Among them are a deep water ice absorption band at 1.65μm, which is an evidence of the crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} Orcus, and a new absorption band at 2.22μm. The origin of the latter feature is not completely clear. It can be caused either by ammonia/ammonium dissolved in the water ice or by methane/ethane ices. The radiative transfer modeling showed that a mixture of water ice, tholins (as a darkening agent), ethane ice and ammonium ion (NH4+) provides the best match to the spectra, whereas a combination of water ice, tholins, methane ice and ammonia hydrate gives a slightly inferior result. On the other hand, a mixture of only ammonia hydrate, tholins and water ice failed to provide a satisfactory match. So, as of 2010, the only reliably identified compounds on the surface of Orcus are crystalline water ice and, possibly, dark tholins. A firm identification of ammonia, methane and <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> requires better infrared spectra.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmospheric}} composition {{in the stratosphere}} is 98.4% nitrogen—the only dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth's—with the remaining 1.6% composed of mostly of methane (1.4%) and hydrogen (0.1–0.2%). Because methane condenses out of Titan's atmosphere at high altitudes, its abundance increases as one descends below the tropopause {{at an altitude of}} 32km, leveling off at a value of 4.9% between 8km and the surface. There are trace amounts of <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene and propane, and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, argon and helium. The orange color as seen from space must be produced by other more complex chemicals in small quantities, possibly tholins, tar-like organic precipitates. The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan has no magnetic field, although studies in 2008 showed that Titan retains remnants of Saturn's magnetic field on the brief occasions when it passes outside Saturn's magnetosphere and is directly exposed to the solar wind. This may ionize and carry away some molecules {{from the top of the}} atmosphere.|$|E

500|$|Jupiter's upper {{atmosphere}} is about 88–92% hydrogen and 8–12% helium by percent volume of gas molecules. A helium atom has {{about four times}} as much mass as a hydrogen atom, so the composition changes when described as the proportion of mass contributed by different atoms. Thus, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass, with the remaining one percent of the mass consisting of other elements. [...] The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds. There are also traces of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia. The interior contains denser materials - by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements. Through infrared and ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and <b>other</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> have also been found.|$|E
500|$|Uranus is {{the seventh}} planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest {{planetary}} radius and fourth-largest planetary {{mass in the}} Solar System.
