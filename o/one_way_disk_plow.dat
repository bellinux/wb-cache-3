40|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>plows</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} tillage tools. Two <b>way</b> (reversible) <b>disk</b> <b>plows</b> can perform continues plowing. So they can save time and costs and hence improve overall efficiency. In this study, a “two-way” <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> was designed based on a λ-formed straight-line, four-bar linkage (Daniel mechanism). This design contains disk and rear wheel reversing mechanism, stabilization mechanism of the <b>plow,</b> a <b>disk</b> angle adjustment tool and transport condition for safe operation of the mechanism. Disk reversing mechanism was designed based on a geometrical analysis considering working condition of the <b>disk</b> <b>plow.</b> The suitable displacement of the plow’s frame was achieved by dimensional analysis of Daniel mechanism and a derived mathematical equation. The rear wheel mechanism was made by means of adding a slotted link to the previous four-bar linkage. The synthesized five-bar linkage was then analyzed for its kinematical and force conditions. For each analysis, related diagrams were plotted and discussed. This innovation has the advantages of low production cost and maintenance as well as easy operation, because of its design simplicity with minimum mechanical auxiliaries.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects of five tillage systems on the physical properties of a cohesive Yellow Argisol. The experiment was installed in the field on January 21, 2011 and lasted 260 days, in an area previously used as pasture with Brachiaria grass without liming or fertilization, but irrigated by a low pressure spray system. The treatments, in five replications and in a randomized block design, consisted of: 1) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + ridge-furrow tillage (raising a ridge along the planting row), 135 days after transplanting (DP + RID); 2) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow (DP no RID); 3) subsoiler (SB); 4) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + scarification with three shanks along the plant row (DP + SPR); and 5) <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> (twice) + <b>disk</b> harrow + scarification with three shanks in the total area (DP + STA). In all tillage systems, furrows were mechanically opened for the papaya plants. After the treatments, the mechanical resistance to penetration was determined, followed by soil moisture, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), bulk density (BD), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), and number of fruits per plant. There were differences in penetration resistance (PR) between treatments. The subsoiler was more effective to decrease RP to a distance of 0. 35 m from the plants, perpendicular to the plant row. The scarifier resulted in a lower PR than DP or SB, even at the depth of 0. 40 m, and it was more effective at greater distances perpendicular to the plant. All tillage systems induced a PR between 2. 0 and 3. 0 MPa at the depth with the highest concentration of papaya tree roots (0 - 0. 25 m), improving the physical conditions to this depth. There was no statistical difference among the treatments for BD, Ma, Mi, MWD, and GMD at a depth of 0. 20 m. The <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> changed the physical properties of the soil most intensely to a depth of 0. 20 m. The use of scarification, reduced tillage with a forest subsoiler, or ridge-furrow tillage did not improve the physical properties in the rhizosphere.

40|$|Introduction: Mulch tillage {{system is}} an {{intermediate}} system which covers some of disadvantages of no tillage and conventional tillage systems. In farms in which tillage {{is done with}} a chisel plow, runoff and soil erosion have a less important relation to moldboard and <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> and naturally absorption of rainfall will be developed. Thus, the mulch tillage system is an appropriate alternative to conventional tillage and no tillage (Backingham and Pauli, 1993). The unwanted vibration in machinery and industry mainly processes most harmful factors, for example: bearing wear, cracking and loosening joints. And noise is produced in electrical systems by creating a short circuit (Wok, 2011). Self-induced and induced vibration are used in tillage systems. Induced vibration is created by energy consumption and self-induced vibration is created by collision among the blades and soil at the shank (Soeharsono and Setiawan, 2010). A study by Mohammadi-gol et al. (2005) was conducted. It was found that on the <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> plant residues maintained on the soil are more than that of moldboard plow. 99...|$|R

A pin microrelief meter was used for the surface roughness measurements. The plot area was 1. 35 × 1. 35 m and the sample spacing was 25 mm, yielding a total of 3, 025 data points per measurement. Before geostatistical analysis, trend was removed from the experimental data by two methods for comparison.

The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial. Except in soil inversion, the effect of soil moisture {{on all of the}} performance parameters mentioned, was highly significant. Mean values of draft, specific draft and drawbar power requirements and clod mean weight diameter were minimized at 13 - 15 % and 16 - 18 % soil moisture contents, respectively. The effect of plowing depth was highly significant only on draft and drawbar power requirement of <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> {{in such a way that}} the mean values of these two parameters were significantly increased with plowing depth, while specific draft showed only a mild decreasing trend. In order to provide a quantitative index to express the degree of soil pulverization by tillage implements, a tractor-pulled rotary sieve was designed and fabricated. With this apparatus, in-field determination of soil clod mean weight diameter (MWD) following plowing was possible. The results showed that the effect of soil moisture content on MWD was highly significant, such that, plowing at 10 - 12 % moisture content produced the largest clods, whereas the effect of plowing depth on MWD was not significant. The decreasing trend of MWD with soil moisture content persisted to the highest moisture level studied (16 - 18 %), in which the average clod MWD (33. 8 mm) was about 72 % smaller than those formed at 10 - 12 % moisture content.

The {{potential impact of}} these externalities on environmental quality and human health prompted an examination of current and potential production strategies on four important dryfarmed soil associations [...] Walla Walla, Pilot Rock, Ritzville and Athena Soils [...] in the Umatilla County area of Oregon. The objective was to evaluate the economic and environmental costs of reducing soil erosion and leaching through implementing strategies that minimize soil loss and (or) nitrate leaching or offer some trade-offs between the pollutants. Four models [...] the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Micro-computer Budgeting Management System (MBMS), Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Program (NLEAP) and Multi-Objective Linear programming (MOP) [...] were employed to accomplish the study objectives. The results revealed that production strategies that focused on reducing only one pollutant generally exacerbated the other. The mixed objective strategies achieved a simultaneous reduction in both soil erosion and leaching. Once either pollutant had been substantially reduced, further reductions certainly increased the rate of generation of the other. On Walla Walla soil, the most cost effective erosion reducing strategies for winter wheat production included those that involved use of chisel plow for primary tillage under standard conservation practice. Large leachate reductions in winter wheat production were possible by using strategies that involved use of <b>disk</b> <b>plowing</b> for primary tillage followed by chisel plow for secondary tillage and a split fertilizer application. On Pilot Rock soil, production process that involved use of sweep plow for primary tillage with a one time spring fertilizer application and (or) with more farm acreage in spring barley production were least cost strategies that reduced leaching considerably.

Los porcentajes de cáscara, almendra, aceite y proteína no respondieron a la fertilización profunda. Desde el punto de vista económico, la mejor alternativa correspondió a la fertilización a 30 cm con cincel-abonador; la incorporación a 15 cm, con la rastra-arado, se presentó como según da opción con una tasa de retorno {{marginal}} aceptable, la cual para la región se estimó en 100 % como valor mínimo. The {{objective of}} the study was to analize the response in yield and other agronomic characteristics of sunflower based on different depths of fertilizer application. The treatments were application of fertilizer 10 cm depth tandem disk harrow, 15 cm depth with disk harrow, 25 cm depth with <b>disk</b> <b>plow</b> and 30 cm depth with chisel; an absolut control was also included. The incorporation with chisel was significantly higher than disk harrow and the control, but not with tandem disk harrow and <b>disk</b> <b>plow.</b> Increments of the chisel treatment with respect to disk harrow for the two consecutive semester were thus: for yield 64. 9 % and 109. 7 %; for capitulum diameter 20. 1 % and 29. 9 %: for weight of 1. 000 seeds 34. 7 % and 37. 1 % for plant height 15. 6 % and 27. 7 %, and a decrement of 43. 9 % and 54 % for the empty seeds percentage. The percentages of oil and protein content, and hull and almond were similar in all the treatments. Economically, the best alternative was the chisel treatment and the second option was the disk harrow with an acceptable return rata, that was estimated for the region in 100 % as a minimum value...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar algumas características físicas e fisiológicas de sementes de trigo e de soja cultivadas em sucessão, obtidas a partir de quatro sistemas de preparo de solo instalados após o cultivo de crotalária ou de guandu. Os sistemas de preparo para o trigo foram: 1. semeadura direta; 2. semeadura direta + 40 kg/ha de N em cobertura; 3. gradagem e 4. aração, seguindo-se a soja com: 1. semeadura direta; 2. semeadura direta; 3. escarificação e 4. aração. A {{cultivar}} de trigo IAC- 24 foi semeada em 13 / 04 / 98 e colhida em 21 / 08 / 98. Avaliaram-se a pureza física, o peso hectolítrico, a massa de 1000 sementes, o teor de água, a porcentagem de germinação e o vigor dessas sementes. A soja, cv. IAC- 17, com semeadura em 23 / 10 / 98 e colheita em 29 / 03 / 99, teve suas sementes avaliadas quanto ao tamanho, massa de 100 sementes, teor de água, germinação e vigor. Os sistemas de preparo de solo e de sucessão, apesar de terem afetado algumas características físicas das sementes produzidas de trigo e de soja, influenciaram muito pouco a qualidade fisiológica. The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate some physical and physiological characteristics of wheat and soybean seeds produced under four tillage systems and in succession after pigeonpea or sunnhemp crops. The tillage systems used for wheat were: 1. No tillage; 2. No tillage + 40 kg/ha of N top dressing; 3. disk harrow; 4. <b>disk</b> <b>plow,</b> following the soybean with: 1. No tillage; 2. No tillage; 3. chisel; 4. <b>disk</b> <b>plow.</b> The wheat, cv. IAC- 24, was sowed in 13 th of April 1998 and harvested in 21 st of August 1998. The wheat seeds quality was evaluated by physical purity, hectolitric weight, moisture content, 1000 seeds weight, germination and vigor. The soybean, cv. IAC- 17, was sowed in 23 rd of October 1998 and harvested in 29 th of March 1999. The size of the seeds, the 100 seeds weight, the moisture content, the germination and the vigor of the seeds of soybean were studied. The tillage systems and the succession kind had influences on some physical characteristics of seeds, but few effects on the physiological quality of soybean and wheat seeds...|$|R
