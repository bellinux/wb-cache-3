5|$|On August 21, 1983, Marcos' chief rival, {{opposition}} leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., was assassinated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tarmac</b> at Manila International Airport.

Marcos and his allies fled to Hawaii and Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino was recognized as president.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, the North Korean {{aircraft}} {{returned in}} larger numbers {{to attack the}} air transports. A flight of eight Ilyushin Il-10s appeared in the airspace between Seoul and Inchon, attempting to ambush transport aircraft while still {{on the ground at}} the airfields. The F-80s spotted the North Korean planes and engaged them. The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tarmac</b> at Kimpo.|$|E

5|$|On 5 September 1986, four ANO gunmen hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 at Karachi Airport on its {{way from}} Mumbai to New York, holding 389 {{passengers}} and crew for 16 hours in the plane <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tarmac</b> before detonating grenades inside the cabin. Neerja Bhanot, the flight's senior purser, was able to open an emergency door, and most passengers escaped; 20 died, including Bhanot, and 120 were wounded. The London Times reported in March 2004 that Libya had been behind the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|As soon as MacArthur cleared US {{aircraft}} to enter North Korea, the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron sent {{aircraft to}} scout all of North Korea's airfields. By the afternoon, the aircraft had not completed their scouting missions but a bombing mission was nonetheless ordered against Heijo Airfield. At 16:15, 18 B-26 Invaders of the 3rd Bombardment Group {{took off from}} airbases in Japan for strikes against the airfield. These {{would be the first}} offensive action against North Korea. The aircraft arrived at the airfield just after dark. There they found a substantial number of aircraft from North Korea's 1st Air Division parked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tarmac,</b> caught completely by surprise. The US aircraft subsequently placed their fragmentation bombs along the hangar line, ramps, and revetment areas. In the confusion, the North Koreans were only able to get one aircraft off the ground to oppose the flight, a Yak-3. The aircraft was quickly shot down by Staff Sergeant Nyle S. Mickley, a gunner aboard one of the bombers. By the end of the raid, the US aircraft destroyed an estimated 25 North Korean aircraft on the ground and one in the air while suffering no aircraft lost.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten months}} of training, Miller {{was offered a}} {{commission}} as a pilot officer. His best friend missed out, so he arranged for Flight Lieutenant Keith Johnson an Australian cricket official, to pull some strings, ensuring his friend's promotion. The pair were posted to 12 Advanced Flying Unit in Grantham, Lincolnshire in on 15 August 1944, which was an Operations Training Unit {{for the purpose of}} familiarising officers with flying aircraft. However, on a trip back to Ouston to visit their colleagues, a night of drunken revelry led to property damage and injury to another airman. Miller and his friend were charged with eight offences and faced possible expulsion. Luckily for Miller, the Commanding Officer (CO) at his new posting at Cranfield, Buckinghamshire was his old CO at Ouston. Miller was given another three-week disciplinary course, but his pleas convinced the CO to reduce the sentence to a fine for the property damage. Miller was allowed to resume his training in Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. Again he had a near miss, when some instruments on his plane failed and he was forced to land his Beaufighter for repairs. After the repairs, another pilot used the plane and the problem recurred. The second pilot crash-landed and was killed. Later, Miller was returning from a training mission over France and misjudged the runway, bouncing his plane <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tarmac.</b> Trying to lift off again, only one engine responded and the unequal power supply caused the plane to swerve, missing the hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment that he had agreed to attend. A V1 rocket hit the venue and killed many of the patrons inside. In October, he went AWOL to watch violinist Yehudi Menuhin perform in London and was dismissed, but the CO revoked his decision on the condition that Miller play for his cricket team.|$|E

25|$|While its {{financial}} performance started {{showing signs of}} improvement, in February 2007, JetBlue faced a crisis, when a snowstorm hit the Northeast and Midwest, throwing the airline's operations into chaos. Because JetBlue followed the practice of never canceling flights, it desisted from calling flights off, even when the ice storm hit and the airline was forced to keep several planes on the ground. Because of this, passengers were kept waiting at the airports for their flights to take off. In some cases, passengers who had already boarded their planes were kept waiting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tarmac</b> for several hours and {{were not allowed to}} disembark. However, after all this, the airline was eventually forced to cancel most of its flights because of prevailing weather conditions. The fiasco reportedly cost JetBlue $30million.|$|E
