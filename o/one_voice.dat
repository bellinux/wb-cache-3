5|$|<b>One</b> <b>Voice</b> is {{the debut}} album by British boy soprano Andrew Johnston, who rose to fame in 2008 after his {{appearance}} on the second series of Britain's Got Talent. The album was released on 29 September 2008 by Syco Music, Britain's Got Talent judge Simon Cowell's record label. Recorded in London, the album features both classical and popular songs, some {{of which had been}} previously performed by Johnston, including a duet with Faryl Smith.

Upon release, <b>One</b> <b>Voice</b> debuted at number five in the British album charts, finishing the week at number four. It also charted in Ireland, reaching number six. Critics responded positively to the album, favourably comparing Johnston to Aled Jones, and <b>One</b> <b>Voice</b> was rated gold in the UK.|$|E

5|$|A {{homophonic}} texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts have the same rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of homophony.
