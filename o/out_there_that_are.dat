500|$|In 2009, {{the choice}} of The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais as winner of the 2008 award was controversial, as Parker did not write the book himself, but used an {{automated}} authoring machine which produces thousands of titles {{on the basis of}} Internet and database searches. Philip Stone, charts editor and awards administrator at The Bookseller, commented by saying: [...] "I think it's slightly controversial as it was written by a computer, but given the number of celebrity memoirs <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> ghostwritten, I don't think it's too strange." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> trying to develop franchise characters."

5000|$|Visual illusions proper {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from some related phenomena. Some simple targets such as the Necker Cube are capable {{of more than one}} interpretation, which are usually seen in alternation, one at a time. They may be called ambiguous configurations rather than illusion, because what is seen at any time is not actually illusory. The configurations of the Penrose or Escher type are illusory in the sense that only on a detailed logical analysis it becomes apparent <b>that</b> they <b>are</b> not physically realizable. If one thinks of an illusion as something <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> misinterpreted, and of a delusion when a demonstrable substrate is lacking, the distinction breaks down for such effects as the Kanizsa triangle and illusory contours.|$|R
