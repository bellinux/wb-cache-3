At low temperature in its superconducting state, the light exposure shifts the superconducting transition towards lower temperature.

Currently, the market is dominated by inorganic-based materials such as silicon, III-V semiconductors, CIGS, etc. Despite their technical maturity, the energy generated from these devices is still low. This is partially due to the high production cost of these materials. Therefore, the search for next generation photovoltaic technologies that utilize earth-abundant elements with low-cost production processes has been an intensive research area. Using solution-processable organic polymer semiconductors, polymer solar cells {{provide an opportunity to}} efficiently generate energy from sunlight at a reasonable cost. This is due to the ease of synthesis/modification of organic molecules and polymers compared to that of inorganic materials, the easily scalable solution-based fabrication process, and the use of cost-effective, environmentally friendly carbon-based elements. Owing to the vast research efforts over the past decade, the power conversion efficiencies of single- and multi-junction polymer solar cells have recently surpassed the 10 % milestone. During this progression, materials development, driven by the desire to overcome the constraint of P 3 HT, has played a very important role in advancing the technology. To date, hundreds of photovoltaic polymers have been made through different combinations of conjugated building blocks and suitable functional groups. As a result, several state-of-the-art polymers, such as PTB 7, PDPP 3 T, PBDTDPP and PffBT 4 T, have shown impressive performance.

40|$|Exploring {{new types}} of photocatalysts and modifying the {{photocatalytic}} activity have attracted more and more extensive attention in many research fields. Anatase TiO 2, a promising photocatalyst widely studied, can only absorb the ultraviolet light and thus only make little use of the power in visible light. Therefore, it is an urgent task to make theoretical and experimental investigations on the photocatalytic mechanism in anatase TiO 2 and then improve its visible light response so as to utilize more visible light. Now, in the present paper, we carry out a systematic theoretical investigation on modifying the photocatalytic properties of the anatase TiO 2 (101) surface via doping transition metal neutral atoms such as Fe, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au by using the plane wave ultrasoft pseudopotential method of the density functional theory. The dependence of the macroscopic catalytic activity on electronic structure and <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>property</b> is uncovered by making a comparative analysis of the geometric structures, the electronic structures, and the optical properties of the undoped and doped anatase TiO 2 (101) surfaces.

With the vast releasing of ZnO NPs, the ecotoxic risk had drawn much research interest in the last decades. The aquatic ecosystem is the final destination of the released ZnO NPs and the coastal seawaters takes into the most of discharge. At least three distinct mechanisms of the toxic action of ZnO NPs, released toxic Zn 2 + effect, surface interactions with media may produce toxic substance were report, and photo-induced toxicity, were reported. Based on the published literatures reviewing, several research points on ecotoxicity of ZnO NPs towards algae and mussel in marine environment were still unexplored and some represent aims of this study. •	ZnO NPs could have a specific behavior and effect in diverse marine seawaters. To this aim the full characterization of ZnO NP dissolution, aggregation, and sedimentation once dispersed into a standard Artificial Sea Water (ASW) and a Reconstituted Sea Water (RSW) from East China Sea was performed. •	The ecotoxicity of ZnO NPs upon a green alga and a diatom would be different. To assess the diverse toxicity upon different algae, growth inhibition algal assays were performed. Additionally, to verify the hypothesis about the role of nano size in the overall toxicity, ZnO bulk, and Zn salt toxicity were assessed as well. •	ZnO NP toxicity towards mussels under a chronic exposure could be shown by Zn bioaccumulation, tissue damages, and transcription of apoptosis and antioxidation-related genes. The hypothesis that nano size {{plays an important role in}} its toxicity was also considered together with the all previous ones for mussel M. galloprovincialis. The obtained results answered to the all hypotheses. Behaviors of ZnO NPs and bulk in different artificial seawater were observed indicating that the primary size of ZnO in suspensions could affect the aggregating rate in higher concentration. The behaviors of ZnO NPs dispersed into ASW and RSW have similar changing trends with some slight differences. Comparative toxicity of ZnO NPs, bulk, and Zn salt towards marine algae indicated that the nano size plays a key role in the overall ZnO toxicity. Zn bioaccumulation and histological damages were observed for mussel exposed to ZnO NPs, bulk, and Zn salt. Pristine ZnO particle size influences the overall toxicity and the rank was represented by three levels of injury (in gill, digestive gland, and gonad) : low for bulk; medium for NPs and high for salts. Ecotoxicity of ZnO NPs in mussel revealed by transcription of apoptosis and antioxidation-related genes indicated that active response to ZnO NP exposure which induced DNA damage and oxidant injury contributing to the overall toxicity.

The efficiency of the Cu-TiO 2 thin film was preserved even after the extended usage of the films which sustains the reusability nature of Cu-TiO 2 films. Introduction. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) has been extensively studied because of its excellent phtotocatalytic activity, chemical stability, non toxicity, <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>property</b> and low cost. However, the wide band gap and intense electron-hole pair recombination limit its efficiency in photo electro chemical applications. Tailoring the band structure of TiO 2 is an effective method for widening its optical absorption range and improving its visible light phtotocatalytic activity [1, 2]. Catalytic activity of TiO 2 is dependent on its phase structure, crystallite size, specific surface area and pore structure. Doping additives were found successful in altering the photo electrochemical properties of TiO 2 [3, 4]. In particular, doping metal impurity in TiO 2 matrix has been found remarkable as the way it exploits the better photo catalytic activity [5, 6]. Cu is a potential metal dopant for phtotocatalytic mechanism since the visible light absorption of TiO 2 can be enhanced by the adding Cu [7]. Here the efforts have been made to prepare Cu doped TiO 2 film because the film shaped photocatalysts are convenient to use and recyclable. There are numerous methods to prepare Cu doped TiO 2 thin film but the sol-gel method shows more advantages over other methods [8]. By carrying out this method in solution, we can modify the few desired structural characteristics like compositional homogeneity, grain size, surface morphology and porosity is possible with this technique. Methyelene blue is a harmful material existing in liquid coming from industries. Exposure to methyelene blue causes various health issues such as increased heart beat rate, vomiting, shock, jaundice and tissue necrosis in human being. Cu doped TiO 2 thin film can be used to photo degrade the methyelene blue in waste water. In this work, pure TiO 2 and Copper doped TiO 2 thin films with various Cu concentrations (0. 02 - 0. 05 mol %) were prepared by sol-gel technique.

In terms of carrier mobility, we find that the functionalization strongly affects the reorganization energy of corannulene, while the enhanced stacking improves hopping integrals, favoring the carrier mobility of crystals of pentafluorophenylcorannulene- 5 -monoimide. The study shows a host of emerging <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>properties</b> and enhancements in the charge-transport characteristics of functionalized corannulene, which may find possible semiconductor and electronics applications...|$|R
40|$|Geometric {{structures}} of the ground states and excited states,frontier molecular orbitals,ionization potentials,electron affinities,reorganization energies,and absorption and emission spectra of three novel methyl-substituted 1, 3, 6, 8 -tetra-phenylpyrenes were studied theoretically by quantum-chemical methods,such as density functional theory (DFT). The {{results show that the}} position of methyl substituent on benzene ring has much effect on the <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>properties</b> of methyl-substituted 1, 3, 6, 8 -tetra-phenylpyrenes. Interestingly,the geometric structures and <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>properties</b> of the designed compound 1, 3, 6, 8 -tetra-p-tolylpyrene (TPPy) {{are similar to those of}} 1, 3, 6, 8 -tetrakis(3, 5 -dimethylphenyl) pyrene (TDMPPy),which is worthy of being further researched...|$|R
40|$|The <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>properties</b> of Si nanodots {{have been}} {{investigated}} using ab initio total energy calculations within the density functional theory. Structural relaxations have been considered. We have studied two types of nanodots: isolated clusters covered by H, studying the substitution of Si/H bonds with different Si/O bonds, and nanocrystals embedded in SiO 2 matrix. In the first case, {{we find that the}} <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>properties</b> strongly depend on the type and the number of Si/O bonds, especially for the gap value and the arrangement of the energy levels. In the second case, the close interplay between chemical and structural effects is pointed out...|$|R
