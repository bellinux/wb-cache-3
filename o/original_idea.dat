5|$|Matt Groening {{originally}} {{pitched the}} idea that Homer would travel through time in Time and Punishment. His <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> was that the time-travel would {{be the result of}} Homer simply jamming his hand in the toaster, but it was rejected by the other writers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> of {{the book}} was {{proposed}} to García Márquez by the former minister for education Maruja Pachón Castro and Colombian diplomat Luis Alberto Villamizar Cárdenas, {{both of whom were}} among the many victims of a Pablo Escobar's attempt to pressure the government to stop his extradition by committing a series of kidnappings, murders and terrorist actions.|$|E

5|$|Karim {{said the}} {{inspiration}} for YouTube first came from Janet Jackson's role in the 2004 Super Bowl incident, when her breast was exposed during her performance, and later from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Karim could not easily find video clips of either event online, {{which led to the}} idea of a video sharing site.

The film's script was described as the <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> from the 1996 film The First Wives Club, but with younger leads. The film's title was revealed to be The Other Woman on November 13. In January of the following year, Nick Cassavetes signed on to direct the film.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we propose}} an {{interactive}} system to augment creative design thinking using networks of concepts {{in a virtual}} reality environment. We discuss how to augment the human capacity to be creative through dynamic suggestions providing new and <b>original</b> <b>ideas,</b> based on specific semantic network characteristics. We outline directions to explore the structures of the concept network and their connection to creative concept generation. It is expected that augmented creative thinking will allow the user to have more <b>original</b> <b>ideas</b> and thus be more innovative...|$|R

5|$|The <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for {{the short}} was a magician who {{incorporated}} a rabbit into his act who suffered from stage fright. This {{was considered to be}} too long and complicated, and the idea was reworked. To design the theater featured in Presto, the filmmakers visited several opera houses and theaters for set design ideas. Problems arose when trying to animate the theater's audience of 2,500 patrons; this was deemed too expensive, and was solved by showing the back of the audience.|$|E
5|$|The <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> was to {{film the}} opening {{sequence}} in 1.33:1 aspect ratio {{in order to}} simulate the TV screens that were {{available at the time}} of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{a market}} assumes primary {{importance}} {{in the study of}} what induces investment in a country. Ragnar Nurkse referenced the work of Allyn A.

5|$|This was the <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for {{the story}} to open the tenth season. This story took aspects from The Seventh Seal, with the ruler of the Time Lords playing a {{variation}} of Chess with Death, who was leading a Federation of Evil. The three Doctors would get transported to an Underworld-like realm, where they would face such creatures of evil like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and the Seven Deadly Sins. This was deemed too expensive and not suitable for a family show.|$|E
5|$|Two new {{characters}} {{were introduced in}} this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character, while the second, Herman, has been used far less. The design of Herman, {{with the exception of}} his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush. The <b>original</b> <b>idea</b> for Herman was for him to have a differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered.

It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
