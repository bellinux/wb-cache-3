5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is {{now found}} only in the Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar, but subfossil records {{indicate}} that {{it used to be}} more widely distributed in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species may have led to the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> it is still known to occur, is threatened by human development.|$|E
5|$|The European immigrant-owned bookstores {{fueled the}} demand for detective fiction, {{historical}} reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets. For many years, the Triangle was also the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods.|$|E

50|$|In North America, zebra {{crossings}} {{are almost}} exclusively called (marked) crosswalks and {{often do not}} incorporate stripes. In some areas, marked crosswalks are the <b>only</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> it is legal to cross the road (see jaywalking).|$|R
50|$|Typically nunataks are the <b>only</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> {{plant life}} can survive {{on the ice}} sheets or ice caps. Lifeforms on nunataks are {{frequently}} isolated by the surrounding ice or glacier, which contributes to provide unique habitats.|$|R
5|$|The largest was at Helmstedt-Marienborn on the Hanover–Berlin autobahn (A 2), {{through which}} 34.6million {{travellers}} passed between 1985–89. Codenamed Checkpoint Alpha, {{this was the}} first of three Allied checkpoints on the road to Berlin. The others were Checkpoint Bravo, where the autobahn crossed from East Germany into West Berlin, and most famous of all, Checkpoint Charlie, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> non-Germans could cross from West to East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Earth (1 AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the largest}} and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current {{geological}} activity, and the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> life is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, {{and it is the}} only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically {{different from those of the}} other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Seats in the Circus {{were free}} for the poor, who {{by the time of}} the Empire had little else to do, as they were no longer {{involved}} in political or military affairs as they had been in the Republic. The wealthy could pay for shaded seats where they had a better view, and they probably also spent much of their times betting on the races. The circus was the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the emperor showed himself before a populace assembled in vast numbers, and where the latter could manifest their affection or anger. The imperial box, called the pulvinar in the Circus Maximus, was directly connected to the imperial palace.|$|E

30|$|Clinical {{resistance}} {{is a complex}} phenomenon and its manifestation is dependent on many factors, but hospitals are not the <b>only</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> bacterial resistance can be developed. The use of biocides in agriculture and antibiotics in animal husbandry are two causes that accentuate the problem.|$|R
5|$|The tax on whiskey was bitterly and {{fiercely}} opposed on {{the frontier}} from {{the day it was}} passed. Western farmers considered it to be both unfair and discriminatory. As the Lower Mississippi River had been closed to American shipping for nearly a decade, farmers in western Pennsylvania were forced to turn their grain into whiskey. The substantial reduction in volume resulting from the distillation of grain into whiskey greatly reduced the cost to transport their crops to the populous east coast, which was the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> there were markets for their crops. By the third quarter of 1794, tensions reached a fevered pitch all along the western frontier as the settlers' primary marketable commodity was threatened by the federal taxation measures.|$|E
5|$|Their {{next stop}} is Agate Village, a forested {{village in the}} mountains. As Rui {{introduces}} Wes to her grandfather Eagun, another villager runs into the room, telling them that the Relic Stone—a shrine protected by Celebi—is under attack. Wes, following Eagun {{to the center of}} the tree, fights off four Cipher agents before the Relic Stone is safe. After resting, Wes is given access to the Relic Stone, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> he can purify Shadow Pokémon. After receiving an e-mail from Duking about Mt. battle being under attack by Cipher, Rui asks Eagun where it is and the two headed over there.|$|E
5|$|Uthman Pasha had {{resumed his}} {{governorship}} of Damascus {{at the end}} of June 1771 and was determined to eliminate Zahir. To that end, he assembled a coalition that included his sons Darwish Pasha al-Kurji and Muhammad Pasha al-Kurji, who were the governors of Sidon and Tripoli, respectively, and Emir Yusuf Shihab of Mount Lebanon. In late August Uthman Pasha reached Lake Hula at the head of 10,000 Ottoman troops. Before Uthman Pasha could be joined by his allies, Zahir and Sheikh Nasif of the Metawalis confronted the governor's troops on 2 September. Ali al-Zahir, Zahir's son and a commander of one of his four battlefield regiments, raided Uthman Pasha's camp, while Zahir's other troops blocked them from the west. Uthman Pasha's troops hastily retreated towards the Jordan River, the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> they were not surrounded. The overwhelming majority drowned in the river, with only 300–500 survivors, including Uthman Pasha who almost drowned but was rescued by one of his men. The Battle of Lake Hula marked a decisive victory for Zahir, who entered Acre triumphantly with the spoils of Uthman Pasha's camp. He was celebrated by the residents of the city and on the way there, he was given honorary gun salutes by each of his fortified villages on the route between Tiberias and Acre. He also received congratulations from the French merchant ships at the port of Acre. Zahir's victory encouraged Ali Bey to relaunch his Syrian campaign.|$|E

25|$|Since the Statute of Autonomy of 1979, Aranese (a dialect of Gascon Occitan) {{has also}} been {{official}} and subject to special protection in Val d'Aran.
