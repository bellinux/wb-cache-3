5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado for a lot <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> Sully owes him (who they took with them when Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, {{and try to keep}} Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> <b>That,</b> of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|During his studies, Wheeler had {{developed}} {{his love of}} archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. Considering a profession in the discipline, he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled the amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded {{a trip to the}} Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been {{strained}} since the appointment in 1932 of Éamon de Valera as Taoiseach (Prime Minister). The Anglo-Irish Trade War, {{sparked by the}} withholding <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to remove the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State. Chamberlain as Chancellor had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but he was persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions, and sought a settlement with Ireland.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I later in 1914, the WSPU suspended their suffragette activities and threw their weight behind a concerted national effort in the conflict.

25|$|Multiple {{surveys and}} polls taken from 2011 {{reveal that the}} {{majority}} of United States cat owners are against declawing, believing the practice to be cruel.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the input statistics, Croatian NGOs GONG and Transparency International Croatia have decided to hire a media analysis agency which calculated the amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was necessarily spent on advertising on television, radio and print media.

25|$|During 1928 and 1929, the Quislings bought {{numerous}} {{paintings and}} antiques, {{as well as}} silverware and furniture.

According to Maria's later statements, her mother arrived in Moscow with a sum <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was Quisling's inheritance from her father, though author Arve Juritzen has questioned whether the mother actually was in Moscow that year. She was at the time poor and relied on economic support from Vidkun.|$|E
25|$|Kmart's {{profitability}} {{and sales}} peaked in 1992, and have since declined due to competition with Walmart, Target, and internet shopping. In 1994, Kmart closed 110 stores. Unlike its competitors Walmart and Target, Kmart failed {{to invest in}} computer technology to manage its supply chain. Furthermore, Kmart maintained a high dividend, which reduced the amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> <b>that</b> was available for improving its stores. Many business analysts also faulted the company for failing to create a coherent brand image.|$|E

25|$|Until he was {{approached}} by TV Guide in December 1994, Ellison did not discuss the issues with the episode in print other than the introduction in Six Science Fiction Plays.

To his surprise, they agreed. So he wrote the article, which immediately generated a backlash from Star Trek fans.|$|E
