40|$|This paper studies how {{the price}} affects {{the demand for}} public {{transport}} in the peak- and <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> in the public transport in Stockholm. Further, the study investigates how differences in price elasticities of demand in the peak- and <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> can enable an increase in revenues {{as well as the}} total number of passengers while dampening the peak-load problem through price discrimination. The data is set up to examine the effect of the price on the number of passengers travelling by subway from January 1999 to December 2008. A number of control variables are used to isolate the effect of a price change in our econometric model. Thereafter, the elasticities of demand for each period are calculated in order to find Ramsey prices that can be used when a monopoly firm maximizes profit and minimizes the welfare loss. The study concludes that the price elasticities of demand differ between the peak- and the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> and that SL should charge a higher price in the peak-period and a lower price in the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> to both increase their revenue, the total number of passengers, and reduce their problems associated with the peak-load demand...|$|R

25|$|Peak and {{off-peak}} {{is used by}} TransLink {{to encourage}} passengers to travel during non-busy hours. TransLink does this by offering discounts to passengers for traveling during off-peak hours. Peak is from 06:00 to 08:30 and 15:30 to 19:00 weekdays, except public holidays, while off-peak is from 08:30 to 15:30 and after 19:00 weekdays until 06:00 the following day and all day weekends and gazetted public holidays. To qualify for off-peak, the journey or segment must be commenced before the off-peak period ends. If a journey straddles the peak and <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> the fare system applies an off-peak fare to all four segments of the journey if it was commenced within the off-peak period.|$|E

In some places, services on two lines combine to provide more frequent services on common sections of tracks.

2500|$|As the 1950s began, {{competition}} {{increased from}} airlines, buses, and private cars. [...] Passenger numbers began to dwindle, especially during <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> and the Railways Department began to investigate railcar alternatives {{that would be}} better suited to the service. [...] In February 1956, just over {{ten years after the}} Picton Express began operating, it was replaced by the much faster RM class 88 seater railcars. [...] The Fiat 88 seat railcars, however, proved expensive and time-consuming to maintain, and from [...] 1967 began to be phased out with Picton route reverting to older Vulcan railcars and summer passenger trains. The Picton service was regarded as a local service for North Canterbury and Malborough locals and for their convenience and because of an agreement with the Union Steam Ship company not to compete with its Lyttelton Wellington steamer express Ferry service, no southbound ferry-rail connection was available at Picton and only a limited connection with the 6:45 pm ferry northbound. When the railcars wore out in the 1970s, they were replaced by a carriage train, which was introduced partly because of the abandonment of the rival Lyttelton Wellington steamer express, with the withdrawal of the 'Rangitira' in 1976 and this reborn Picton express proved something of a success to the amazement of the Railways management who did not expect, much patronage, given the early morning departures in 1976-7 due to track damage and repairs and this train was later rebranded as the TranzCoastal. [...] Before the rebranding, this carriage train was sometimes also referred to as the Picton Express.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{difference}} between peak and off-peak occupancy rates in public transport, the average emission per traveller kilometre is lower in the peak than during the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> However, in this paper {{it is argued that}} it is much more fruitful to analyse environmental effects in marginal than in average terms. The issue appears to depend on capacity management policies of public transport suppliers that are facing increases in demand both during the peak and <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> A detailed analysis of capacity management of the Netherlands Railways reveals that the off-peak capacity supply is mainly dictated by the demand levels during the peak period. Topics that receive attention in the analysis are the effects of frequency increases and size of vehicle increases on environmental effects. Also environmental economies of vehicle size are taken into account in the analysis. The main conclusion is that the marginal environmental burden during the peak is much higher than is usually thought, whereas it is almost zero at the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> Thus, one arrives at a pattern that is entirely reversed compared with the average environmental burden: peak passengers are more polluting than off-peak passengers. The conclusion is that policies based on average environmental performances would lead to misleading conclusions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
