6000|$|The woman showed {{herself through}} the darkness. He saw her, {{as if he}} had just asked her a question, writing on her slate. What she wrote he failed to make out. It was all over in an instant. He started up, with a feeling of astonishment at himself--and, at the same moment his brain cleared with the suddenness of a flash of light. He saw his way, without a {{conscious}} effort on his own part, through the difficulty that had troubled him. Two envelopes, of course: an inner one, unsealed, and addressed to [...] "Mrs. Arnold Brinkworth;" [...] an outer <b>one,</b> <b>sealed,</b> and addressed to [...] "Mrs. Silvester:" [...] and there was the problem solved! Surely the simplest problem that had ever puzzled a stupid head.|$|E
6000|$|I sat down; I propped my {{forehead}} on both my hands; I thought and thought an hour-two hours; vainly. I seemed like <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> in a subterranean vault, who gazes at utter blackness; at blackness ensured by yard-thick stone walls around, and by piles of building above, expecting light to penetrate through granite, and through cement firm as granite. But there are chinks, or {{there may be}} chinks, in the best adjusted masonry; there was a chink in my cavernous cell; for, eventually, I saw, or seemed to see, a ray--pallid, indeed, and cold, and doubtful, but still a ray, for it showed that narrow path which conscience had promised after two, three hours' torturing research in brain and memory, I disinterred certain remains of circumstances, and conceived a hope that by putting them together an expedient might be framed, and a resource discovered. The circumstances were briefly these: ...|$|E
6000|$|But in Israel's eyes, {{the marble}} mantel (a {{comparatively}} recent addition) and its appurtenances, not only redeemed the rest, but looked quite magnificent and hospitable in the extreme. Because, {{in the first}} place, the mantel was graced with an enormous old-fashioned square mirror, of heavy plate glass, set fast, like a tablet, into the wall. And in this mirror was genially reflected the following delicate articles:--first, two boquets of flowers inserted in pretty vases of porcelain; second, one cake of white soap; third, one cake of rose-colored soap (both cakes very fragrant); fourth, one wax candle; fifth, one china tinder-box; sixth, one bottle of Eau de Cologne; seventh, one paper of loaf sugar, nicely broken into sugar-bowl size; eighth, one silver teaspoon; ninth, one glass tumbler; tenth, one glass decanter of cool pure water; eleventh, <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> bottle containing a richly hued liquid, and marked [...] "Otard." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{desert is}} {{bisected}} by only <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> road, {{a section of}} State Highway 1 known as the Desert Road. The road is closed for short periods most winters with barriers arms due to severe snow storms and icy road conditions. Turangi emergency services monitor {{the northern part of}} the Desert Road and the NZDF Military Police at Waiouru is responsible for the southern end.|$|E
50|$|Point Henry is an {{industrial}} peninsula of Geelong, located approximately 5 km {{east of the}} Geelong central business district. Only <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> road leads to Point Henry, being Point Henry Road which leaves the Portarlington Road at Moolap and travels to the Alcoa's Point Henry aluminium smelter and smaller surrounding industries. A small weather station is also located on the peninsula. Point Henry is named after Henry Reed's boat Henry.|$|E

5000|$|Items {{from the}} great mastaba (Nr 3503, 16 x 42 m) in Saqqara, where her name {{has been found in}} {{inscriptions}} on stone vessels, jars, as well as seal impressions. In particular, there is <b>one</b> <b>seal</b> from Saqqara, which shows Merneith's name in a serekh.|$|R
50|$|Recently, the Saimaa Ringed Seal, a rare {{freshwater}} seal species, {{has returned}} to Puruvesi. Sightings of this animal have occurred frequently in 2006, 2007 and 2008. At least <b>one</b> <b>seal</b> was also sighted {{in the winter of}} 2009 as having wintered and given birth {{in the eastern part of}} Puruvesi.|$|R
5000|$|The logo {{was created}} by Guo Chunning, the {{vice-president}} of the [...] "Beijing Armstrong International Corporate Identity" [...] (AICI). There was only <b>one</b> <b>seal</b> among the 1,985 entries contributed by designers from China and overseas. Other entries included dozens of Great Walls, pandas and dragons. [...] Other designers include Chang Wu (張武).|$|R
5000|$|Simplicity is {{maintained}} through usage of a single, two-directional path for the solution. Water flows {{in and out}} using the same tube. When the pump has raised water into the tray, briefly submerging the roots, the pump is rendered inactive using a switch, typically a timer, and the water flows back down the same tube. This {{eliminates the need for}} more than <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> fitting and reduces overall complexity of the system.|$|E
50|$|Its primary (antenna) and {{secondary}} circuits were both tunable by variable capacitance and inductance. A crystal detector (Type DC-1) and telephone circuit {{were connected to}} the secondary circuit. It could receive wavelengths from 250-550 meters. The receiver included two crystal (galena) detectors, <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> in glass, and the other not, which were attached {{on the surface of}} the receiver. A buzzer circuit, powered by a BA-4 battery, was mounted in the box cover and used to adjust the crystal.|$|E
5000|$|The case {{arose from}} a fatal {{accident}} {{that occurred in}} the chemistry laboratory of Patrick Harran at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Research assistant Sheharbano [...] "Sheri" [...] Sangji suffered severe burns from a fire that occurred on December 29, 2008 when a plastic syringe she was using to transfer the pyrophoric reagent tert-butyllithium from <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> container to another came apart, spilling the chemical, and igniting a fire. Sangji was not wearing a protective lab coat and her clothing caught fire, resulting in severe burns that led to her death 18 days later.|$|E

50|$|Two {{terracotta}} sealings with inscriptions; on <b>one</b> <b>seal</b> is {{a picture}} of three headed unicorn; second sealing has three consecutive stampings of Harappan seals and the stamping is done in such a manner that the inscribed upper part of all three seals is clear. The reverse of the sealings bear the mark of thread and knots.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the term is {{somewhat}} obscure, but it is first noted in historical records in the 16th century, when Henry VIII besieged Pope Clement VII with around eighty or so petitions for the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. A photo of the petitions from Cardinal Wolsey and others, now stored in the Vatican archives, {{can be seen on}} page 160 of Saints and Sinners: A History of The Popes, by Eamon Duffy (published by Yale University Press in 1997). The documents can be viewed rolled and stacked in their original condition, each <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> and bound with the obligatory red tape, as was the custom.|$|E
50|$|In the barn, Maxine {{tries to}} lay down the future plans. After the broadcast, the two {{resistance}} groups will be merged into <b>one,</b> <b>sealed</b> by a marriage between Louise and René. Edith becomes very upset at this and refuses it. It is then decided, that the two competing for René (Edith and Louise) shall fight for him. As René points out, they are not evenly matched. Therefore, Edith is allowed to appoint somebody to fight on her behalf and as Mimi volunteers, she chooses her. Since Louise {{does not want to}} get hurt, she appoints a replacement too, a rather large and strong girl called Désirée. As the fight begins, Mimi is no match for her and Désirée toys with Mimi. However, when she is not paying attention, Mimi climbs up a ladder and hits Désirée on the head with a marrow, thus rendering her unconscious.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{safety valve}} {{was invented by}} Denis Papin for his steam digester, an early {{pressure}} cooker rather than an engine. A weight acting through a lever held down a circular plug valve in the steam vessel. By using a [...] "steelyard" [...] lever a smaller weight was required, also the pressure could easily be regulated by sliding the same weight back and forth along the lever arm. Papin retained the same design for his 1707 steam pump. Early safety valves were {{regarded as one of}} the engineman's controls and required continuous attention, according to the load on the engine. In a famous early explosion at Greenwich in 1803, one of Trevithick's high-pressure stationary engines exploded when the boy trained to operate the engine left it to catch eels in the river, without first releasing the safety valve from its working load. By 1806, Trevithick was fitting pairs of safety valves, one external valve for the driver's adjustment and <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> inside the boiler with a fixed weight. This was unadjustable and released at a higher pressure, intended as a guarantee of safety.|$|E
50|$|Two Los Angeles class {{submarines}} {{have been}} modified to deploy the ASDS, and the Virginia class submarine is built with the inherent capability to deploy the mini-sub. Planners originally intended the ASDS to be piloted by one submarine officer and <b>one</b> <b>SEAL.</b> This occurred during initial testing and operational evaluation. The sub {{was designed to}} carry 16 SEALs {{in addition to the}} two pilots.|$|R
5000|$|Hinckley {{dedicated}} {{the temple}} on January 9, 1999, {{with more than}} six thousand members {{from as far away}} as the Yukon braving the freezing weather. After remodeling that nearly doubled the size of the temple, Hinckley rededicated the temple on February 8, 2004. The Anchorage Alaska Temple now has a total floor area of 11937 sq ft, two ordinance rooms, and <b>one</b> <b>sealing</b> room.|$|R
5000|$|Of several Indus valley seals {{that show}} animals, <b>one</b> <b>seal</b> that has {{attracted}} attention shows a large central figure, either horned or wearing a horned headdress and possibly ithyphallic, {{seated in a}} posture reminiscent of the Lotus position, surrounded by animals. This figure was named by early excavators of Mohenjo-daro as Pashupati (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit [...] ), an epithet of the later Hindu deities Shiva and Rudra.|$|R
5000|$|The FCC {{generally}} uses auctions {{to allocate}} bandwidth between companies. Some economists believe based on Auction Theory, auctions {{are the most}} efficient method of allocating resources. Due to {{the differences in the}} amount of data each band can transmit and the clarity of the signal, auctions allow the more desirable bands to sell for more. The United States currently auctions off bands that then become the property of purchaser. The FCC spectrum auctions have multiple rounds of bidding, as opposed to each party submitting <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> bid. The FCC, when auctioning multiple bands, auctions them simultaneously. This allows for a more efficient bidding process, and keeps bands being auctioned {{at the end of the}} auction from being over or under valued. An example of this practice was the 700 MHz auction in 2008. While this method raises billions of dollars for the government, there is concern that smaller companies may be priced out of the market and therefore rendered unable to compete with large firms. This would reduce the number of points of view in the communications industry, which would violate one of the principles of the FCC, to protect the public interest. To help mitigate this concern, the FCC often sets aside a portion of the spectrum being auctioned so that it can only be bid on by smaller industry players.|$|E

40|$|We {{establish}} {{conditions under}} which the input impedance and its first two derivatives, evaluated at the origin, uniquely determine the axial resistance, membrane capacitance, and membrane conductance of a finite uniform cable with <b>one</b> <b>sealed</b> end. We argue that this impedance data is readily available to the experimentalist and we demonstrate the recovery of a cable's electrical parameters from synthetic noisy measurements. 1. Introduction In the classical cable model of a dendritic neuron, see, e. g., Rall [R 1 [...] 2], one assumes that the potential difference, v, across the surface (membrane) of the neuron and the current, i, traveling along the neuron's axis satisfy v x (x; t) = (x; t) (1 : 1) i x (x; t) = v t (x; t) Γ Gv(x; t) (1 : 2) where 0 ! x ! `; the length (cm) of the cylinder, and the coefficients are R = 4 R a d 2; C = Cmd; and G = Gmd: Here d is the diameter (cm) of the cylinder, R a is the axial resistance(Ω cm), Cm is the membrane capacitance (F [...] ...|$|E
