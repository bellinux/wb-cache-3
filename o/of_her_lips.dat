500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] was filmed in New York City by director, Isaac Ravishankara. The song's music video is {{relative}} to the song's theme: kissing. Foreman explained, [...] " [...] the video is a play on kissing in general, and lips, and getting close up {{to a bunch of}} lips, and people coming out of mouths and just, like, really cool transitions." [...] The video follows a similar theme that is {{relative to the}} song's title, [...] "My First Kiss". It features a lot of people (punks, teachers, sailors, soldiers, lesbians, nerds, an elderly couple and hirsute rockers) [...] "smooching, kissing, and making out." [...] The video is made up of different scenes all using multi-colored backdrops as the video's dominant backing. The main scenes present are of [...] "3OH!3 bouncing around and throw punches at the camera" [...] while singing their versus and occasional close-ups of different pairs of lips that are mouthing different lyrics of the song. Kesha is also present throughout the video, mainly on her verses where she is seen in close-ups <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and dancing around the screen on the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|In the videos, Miranda {{sings in}} a comically off-key, yet plausible, voice and covers mostly pop music hits, rants about {{internet}} haters, gives [...] "tutorials", and sometimes discusses the character's backstory or current events, which she usually misunderstands. She uses spoonerisms and malapropisms, is irritable, ludicrously self-absorbed and self-righteous, socially awkward, {{and has a}} defiant, arrogant attitude. She responds to viewers who take the videos seriously and offer criticism with the catchphrase, [...] "Haters back off!", telling these critics that [...] "haters make me famous". The character displays unusually active eyebrows and a crooked smile, her head is cocked to one side, and she has pronunciation quirks. She wears bright red lipstick drawn beyond the borders <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> dresses in mismatched out-of-style clothing, and often dances stiffly to the music she is performing. Her views of society and morality are politically incorrect, and she displays a strong aversion to anything risque, which she calls [...] "porn". From 2010 to 2012, Ballinger posted 86 Miranda video blogs to a second Miranda YouTube channel, Mirandavlogz.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} displays eccentric facial traits such as unusually active {{eyebrows and}} a crooked smile {{described as a}} [...] "side smirk". Her head is cocked to one side, and her pronunciation quirks include {{an emphasis on the}} use of a prominent hard 'g' (in such words as 'singing' and 'song'). In place of lyrics that she cannot remember, the character [...] "scat" [...] sings. She wears bright red lipstick drawn beyond the borders <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> her hair pulled up at the temples to expose the maximum amount of forehead, dresses in mismatched out-of-style clothing (such as a men's shirt buttoned to the neck with red sweatpants), and often dances stiffly to the music she is performing. Miranda's views of society and morality are politically incorrect, and she displays a strong prudish aversion to anything risque, which she calls [...] "porn". Some of the videos show Miranda duetting with well-known singers or instrumentalists. Since 2013, Miranda has frequently collaborated on videos with other YouTube personalities that are shown on their channels, often accumulating millions of views. People magazine featured a Miranda collaboration with Tyler Oakley and Bethany Mota. Until March 2013, her YouTube audience was relatively modest, but in that month, her channel's audience reached 150,000 subscribers and began to expand more rapidly.|$|E
60|$|She stopped, {{gazing into}} Courtland's {{face with a}} pretty vague impatience and a slight pouting <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{grasped the}} balcony rail, and I think {{would have fallen}} but for my arm. Then she straightened, and only the quiver <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> marked the effort.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, madam--very good," [...] said the poor little Margaret, while the anxious {{trembling}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> and <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hand showed all that sickening agitation {{of the heart}} which arises from hope deferred.|$|R
60|$|She smiled very slightly, but {{the curve}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> was delightful.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} subtlest of smiles flickered {{at the corners}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a little twitch at the corners <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Shelton {{caught the}} cringing glance of the girl's eyes; in the droop <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> there was {{something}} sensuous, and {{the conviction that the}} young man's words were true came over him.|$|R
6000|$|The Lady {{she sat in}} Saint Swithin's Chair, [...] The dew of {{the night}} has damp'd her hair: [...] Her cheek was pale; but {{resolved}} and high [...] Was the word <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> and the glance <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "I only {{talked of}} what I'd heard, aunt Vashti," [...] said Cecilia indignantly. [...] "And he {{afterwards}} talked of--of--my voice, and said I had a heavenly gift," [...] she added, {{with a slight}} quiver <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R
60|$|Gyp bent {{her face}} over her baby {{to hide the}} quivering <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Joan's {{eyes were}} bright with battle, the curve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> sharp with mockery.|$|E
60|$|The answer is, {{the ready}} {{pressure}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> upon the cold but smiling mouth.|$|E
6000|$|She {{moved her}} head upon the white column <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, {{and with the}} gesture one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brown curls became disordered. I could fancy the upward tilt <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{delicate}} nose, the scornful curve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> as she answered shortly [...] "Then say it quickly, monsieur." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a look full <b>of</b> kindness. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> {{outlined}} a charming smile.|$|R
60|$|Strive as I might I {{could not}} rid my tone of an ironical inflection. I was goaded {{to it by}} her attitude, by the scornful turn <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> and the disdainful glance <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grey eyes--she had her father's eyes, saving that her gaze was as steadfast as his was furtive.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked down}} {{at him with a}} half pathetic, half humorous {{twitching}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Thorpe-Satchell looked {{straight}} {{at him with a}} faint smile at the corners <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|She made {{a little}} grimace, but {{immediately}} afterwards he saw the cold tightening <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|He met her dilating glance, {{noted the}} quivering <b>of</b> <b>her</b> parted <b>lips.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ashwood {{turned the}} slip over with scornful impatience, a pretty {{uplifting}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows {{and a slight}} curl <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "I suppose none of those people's beginnings can bear looking into--and they certainly should be the last ones to find fault with anybody. But, good gracious, Jack! what has this to do with you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{blue eyes}} clouded, and a tremor changed the {{expression}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sweet <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|She became indiscreet. She {{looked at}} him with a little smile at the corners <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|She kept {{close to}} him, {{and he did}} not see the wince and quiver <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|He saw the {{hardening}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> {{the flash}} {{in her eyes}} {{at the mention of}} Somerfield's name.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Heckman, laconic, quizzical, walked about [...] "the reservation" [...] with me, {{and in her}} smiling eyes I {{detected}} a kind of gentle amusement with her unconventional neighbors. She said nothing then (or at any time) which {{could be interpreted as}} criticism, but a merry little quirk in the corner <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> instructed me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dinner is over, {{neighbour}} Loveday; {{please come}} in,' said the widow, seeing his case. The miller {{said something about}} coming in presently; but Anne pressed him to stay, with a tender motion <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> as it played {{on the verge of}} a solicitous smile without quite lapsing into one--her habitual manner when speaking.|$|R
60|$|Her kind {{blue eyes}} met mine in an infinitude <b>of</b> friendliness. <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> in <b>her</b> pauses shaped {{in a pretty}} faint smile.|$|R
60|$|Tony saw {{the slight}} {{trembling}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and laughed somewhat inanely {{as he held}} out his hands.|$|E
60|$|He {{was silent}} for some moments. The faint curve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> had again given him almost a shock.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes drew his. He almost fancied {{that the}} quiver {{at the corners}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> was of mirth.|$|E
60|$|He came nearer still. His hand rested {{against the}} wall, {{within a few}} inches <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>lips</b> were a little parted, but her eyes flashed.|$|R
6000|$|They {{had reached}} the {{entrance}} to the mansion, and entered the hall. Thankful turned impulsively, and kissed the extended hand of the commander. [...] "You are so good! I have been so foolish--so very, very wrong," [...] she said, with a slight trembling <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "And your Excellency believes my story; and those gentlemen were NOT spies, but even as they gave themselves to be." ...|$|R
60|$|I glanced anxiously at Dorothy, and {{saw that}} she was neither {{satisfied}} nor appeased. Well I remembered every turn <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, and every curve <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip!</b> In the meantime we were off through Cursitor Street at a gallop, nearly causing the death of a ragged urchin at the corner of Chancery Lane. I had forgotten my eagerness to know whence they had heard of my plight, when some words from Comyn aroused me.|$|R
