50|$|The Victorian Railways in Australia changed only {{isolated}} <b>distant</b> <b>signals,</b> leaving combined {{home and}} <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> showing green over red at the caution position. The New South Wales Government Railways retained the red <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> everywhere, adding a fixed upper green light so that an isolated <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> displayed green over red, like a combined home and <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> at caution.|$|R

50|$|Every <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> {{is mounted}} with a Ne2 plate to mark their {{position}} (if this plate was not fitted, the driver {{would not know}} if he had passed the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> or not when showing aspect Vr1, since in this position it is practically invisible). <b>Distant</b> <b>signal</b> repeaters or <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> mounted in combination with a main signal {{do not have a}} Ne2 plate.|$|R

50|$|A <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> (遠方信号機, enpō shingōki) is {{installed}} before a home signal with limited visibility and {{is linked to}} the home <b>signal.</b> <b>Distant</b> <b>signals</b> are primarily installed in non-automatic block sections on single-track lines. They may have two (caution and clear) or three (caution, reduced-speed and clear) displays. With multiple home <b>signals,</b> the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> applies to all.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} of this design over the standard <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> of the Reichsbahn was that it displayed a clearly visible signal aspect in each position. As a result, it did not need a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> board (Vorsignaltafel). This was hesitantly retrofitted by the Reichsbahn from 1936. After the Second World War, however, <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> without signal boards could still be found in Bavaria.|$|R

50|$|In some cases, mostly {{entering}} stations, home <b>signals</b> and <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> can {{be found}} on the same mast; in this case the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> is linked to the next home signal.|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century, a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> on the Victorian Railways {{required}} {{the train to}} stop when the signal was at red, not just to proceed with caution {{as is the case}} now. However, having stopped at a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> at red, the train could then proceed carefully to the home signal, being prepared to stop short of any obstruction between the two <b>signals.</b> Thus the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> at that time was a bit like a later [...] "outer home" [...] signal. That practice at a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> at that time may have been a factor in the Sunshine rail accident of 1908.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> {{is close}} to a {{following}} home signal (i.e. when the distance between two consecutive home signals is equal to or lower than 1,500 meters, or a maximum of 2,000 meters in special cases), the two signals are combined into a single signal with a home function {{as well as a}} <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> for the home signal immediately following. These are called coupled <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> (avviso accopiato).|$|R
5000|$|Where {{signals are}} closely spaced, a stop <b>signal</b> and a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> can be {{mounted on the}} same post. The <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> is always the lower of the two. The two signals are [...] "slotted" [...] so that the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> can only clear if the stop signal is clear. Both signals display a light at night, {{which means that the}} 'danger' {{indication}} appears as red over yellow.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1920s, <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> were {{coloured}} red, with a {{red light}} at night. Given that their meanings were different, it was obviously unsatisfactory to have both home and <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> showing the same colour, {{but one of the}} problems which delayed a change in the colour of <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> to yellow was the lack of a suitable yellow glass for the spectacle frame. Some British railway companies used the Coligny-Welch signal lamp to clarify night aspects; this was fitted to <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> and showed a white vee in addition to the main red or green light. The Ministry of Transport recommended that the colour of <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> arms and spectacles be altered from red to yellow in the early 1920s, although this was not universally adopted in the UK until the late 1920s. Since this time, the yellow caution aspect has remained a British railway standard.|$|R
50|$|Hl-signals {{are used}} only in East Germany. The {{upper part of}} the <b>signal</b> is a <b>distant</b> <b>signal,</b> the lower part is the main signal. Signals can be found without the main signal section or without the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> section.|$|R
5000|$|A main signal, {{shunting}} signal or a Ne1 {{will be found}} at braking distance. Unless a <b>distant</b> <b>signal,</b> <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> repeater or main signal is visible, the train driver treats this signal as [...] "Vr0 or Ks2: Expect Stop".|$|R
5000|$|If the {{distance}} between the stop <b>signal</b> and a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> is too short (it can sometimes get down to 400m), then the previous <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> has a yellow flashing to inform the driver of the short distance between the two following signals.|$|R
5000|$|From 1872, <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> arms (see below) were {{distinguished}} {{by having a}} [...] "fishtail" [...] notch cut into the end. All signal arms were still painted red at this time. In the 1920s, the British railway companies began to colour their <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> arms yellow to better distinguish them from the red stop signals. The red lenses in <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> were changed to yellow at the same time. The practice of using red distant arms has survived in some countries however.|$|R
5000|$|From 1922, {{the night}} aspects of Bavarian <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> {{corresponded to the}} {{standard}} Vr 0 and Vr 1. Until 1922, however, a green light meant 'caution'. For the 'clear' aspect, the green lens was folded away and a white signal lamp appeared. It is interesting that the Bavarian <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> only knew two aspects. 'Caution' always meant [...] "expect a stop signal". In addition, to begin with, a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> was only installed, if the home signal could not be seen within the train's braking distance.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: British {{semaphore}} <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> (lower quadrant type) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> {{is located}} at least 1200 m before the main signal.It may also {{be located in the}} same post with a main signal, below it. In this {{combined}} arrangement, whenever the main signal shows a stop aspect, the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> doesn't show any aspect at all.|$|R
50|$|A <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> is {{one that}} cannot display a 'danger' aspect. It is however able to display a 'caution' aspect, which gives the driver advance warning that the stop signal ahead may be {{displaying}} 'danger'. The <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> is installed roughly at full braking distance on approach to the stop signal to which it applies, {{taking into account the}} gradient, the permitted speed, and the braking performance of trains. On sighting a 'caution' aspect, the driver must prepare to stop at the signal ahead. If the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> shows a 'clear' aspect, the train may maintain full speed. A single signal may be equipped to function both as a stop <b>signal</b> and a <b>distant</b> <b>signal.</b> Some <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> are {{in the form of a}} 'fixed distant'. That is: they only ever display a 'caution' aspect and never a 'clear' one. Such signals are usually in the form of a standard distant arm fixed in the horizontal position to the signal post. An alternate form is a picture of a horizontal distant arm painted onto a white board.|$|R

50|$|Semaphore <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> in New South Wales are {{fitted with}} a fixed green light, {{positioned}} above the arm and spectacle, {{so that they may}} be easily distinguished from stop signals at night.

5000|$|Established in 1925, Asansol Division {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{divisions}} of Indian Railways. On the Howrah-Delhi main line, its jurisdiction extends from the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> of Khana junction to the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> of Jhajha [...] On the Grand Chord line its jurisdiction extends up to the <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> of Pradhankhunta. Branch lines under its jurisdiction are: Andal-Sainthia, Andal-Tapasi-Barabani-Sitarampur, Madhupur-Giridih, Jasidih-Baidyanathdham and Jasidih-Dumka. With a total of 565 route kilometers, the division has quadruple lines (two up and two down line) from Khana to Sitarampur. It handles 100 mail/express trains daily and 212 passenger train runs per day. The number of originating passengers per day is 144,070.|$|R

50|$|A {{signal that}} {{provides}} advance warning of a stop signal ahead (and {{which does not}} compel a stop when in its most restrictive position) {{is referred to as}} <b>distant</b> <b>signal.</b> The term originated in the UK and is used throughout the English-speaking world. In some regions, notably North America, the terms <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> and approach signal are both in common usage.|$|R
50|$|A <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> {{can either}} be an {{automatic}} signal before an interlocking, or the interlocking signal itself when interlockings are back to back. <b>Distant</b> <b>signals</b> typically display more aspects than a typical block or interlocking signal to warn trains of diverging movements at the next interlocking however {{this is not always}} the case if there are no diverging paths available.|$|R
50|$|Diversity {{combining}} reduces {{one possible}} single-point failure: any single receiver failure, or local interference {{to a single}} receiver, will not block reception on the entire system. Equipment sites can host many radio transmitters and receivers. A single site is subject to local, site-specific interfering signals. These interfering signals may {{come and go as}} transmitters switch on and off. A potential problem with receivers located at high-elevation receiver sites is that they may acquire <b>signals</b> from <b>distant</b> counties, prefectures, or other provinces. These unwanted, <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> can be stronger than desired signals from local walkie-talkies. The <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> may block local weak signals in some cases. Having several receive sites increases the probability that one of the sites will receive the local signal {{in the presence of a}} distant, undesired one. Selective calling can eliminate users having to listen to the audio of <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> even though the <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> are within receive range of one or more receivers.|$|R

50|$|The Great Western Railway {{developed}} a system {{referred to as}} Automatic train control (ATC). In its developed form it gave drivers an audible and visual indication in the cab of the aspect of a <b>distant</b> <b>signal</b> as it was approached or passed. If a warning was given and not acknowledged by the driver, the train brakes would be applied. Track equipment near the <b>distant</b> <b>signals</b> operated detection equipment on the locomotive.|$|R
