5|$|The {{environmental}} {{movement in the}} American Southwest has opposed the damming and diversion of the Colorado River system because of {{detrimental effects on the}} ecology and natural beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> its tributaries. During the construction of Glen Canyon Dam, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>and</b> a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.|$|E
5|$|Artist Matthew Ritchie was {{commissioned}} to create {{much of the}} building's artwork. One piece is a metal sculpture located on the exterior in the courtyard that mimics the nearby Willamette River's watershed, and includes metal spheres attached to the line shaped metal. The other main piece of art is a piece with two lightboxes on the interior that display different images as one moves along the display that uses lenticular glass. Images represent themes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> of legal history.|$|E
5|$|As the Brazilian {{army was}} ready for combat, Caxias sought to {{encircle}} Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. To aid the operation, he used observation balloons to gather information of the enemy lines. The combined Brazilian–Argentine–Uruguayan army advanced through hostile territory to surround Humaitá. By 2 November, Humaitá was completely cut off from land reinforcement by Paraguayan forces. On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It {{was a place of}} great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nearby}} Second Battle of Naktong Bulge, the North Korean People's Army {{broke through the}} US Army's 2nd Infantry Division lines along the Naktong River.

5|$|In the mid 1530s, {{the natives}} of western Honduras {{resisted}} the Spanish incursions, their efforts {{were led by}} Sicumba in the Ulúa valley.

5|$|On the {{opposite}} bank of the Mississippi, a second simultaneous attack on the nearby former British colonial outpost of Cahokia, occupied by Patriot Virginians, was also repulsed.

5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> <b>and</b> the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> city <b>of</b> São Paulo {{has great}} part of its humid areas drained and filled with earth. <b>The</b> {{occupation}} <b>of</b> fertile valleys brings diverse problems for the city, compromising <b>the</b> natural landscape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> streams. <b>The</b> problems enclose since <b>the</b> interruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environmental processes to questions of superficial draining.

5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{expanded}} its railroad connections and industrial activity. It suffered a corresponding rise in pollution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> waterfront. During the early 1870s, the Eads Bridge was constructed over the Mississippi River, {{and the city}} established several large parks, including Forest Park. Due to local political and economic disputes, the city separated from St. Louis County in 1876 and became an independent city. Its limited geographic area has inhibited its success in the 20th and 21st centuries {{because of the small}} tax base. During the late 19th century, St. Louis became home to two Major League Baseball teams. Ragtime and blues music flourished in the city, with African Americans making major contributions also in jazz.|$|E
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|At 02:00 on 15 April Océan {{finally began}} to move again, {{reaching}} safety upriver by 03:30. Several other ships were exposed, but without a bomb vessel they lay beyond {{the range of the}} British fleet. The French sailors made significant efforts to retrieve these ships over the following days; on 16 April Indienne was deemed too damaged to be saved, abandoned, and set on fire. The frigate exploded at midday. The following day Foudroyant and Tourville reached safety, and only Régulus now remained vulnerable. For several days in severe gales and heavy rain the ship remained stranded in the mud while Wolfe worked to bring up newly arrived replacement bomb vessel HMS Thunder. An attack on 20 April failed after the gun spilt almost immediately, and a larger scale attack with both bomb vessels and smaller ships failed on 24 April. No further attempts were made to destroy Régulus, and on 29 April the ship was finally refloated and brought to safety in the Charente. On the same day Gambier finally abandoned his blockade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>and</b> sailed his fleet for England.|$|E
