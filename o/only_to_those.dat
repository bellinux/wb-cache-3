5|$|Article Seven of the {{proposed}} Constitution set the terms by which the new frame of government would be established.

5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{the sacrament}} of {{initiation}} into the visible church, or body of people who publicly claim faith in Christ. Baptism also signifies regeneration and remission of sin. Reformed Christians believe that the children of those who express faith in Christ should be baptized. Because baptism {{is believed to be}} beneficial <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who have faith in Christ, infants are baptized {{on the basis of the}} promise of faith which will come to fruition later in life.|$|E

5|$|In mid-July Warwick had to {{withdraw}} from government to his estates on account of illness. When he died on 12 August 1315, political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had had Warwick poisoned. He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire, an establishment to which his family had been benefactors. In value, his possessions were second <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of the earl of Lancaster among the nobility of England.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} a {{renovation}} project, Domitian's building program {{was intended to be}} the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural renaissance. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of Augustus. Among the most important new structures were an odeon, a stadium, and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect Rabirius.|$|E
5|$|The {{privilege}} of peerage {{is the body}} of special privileges belonging {{to members of the}} British peerage.

5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as begging for money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{firearms}} possession {{was banned}} during German Nazi occupation and then allowed <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> deemed loyal during the Communist regime, {{the right to}} be armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's {{political}} importance did not {{end with}} his death; his disappearance from the political scene had immediate consequences. In his Welsh lordship of Glamorgan, the uncertain situation caused by his death caused a short-lived rebellion in 1316. In Ireland, where he also held large possessions, the power vacuum he left behind facilitated the 1315 invasion by Robert the Bruce's brother Edward. The greatest consequences, however, resulted from {{the division of the}} de Clare estates. In 1308, Gilbert de Clare had married Maud (or Matilda) de Burgh, the daughter of Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster. The couple left no surviving issue, so his death marked the end of the great de Clare family. The family lands were worth as much as £6,000, second <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> of the Earl of Lancaster among the nobility of the realm.|$|E

5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The bottom of each elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to demographic losses through significant migrations, {{the population of}} Croatia suffered significant losses due to wars and epidemics. In the 20th century alone, there were several such events. The first was World War I, when {{the loss of the}} population of Croatia amounted to an estimated 190,000 persons, or about 5.5% of the total population recorded by the 1910 census. The 1918 flu pandemic started to take its toll in Croatia in July 1918, with peaks of the disease occurring in October and November. Available data is scarce, but it is estimated that the pandemic caused at least 15,00020,000 deaths. During World War II, nearly 195,000 people died in the territory of present-day Croatia. The surrender of the armed forces of the Independent State of Croatia and of the civilians accompanying the troops of the British Army at the end of World War II was followed by repatriation and subsequent events that became known as the Bleiburg tragedy. A substantial number of people were executed, but the exact number is disputed. The claims range from 12,00015,000 to as many as 80,000 killed in May 1945. Finally, approximately 20,000 were killed or went missing during the 19911995 Croatian War of Independence. The figure pertains <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> persons who would have been recorded by the 1991 census as living in Croatia.|$|E
