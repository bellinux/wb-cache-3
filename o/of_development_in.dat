It was reported that Chris Columbus had signed on to produce, and that Cyrus Nowrasteh had already completed the script. On November 8, 2014, during an interview with her long-time editor, Victoria Wilson, at the Chicago Humanities Festival, Rice revealed that filming had finished on the movie and was going into post-production. The film, titled The Young Messiah, was released in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The bicycle kick {{was invented}} in South America, {{possibly}} {{as early as the}} late 19th century, during a period <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> football history. Innovations like the bicycle kick were the result of local adaptations to the football style introduced by British immigrants. Football lore has many legends on the possible origins of the bicycle kick. Newspaper archives {{from the beginning of the}} 20th century evidence a complex, multinational history for the bicycle kick's invention, naming, and diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1921 and spurred {{a new wave}} <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> South Jacksonville. New subdivisions were platted in Oklahoma and Villa Alexandria, {{including}} South Shores, Alexandria Place, River Oaks, and the original San Marco development, while the old Red Bank plantation became South Riverside and Colonial Manor. The 1857 the Red Bank Plantation House became a residence in the Colonial Manor neighborhood that grew around it; it is Jacksonville's second oldest residential building still in use. The bridge triggered economic development in South Jacksonville as well, though it greatly reduced the ferry business, which disappeared entirely within twenty years.|$|E

5|$|The main {{land use}} in the {{watershed}} of Mud Creek is agricultural land, which accounts for 62.97 {{percent of the total}} area. 31.49 percent of the watershed is forested and 5.54 percent is developed land.

Most of the developed land is near Jerseytown and Washingtonville, but there are several other small areas <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> the watershed's lower reaches and a few other areas in its upper reaches.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{shaped the}} {{political}} ideology of E.V. Ramasamy {{to achieve the}} social concept of Self-Respect. The communist system obtained in Russia appealed to him as appropriately suited {{to deal with the}} social ills of the country. Thus, on socio-economic issues Periyar was Marxist, but he did not advocate for abolishing private ownership. Immediately after his return, E.V. Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist, M. Singaravelar, began to work out a socio-political scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals. This marked a crucial stage <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> the Self-Respect Movement which got politicised and found its compatibility in Tamil Nadu.|$|E

5|$|An online {{petition}} {{was formed}} {{in response to the}} concerns raised about the planned mosque, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent the building of the mosque; the petition closed with over 250,000 signatures and was at the time the most signed petition on the site. Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E
5|$|By 1871 Burnside {{had grown}} significantly; {{it was now}} a mix of villages {{supporting}} a modest population of 1,557. By comparison, Kensington-Norwood, though smaller in area, had grown to 5,132 persons. Glen Osmond, still affected by its immense growth following the expansion of mining, was the largest single population centre with 343 residents. The District Council had also constructed its first council chambers in December 1869, finally concluding the haphazard meeting agreement. Two villages, Beulah Park (North Kensington) and Eastwood experienced booms in population growth and development between 1870 and 1880, providing both housing to new immigrants and investments for the wealthy Adelaide Establishment. Parkside Hospital (now Glenside), a mental health asylum was constructed in 1866 to replace a crowded building in the Parklands. Built on beautifully tended grounds and with an elaborate façade, it was an early Burnside architectural monument. In 1881 Thomas Cooper started brewing South Australia's first branded beer, 'Coopers', at Leabrook. During this era, Stonyfell saw economic expansion as well; its large quarry changed hands in 1867 and the Stonyfell Olive Co was founded in 1873. The late 19th century was a significant time <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> Burnside. This development, however, was brought {{to an abrupt end}} in the last decade, the 1890s, when depression stuck the economies of Australasia after decades of reckless expansion, hitting Burnside hard.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the owner}} of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also {{purchased}} the Old Lifeboat House {{at the end of the}} spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> <b>In</b> 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced off until the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, especially those of the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> <b>In</b> other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

5|$|While there aren’t many {{external}} morphological {{differences between}} queens and workers {{there are some}} internal traits that can be signals of a wasp’s social status. It has also been found that caste determination is irreversibly determined by temperature during the immature stages <b>of</b> <b>development.</b> <b>In</b> one experiment, some wasps emerging in June were kept in long day chambers, or chambers set at 26°C with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. These individuals had larger and more active ovaries as {{compared to those who}} were incubated in short day chambers, which are set at 22°C with 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness. It is thought that this phenomenon may occur because of a juvenile hormone secretion that determines the castes and a suppression of the workers’ ovaries by environmental or hormonal factors.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological imperatives <b>of</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E
