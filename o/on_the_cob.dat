5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's in New York. When he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob.</b>|$|E

The {{municipality}} has a small archipelago with some 30 islands, called Tösse skärgård, to the south of the city. The islands are protected as a nature preserve; many of the islands are wooded, but a few are used for farming. They provide habitat for a number of bird species, including heron, osprey, mallard, goldeneye, goosander, the black-throated diver and hobby in <b>the</b> bays; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cobs</b> are colonies of herring gull, seagull and the common tern; while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fir-covered islands are capercaillie, woodpeckers and other birds.|$|R

25|$|In the United States, {{barbecue}} restaurants {{may offer}} dishes that are slow-smoked or barbecued over a grill. Fare includes barbecue sandwiches, brisket, barbecue chicken, pulled pork, pork shoulder, pork ribs, beef ribs, beefsteak and other foods. Various side dishes are typically available, such as baked beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw and corn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob,</b> among others. A variety of barbecue sauces may be available, and some barbecue restaurants bottle their own sauces for customer purchase. Some barbecue restaurants prepare their foods without any sauces, {{and may not}} offer any as condiments. This may occur per a preference for {{the flavor of the}} meats to stand on their own, rather than being accentuated with flavors from sauces. Some barbecue restaurants use a dry spice rub to flavor meats.|$|E
25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|E

2500|$|Maize {{can also}} be {{harvested}} and consumed in the unripe state, when the kernels are fully grown but still soft. Unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable; this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob. Sweet corn, a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch, is usually consumed in the unripe state. Such corn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> is a common dish in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Cyprus, some parts of South America, and the Balkans, but virtually unheard of in some European countries. Corn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> was hawked {{on the streets of}} early 19th-century New York City by poor, barefoot [...] "Hot Corn Girls", who were thus the precursors of hot dog carts, churro wagons, and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today. The cooked, unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a vegetable in side dishes, salads, garnishes, etc. Alternatively, the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes, such as maize purée, tamales, pamonhas, curau, cakes, ice creams, etc.|$|E

50|$|The tundra swans mate in {{the late}} spring, usually after they have {{returned}} to the nesting grounds; as usual for swans, they pair monogamously until one partner dies. Should one partner die long before the other, the surviving bird often will not mate again for some years, or even for its entire life. The nesting season starts at the end of May. The pair build the large mound-shaped nest from plant material at an elevated site near open water, and defend a large territory around it. The pen (female) lays and incubates a clutch of 2-7 (usually 3-5) eggs, watching for danger while sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nest. <b>The</b> <b>cob</b> (male) keeps a steady lookout for potential predators heading towards his mate and offspring. When either of them spots a threat, they give a warning sound to let their partner know that danger is approaching. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> will use his wings to run faster and appear larger in order to scare away a predator.|$|R

In July 1992, the Washington Business Journal said the 390-seat Old Ebbitt Grill grossed more money than any other restaurant in the D.C. metropolitan area. (It spent $17,000 a month on table linens). The Washington Post's Phyllis Richman claimed the combination of superb hamburgers with seasonal foods (fresh Alaskan halibut during three weeks, corn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> in the summer, locally grown vegetables and berries) was what drew customers. In May 1994, Old Ebbitt Grill added a take-out service, Ebbitt Express, in the atrium section of its restaurant.|$|E

50|$|From 2011, {{with the}} WHR now {{connected}} to the station via the CTRL, a new short platform and point work {{was added to the}} eastward side of the existing platform structure/Spooners Bar. Too short to hold the longer WHR trains, WHR trains were hence scheduled to pull <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> and stop, and then a pilot locomotive was attached to the rear to drag the complete WHR train into the station. This operation was reversed on departure, and due to the need for both lines to use <b>the</b> <b>cob</b> and single platform, resulted in only one train operation in the station at any time. This arrangement was always seen as a temporary solution, until the funds could be found to rebuild the station.|$|R

40|$|Shades for {{reducing}} available irradiance were placed over field-grown plants to measure light effects on root and shoot morphology and phenology. As {{reported in the}} past the ratios of leaf and shoot biomass to leaf area decreased with shade intensity. The 20 %-of-ambient treatment greatly reduced corn root growth, but the trend from 70 to 27 % ambient was weak. Kernel row numbers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corn <b>cob</b> were sensitive to shade level. In general soybean was more shade tolerant than corn. The treatments supplying 49 to 20 %-of-ambient resulted in longer internodes in soybean, which induced severe lodging.

40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{potential}} increase in the use of alkaline protease as industrial catalysts. Many major industrial and commercial applications, such as food and textile industries, and medical diagnoses, are highly dependent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> protease enzyme. In the cell immobilization technique, the free movement of microorganisms is restricted in the process, and a continuous system of fermentation can be used. In the present work, this technique has been used for alkaline protease production using different carriers, such as chitosan, corn cob and corn tassel. Enzyme activity before immobilization (72  h) was 78. 3  U/ml. Corn cob, with 65 % immobilization capacity and the highest enzyme activity, was selected as the best carrier. After immobilization <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corn <b>cob</b> enzyme, activity was obtained (119. 67  U/ml) ...|$|R
