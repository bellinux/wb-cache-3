5|$|According to Plutarch, Alcibiades {{had several}} famous teachers, {{including}} Socrates, and was well {{trained in the}} art <b>of</b> <b>Rhetoric.</b> He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. It was believed that Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.|$|E
5|$|Although Pericles was a {{main source}} of his inspiration, some historians have noted that the passionate and idealistic {{literary}} style of the speeches Thucydides attributes to Pericles is completely at odds with Thucydides' own cold and analytical writing style.

That is to say, Thucydides could simply have used two different writing styles for two different purposes.|$|E

5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household.

40|$|Empathy {{has been}} {{commonly}} evoked within rhetoric and composition {{as a way}} to understand audiences and as a classroom ethic. This dissertation goes further in defining <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy, analyzing the uses <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy in political and social discourse, and proposing how <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy might inform the ways we teach reading and writing. The first chapter defines <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy through a survey of empathy 2 ̆ 7 s place in the rhetorical tradition, including Aristotle 2 ̆ 7 s theories of emotion, ideas of compassion in the Scottish Enlightenment, and Kenneth Burke 2 ̆ 7 s concept of identification. This rhetorical history is combined with contemporary understandings of empathy from developmental psychology and moral philosophy. The resulting definition is <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy as means of persuasion notable for combining the cognitive and the affective within our perspective-taking faculties, social relations, and moral judgments. The importance <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy in political discourse is shown in an analysis of Barack Obama 2 ̆ 7 s speeches, which both promote and perform positions of empathy. Obama 2 ̆ 7 s speeches are further shown to employ empathy through allegory, particularly in the telling of Obama 2 ̆ 7 s own story as an occasion for empathizing with multiple American identities. A series of first-person accounts of the nearly and newly homeless from the Las Vegas Sun are used to illustrate the contested conditions <b>of</b> <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy based upon readings of suffering, victimhood, and the overlap between self and other. An argument then is made for composition pedagogies that work with empathy as rhetorical appeal and as a disposition that can be cultivated through habits of reading and writing. The proposed pedagogies include an attention to perspective-taking and the perceived human reality of issues. They also require an awareness that empathy is always at best an approximation, one inherently tied to differences in experiences and social relations. This dissertation maintains at the end that <b>rhetorics</b> <b>of</b> empathy are valuable precisely because of the paradoxical questions they foreground, those of the cognitive and the affective, our relationships and responsibilities to one another, and the critical necessity of recognizing our always present differences alongside a shared humanity...|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method <b>of</b> <b>rhetoric</b> schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E
5|$|During {{most of the}} 4th century, the Christian {{community}} was small, poor, and carried no influence in the city. The church was insignificant and its members {{were not allowed to}} hold political office. However, conversion to Christianity in Gaza was spearheaded under Saint Porphyrius between 396 and 420. In 402, after obtaining a decree from the emperor, he ordered all eight of the city's pagan temples destroyed and idol worship was forbidden by the Byzantine government. Paganism continued and Christians were still persecuted in the city, forcing St. Porphyrius to undertake more measures. As a result of his persuasion, Empress Aelia Eudocia commissioned the construction of a church atop the ruins of the Temple of Marnas in 406. (Note that according to MacMullen it is likely that Porphyrius did not even exist.) Persecution against Christians did not cease, but it was less harsh and frequent than previously. A large 6th century synagogue with a mosaic tile floor depicting King David was discovered in Gaza. An inscription states that the floor was donated in 508–509 CE by two merchant brothers. Around 540, Gaza became the starting point for pilgrimages to the Sinai Peninsula. It was an important city in the early Christian world and many famous scholars taught at its academy <b>of</b> <b>rhetoric,</b> including 6th-century scholar Procopius of Gaza. The celebrated Church of Saint Sergius was built in this century.|$|E
5|$|His father, Euzebiusz Słowacki, a Polish nobleman of the Leliwa coat of arms, taught rhetoric, poetry, Polish language, and {{the history}} of {{literature}} at the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Kremenets; from 1811 he held the chair (katedra) <b>of</b> <b>rhetoric</b> and poetry at Vilnius Imperial University. He died in 1814, leaving Juliusz to be raised solely by his mother, Salomea Słowacka (née Januszewska, a noblewoman of disputed descent), who was of either Jewish or Armenian descent. In 1818 she married a professor of medicine, August Bécu. She ran a literary salon where young Juliusz was exposed to diverse influences. It was there in 1822 that the 13-year-old met Adam Mickiewicz, the first of the Three Bards of Polish literature. Two years later, in 1824, Mickiewicz was arrested and exiled by the Russian authorities for his involvement in a secret patriotic Polish student society, the Philomaths; Słowacki likely met with him on Mickiewicz's final day in Wilno.|$|E

5|$|Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired {{a series}} of {{hearings}} into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's CEO, argued {{that there was little}} point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX concept be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor. Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX. He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France's aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee's concluding remarks, the State Department and DOD were accused <b>of</b> <b>rhetoric,</b> and lacking support, on FX.|$|E

Deliberative (also known as political), was concerned with determining whether or not particular actions should or should not be taken in the future.
