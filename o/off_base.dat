25|$|TCKs {{who have}} {{parents or guardians}} {{affiliated}} with the military have varying levels of exposure to local culture. This {{is due to the}} possibility of living on base or <b>off</b> <b>base.</b> TCKs who live <b>off</b> <b>base</b> or who are not closely affiliated with the military (such as contractors) will have higher exposure and cultural shaping, while those who spend the majority of their time on the base will have lower exposure and minimal cultural shaping. Military children who are immersed in local culture from birth tend to show an extremely high level of cultural shaping, and upon relocation they are likely to cling to said culture for years, if not their lifetime. Relocation for these particular TCKs has shown to be particularly marring for them emotionally.|$|E

This finding means that the model setting that assumes performance-based layoffs is more applicable to non-union workers.|$|R

25|$|Given {{its size}} and importance, and {{the large number of}} {{personnel}} assigned {{during the height of the}} Cold War in the 1950s, the base managed to attract many celebrities to visit and/or perform, including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope. In the early years of the base, recreational activities <b>off</b> <b>base</b> in the town of Stephenville were very limited and some were often restricted. In some of the pamphlets released by the base to its airmen, they went as far as giving the names of women and particular houses and taverns that no base personnel were to be in or near, as well as rules about fraternizing with the local girls.|$|E
25|$|In late September 1966, Shuwa and Oluleye were serendipitously posted {{away from}} the 5th Battalion and were {{replaced}} by then Major Abba Kyari and Captain Auna. On October 1, 1966, 5th Battalion troops mutinied and opened fire on the parade ground as they were addressed by Major Kyari. The mutineers murdered Captain Auna and their Regimental Sergeant Major Dauda Mumuni while Major Kyari was able to escape and hide <b>off</b> <b>base.</b> The rampaging soldiers broke into the armory and murdered Igbo civilians in Kano including some Igbo refugees about to board a south bound plane. Lt. Colonel Hassan Katsina, military governor of the Northern Region intervened {{with the assistance of}} Lt Colonel Shuwa, Major Martin Adamu, and Lieutenant Garba Duba to suppress the mutiny. The quartet was initially overwhelmed by the mutineers and subsequently enlisted the assistance of the Emir of Kano to quell the mutiny.|$|E

500|$|In the essay, Carr {{introduces}} {{the discussion of}} the scientific support for the idea that the brain's neural circuitry can be rewired with an example in which philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche {{is said to have been}} influenced by technology. According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler in his book Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Nietzsche's writing style became more aphoristic after he started using a typewriter. Nietzsche began using a Malling-Hansen Writing Ball because of his failing eyesight which had disabled his ability to write by hand. The idea that Nietzsche's writing style had changed for better or worse when he adopted the typewriter was disputed by several critics. Kevin Kelly and Scott Esposito each offered alternate explanations for the apparent changes. Esposito believed that [...] "the brain is so huge and amazing and enormously complex that it's far, far <b>off</b> <b>base</b> to think that a few years of Internet media or the acquisition of a typewriter can fundamentally rewire it." [...] In a response to Esposito's point, neuroscientist James Olds stated that recent brain research demonstrated that it was [...] "pretty clear that the adult brain can re-wire on the fly". In The New York Times it was reported that several scientists believed that it was certainly plausible that the brain's neural circuitry may be shaped differently by regular Internet usage compared with the reading of printed works.|$|E

When Education Secretary Arne Duncan changed a February 2011 speech {{at the last minute}} to remove a negative reference to the LIFO policy, under which the last teacher to be hired must be the first one fired, the New York Post editorialized that the action “has the fingerprints of Randi Weingarten and the American Federation of Teachers all over it.” Asked in a 2011 Wall Street Journal interview about LIFO, Weingarten defended it, saying: “It's not the perfect mechanism but it's the best mechanism we have. You have cronyism and corruption and discrimination issues. We're saying let's do things the right way.

[...] He cut <b>off</b> <b>base</b> hit after base hit, going now far to his right side and now to his left. [...] When occasion demanded, he roamed into left field for fly balls that previously had gone for base hits. [...] While Tavener was a light hitter, his defensive skill more than off-set his weakness on attack. Detroit [...] [...] [...] needed someone to discourage the offense of the opposition.

2500|$|The Working Khaki uniform {{was worn}} by Officers and Chief Petty Officers, {{primarily}} aboard ship or in selected working areas at bases ashore. Originally {{it was simply}} the Service Dress Khaki uniform worn without the coat and tie. Similar to, but less formal than, the Service Khaki, it consisted of a short or long-sleeve khaki uniform shirt, with warfare insignia and badges (i.e. command pins, nametags, etc., but no ribbons) worn {{on the top of}} the left pocket, and pin-on metal rank devices located on the collar. It also came with a set of khaki trousers, a khaki belt with a gold belt buckle, a command or [...] "U.S. Navy" [...] ballcap (garrison cap optional), and black or brown low quarter shoes, black or brown boots, or black leather safety shoes. It was often referred to as the [...] "Wash Khaki" [...] uniform, because it was a 100% cotton uniform that could be laundered but required pressing, differentiating it from the Summer Khaki made of Certified Navy Twill (CNT) or a poly-wool blend that is considered acceptable for wear ashore and <b>off</b> <b>base,</b> but which requires dry-cleaning. At the beginning of January 2011, the working khakis were replaced by the Navy Working Uniform, although the Navy Junior ROTC still uses them.|$|E

[...] In November, Spitzer went on to defeat Republican incumbent Dennis Vacco by a small margin of victory of 0.6%. Spitzer didn't win a single county in the upstate.

2500|$|The Cardinals won the National League pennant for {{a second}} {{consecutive}} year in 1968 as Brock once again {{led the league in}} stolen bases as well as in doubles and triples. In the 1968 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Brock had three stolen bases in Game 3 and contributed a double, triple, home run and four runs batted in during Game 4 to help the Cardinals build a three-game to one advantage over the Tigers. The Cardinals appeared {{to be on the verge}} of winning a second consecutive World Series, going into the fifth inning of Game 5 with a 3–2 lead. Although Brock's base running abilities had proven to be a factor in the previous four games, his carelessness may have cost the Cardinals a run. After Brock had hit a double, he tried to score standing up on Julián Javier's single to left, but Willie Horton threw him out with a strong throw to home plate. Detroit rallied for three runs in the seventh inning as Mickey Lolich shut out the Cardinals for the final eight innings to win the game for the Tigers. In Game 7, Brock had another crucial miscue when he was picked <b>off</b> <b>base</b> by Lolich, extinguishing a possible Cardinals rally. The Tigers rallied from being down three games to one behind the excellent pitching of Mickey Lolich to win the series. Brock once again stole seven bases and was the leading hitter in the series, posting a [...]464 batting average with 6 runs and 5 runs batted in.|$|E
