The proposal, which would have diverted excess revenues under TABOR to K-12 education, {{was regarded as a}} sweeping revision to competing constitutional mandates; it was not passed by the General Assembly, but was advanced as a citizens' initiative.|$|E
5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster {{and a number of}} bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E

Most shops front onto Market Street and date from late Victorian times, the majority operated by small independent retailers, {{although there is a}} supermarket that brings customers into the town centre. Older, low cost, mostly terraced housing, surrounds the centre of town. Bolts and fastenings are still manufactured in Atherton by Smith Bullough, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> remaining bolt and nut manufacturers in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Characteristically, Sebrights {{are only}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> chicken breeds {{in which the}} roosters are hen feathered, meaning they have none of the long, sickleshaped {{feathers}} common in most roosters that appear in the tail, neck and saddle. Due to the unique characteristic hen feathering, molecular biologists have found the Sebright bantam a useful model organism {{in the study of}} sex hormones. This is because they carry a mutation that causes the tissues of their skin to convert an unusually large amount of male sex hormones (androgens) into female sex hormones (estrogens).|$|E
5|$|Copper is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E

That scene is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> to be filmed on 35 mm film, and consequently slight film grain {{can be seen in the}} HD version of the episode.|$|E

5|$|When the South {{returned}} to firm Democratic {{control at the}} end of the 1870s, Indiana became a key swing state, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> that often decided the outcome of national elections. Five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets in elections held between 1868 and 1916.

5|$|When the South {{returned}} to firm Democratic {{control at the}} end of the 1870s, Indiana, which was closely split between the two parties, was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> key swing state that often decided the balance of power in Congress and the presidency. Five Hoosier politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets held between 1868 and 1916, as the nation's political parties vied for the support of the state's electorate. In 1888, at the height of the state's post-war political influence, former Civil War general Benjamin Harrison was elected president, and served in that capacity from 1889 to 1893.|$|E
5|$|After her defeat, Dallas {{worked in}} private {{business}} {{after her husband}} suffered several strokes {{and was forced to}} retire. Initially, she worked as an associate editor at the Philadelphia Daily News. In 1959, she was hired as an investment banker at Dehaven & Townsend, Crouter & Bodine. As in politics, she was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> women working in a male-dominated profession. When her husband died, Dallas moved out of their Chestnut Hill home to a retirement community in Delaware County, but continued working until the age of 76. She also remained active on several charitable boards including serving as a commissioner of Valley Forge State Park (now Valley Forge National Historical Park) and in the nonpartisan watchdog group, the Committee of Seventy. She died on January 13, 1983, and was buried alongside her husband in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus casuarius is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lambeosaurines, {{along with}} Lambeosaurus lambei, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri and H. altispinus, {{to have had}} {{surviving}} fossilized juveniles assigned to it. Juveniles are harder to assign to species, because {{at a young age}} they lack the distinctive larger crests of adults. As they age, lambeosaurine crests tend to grow and become more prominent come maturity. In the Dinosaur Park Formation, over fifty articulated specimens have been found, coming from many different genera. Among them, juveniles are hard to identify at the species level. Earlier, four genera and thirteen species were recognized from the formation's area, when paleontologists used differences in size and crest shape to differentiate taxa. The smallest specimens were identified as Tetragonosaurus, now seen as a synonym of Procheneosaurus, and the largest skeletons were called either Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus; an adult was identified as Parasaurolophus. Small lambeosaurines from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation were referred to Cheneosaurus.|$|E

The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter.

5|$|Neptune {{was built}} {{during the early}} years of the war with Revolutionary France and was {{launched}} in 1797. She almost immediately became caught up in the events of the mutiny at the Nore, and was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> loyal ships tasked with attacking mutinous vessels if they could not be brought to order. The mutiny died out before this became necessary and Neptune joined the Channel Fleet. She moved to the Mediterranean in 1799, spending the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars in operations with Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's fleet. After refitting, and spending time on blockades, she formed part of Lord Nelson's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, and was heavily involved in the fighting, sustaining casualties of 10 killed and 34 wounded.|$|E
