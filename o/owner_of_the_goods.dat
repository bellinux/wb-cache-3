50|$|By contrast, George Reisman {{says that}} time {{preference}} arises {{because of the}} possibility of being less able (say through injury or the effects of aging) or totally unable (through substantial incapacitation or death) to enjoy the use of goods in the future. The further into the future someone considers, the less likely it is that this someone will be able to enjoy the goods {{as much as they can}} be enjoyed now. The root of time-preference in Reisman's view is an internal risk premium that is specific to the <b>owner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> in contrast to an external risk premium that is demanded when the owner invests them in a production process or lends them to another. He then points out that the scarcity of capital combined with the uncertainties he raises, means that time preference is unavoidable and hence a minimum rate of return on that capital (such as in interest and normal profit) is always going to be required by suppliers of capital.|$|E
