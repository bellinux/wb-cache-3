5|$|During the Becket controversy, {{which began}} in October 1163, de Broc {{supported}} King Henry II of England and was appointed to oversee the lands and income of the see <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury</b> while Thomas Becket, the Archbishop <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury,</b> was in exile after fleeing England in October 1164. The estates were given into de Broc's custody at Christmas 1164, although the grant was back-dated to Michaelmas (29 September) 1164. De Broc was to pay the king 1562 pounds 5 shillings and 5.5 pence annually from the revenues of the estate. Ranulf entrusted the day-to-day administration <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury</b> to his kinsman Robert de Broc. The de Brocs continued to administer the estates until Michaelmas 1170. Soon after de Broc took up the administration <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury,</b> Becket accused de Broc of despoiling the Canterbury estates. Historians are not clear on whether Becket's charges were just propaganda or if the estates were actually damaged. De Broc managed to secure the support {{of some of the}} monks of the cathedral chapter <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury,</b> as some monks were willing to inform de Broc of any proceedings of the chapter that were favourable to Becket.|$|E

5|$|Offa was a Christian {{king who}} came into {{conflict}} with the Church, particularly with Jaenberht, the Archbishop <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury.</b> Offa persuaded Pope Adrian I to divide the archdiocese <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury</b> in two, creating a new archdiocese of Lichfield. This reduction in the power <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury</b> may have been motivated by Offa's desire to have an archbishop consecrate his son Ecgfrith as king, since it is possible Jaenberht refused to perform the ceremony, {{which took place in}} 787. Offa had a dispute with the Bishop of Worcester, which was settled at the Council of Brentford in 781.|$|E

The monks put forward three candidates from within Christ Church Priory: Odo, who had been prior of Christ Church and was then Abbot of Battle Abbey, Peter de Leia, a Cluniac prior of Wenlock Priory and later Bishop of St David's, and Theobald, Abbot of Cluny, but none of them found favour with the English bishops. Instead, the prelates selected the king's choice, Baldwin. The selection of Baldwin took place only after a dispute between the members of the cathedral chapter <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury</b> and the suffragan bishops <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury,</b> both of whom claimed the right to elect the new archbishop.|$|E

5|$|Gervase <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury</b> wrote {{at the end}} of {{the twelfth}} century that Ceolnoth was Dean of the see <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury</b> {{previous}} to being elected to the archiepiscopal see <b>of</b> <b>Canterbury,</b> but this story has no confirmation in contemporary records. There is no sign of him being associated with either Canterbury or Kent, the region where Canterbury is located, prior to his elevation as archbishop. Given the length of his archiepiscopate, he was probably a young man when he was elected to Canterbury. Ceolnoth was consecrated archbishop on 27 July 833. Upon becoming archbishop, Ceolnoth had to deal with two problems– first the Viking attacks on his archbishopric and the surrounding lands in Kent and second the newly ascendant kings of Wessex who had just gained control of Kent. Previously, the Mercian kings had ruled Kent.|$|E
