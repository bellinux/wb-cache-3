5|$|Poohsticks is {{considered}} to be a sport of chance yet some players claim skill is involved. Some strategies involve the way in which the stick is held before it is dropped and trying to find the fastest route in the river. Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schott’s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany, but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E

5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass {{had a tendency to}} go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stick</b> the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{vertical}} drying <b>of</b> a {{two dimensional}} colloidal film containing zero-thickness sticks (lines) was studied {{by means of}} kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

40|$|Archaeological {{research}} under churches has unearthed {{a substantial}} and varied range <b>of</b> finds. Among <b>the</b> numerous types <b>of</b> objects found are sticks with carved notches. <b>The</b> function these <b>sticks</b> have had, {{and the reason}} why they are found under the church floor, are discussed in this article. Around 35 of these sticks were found under Uvdal stave church in Numedal and the old church at Bø, Telemark. A little over half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> in both churches were found under the choirs. Approximately half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticks</b> have been dated, and most of these appear to have been pushed through cracks in the church floor at some time during <b>the</b> latter half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17 th century or the 18 th century.

40|$|Transition-state theory (TST) {{has long}} been applied to gas-surface {{reactions}} for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> characterizing and predicting desorption rate coefficients. However, current perceptions of its use exclude <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> TST from meaningful description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient, either for clean or for partially covered surfaces, principally because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory in describing adsorbate-adsorbent energy transfer. TST has thus previously been neglected as an interpretative and predictive tool for the temperature and coverage dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient, particularly for processes without a barrier to adsorption. It has previously been generally believed that only variational minimum dividing surfaces at infinite adsorbate-surface separation could be possible for barrierless adsorption processes, implying a TST sticking coefficient of unity. Reassessment of this point suggests {{that this is not}} necessarily the case even for clean surfaces; a form for the desorption rate coefficient that insists all trajectories have sufficient energy to desorb is derived, and a model calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient on a clean surface is presented that demonstrates that other variational minimum dividing surfaces are indeed possible...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} {{of physical and}} chemical processes in the interstellar medium requires detailed knowledge of how atoms and molecule adsorb on dust grains. However, <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient, a number between 0 and 1 that measures {{the first step in}} <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> a particle with a surface, is usually assumed in simulations of ISM environments to be either 0. 5 or 1. Here we report on <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient <b>of</b> H$_ 2 $, D$_ 2 $, N$_ 2 $, O$_ 2 $, CO, CH$_ 4 $, and CO$_ 2 $ on non-porous amorphous solid water (np-ASW). <b>The</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient was measured over a wide range of surface temperatures using a highly collimated molecular beam. We showed that <b>the</b> standard way <b>of</b> measuring <b>the</b> <b>sticking</b> coefficient [...] - the King-Wells method [...] - leads to <b>the</b> underestimation <b>of</b> trapping events in which there is incomplete energy accommodation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecule on the surface.
