Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures, and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official. There are 11 indigenous language groups, composed of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects. Of these, only the Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway languages have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable to survive in the long term. Several indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest Territories. Inuktitut is the majority language in Nunavut, and is one of three official languages in the territory.|$|E

25|$|Among {{those who}} opposed the canal {{expansion}} proposal is Panama's construction workers' union, SUNTRACS. The union's secretary general, Genaro Lopez, argued that while some construction jobs would be created by the project, the debt that Panama incurs to build a third set of locks will not be defrayed by increased canal usage and thus an increased part of canal revenues will go toward paying the debt, reducing the waterway's contributions to the national government's general fund, in turn reducing the money available for road projects, public schools, police protection, and <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

25|$|The local councils are {{responsible}} for providing the functions {{set out in the}} Local Government Act 1989 such as urban planning and waste management. Most <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>services</b> are provided or regulated by the Victorian state government, which governs from Parliament House in Spring Street. These include services which are associated with local government in other countries and include public transport, main roads, traffic control, policing, education above preschool level, health and planning of major infrastructure projects. The state government retains the right to override certain local government decisions, including urban planning, and Melburnian issues often feature prominently in state election.|$|E
25|$|Even {{worse in}} Byrd's eyes was {{the dilemma of}} the state itself, which was also heavily in debt during Byrd's youth. Before the Civil War, Virginia had taken on debt to help finance many {{internal}} public improvements (canals, turnpikes, and railroads) through the Virginia Board of Public Works. Most had been destroyed during the War, although the debt remained and the infrastructure needed to be rebuilt to get crops and goods to market. Virginia's first postwar legislature had affirmed those debts at original terms (highly favorable to bondholders, which by then were mostly out-of-state purchasers at rates {{a small fraction of}} par value). Some related to improvements in the area that separated during the war to form the new State of West Virginia; those were litigated for decades until the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1915 that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50. After the Reconstruction period, most of Virginia's governors insisted upon paying state bondholders, rather than pay for public education (newly added in Virginia Constitution of 1869) or <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>services.</b> The Readjuster Party, which briefly challenged the Conservative Party of Virginia which became the Virginia Democratic Party, advocated adjusting the terms of the prewar bonds, but had a relatively brief lifespan. Thus, the issue of Virginia's public debt was far from resolved during Byrd's formative years.|$|E

However, the INA's slogan Jai Hind which means [...] "Victory to India", was adopted by Cariappa and later it became a formal phrase between personnel to greet each other. He also turned down the proposal to reserve vacancies in the Army for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as had been done in <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>services.</b> He stated that the proposal would degrade the Army's standards and {{increase the risk of}} it being defeated if the right talent was not recognised.|$|E

40|$|The FoodNet {{project in}} Uganda {{is a joint}} venture involving, amongst <b>others,</b> <b>government</b> <b>services,</b> the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, and CTA. The {{particular}} interest in the MIS operated by FoodNet {{is the way it}} seeks to serve macro-level interests (policy makers and large traders) as well as a micro-level thrust aiming to provide localised information to small-scale producers and traders. The micro-MIS has focused initially on pilot sites for maize, beans and root crops, with information flows using local radio, email and classical print media. A similar attempt, involving the governments of Jamaica and the Netherlands, and local financial and information agencies, was made ten years ago in Jamaica to link micro- and macro-levels in a micro-enterprise development project. That project also launched a modest trade information service. The lessons learned at micro-level had to be translated into macro-level policy, hence the all-important emphasis on support and training of stakeholders at different levels in communication.

The team estimated that sustaining such a force structure would cost 2.6 to 3.3percent of East Timor's annual gross domestic product and would [...] "represent a heavy burden on the East Timor economy". Moreover, the Force 2020 plan may not be realistic or suitable as it appears to emphasise military expansion to counter external threats over spending on <b>other</b> <b>government</b> <b>services</b> and internal security and outlines ideas such as the long-term (~2075) development of space forces.|$|E
