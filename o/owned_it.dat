Ivythorne Manor is a Grade II* listed building {{which was built}} as a monastic dwelling in the medieval era and rebuilt in 1488 by John Selwood, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey. It later became a country house and was revised and extended from the 16th to 20th centuries by the Marshall and Sydenham families which <b>owned</b> <b>it.</b> Within the grounds is a dovecote which was probably built around 1578 for John Sydenham.|$|E
40|$|Who {{owns the}} 6 ? If we’re {{talking about the}} {{nickname}} for Toronto, some people might say Drake <b>owns</b> <b>it</b> — he popularized, after all, it starting {{in the summer of}} 2014 — but others might say we all <b>own</b> <b>it,</b> since it caught on so widely.

Although some older ones, {{such as the}} Victorian-era Jolly Collier in Coppice Side, were {{demolished}} in the 1980s, several dating from the 19th century still stand comparatively unchanged, including the Shoulder of Mutton, which still bears windows etched with the emblem of the brewery which <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> in the 1850s. The Station Hotel in the High Street hosted concerts, including an appearance by Black Sabbath in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Edward III {{gave the}} castle {{to his own}} son, Edmund of Langley, the Duke of York, who {{controlled}} it until 1402. Edmund's eldest son, Edward, <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> until 1415, when it passed to Maud Clifford, the widow of Edmund's younger son Richard, who lived there until 1446. Richard of York then inherited the castle, and on his death in 1460 during the Wars of the Roses it passed to his son Edward, who seized the throne in 1461, bringing Conisbrough back into Crown ownership once again.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} {{the most famous}} hotel in Calais was the Hôtel d'Angleterre, often called Dessin's or Dessein's, after the family which <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> for almost a hundred years.

With {{the arrival of the}} railway fewer British visitors stopped in Calais and Dessin's closed in 1860.|$|E

5|$|However, his {{re-instatement}} {{was short}} lived, as the navigation ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, the last month in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan to buy the waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to buy the navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea. He created a company called the Itchen Navigation Ltd, with a capital of £20,000, but {{they were unable to}} establish who <b>owned</b> <b>it,</b> and so the company never traded.|$|E
5|$|In 1528, Margaret Tudor, now Regent of Scotland for {{her infant}} son James V, married Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven, a {{descendant}} of Albany. His brother, Sir James Stewart (c.1513–1554), was made Captain of Doune Castle, and Sir James' son, also James (c.1529–1590), was created Lord Doune in 1570. Lord Doune's son, another James (c.1565–1592), married Elizabeth Stuart, 2nd Countess of Moray around 1580, becoming Earl of Moray himself. The castle thus came to be the seat of its keepers, the Earls of Moray, who <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> until the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a project}} of real estate {{developer}} and former New York State Senator William H. Reynolds, the structure was built by Walter Chrysler, {{the head of the}} Chrysler Corporation. The Chrysler Building's construction was characterized by a competition with 40 Wall Street and the Empire State Building to become the world's tallest building. The building served as the corporation's headquarters from 1930 until the mid-1950s. Although the building was built and designed specifically for the car manufacturer, the corporation did not pay for its construction and never <b>owned</b> <b>it,</b> as Walter P. Chrysler decided to pay for it himself, so that his children could inherit it.|$|E

5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the priory {{was granted}} to William St Loe and leased to Edward Fetyplace of Donnington, Berkshire who {{converted}} {{it into a}} farmhouse. The chancel was demolished, a second floor was constructed in the north aisle and large windows were bricked up. In 1566 it was sold to William Carr the MP for Bristol who completed the conversion from priory to manor house. In the late 17th century it was inherited by the Pigott family who <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> for 200 years, including the Smyth-Pigotts who {{were related to the}} Smyth family who owned Ashton Court. In the 17th century it was owned by Ralph Hopton who was a Royalist commander in the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it through the desert. It {{turned out that the}} county officially <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who <b>owned</b> <b>it.</b> Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E

5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which {{will see a}} 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at Buzzard Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C. Council to approve the plan, it {{was signed into law}} on December 30, 2014. Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary Buzzard Point property from the developer that <b>owned</b> <b>it,</b> in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United would kick the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer's land, and use eminent domain if a deal could not be reached.|$|E
5|$|Other {{proposals}} from Kelly and Giffords include {{limiting the}} sale of certain magazines, limiting {{the sale of}} assault weapons, and stopping gun trafficking. Mark Kelly was denied the sale of an AR-15 rifle. The shop owner denied Mr. Kelly the purchase stating his disagreement with Mr. Kelly's previous statements on gun laws. Local news reports that Mr. Kelly tried to buy the firearm using his Texas drivers license and thus could not prove Arizona residency. Mr. Kelly had stated that he was purchasing in order to turn the weapon in to the police department. In April 2013, Kelly was photographed at his mother-in-law's house in Arizona, with Giffords watching and cheering him on while he used a Glock 9 millimeter for target practice. The gun belongs to Giffords--she <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> prior to the 2011 attempt on her life. It is {{the same type of}} gun that was used in the January 2011 shooting.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure {{wind and water}} tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest that the spirit of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building.|$|E

5|$|The Briarcliff Lodge was {{a luxury}} {{resort in the}} village of Briarcliff Manor, New York.

Walter William Law had it built on his estate, and the Law family <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> until 1937. When the lodge opened in 1902, it was one of the largest resort hotels in the world. The lodge hosted presidents, royalty, and celebrities, and was the scene of numerous memorable occasions for visitors and local residents who attended weddings, receptions, and dances in the ballroom and dining room. For a long time, the lodge was situated among other businesses of Walter Law, including the Briarcliff Farms and Briarcliff Table Water Company.|$|E
5|$|The Mucking {{excavation}} was {{to become}} the largest ever carried out in Britain. To keep ahead of its destruction by the gravel company that <b>owned</b> <b>it,</b> Jones, assisted by her husband Tom, directed work at the site continuously for 13 years. Unusually, they excavated all year round, living in a small caravan and employing a shifting workforce of freelance archaeologists and volunteers from around the world. When it finally completed in 1978, the excavation covered 44 acres and had recorded 44,000 archaeological features, including Beaker burials; a Bronze Age hillfort; an Iron Age settlement and cemetery; a Roman villa and cemetery; {{one of the most}} significant Anglo-Saxon settlements in Britain; two large Anglo-Saxon cemeteries; and a Medieval field system. It involved 5000 archaeologists and volunteers and recovered 1.7 million finds.|$|E
5|$|The second {{castle in}} Lydford was {{constructed}} in 1195 following a wave {{of law and order}} problems across England. It included a stone tower with a surrounding bailey, and rapidly became used as a prison and court to administer the laws in the Forest of Dartmoor and the Devon stannaries. The tower was rebuilt {{in the middle of the}} 13th century, probably in the 1260s by Richard, the Earl of Cornwall. It was redesigned to resemble a motte and bailey castle, an antiquated design for the period but one that was heavily symbolic of authority and power. In 1342 the castle, still being used as a prison and courtroom, passed to the Duchy of Cornwall, who <b>owned</b> <b>it</b> until the 20th century.|$|E
