It was all very amusing, and very happy also, for these two really loved each other. Thank God that I, or rather Brother John, was able to bring them together again.|$|E

50|$|The Sri Lankan leopard hunts like <b>other</b> <b>leopards,</b> silently {{stalking}} {{its prey}} {{until it is}} within striking distance where it unleashes a burst of speed to quickly pursue and pounce on its victim. The prey is usually dispatched with a single bite to the throat.|$|E

50|$|Balaji, an Indian leopard {{housed in}} the Sri Venkateswara Zoological Park, located {{at the foot of}} the holy seven hills in Tirupathi, is the largest leopard to be ever recorded. The leopard weighs 139 kg against the normal weight of 70 kg of its class. Balaji was born in 1994 and {{captured}} in 1996, when he weighed 108 kg. He eats 4 kg of beef daily, the same as the zoo's <b>other</b> <b>leopards.</b> The Park management is said to be in touch with the Guinness Book of World Records authorities seeking its entry in the records as the biggest leopard. He died on June 11, 2013.|$|E
50|$|In Armenia, {{people and}} leopards co-existed {{since the early}} prehistoric times. By the mid-20th century leopards were {{relatively}} common in the country's mountains. Today, the leopard stronghold is the rugged and cliffy terrain of Khosrov State Reserve, located south-east of Yerevan on the south-western slopes of the Geghama mountains, where between October 2000 to July 2002 tracks {{of no more than}} 10 individuals were found in an area of 780 km2. Leopards were known to live on the Meghri Ridge in the extreme south of Armenia, where only one individual was camera-trapped between August 2006 to April 2007, and no signs of <b>other</b> <b>leopards</b> were found during track surveys conducted over an area of 296.9 km2. The local prey base could support 4-10 individuals, but poaching and disturbance caused by livestock breeding, gathering of edible plants and mushrooms, deforestation and human-induced wild fires are so high that they exceed the tolerance limits of leopards.|$|E
50|$|Results of {{molecular}} research {{indicate that the}} Javan leopard is craniometrically distinct from <b>other</b> Asian <b>leopard</b> subspecies, and is a distinct taxon that split off from <b>other</b> Asian <b>leopards</b> {{hundreds of thousands of}} years ago. In the Middle Pleistocene, it may have migrated to Java from South Asia across a land bridge that bypassed Sumatra and Borneo.|$|R
25|$|The tips of {{the ears}} are rounded, with black hair along the edge. There are no tufts of longer hair {{on the top of}} the ears. Adult Iriomote cats have a white spot on the back of each ear, much like those found on tigers' ears. Young Iriomote cats do not have these marks, and even as adults the spots will not be as white as those seen on <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> cat subspecies.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} in size to the Amur leopard, however their coats are darker almost orange in color. The rosettes are also darker, smaller and closer {{together}} {{with the possibility of}} spots being within the rosettes - a trait more often familiar with jaguars rather than leopards. Their fur is also relatively long when compared to <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> subspecies. The average weight in the wild is 50 kg for adult males and 32 kg for females.|$|R
5000|$|Translocation (the capture, transport, and release) of [...] "problem leopards", as {{with other}} {{territorial}} felids, is generally ineffective: translocated leopards either immediately return or <b>other</b> <b>leopards</b> move in and claim the vacant territory. One translocated leopard in Cape Province traveled nearly 500 km {{to return to his}} old territory. Translocations are also expensive, tend to result in high mortality (up to 70%), and may make leopards more aggressive towards humans, thus failing as both a management and a conservation strategy. Historically, lethal control of problem animals was the primary method of conflict management. Although this remains the situation in many countries, leopards are afforded the highest legal protection in India under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972—only man-eaters can be killed and only when they are considered likely to continue to prey on humans. In Uttarakhand, the state with the most severe human-leopard conflict, 45 leopards were legally declared man-eaters and shot by wildlife officials between 2001 and 2010.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of the {{interactions}} between humans and wildlife is of vital importance for conflict mitigation. We equipped five leopards with GPS-collars in Maharashtra (4) and Himachal Pradesh (1), India, to study movement patterns in human-dominated landscapes outside protected areas. An adult male and an adult female were both translocated 52 km, and exhibited extensive, and directional, post release movements (straight line movements: male = 89 km in 37 days, female = 45 km in 5 months), until they settled in home ranges of 42 km 2 (male) and 65 km 2 (female). The three <b>other</b> <b>leopards,</b> two adult females and a young male were released close to their capture sites and used small home ranges of 8 km 2 (male), 11 km 2 and 15 km 2 (females). Movement patterns were markedly nocturnal, with hourly step lengths averaging 33969. 5 m (SE) during night and 6064. 1 m during day, and night locations were significantly closer to human settlements than day locations. However, more nocturnal movements were observed among those three living in the areas with high human population densities. These visited houses regularly at nighttime (20 % of locations, 25 m from houses), but rarely during day (, 1 %). One leopard living in a sparsely populated area avoided human settlements both day and night. The small home ranges of the leopards indicate that anthropogenic food resources may be plentiful although wild prey is absent. The study provides clear insights into the ability of leopards to live and move in landscapes that are extremely modified by human activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} of leopards in the Eastern Cape Province requires a holistic approach that considers both predator-human interactions {{as well as}} the biology of the carnivore. Numerous studies have been conducted on leopards within protected areas; however more information regarding the species is needed outside these areas to facilitate effective management of predators. The spatial ecology of the leopard (Panthera pardus) were studied in the Baviaanskloof and GAENP in the Eastern Cape. The Baviaanskloof is an extensive area of mountainous terrain (approximately 2665 km²) which has a mosaic of land uses, and leopards move from conservation areas to farmland where they come into contact and conflict with farmers. This study examined the spatial ecology of leopards living on farmlands adjacent to protected land. The space utilization and activity patterns of six leopards were analysed. These animals were caught and released on farmlands in the Baviaanskloof (n= 4) or translocated (n= 2) when not possible to release on site. The animals were caught by means of fall-door, walk-in traps and fitted with Vectronic GPS collars that facilitated the collection of high quality GPS fixes from each animal. Data was collected using VHF and UHF telemetry to download data. An understanding of spatial requirements in areas with different land use, and the extent of overlap of space use with <b>other</b> <b>leopards</b> allow, {{for the first time in}} the region, the calculation of possible maximum population size. Analysis of range size was carried out using two methods: minimum convex polygon, and Kernel Utilization Distribution. Finally, a key predictor of space use is prey availability. I assessed the prey base using a grid of camera traps. The studied leopards revealed large range utilization with minimal overlap. The activity patterns suggest there is no preference between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns and the population density was estimated between 0. 3 - 1. 3 leopards per 100 km². Large home range sizes and low population densities suggest that leopards require large areas of suitable habitat, and that conservation efforts need to be extended beyond protected areas to ensure the long-term viability of leopard populations in such areas...|$|E

50|$|The species breeds at {{a similar}} time of year as many <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> frog species. The frogs {{commence}} migrations in February and March. As the air temperature rises in March and April, males begin consistent nocturnal choruses of mating calls, though both sustained diurnal and nocturnal choruses have been observed. They float in shallow water in groups of five or more and call to females. The advertisement call does not travel far, which may be a reason for dense groups.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and <b>other</b> <b>Leopard</b> 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|R

50|$|A {{study in}} Yala National Park {{indicates}} that Sri Lankan leopards are {{not any more}} social than <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> subspecies. They are solitary hunters, {{with the exception of}} females with young. Both sexes live in overlapping territories with the ranges of males overlapping the smaller ranges of several females, as well as overlapping the ranges of neighbouring males. They prefer hunting at night, but are also active during dawn and dusk, and daytime hours. They rarely haul their kills into trees, which is likely {{due to the lack of}} competition and the relative abundance of prey. Since leopards are the apex predators they don't need to protect their prey.|$|R
50|$|Males can {{determine}} the sex of <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> geckos by smelling pheromones on their skin. Males respond to males with aggressive behavior while they demonstrate courtship behavior towards females. Towards other males, the male would raise itself up from the ground, extend his limbs, and arch his back with the swelling of the tongue in aggression. He will then make short dashes and quick, vigorous bites, which frequently lacerate the skin and sometimes severely injure his opponent. Males behave the same way towards females while they are shedding their skin. Before and after the shedding of the skin, the males still express courtship behavior towards the females.|$|R
50|$|Their coat {{is fairly}} soft with long and dense hair. The length of {{hair on the}} back is 20 - 25 mm in summer and up to 70 mm in winter. The winter coat varies from fairly light yellow to dense yellowish-red with a golden tinge or rusty-reddish-yellow. The summer pelage is {{brighter}} with more vivid coloration pattern. Compared with <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> subspecies, they are rather small in size, with males larger than females. Males measure from 107 to 136 cm with a 82 to 90 cm long tail, a shoulder height of 64 to 78 cm, and a weight of 32.2 - 48 kg. Females weigh from 25 to 42.5 kg.|$|R
40|$|LEOPARD {{syndrome}} (LS) {{is a rare}} inherited {{autosomal dominant}} disease with high penetrance and markedly variable expression characterized by a spectrum of somatic abnormalities. In 1971, Gorlin proposed the well-known acronym LEOPARD (lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormalities of the genitalia, retardation of growth, deafness). The nature and clinical importance of cardiovascular phenotypes associated with LS remain uncertain, because few patients with the disease have undergone comprehensive cardiac evaluations. To date, 200 cases have been described and one review has been published. We emphasize that this case is exceptional insofar as life expectancy was longer than <b>other</b> <b>LEOPARD</b> syndrome cases described in previous reports; these have had an early mortality due to cardiopathies. The aim of our study is to report a rare case of a patient affected with LEOPARD syndrome, survived until 67 years with cutaneous associations never described in literature...|$|R

2500|$|In 1967, Dr. [...] {{announced}} the Iriomote cat {{to the scientific}} community as a new species of feline in its own genus. It was labeled Mayailurus iriomotensis. Dr. Imaizumi pointed out that, compared to <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> cats, the Iriomote cat retained some especially primitive features. Judging from these characteristics, Yoshinori Imaizumi estimated that the Iriomote cat appeared as a species sometime between ten million {{years ago in the}} Miocene epoch and three million years ago during the Pliocene epoch. He also believed that they shared many primitive characteristics with fossils in the extinct Metailurus genus. He emphasized these points, stating that the Iriomote cat and Metailurus shared a common ancestor sometime between ten million and five million years ago, and from that he deducted that the Iriomote cat's ancestors must have widened its range from mainland Asia to Iriomote and other areas beginning three million years ago. It appears to be a very ancient species, a ‘missing link’, nearer to the common root of the cat tribe than any other extant species.|$|R
60|$|A sharp {{search was}} now {{set up for}} the tracks of the <b>other</b> <b>leopard,</b> the Houssas going back to the tree and taking it up anew. They soon found traces of blood in a line {{diverging}} from that followed by the other animal. For an hour they followed this, great care being required, as at times no spots of blood could be seen for a considerable distance. At last they seemed to lose it altogether. Mr. Goodenough and Frank stood together, while the Houssas, scattered round, were hunting like well trained dogs for a sign. Suddenly there was a sharp roar, and from the bough of a tree close by a great body sprang through the air and alighted within a yard of Frank. The latter, in his surprise, sprang back, stumbled and fell, but in an instant the report of the two barrels of Mr. Goodenough's rifle rang out. In a moment Frank was on his feet again ready to fire. The leopard, however, lay dead, its skull almost blown off.|$|R

40|$|The local warming {{occurring}} {{within the}} western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is causing {{some of the}} greatest environmental shifts on the planet.   Over the past 140 years there have been profound biological and physical perturbations to the wildlife on the WAP. We examined whether trophic level shifts were evident in the top predators within this system and use stable isotope signatures as a proxy. Contemporary WAP leopard seals have different nitrogen isotopic values to <b>other</b> <b>leopard</b> seal populations, however historically WAP leopard seals had δ 15 N values within the range of other western and eastern Antarctic populations. From our 140 yr record of leopard seal tissues (n = 167), we show that the δ 15 N values of WAP leopard seal tissues have dropped significantly, and that this change occurs as a step around the 1980 s. The magnitude (2. 6 o/oo δ 15 N) of change is ecologically significant as it reflects a drop of a trophic level within the contemporary WAP food web. Values suggest that leopard seals have shifted from eating vertebrates to krill. Over this same time period there was no shift in δ 15 N of the WAP krill-feeding specialist, the crabeater seal, which supports the idea that the change in leopard seal δ 15 N values is not due to a baseline shift in the nitrogen isotope values. Despite the century-long perturbation in the WAP, the top-predators, the seals, show a trophic downshift only in recent times, post 1980 s...|$|R
