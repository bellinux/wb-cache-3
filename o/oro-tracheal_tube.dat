40|$|Background and Aims: Airway {{management}} in anaesthesia for maxillofacial surgical procedures is tricky {{at times when}} the nasal/oral routes are contraindicated or are impossible. Tracheostomy as an alternative inherits its own complications. We present a case series of the submandibular route for tracheal intubation as an alternative. Methods: The procedure was performed in ten selected adult patients with maxillofacial/mandibular fractures associated with a fracture of skull base or nasal bone. All of them were medically stable with no need of intensive care or mechanical ventilation in post-operative period. Results: Submandibular intubation in all ten patients of panfacial fractures allowed uninterrupted surgical techniques with a secured airway. All patients were reverted to <b>oro-tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> {{at the end of}} surgery as immediate maxillomandibular fixation was not necessary. The patients were extubated after recovery from anaesthesia before they left the operating theatre. One patient in the post-operative period had a superficial infection of incision site that responded well to local treatment. No other complications were encountered in the intra-operative or post-operative period. Conclusion: In complex maxillofacial injuries, when oral or nasal intubation hampers surgeon′s field of view, submandibular intubation offers an effective alternative to short-term tracheostomy along with small risk potential. There is a need to emphasise its regular application in such cases so that technique can be mastered by both surgeons and anaesthesiologist...|$|E
40|$|Question: Can Respiratory therapy {{alter the}} lung {{mechanics}} {{in patients with}} invasive mechanical ventilation? The data available in the literature remain controversial. This study aims to assess the changes of pulmonary mechanics in patients with invasive mechanical ventilation, comparing hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters one hour prior to application of the service, immediately after and one hour after the service. Design: Participants: Patients on mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours with <b>oro-tracheal</b> <b>tube.</b> Intervention: Patients underwent a protocol of respiratory therapy and hemodynamic variables were recorded at different times. Outcome measures: The following variables were measured one hour before, immediately after and one hour after application of the protocol of respiratory therapy. Dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), respiratory system resistance (Rsr), Tidal Volume (Vt), Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP), Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP), Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory frequency (RF), and Saturation peripheral oxygen (SpO 2). Results: The variables obtained the following mean and standard deviation: HR 88. 9 ± 18. 7 {{an hour before the}} service, presented an increase to 93. 7 ± 19. 2 immediately after the service, which fell one hour after the service, 88. 5 ± 17. 1. So we can conclude that heart rate showed an increase after treatment of respiratory therapy and one hour after this variable had a value less than the obtained in the beginning. SpO 2 96. 5 ± 2. 29 one hour before the service, with an increase to 98. 2 ± 1. 62 immediately after the service, and a slight decrease to 97. 8 ± 1. 79 one hour after the service. We can conclude that the oxygen saturation showed a significant improvement one hour after the service, not returning to the value obtained one hour before the service. RF 20. 8 ± 5. 40 one hour before the service, increasing to 21. 9 ± 5. 89 immediately after the service and presenting a decrease of 19. 4 ± 1. 79 one hour after the service, when compared to one hour before the service. Rsr 14. 2 ± 4. 63 one hour before the service, down immediately after the service 11. 0 ± 3. 43 and a small increase one hour after the service, but did not return to baseline. Vt 550 ± 134 one hour before the service, increasing significantly to 698 ± 155 and presenting a decrease 672 ± 146, although it remained higher than the value obtained one hour before the service. PIP 22. 2 ± 5. 54 one hour before the service, with a slowdown that does not differ from the Bonferroni test with the value immediately after the service, and decreased to 21. 5 ± 5. 24, when compared with the previous two times. Cdyn 52. 3 ± 16. 1 one hour before the service, increased significantly immediately after the service 65. 1 ± 19. 1 and decreased to 64. 7 ± 20. 2 one hour after the service, with no significant difference if compared to the second time, and significant difference if compared with the first time. Peep 5. 93 ± 1. 80 one hour before the service, 5. 89 ± 1. 71 immediately after the service and 5. 91 ± 1. 70 one hour after the service. This was the only variable that showed no significant difference in any of the times compared. In Conclusion: The variables HR, SpO 2, RF, Rsr, Vt and Cdyn obtained significance p < 0, 01. Variable PIP gained significance with p < 0, 013...|$|E
