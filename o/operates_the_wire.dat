40|$|Abstract- TFRC is a TCP-Friendly Rate Control {{protocol}} {{based on}} TCP Reno's throughput equation. It {{is designed to}} provide optimal service for unicast multimedia flow <b>operating</b> in <b>the</b> <b>wired</b> Internet environment. However, in wireless networks, TFRC, same as TCP Reno, suffers significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose to make use of a more advanced equation to enhance TFRC over wireless networks. This new equation is directly derived from the modeling of the wireless TCP rather than <b>the</b> <b>wired</b> TCP. After incorporating this equation into TFRC, two achievements are obtained: 1) this enhanced TFRC has a significant throughput improvement; it is shown that in wireless networks with 10 % loss rate, it can obtain 300 % improvement over the original TFRC; 2) this enhanced TFRC inherits the desirable features of TFRC, namely good fairness, nice TCP-friendliness and smoothness of sending rate. The extensive experiments, including simulation and live Internet measurements, validate our proposed scheme. Moreover, our scheme only needs to modify the sender-side protocol of TFRC while the receiver-side or intermediate node protocol stack remains intact. I...|$|R

Integrated mechanical, electrical and thermal models of the RSW process also require accurate specification of machine dynamics. The influence of specific machine configurations {{is extremely difficult to}} predict starting from individual component specifications, and it has also been difficult in the past to accurately measure dynamic performance under typical operating conditions. This paper presents a reliable and very straightforward new method for the characterization of machine performance. This method has the advantage that {{it can be used to}} characterize the performance of RSW machines under realistic <b>operating</b> conditions. <b>The</b> test, <b>the</b> “Exploding <b>Wire</b> Test", uses a small diameter <b>wire</b> placed between <b>the</b> welding electrodes. The machines’ performance can subsequently be measured at <b>the</b> required <b>operating</b> load as <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> disintegrates when welding current is applied.

The welding machines’ performance characteristics can be used directly, in order to optimize process operation towards a specific and demanding application, or serve as an input into an integrated mechanical / electrical / thermal model of the RSW process. The test method is relatively simple (although sophisticated instrumentation is required to accurately measure dynamic behaviour) and it can be used over a wide range, from micro-joining to heavy duty applications, and can be applied to projection welding as well as resistance spot welding. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} {{of what is}} known as the imperfect junction coherer. The principle of operation (microwelding) suggested above for the filings coherer may be less likely to apply to this type because there is no need for decohering. An iron and mercury variation on this device was used by Marconi for the first transatlantic radio message. An earlier form was invented by Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1899. The device consisted of a small metallic cup containing a pool of mercury covered by a very thin insulating film of oil; above the surface of the oil, a small iron disc is suspended. By means of an adjusting screw the lower edge of the disc is made to touch the oil-covered mercury with a pressure small enough not to puncture the film of oil. Its principle of operation is not well understood. The action of detection occurs when the radio frequency signal somehow breaks down the insulating film of oil, allowing the device to conduct, <b>operating</b> <b>the</b> receiving sounder <b>wired</b> in series.
