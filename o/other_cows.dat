60|$|And {{there is}} the case, on record where A., a settler, makes a bet with B., that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can, and A. will produce an {{aboriginal}} who will find her.

B. then drives the cow a few miles over a course which drifts in all directions, and frequently doubles back upon itself; and he selects difficult ground all the time, and once or twice even drives the cow through herds of <b>other</b> <b>cows,</b> and mingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs. He finally brings his cow home; the aboriginal is set at liberty, and at once moves around in a great circle, examining all cow-tracks until he finds the one he is after; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic course, and ultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the cow.
