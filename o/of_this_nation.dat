500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>nation,</b> the minorities <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>nation,</b> the discriminated <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>nation</b> are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.'

500|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, Johnson {{is among those}} {{commonly}} mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history. According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes Buchanan the worst president, [...] "Johnson is a particular favorite for {{the bottom of the}} pile because of his impeachment... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance." [...] Tolson suggests that [...] "Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans". Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, [...] "there have never been more difficult times in the life <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>nation.</b> The problems these men had to confront were enormous.

500|$|Anne {{supported}} the Occasional Conformity Bill of 1702, which was {{promoted by the}} Tories and opposed by the Whigs. The bill aimed to disqualify Protestant Dissenters from public office by closing a loophole in the Test Acts, legislation that restricted public office to Anglican conformists. The existing law permitted nonconformists to take office if they took Anglican communion once a year. Anne's husband was placed in an unfortunate position when Anne forced him {{to vote for the}} bill, even though, being a Lutheran, he was an occasional conformist himself. The Whigs successfully blocked the bill {{for the duration of the}} parliamentary session. Anne reinstituted the traditional religious practice of touching for the king's evil that had been eschewed by William as papist superstition. After the Great Storm of 1703, Anne declared a general fast to implore God [...] "to pardon the crying sins <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>nation</b> which had drawn down this sad judgement". The Occasional Conformity Bill was revived in the wake of the storm, but Anne withheld support, fearing its reintroduction was a ruse to cause a political quarrel. Once again it failed. A third attempt to introduce the bill as an amendment to a money bill in November 1704 was also thwarted.|$|E
