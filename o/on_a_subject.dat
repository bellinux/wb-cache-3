5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of {{the flesh of the}} dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E
5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E

5|$|Harald {{became the}} first of the two Bohr {{brothers}} to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a thesis <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger Doctor of Philosophy (dr. phil.) thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's thesis that is today known as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem.|$|E
25|$|Menotti was {{commissioned}} by Peter Herman Adler, director of NBC's new opera programming, to write the first opera for television.

Cuppy would amass hundreds of cards even for a short article.

25|$|While at Harvard, Stevens wrote a {{paper on}} {{maritime}} law which received honorable mention for the Addison Brown prize, a Harvard Law School award made for the best essay by a student <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> related to private international law or maritime law. The essay later became a Harvard Law Review article whose scholarship Justice Jay Rabinowitz of the Alaska Supreme Court praised 45 years later, telling the Anchorage Daily News in 1994 that the high court had issued a recent opinion citing the article. Stevens graduated from Harvard Law School in 1950.|$|E

Little Britain was later broadcast on the BBC's terrestrial analogue channels BBC One and BBC Two. The channels longest-running comedy programme is Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. Some current programmes feature stand-up comedians performing their own take <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject,</b> usually the news, examples of which include Russell Howard's Good News (Now being broadcast on BBC Two, due to success and partly to BBC Three's move to online only) and Lee Nelson's Well Good Show.|$|E
25|$|For Verdi, {{the years}} 1851 to 1853 {{were filled with}} operatic activity. First, he had agreed with the {{librettist}} Salvadore Cammarano <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> for what would become Il trovatore, but work on this opera could not proceed while the composer was writing Rigoletto, which premiered in Venice in March 1851. In addition, personal affairs in his home town limited his activities that spring, but after Rigolettos success in Venice, an additional commission was offered by Brenna, the secretary of La Fenice. After Verdi's return from Paris a contract was signed in May 1852, with performances scheduled for March 1853, although no subject was chosen at that time.|$|E

Kuroki, sharing Muranishi's opinion that the AV should have a documentary quality, continued to work with him when he left Crystal-Eizou to found his own company, Diamond Visual. Her videos for Muranishi usually began with her seated, sharply dressed, and addressing the camera in an improvised talk <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> like sexual liberation. This would typically be followed by a modeling segment, either nude or in a swimsuit. The remaining video footage would be taken up with various sexual performances, often involving S.|$|E
25|$|The Sikh gurus {{established}} a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react {{as a community}} to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, {{was responsible for the}} creation of the concept of Akal Takht (throne of the timeless one), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the Harmandir Sahib. The Sarbat Ḵẖālsā (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Hola Mohalla and when {{there is a need to}} discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A gurmatā (literally, guru's intention) is an order passed by the Sarbat Ḵẖālsā in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A gurmatā may only be passed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs. The term hukamnāmā (literally, edict or royal order) is often used interchangeably with the term gurmatā. However, a hukamnāmā formally refers to a hymn from the Gurū Granth Sāhib which is a given order to Sikhs.|$|E

500|$|Diane Johnson, who co-wrote the {{screenplay}} for The Shining with Kubrick, {{notes that he}} [...] "always {{said that it was}} better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn't a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he's always done, except with Lolita". When deciding <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> for a film, {{there were a number of}} aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would [...] "appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film". According to his co-producer Jan Harlan, Kubrick mostly [...] "wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance". Kubrick himself believed that audiences quite often were attracted to [...] "enigmas and allegories" [...] and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.|$|E
500|$|Professor Ewing {{left the}} {{university}} in 1903 {{to become the first}} Director of Naval Education at the Admiralty but Inglis remained; he was appointed a university demonstrator in mechanism by Professor Bertram Hopkinson, Ewing's successor, and worked with him to study the effects of vibration. [...] Inglis was promoted to lecturer of mechanical engineering in 1908. [...] Hopkinson recognised Inglis' academic abilities and assigned him the heaviest teaching load of all the staff, covering statics, dynamics, structural engineering theory, materials engineering, drawing, engine balance and the design of steel girders and reinforced concrete. Inglis later recalled that if he wished to learn more <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> then he volunteered to teach a course on it. [...] From 1911 Inglis became involved in hydraulic engineering and served {{on the board of the}} Cambridge University and Town Waterworks Company, serving as deputy chairman from 1924 to 1928 and chairman from 1928 to 1952.|$|E

If they did, the kid would be gunged. In January 2001, the premise evolved into a courtroom setting with a trivial argument between friends trying to be settled. The person the jury found guilty would subsequently be gunged. In March 2001, the game took on the premise of The Leakiest Sink', a parody of The Weakest Link which involved three contestants vying to meet a celebrity. After three rounds of questions which would eliminate one contestant, the remaining two would go onto the final round where the celebrity would pick plugs out of a sink whilst the contestants switched for each one pulled. Whoever was sitting under the tank when the wrong plug was pulled would lose and be gunged, the one left untouched would win.' ...|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein's early comics-based {{works such}} as Look Mickey focused on popular {{animated}} characters. By 1963 he had progressed to more serious, dramatic subject matter, typically focusing on romantic situations or war scenes. Comic books as a genre were held in low esteem at the time. Public antipathy led in 1954 to examination of alleged connections between comic books and youth crime during Senate investigations into juvenile delinquency; {{by the end of}} that decade, comic books were regarded as material of [...] "the lowest commercial and intellectual kind", according to Mark Thistlethwaite of the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Lichtenstein was not a comic-book enthusiast as a youth, but was enticed as an artist by the challenge of creating art based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> remote from the typical [...] "artistic image". Lichtenstein admitted he was [...] "very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images." ...|$|E

The same week, he was told that the prognosis for his pancreatic cancer was to be terminal. Pausch nearly canceled the lecture after hearing the news.
