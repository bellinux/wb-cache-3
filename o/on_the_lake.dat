5|$|The Continental Army {{had retreated}} from Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced. They {{spent the summer}} of 1776 fortifying those forts, and {{building}} additional ships to augment the small American fleet already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fort Saint-Jean, but needed to build a fleet to carry it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> The Americans, during their retreat, had either taken or destroyed most of the ships <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> By early October, the British fleet, which significantly outgunned the American fleet, was ready for launch.|$|E

These include two oak species, two maple spaces, red elm, boxelder, shagbark hickory, black tupelo, American basswood, eastern hop-hornbeam, black ash, and musclewood. Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's honeysuckle, speckled alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore {{not be limited to}} simply drifting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> when it splashes down.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, {{a veteran}} of World War I and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of Royal Savages hull, which he {{successfully}} raised in 1935. Hagglund followed up his discovery of Royal Savage {{with the discovery of}} Philadelphias remains in 1935, sitting upright <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> bottom. He raised her that year; in addition to the guns and hull, hundreds of other items were recovered from the vessel. These relics included shot, cooking utensils, tools, buttons, buckles and human bones.|$|E

5|$|Native trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and {{non-native}} mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all {{be found}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> in winter.

Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.|$|E
5|$|RE11 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with FM 1929, {{to the north}} of a small farm. The roadway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward through rural areas on a large peninsula <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> The road continues north, traveling through scrub land before it intersects the Ray Stoker Jr. Highway, and bends slightly northeast for a short distance. After continuing north, the roadway bends northeast, as it intersects the former route of RM 2134. The highway intersects a small road leading to a residential community <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> before continuing northeast, where it intersects County Road 4763 (CR 4763), which leads to a small residential area. It turns north and continues for a short distance, after which the highway bends northwest, and proceeds to its northern terminus, a boat-launch ramp on the coast of the lake. The highway is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Service <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> Shore Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach seating and Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a dining car service. As the Erie station is not equipped with a ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, equipped with a waiting room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown circulator, provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound Lake Shore Limited.|$|E
