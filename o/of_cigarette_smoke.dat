40|$|Background: The {{deterioration}} in lung function associated with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) {{is directly related}} to duration of smoking and the number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked.</b> Over 85 % of lung cancers are attributed to smoking. The problem is, whether the length of smoking consumption period has more impact to COPD and lung cancer than the bigger number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day?Examinees and methods: The sample has constituted of two groups of examinees, smokers, both gender, age 25 - 64 years old. The first group consisted of 240 examinees divided in 8 subgroups according to a number of years they have been smoking. The second group consisted of 180 examinees, which was divided in 6 subgroups, according to average number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily during the smoking consumption period. Results: The prevalence of smoking was higher in men (65. 7 % vs. 62 %) than in women (34. 3 % vs. 38 %). Smoking duration in the group of smokers according to the length of smoking consumption period was 20. 34 ± 10. 63 y and in the group of smokers according to a number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily 13. 55 ± 8. 20 y.

The decades following World War II, during the apex of smoking when the practice had still not come under fire by the growing anti-smoking movement, a cigarette casually tucked between the lips represented the young rebel, epitomized in actors like Marlon Brando and James Dean or mainstays of advertising like the Marlboro Man.

40|$|Cotinine {{concentration}} in various body fluids {{is considered to}} be among the most useful markers of nicotine exposure currently available. Despite the prevailing consensus concerning cotinine's usefulness, cotinine's large intrasubject variability has led some to question the value of a single-point measurement. Several individual differences (for example, age, race, sex, and so forth) may affect cotinine excretion, and a peculiar nonlinearity between the number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> and cotinine concentration has been reported previously in the literature. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the nature of the association between cotinine and reported number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> after adjustment for the relationship between cotinine and age, a key individual difference known to affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and tissue sensitivity. The authors examined the relationship between saliva cotinine and daily cigarette consumption in 116 smokers (mean age = 37. 4 years; average number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily = 20. 1) who logged each cigarette into a hand-held computer as part of a study on the accuracy of recall. The Pearson correlation between saliva cotinine and the logged number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> in the previous 17 hours (the time window corresponding to the half-life of cotinine) accounted for significantly more of the variance in cotinine than did the average logged number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> daily during 5 days. Age was also significantly associated with cotinine levels. Further examination of the relationship between cotinine and amount smoked in the previous 17 hours revealed evidence for a significant nonlinear component. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—The number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day is an imprecise {{indicator}} <b>of</b> {{exposure to}} <b>cigarette</b> <b>smoke,</b> and biochemical assessment of exposure {{is not always}} feasible. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop more accurate measures of self reported active exposure to <b>cigarette</b> <b>smoke.</b>  DESIGN—Mail survey in 386  smokers, retest at one month in 94  participants (24 %), analysis of saliva cotinine in 98  participants (25 %), collection <b>of</b> empty <b>cigarette</b> packs in 214  participants (55 %), collection <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> butts in 107  participants (28 %). Ten questions and items intended to assess active exposure to <b>cigarette</b> <b>smoke</b> were tested and compared with saliva cotinine, the Fagerström test for nicotine dependence, and self rated dependence.  SETTING—A population sample in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1999.  PARTICIPANTS— 323 daily smokers and 63  occasional smokers.  MAIN RESULTS—Measures that were associated with saliva cotinine included the number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day (r 2 = 0. 36), smoking intensity (r 2 = 0. 40), the type <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> (regular versus light) (r 2 = 0. 04), smoking when ill (r 2 = 0. 15) and a single item rating of the total quantity of smoke inhaled (r 2 = 0. 27).

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine influence <b>of</b> <b>cigarette</b> smoking on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with estrogen deficiency in menstrual history. Methods: The total of 100 postmenopausal women living in Sarajevo area, aged 50 - 65 years, with estrogen deficiency in menstrual history participated in this prospective study. The subjects were divided in two groups, examination and control group, based on bone mineral density values. The women in the examination group had osteoporosis while in the control group were women with osteopenia or normal bone mineral density. Bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and proximal femur by Dual–Energy X–ray Absorptiometry using Hologic QDR- 4000 scanner. Smoking habits were assessed for each subject. Results: The average number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day in women with estrogen deficiency in menstrual history was 14. 86 in the examination group and 4. 67 in the control group. The difference in the average number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day between the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0. 01). The coefficient of linear correlation between T score and the number <b>of</b> <b>cigarettes</b> <b>smoked</b> per day among women with estrogen deficiency in menstrual history in the examination group was statistically significant (p< 0. 01).
