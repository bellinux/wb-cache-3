The {{loss of his}} wife had a {{profound}} effect on Low: in his later career of piracy, he would often express regret for the daughter he left behind, and refused to press-gang married men into joining his crews. He would also allow women to return to port safely. At first working honestly as a rigger, in early 1722 he joined a gang of twelve men on a sloop headed for Honduras, where they planned to collect a shipment <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> for resale in Boston.|$|E

5|$|Exactly {{one year}} after the {{explosion}} of Flight 180, college student Kimberly Corman is heading to Daytona Beach, Florida for spring break with her friends, Shaina McKlank, Dano Estevez, and Frankie Whitman. On route, Kimberly has a premonition <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> falling off a semi, causing a massive car accident that kills everyone involved. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering the highway, including lottery winner Evan Lewis; widow Nora Carpenter and her fifteen-year-old son Tim; businesswoman Kat Jennings; stoner Rory Peters; pregnant Isabella Hudson; high school teacher Eugene Dix; and Deputy Marshal Thomas Burke. While Thomas questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs. Shaina, Dano and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck, but Kimberly is saved by Thomas.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} inundation {{caused by}} Vera's storm surge submerged {{areas around the}} periphery of the bay for extended periods of time, with some low-lying areas remaining underwater in excess of four months. Due to the failure of multiple flood mitigation systems in quick succession, coupled with the narrow coverage of telecommunications exacerbated by Vera's strong winds, many persons in affected regions had very little time to evacuate. Nagoya {{was one of the worst}} impacted cities by Vera, and as a result of the storm surge and wind, its harbor was put out of service in under three hours. The effects of the typhoon's storm surge there were further worsened by the destruction of lumber yards in Nagoya Harbor, which set loose large quantities <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> that caused considerable damage to structures. The release <b>of</b> <b>logs</b> also hampered relief efforts following the typhoon's passage. Citywide, 50,000homes were severely damaged by flood waters, and 1,800other residences were washed away off of their foundations. Total damage to crops was estimated at US$30million. Rice crops sustained heavy impacts, with 150,000tons (135,000tonnes) of rice lost. In addition to the crop damage, US$2.5million worth of fruits and US$4million worth of vegetables were lost. The collapse of a single apartment home in the city buried 84people under debris; a similar incident in Naka, Ibaraki buried roughly 300people. Beach houses were destroyed, and large swaths of nearby cropland were heavily damaged. In addition to the storm surge, Nagoya experienced sustained winds of about 145km/h (90mph), with gusts reaching as high as 260km/h (160mph), downing power lines and causing power outage. Southeast of Nagoya, in Handa, Aichi, around 300people were killed after Vera's waves engulfed more than 250homes. Casualties throughout Aichi totaled 3,168 and roughly 59,000people were injured, based on an enumeration conducted in March1960.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define a {{reasonable}} moduli theory <b>of</b> <b>log</b> smooth curves which recovers the classical Deligne-Knudsen-Mumford moduli of pointed stable curves.

In this paper we will develop the theory <b>of</b> moduli <b>of</b> <b>log</b> smooth curves, which is expected to give a compactification of the classical moduli of algebraic curves.
