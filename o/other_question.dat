25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The <b>other</b> <b>question</b> is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E
25|$|As to the <b>other</b> <b>question</b> — that {{of singing}} roles that, {{according}} to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not}} to be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any <b>other</b> <b>question</b> about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} regarding whether vos Savant's formulation of the problem, as presented in Parade magazine, is asking {{the first or second}} question, and whether this difference is significant (Rosenhouse 2009). Behrends (2008) concludes that [...] "One must consider the matter with care to see that both analyses are correct"; {{which is not to say}} that they are the same. One analysis for one question, another analysis for the <b>other</b> <b>question.</b> Several discussants of the paper by (Morgan et al. 1991), whose contributions were published alongside the original paper, strongly criticized the authors for altering vos Savant's wording and misinterpreting her intention (Rosenhouse 2009). One discussant (William Bell) considered it a matter of taste whether or not one explicitly mentions that (under the standard conditions), which door is opened by the host is independent of whether or not one should want to switch.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian {{referendum}} of 27 May 1967, {{called by}} the Holt Government, approved two amendments to the Australian constitution relating to Indigenous Australians. [...] Technically it was {{a vote on the}} Constitution Alteration (Aboriginals) 1967, which became law on 10 August 1967 following the results of the referendum. The amendments were overwhelmingly endorsed, winning 90.77% of votes cast and carrying in all six states. These amendments altered sections 51(xxvi), and 127, having the immediate effect of including Aboriginal Australians in determinations of population, and also empowered the Federal Parliament to legislate specifically for this racial group. The <b>other</b> <b>question</b> put in the referendum, to allow the number of seats in the House of Representatives to be increased without increasing the number of senators, was rejected. [...] It received majority support in only one state – New South Wales – and received about 40.25% [...] "yes" [...] votes nationwide.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Joe Little {{was due to}} co-present an {{edition of}} the {{programme}} from the RTÉ studio in Castlebar, County Mayo, during the European Parliament election of that year, when it was realised belatedly {{that it could not}} be heard in Dublin. Disaster was prevented by mere minutes. When the IRA announced its cease-fire that same year, Joe Little was in the Belfast studio beginning an interview with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when the sound broke down live on air on a temporary basis. During one edition, the entire programme did malfunction, and, with interviews suspended and a commercial break impossible, Hanly intervened to prevent a complete disaster for several minutes by commenting to the show's previous guest: [...] "There was one <b>other</b> <b>question</b> I wanted to ask you [...] ". Joe Little interviewed Lady Valerie Goulding to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of The Blitz of London by Germany.|$|E

2500|$|William Bass and his {{students}} did not isolate themselves through their own studies at the Body Farm; they also received forensic cases from law enforcement {{in which they could}} lend their expertise. One situation, case [...] "91-23", involved arson upon a car on the border of Tennessee. After using other various forensics on the body including bone examinations, Bass and his team were able to identify the victim. The only <b>other</b> <b>question</b> was how long ago the victim had died; with this, they turned toward entomology, and more specifically, the life cycle of flies. Two of Bass' graduate students collected maggots and puparia on the scene and took them back to the Body Farm to study and after procedural observation and testing, the puparia appeared to be [...] "charred" [...] from the same fire that brought an end to the car and the body. This observation gave significant evidence that the man had been dead in his car for almost an entire life cycle of a blow-fly (approximately two weeks) before fire was even set to it. Because of this, Bass and his team were able to determine a more accurate time of death, which helped place authorities in the right direction in search of the murderer(s).|$|E
