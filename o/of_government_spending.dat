In his April 2002 budget, Brown increased National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending.

These increases were followed by another £1billion of support for increases in the child tax credit.|$|E

He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would be abolished when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% <b>of</b> <b>government</b> <b>spending.</b>|$|E

In addition to the high expense of medical care relative to the average Malagasy income, the prevalence of trained medical professionals remains extremely low.

Approximately 70percent of spending on health was contributed by the government, while 30percent originated with international donors and other private sources. The government provides at least one basic health center per commune. Private health centers are concentrated within urban areas and particularly those of the central highlands.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Federal budget had a size of 62.8 billion Swiss francs in 2010, {{which is}} an {{equivalent}} 11.35% of the country's GDP in that year; however, the regional (canton) budgets and the budgets of the municipalities are not counted {{as part of the}} federal budget and the total rate <b>of</b> <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> is closer to 33.8% of GDP. The main sources of income for the federal government are the value-added tax (33%) and the direct federal tax (29%) and the main expenditure is located in the areas of social welfare and finance & tax. The expenditures of the Swiss Confederation have been growing from 7% of GDP in 1960 to 9.7% in 1990 and to 10.7% in 2010. While the sectors social welfare and finance & tax have been growing from 35% in 1990 to 48.2% in 2010, a significant reduction of expenditures has been occurring in the sectors of agriculture and national defence; from 26.5% in to 12.4% (estimation for the year 2015).|$|E

The increase in a <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> financed by budget deficit decreases consumption and leisure time and increases the level of labour and production.

40|$|Abstract—Government {{spending}} is categorized into consumption spending and capital spending. Three categories of private consumption are used: food consumption, nonfood consumption, and services consumption. The estimated model indicates substitution effects <b>of</b> <b>government</b> consumption <b>spending</b> on budget shares of private nonfood consumption and <b>of</b> <b>government</b> capital <b>spending</b> on budget share of private food consumption. However, the results do not indicate whether {{the negative effects}} of changes in the budget shares of the nonfood and the food consumption equates to reduce total private consumption. The concept of aggregate demand comprising consumption, investment, <b>government</b> <b>spending</b> (consumption spending and capital spending), export, and import are used to estimate their relationship by using the Vector Error Correction Mechanism. The study found no effect <b>of</b> <b>government</b> capital <b>spending</b> on either the private consumption or the growth of GDP while the <b>government</b> consumption <b>spending</b> has negative effect on the growth of GDP...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} female political representation {{and the extent to}} which it effects <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> as a share of GDP in states with varying income levels. First, the paper reviews and discusses the broad literature on determinants <b>of</b> <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> and the literature related to gender and health spending, generally. Second, it tests whether female parliamentary representation can explain parts of the variation in <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> across countries and over time. To do so, it uses country-level data and controls for known determinants <b>of</b> <b>government</b> health <b>spending.</b> The results show that increased female parliamentary representation is associated with higher <b>government</b> health <b>spending.</b> Moreover, this association remains significant even after controlling for other determinants <b>of</b> <b>government</b> health <b>spending,</b> indicating that that the effect may be partially causal. The results also indicate that if lowand middle-income countries increased their share of women in parliaments by 10 percentage points, <b>government</b> health <b>spending</b> as a portion of GDP would, on average, increase by between 10 and 12 percent. The corresponding figure for high-income countries is around 5 percent. Overall, the analysis suggests that the level of female representation in parliaments has significant effect on countries health spending...|$|R
