30|$|Evident {{differences}} in dominant NLAB {{were found between}} C 1 and C 2 samples; {{this could be a}} consequence of {{differences in}} the environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, water, and maize provenance) and in the evolution of dough pH; this parameter has a strong and decisive influence on the control and selection of bacteria. Among the identified NLAB, the family Enterobacteriaceae was the predominant in C 1 doughs, followed by Acetobacter genus, differently from the doughs C 2 where Staphylococcus genus was the prevalent. Regarding Enterobacteriaceae, strains of E. asburiae were previously identified among thermotolerant wheat associated bacteria from a peninsular zone of India (Verma et al. 2016) and one E. ludwigii strain isolated from Lolium perenne rhizosphere showed plant growth promoting properties (Shoebitz et al. 2009). The genus Acetobacter has been previously reported to dominate, together with the genus Lactobacillus, the first step of fermentation of whole crop maize silage (Sträuber et al. 2012). Different species of the genus Acetobacter were also found in a preliminary study to explore the bacterial microbiota in Colombian maize fermented dough Masa Agria (Chavez-Lopez et al. 2016). Lactic and acetic acid provide sour taste in maize, but, at the same time, these fermentation products promote the activation of the phytases naturally present in grains and in bacteria, by a decrease of the pH value. The action of phytases {{plays a key role in}} improving nutritional value by increasing the bioavailability of essential dietary minerals. In addition, as it was observed in this study, Acetobacter species can be present in the later stage of cereal fermentation for their ability to utilize molecules other than sugars and to tolerate low pH conditions (Chavez-Lopez et al. 2016). Our findings on Staphylococcus isolated from C 2 doughs are in agreement with other researchers who stated that Staphylococcus sp. bacteria were isolated and identified from fresh yellow grains and roots of maize in Nigeria (<b>Orole</b> and Adejumo 2011). Their persistence during the fermentation steps can be explained by the higher pH values profile of C 2 doughs (4.3 – 4.1) that did not lead to selective environmental conditions.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 2nd century BC, Pompeius Trogus writes in his Historiae Philippicae of a Dacian king, <b>Oroles,</b> who fought against Celtic incursions. <b>Oroles</b> is {{recorded}} as resisting the intrusion of the Bastarnae, a people now generally considered to be of Germanic origin but who were in fact Celto-Germanic and, according to Livy, spoke a Celtic language. The Bastarnae moved from Silesia into what is now central and northern Moldavia.|$|R

5|$|Before Burebista became king, the Dacians {{experienced}} {{a succession of}} kings through the period of 450 to 60 BC. The kings included Dromichaetes, <b>Oroles</b> and Rubobostes {{in the third and}} second centuries BC. From the 4th century BC to the 2nd century BC the La Tène Celts of the Danube, Alpines and Balkans influenced the Dacian culture. La Tène material culture was found in the central and north-west of Dacia. The development of a La Tène based economy in 3rd–2nd century BC allowed the consolidation of political power through tribal unions. Such regional unions were found both among the Transylvanian Dacians under the rule of Rubobostes, and the Moldavian and Wallachian Getae in Argedava. It is from the La Tène that the Dacians were introduced to the potter's wheel, superior metal-working techniques and probably a tradition of coinage. Homes were a combination of Celtic and Dacian pottery, and certain Celtic style graves contain Dacian style vessels. This suggests a sort of co-existence and fusion between the cultures. Sometime after around 150 BC, however, evidence of La Tène culture peters out, around the same time the Dacian culture began to mature as evidenced by population and economic growth. Under Rubobstes the authority of the Dacians appears to have increased, thus ending the dominance of the Celtic culture, and leading to the Celts being expelled from the area or merged into the culture, or both at once. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that relations between Dacians and Celts living in the areas north and west of Dacia continued. Painted ceramics of late La Tène-style have been found in Dacian sites in west and central Dacia. Some of these were imported while others were made by Dacian potters imitating Celtic style. A stable monarchy, however, only developed when Burebista became king. Burebista's accession came with the expulsion of Celts around 60 BC when his forces moved through to the middle Danube region, and {{with the support of the}} religious establishment and leaders in Dacia which brought around a stricter moral code in the Dacian kingdom. Around this time pottery of the Dacian style began appearing in Celtic settlements in Central Europe, including former Yugoslavia including in Gomolava, Yugoslavia and Budapest, Hungary.|$|R
