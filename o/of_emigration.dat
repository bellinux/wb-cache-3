5|$|The {{population}} of Ireland collapsed dramatically {{during the second}} half of the 19th century. A {{population of}} over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was due to death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives. However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture <b>of</b> <b>emigration</b> lasting until the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 19th century, the major {{shipping}} lines financed Swedish emigrant agents {{and paid for}} the production of large quantities <b>of</b> <b>emigration</b> propaganda. Much of this promotional material, such as leaflets, was produced by immigration promoters in the U.S. Propaganda and advertising by shipping line agents was often blamed for emigration by the conservative Swedish ruling class, which grew increasingly alarmed at seeing the agricultural labor force leave the country. It was a Swedish 19th-century cliché to blame the falling ticket prices and the pro-emigration propaganda of the transport system for the craze <b>of</b> <b>emigration,</b> but modern historians have varying views about the real importance of such factors. Brattne and Åkerman have examined the advertising campaigns and the ticket prices as a possible third force between push and pull. They conclude that neither advertisements nor pricing had any decisive influence on Swedish emigration. While the companies remain unwilling, , to open their archives to researchers, the limited sources available suggest that ticket prices did drop in the 1880s, but remained on average artificially high because of cartels and price-fixing. On the other hand, H. A. Barton states that the cost of crossing the Atlantic dropped drastically between 1865 and 1890, encouraging poorer Swedes to emigrate. The research of Brattne and Åkerman has shown that the leaflets sent out by the shipping line agents to prospective emigrants would not so much celebrate conditions in the New World, as simply emphasize the comforts and advantages of the particular company. Descriptions of life in America were unvarnished, and the general advice to emigrants brief and factual. Newspaper advertising, while very common, tended to be repetitive and stereotyped in content.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Tønnies (1825–1903) {{remains to}} date {{one of the}} premier CDV photographers of Denmark. In June 1856 he began his {{photographic}} career as a partner under C. Fritsche in Aalborg and by December of the same year he bought his partner's share of the business and struck out with a studio under his own name. By 1861, Tönnies' business boomed requiring a larger studio and the hiring of assistants, and by 1870 he became a Danish citizen. Ultimately, his family business spanned three-generations and 75 years. The breadth of his photographic products included: Daguerreotypes, calotypes, pannotypes, photo-lithography, stereoscopy, ambrotypes, CDVs, and medallions. It is believed that he produced no less than 75,000 CDVs, many ordered in relation to a large wave <b>of</b> <b>emigration</b> from Nordjylland to North America. Owing to the poverty of Denmark's Vendsyssel region, local demands for inexpensive CDVs persisted in Aalborg right up until World War I, making Tönnies' studio one of the last to produce CDVs in Denmark.|$|E

His exceptional skills with figures and calculations led to different business ventures: he was an agent for the Anglo-African weekly newspaper (1860–1861) and Pine and Palm (1860–1862). In 1861, he became a representative at the Haitian Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Emigration,</b> empowering him with the transfers of funds for free blacks who sought to move to Haiti, via New York. As a result of his different ventures, White became a relatively wealthy man at a young age.|$|E

5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages <b>of</b> <b>emigration</b> included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E
5|$|The reforms, {{especially}} the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent {{half a million}} Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. New York Times cites reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. A large wave <b>of</b> <b>emigration</b> swept the nation. A spirited non-violent resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, painting over and turning street signs (on one occasion an entire invasion force from Poland was routed {{back out of the}} country after a day's wandering), defiance of various curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country the resistance held out for eight months, and was only circumvented by diplomatic stratagems (see below). There were sporadic acts of violence and several suicides by self-immolation (such as that of Jan Palach), but there was no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained Soviet-controlled until 1989, when the Velvet Revolution ended pro-Soviet rule peacefully, undoubtedly drawing upon the successes of the non-violent resistance twenty years earlier. The resistance also became an iconic example of civilian-based defense, which, along with unarmed civilian peacekeeping constitute the two ways that nonviolence can be and occasionally has been applied directly to military or paramilitary threats.|$|E
5|$|Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' {{freedom was}} {{significantly}} reduced and religion became a central feature {{of social and}} political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition <b>of</b> <b>emigration</b> from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms. In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina, Tanala and Antanosy may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country.|$|E

40|$|Hypotheses are {{presented}} {{to explain the}} juvenile migratory behavior of yearling chinook salmon and steelhead in the Yakima River over a thirteen-year period with particular reference to water movement. Interactions <b>of</b> <b>emigrations</b> with water movements, measured as daily flow, and daily change in flow, are pervasive, however annual variations in the annual timing <b>of</b> <b>emigrations</b> are not explained by timing of water movement. Even though annual <b>emigrations</b> <b>of</b> yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead can be tightly synchronized with water movements, under time patterns of water movement associated with impoundment and regulation, emigrations and water movements are not necessarily synchronous. An approach to statistical analysis using fish-weighted statistics is recommended in order to best capture the ambient physical conditions experienced by the average fish. Timing <b>of</b> <b>emigrations</b> <b>of</b> juvenile steelhead and yearling chinook overlap, but yearling chinook usually emigrate earlier (grand mean April 25) than juvenile steelhead (grand mean April 29). Yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrate under all observed water movement conditions, however individuals of both species are virtually certain to emigrate when sharp positive changes in daily water volume occur during the migration season. Both yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrants are positively associated with water accelerations. Yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrants are predominantly positively associated with flow, and they are only occasionally negatively associated with flow. When annual average instantaneous Yakima River flow is below the long term average (102. 4 m 3 /s), the average Yakima River yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrates within the highest water flows and accelerations available. These findings support theories of juvenile salmon migration advanced by Hoar, Groot, Thorpe, and Northcote...|$|R
