5|$|A {{second meeting}} {{occurred}} on 8 May, when Virginia came out while Monitor and four <b>other</b> <b>Federal</b> ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure Virginia into the Roads.

Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{table of}} congressional seats, <b>other</b> <b>federal</b> offices, and other governorships held by governors. All representatives and {{senators}} mentioned represented New Jersey.

5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction will result in unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of <b>other</b> <b>federal</b> departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{the federal}} {{constitution}} provided that details concerning the federal institutions, {{such as their}} locations, should {{be taken care of}} by the Federal Assembly (BV 1848 Art. 108). Thus on 28 November 1848, the Federal Assembly voted in majority to locate the seat of government in Berne. And, as a prototypical federal compromise, to assign <b>other</b> <b>federal</b> institutions, such as the Federal Polytechnical School (1854, the later ETH) to Zurich, and other institutions to Lucerne, such as the later SUVA (1912) and the Federal Insurance Court (1917). In 1875, a law (RS 112) fixed the compensations owed by the city of Bern for the federal seat.|$|E
