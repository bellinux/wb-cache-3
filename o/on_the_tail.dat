5|$|Sinosauropteryx was {{the first}} dinosaur to have its life {{colouration}} described by scientists based on physical evidence. Some fossils of Sinosauropteryx show an alternation of lighter and darker bands preserved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail.</b> Chen and colleagues initially interpreted this banding pattern as an artifact of the splitting between the main slab and counter-slab in which the original specimen was preserved. However, Longrich suggested in his 2002 presentation for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology that these specimens actually preserve remnants of the colouration pattern the animal would have exhibited in life. He argued that the dark, banded areas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> were too evenly spaced to {{have been caused by}} random separation of the fossil slabs, and that they represent fossilized pigments present in the feathers. Additionally, rather than an artifact of preservation or decomposition, the presence of dark feathers along only the top of the body may also reflect the colour pattern in life, indicating that Sinosauropteryx prima was countershaded with dark colouration on its back and lighter colouration on its underside, with bands or stripes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Next to the {{hydrated}} {{region is}} an intermediate region {{that is only}} partially hydrated. This boundary layer is approximately 0.3nm thick. Within this short distance, the water concentration drops from 2M on the headgroup side to nearly zero <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> (core) side. The hydrophobic core of the bilayer is typically 3-4nm thick, but this value varies with chain length and chemistry. Core thickness also varies significantly with temperature, in particular near a phase transition.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple and easily {{implementable}} model of credit contagion in which we include macro- and microstructural interdependencies among the debtors within a credit portfolio. We show that even for diversified portfolios, moderate microstructural interde-pendencies {{have a significant impact}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tails</b> of <b>the</b> loss distribution. This impact in-creases dramatically for less diversified microstructures. Since the inclusion of microstruc-tural interdependencies acts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tails,</b> <b>the</b> choice of an appropriate risk measure for credit risk management is a delicate task...|$|R
5|$|The pilots felt a jolt, and the {{autopilot}} disengaged. As Records {{took hold of}} his control column, Haynes focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> engine, whose instruments indicated it was malfunctioning; he found its throttle and fuel supply controls jammed. At Dvorak's suggestion, a valve cutting fuel to the tail engine was shut off. This part of the emergency took 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it is dark brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white to a greater or smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The scales <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E
5|$|The tail is {{moderately}} {{short and}} does not have large thorn-like structures called dermal denticles that are normally found on skates. This lack of denticles distinguishes it from all but two species of skates that {{are found in the}} western Atlantic. Larger individuals do have three rows of smaller denticles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> and mature females also possess denticles on the head and shoulders, and along the dorsal midbelt of the disk and tail. Denticles are completely absent on small individuals.|$|E

5|$|The varying {{patterns}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> flukes distinguish individual animals. A {{study using}} data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the mark-release-recapture technique. A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained by College of the Atlantic. Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} have formed from a low-pressure area, possibly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> end of a cold front on October 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward on October 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression. No damage {{is known to have}} been caused by the {{tropical storm}}.|$|E

5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of the motions of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast. They further suggested that some species of Psittacosaurus were more terrestrial than others.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1999, Color Air {{terminated}} all {{flights and}} ceased operations. On {{the day of}} the termination, the stock price of Braathens increased by 16%. Immediately following the bankruptcy, the two airlines increased their prices. Subsequently, Braathens increased their ticket price by 15%, but stated that this {{had nothing to do with}} the elimination of competition, since the price increase was not on any Oslo routes. In November, Braathens started to remove routes, and announced they would increase prices by 20%. They also reintroduced the Flag of Norway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> which since the rebranding had been replaced by a silver, abstract wing. Both Braathens and SAS lost more than NOK1 billion in 1999, totaling the cost of the price war between the three airlines to exceed NOK 3 billion.|$|E
5|$|On 6April, all {{available}} Liberators joined B-25 Mitchells of No.79 Wing in {{an assault on}} a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. Anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, as well as attacks by enemy fighters, resulted {{in the loss of}} two Liberators, and the crews' standard of aerial gunnery was criticised afterwards. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the following day. Later that month, No.23 Squadron, having recently converted to Liberators from A-31 Vengeances, was added to No.82 Wing's strength. The wing's three flying squadrons identified themselves with black chevrons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> fins of their aircraft, No.21's facing backwards, No.23's downwards, and No.24's forwards.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. Interdigital webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long hairs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> that {{is characteristic of}} Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and the bony palate itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E

5|$|The White County Emergency Management Director {{reported}} that an F0 tornado touched {{down in the}} southwest corner of White County near the Hall County line at the Wauka Valley Farms area, which formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> end of a feeder band associated with the remnants of Hurricane Dennis. The tornado path width was estimated to be approximately 1/8 to 1/4mile wide. Significant damage was reported at the Wauka Valley Farms facility. Hundreds of trees were uprooted, and two barns were completely destroyed. One structure sustained room damage and a number of trees and power lines were also down along Town Creek road. Overall, in excess of 200 trees were down in the southwest part of the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail,</b> where they may merge to form a band.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloration}} of the upperparts {{is generally}} uniform, with some scattered darker hairs. There is a yellow {{ring around the}} eyes, which is more prominent than in A.sylvanus. The underparts are not strongly demarcated from the upperparts in color and are yellow-brown to gray. There are some scattered white hairs on the chin. Although this white spot is better developed than in A.sylvanus, A.spegazzinii lacks the conspicuous white spot seen in A.simulator. The color of the feet ranges from white and yellow-brown to gray. Ungual tufts of hairs cover the claws; these hairs are grayish-brown at the bases and whitish at the tips. The amount of hair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> is variable, but it is dark brown above and white to yellow-brown below. High-altitude animals tend to have hairier ears and tails.|$|E
