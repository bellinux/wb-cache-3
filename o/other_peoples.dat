The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and <b>other</b> <b>peoples.</b> Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship.

5|$|Blökumen are {{mentioned}} in the Flateyjarbók, an Icelandic manuscript from the late 14th century, which preserved a 13th-century biography of King Olaf of Norway. This work contains a separate chapter on the adventures of a Norwegian prince, Eymund, at the court of Prince Jarizleifr in Novgorod. The chapter narrates that Eymund informed Jarizleifr of the departure of Jarizleifr's brother, Burizlaf, to Tyrkland, and added that Burizlaf was preparing to attack Jarizleifr with a huge army formed by Tyrkir, Blökumen and <b>other</b> <b>peoples.</b> Curta, Spinei and other scholars identify Jarizleifr with Yaroslav the Wise, and Burizlaf with Sviatopolk I of Kiev. They argue that the reference to the Tyrkir and Blökumen proves that Sviatopolk I hired Pechenegs and Vlachs {{when he decided to}} go to war with Yaroslav. Furthermore, they propose that the Blökumenn of the Flatey Book, like the Blakumen of the runic inscription from Gottland, were Vlachs from Moldavia or Wallachia.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, {{veterinarian}} {{and professor}} Veikko Rislakki (then Svanberg) proposed a different theory in his doctoral thesis. He argued that {{three types of}} wild horses existed in Europe, one of which he {{believed to be the}} Przewalski's Horse. Rislakki believed this unrefined and notably large-headed type was the horse the early Finns encountered about 1000 BCE. He suggested that the Finns later encountered <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> and horses south of the Gulf of Finland, and that these peoples had better proportioned horses with a shorter muzzle and wider forehead, descended from the Tarpan. In addition, Rislakki suggested that the Finns came across European horses of Spanish and French origin during the first few centuries CE, larger in size and with narrow foreheads. Rislakki believed that his craniometric examinations, carried out in the 1920s, proved the influence of all these three horse types. Almost 20 years later, during the Continuation War, Rislakki also measured Karelian horses, and proposed they also came from an original Northern European animal descended from the Tarpan. Modern studies have discredited theories suggesting modern domesticated horse breeds descending from the Tarpan or the Przewalski's horse. The modern Konik horse resembles the extinct Tarpan however.|$|E

40|$|Blood {{donation}} is {{a critical}} part of health services with a viable blood supply underpinning an effective health program in any country. Typically blood is provided by voluntary donations from citizens and is therefore reliant on the goodwill and altruistic commitment of donors. In Australia, like many other developed nations, there are many challenges in maintaining a sufficient and sustainable blood supply. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service Donor and Community research group aim is to understand the barriers, motivations and perceptions of donors. Blood donation is a ‘people-processing’ service (Lovelock 1983, Russell-Bennett et al 2013) with the marketing exchange relating to bodily fluid rather than money and is an altruistic social service that has no direct benefit for the customer donor rather the benefit is for <b>other</b> <b>people</b> and society (Kotler and Zaltman 1971). Emotion {{has been shown to be}} a motivator and a barrier in a variety of Blood Service studies, this is a key insight that is further explored in the current study. Other key social factors that impact blood donor behavior are classified as social because they involve perceptions of <b>other</b> <b>people’s</b> beliefs and responses (such as moral or subjective norms), peer pressure, <b>other</b> <b>people’s</b> expectations and <b>other</b> <b>people</b> as a form of support. Given that emotions are social phenomena (Parkinson 1996), this study focuses on the role of <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the blood donation process and how <b>other</b> <b>people</b> relates to the emotional experience of blood donors. We argue in this paper that overcoming emotional barriers to blood donation by leveraging the role of <b>other</b> <b>people</b> will influence low donation rates in Australia. To date, there has been little evidence in service research that identifies. In this paper we explore how <b>other</b> <b>people</b> influence the emotional experience of donors and how, donor emotions create the need for <b>other</b> <b>people</b> as a coping resource...|$|R
