Anonymous Referee # 1 Received and published: 10 December 2010 The manuscript uses simulations of the well-established model CMAM to investigate the impacts of the solar cycle and particle precipitation on the atmosphere. The main conclusion is that for accurate simulations of ozone and dynamics, these processes need to be properly taken into consideration. The paper is well suited to publication in ACP and in my opinion needs only minor revisions. My main concerns were in the <b>overgeneralisations</b> of the results obtained from the one model in the comparisons with measurements, {{and the need for}} more comments on statistical uncertainty in some places...|$|R
40|$|Contact with {{accountants}} {{has often}} been suggested as a strategy for changing the stereotypical perceptions people have of accounting. This study examines how contact with accountants influences these perceptions. The perceptions of sixteen {{people who have had}} no contact with accountants are compared with perceptions of sixteen people who have been the recipients of information from accountants. The perception data was collected by questionnaire and interview. Response data was analysed and compared between the collection techniques and participant groups. The results reveal that while the perceptions do differ between participant groups they are still <b>overgeneralisations</b> and are therefore stereotypical. These findings confirm the claims by social psychologists that while contact may assist in changing perceptions, the change will not necessarily have the desired effect. This has implications for how the profession attempts to alter its image to the public at large...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two main}} factors, which are {{influential}} on EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners’ errors. The first is the learner’s native language, {{and the second is}} the target language,namely the language being learnt. Because the learner has already acquired his/her own nativelanguage, she/he will be influenced by his/her native language at various levels such asphonological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and discourse levels. If the learner is notaware of the fact that languages differ from each other at these levels, the risk of errors will behigher. On the other hand, <b>overgeneralisations</b> in the target language and lack of knowledgecause EFL learners to make errors. In this article, a research based on a list of very commonlymispronounced words by EFL teacher trainees at the ELT (English Language Teaching) Department of Gazi Education Faculty of Gazi University is introduced. These errors should notbe considered as the errors only unique to the students in the domain of this research, but otherTurkish EFL learners might also make the same errors if we consider the reasons of the errors. The reasons of the errors were also investigated by means of the questionnaire given to thesubjects of this study...|$|R
40|$|Background Self-critical {{thinking}} is common across psychological disorders. This study hypothesised {{that it may}} {{play an important role}} in ‘overgeneralisation’, the process of drawing general implications from an isolated negative experience. Aims To explore the impact of two experimental tasks designed to elicit self-critical thoughts on the endorsement of general negative self-views of clinical and nonclinical populations. Methods Three groups (depression, eating disorders, and nonclinical controls), completed standardised questionnaires and the two tasks. Participants rated their self-critical thinking and general negative self-beliefs before and after each task. Results Following a failure experience, both clinical groups showed a greater increase in general negative self-views compared to controls, indicating greater <b>overgeneralisation.</b> Both habitual and increases in state self-critical thinking were associated with <b>overgeneralisation</b> while negative perfectionism was not. <b>Overgeneralisation</b> was more strongly associated with post-task reduced mood than self-criticism. Conclusions Self-critical thinking may be an important factor in the process of <b>overgeneralisation,</b> and the increase in general negative self-views may be particularly crucial for lowering of mood. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} children’s argument structure <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors (e. g. *Don’t giggle me!). Errors of {{this kind}} arise from children observing that certain verbs can appear {{in more than one}} argument structure (e. g. The ball rolled/Homer rolled the ball). This pattern can be usefully generalised to allow children who have heard a verb produced in only one of these structures (e. g. The window opened) to produce it in the other (e. g. Marge opened the window). The ability to generalise patterns to new items is key to children becoming productive language users. However, if they overgeneralise this pattern, errors will result: Bart giggled is grammatical, but *Lisa giggled Bart (meaning Lisa made Bart giggle) is not. This thesis tested three hypotheses designed to explain how children retreat from such <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors, or, indeed, avoid making them altogether: the semantic verb class hypothesis (Pinker, 1989); the entrenchment hypothesis (Braine & Brooks, 1995); and the preemption hypothesis (Goldberg, 1995). Chapter 3 uses a novel-verb grammaticality judgment paradigm to investigate <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors in the locative construction (e. g. *Marge filled tea into the cup). Chapter 4 investigates <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors in the transitive and intransitive constructions, using a grammaticality judgment paradigm with known verbs, as well as a production priming paradigm designed to elicit errors from young children (e. g. *Homer swam the fish). Finally, in order to investigate the role of semantics in language development more generally, Chapter 5 moves beyond <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors to investigate children’s acquisition of the passive construction (e. g. Bart was helped by Lisa). This thesis adds to a growing body of work demonstrating that none of the individual theories (semantics, entrenchment, preemption) alone is able to explain children’s retreat from <b>overgeneralisation,</b> and that an integrated approach, such as that proposed by Ambridge and colleagues’ FIT account, is required to account for the data. The thesis moves our understanding forward by demonstrating both that this account can explain error patterns in production, and that the role of verb-in-construction semantic compatibility (a key aspect of the FIT account) can explain children’s acquisition of argument structure more widely...|$|E
40|$|Whilst some locative verbs {{alternate}} between the ground- and figure-locative constructions (e. g.

The present study investigated two proposals for how learners (aged 5 – 6, 9 – 10 and adults) acquire this restriction, using a novel-verb-learning grammaticality-judgment paradigm. In support of the semantic verb class hypothesis, participants in all age groups used the semantic properties of novel verbs to determine the locative constructions (ground/figure/both) {{in which they could}} and could not appear. In support of the frequency hypothesis, participants ’ tolerance of <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors decreased with each increasing level of verb frequency (novel/low/high).

This paper first compares four countries from Europe and Asia on a macroeconomic level {{as well as on}} cultural dimensions. It then investigates perceived cultural differences between managers on the transfer of human resource policies by contrasting the perceptions of German headquarters managers with those of their subsidiary managers in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia. This exploratory study uses qualitative methodology to analyse twenty four in-depth interviews with Human Resource directors and line managers in German electrical, mechanical and chemical companies. The study confirms the importance of perceived cultural differences between managers at headquarters and in the subsidiaries and highlights the presence of misperceptions based on <b>overgeneralisations</b> emanating from the German headquarters as well as local subsidiaries. Convergence is confirmed on a HR policy level with crossvergence taking place on a process level via regional platforms. The growing role of the subsidiary HR director as a cultural translator and regional team player is found to be a key element in the transfer process...|$|R
40|$|Stereotypes are <b>overgeneralisations</b> that dismiss {{individual}} {{traits and}} create tension among various groups in society. One {{of the most}} common stereotypes, ethnic stereotyping, can be considered a form of racism, since the stereotyped group is morally affected. This is the case of Chicanas, who apart from being victims of racism, have also been victims of sexism. Due to this, one of the means to counteract and redefine their identity has been literature. In fact, in works written by Chicanas, irony is a frequent literary tool, since it facilitates social issues to be discussed from a distant point of view. Considering all this, the main aim of this dissertation is to examine how Chicana writer Michele Serros uses irony to challenge stereotypes in her novel How to Be a Chicana Role Model. To this end, various instances of ethnic stereotyping from the novel are compared with works written mainly by Chicanas. Through this reading of the novel, I seek to illustrate how the various instances of ethnic stereotyping reveal the multidirectionality of stereotypes, the notion of cultural authenticity and the difficult process of becoming a Chicana writer. In doing so, Serros breaks stereotypes and creates a new role model for Chicanas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective To {{review the}} rates of self-harm in British South Asian women, look into the factors that {{contribute}} to these high rates of self-harm and discuss possible strategies for prevention and provision of culturally sensitive service for South Asian women who harm themselves. Method Review. Results South Asian women are significantly more likely to self harm between ages 16 – 24 years than white women. Across all age groups {{the rates of}} self harm are lower in South Asian men as compared to South Asian women. These women are generally younger, likely to be married and less likely to be unemployed or use alcohol or other drugs. They report more relationship problems within the family. South Asian women are less likely to attend the ER with repeat episode since they hold the view that mainstream services do not meet their needs. Conclusion South Asian women are at an increased risk of self harm. Their demographic characteristics, precipitating factors and clinical management are different than whites. There is an urgent need for all those concerned with the mental health services for ethnic minorities to take positive action and eradicate the barriers that prevent British South Asians from seeking help. There is a need to move away from stereotypes and <b>overgeneralisations</b> and start from the user's frame of reference, taking into account family dynamics, belief systems and cultural constraints. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} acquisition of particle verbs in Dutch. Based on longitudinal child data it shows how children acquire lexical categories V, A and P and how they acquire the complex predicate status of particle verbs. It shows that {{the acquisition of}} categories A and P {{is dependent on the}} acquisition of category V and that the acquisition of category V is tightly connected to the acquisition of verb-second. It is the acquisition of this verb-second that also leads to the acquisition of the complex predicate status of particle verbs. It further shows that the acquisition process inevitably leads children into <b>overgeneralisation</b> of preposition stranding, but that the same acquisition process also inevitably leads children out of it. This dissertation further presents data from experiments with adult speakers that shed an interesting light on the role this <b>overgeneralisation</b> still plays in the adult grammar. Investigating the acquisition of particle verbs cannot be done without taking {{a closer look at the}} acquisition process itself. As such, this dissertation also addresses more general questions concerning the acquisition process, such as the role of the lexicon and of generalizations. It shows an acquisition process in which the child makes use of pragmatic bootstrapping and syntactic cueing to build layer upon layer of grammar without the need of inherently, specifically linguistic knowledge. This dissertation will be of interest to anyone working on language acquisition, the syntax of particle verbs and preposition stranding, and the interaction between syntax and information structure...|$|E

40|$|Background: Non-organic {{disorders}} are frequently encountered in clinical medicine, {{but the number}} of reports on non-organic language disorders is limited. There is a lack of diagnostic criteria for this entity. Aims: The paper describes three patients with a language disorder that is not ascribed to concomitantly present brain lesions and compares the clinical and linguistic features with those of previously reported cases of non-organic language disorder. Methods & Procedures: Case studies and cross-tabulation of characteristics of our reported patients and of patients reported earlier in the literature. Outcomes & Results: All three reported patients had a prior history of psychiatric disorders, and lived alone or were involved in conflicting situations. All of them presented cerebral lesions as documented by neuro-imaging but with a linguistic presentation that is totally incompatible with true aphasia and therefore not related to the documented lesions. Characteristic linguistic features included abrupt onset of a nonfluent language disorder with agrammatism, <b>overgeneralisations,</b> paraphasias preceded by pauses, and error variations. Comprehension was unaffected. Additionally dysarthria with hypophonia and reduced speech rate was striking. The linguistic symptoms fluctuated over time, dependent on cognitive distraction and context. Conclusion: The presence of a brain lesion does not imply the organic nature of all symptoms including language deficits. We argue the necessity of taking into account non-organic language behaviour in the differential diagnosis of aphasia. The common characteristics reported in our cases may serve as a basis for the future development of diagnostic criteria...|$|R
40|$|Master of EducationAgainst a {{background}} which proposes {{significant change in}} the education of deaf students, it is significant that the Australasian Signed English system has had little investigation, either in terms of teacher accuracy in using Signed English, or in studies to examine the development of English competency among the students engaged in such programs. This study has sought to investigate the development of English structures in a group of children whose education is taking place through the medium of Signed English combined with speech and audition. Language samples were collected as a matter of routine {{during the course of a}} school year from three children who commenced the year aged 6. 7, 6. 8 and 6. 9 years. Activities which typically occur in classrooms over the course of a year were used rather than contexts which are not authentic and are unrelated to the normal communicative environment of the classroom. Three codes of English have been examined: spoken English, signed English and written English, and eleven aspects of English grammatical structure: negation, copula, possessives, plurals, pronouns, relativisation, conjunctions, third person singular, question forms, past tense and auxiliaries. The data from the three children indicate the presence of developing English structures. These may occur in the mature form, in a non-mature form, or as yet unmarked or marked inconsistently. There is also evidence of approximations which mirror the <b>overgeneralisations</b> to be found in young hearing learners of English. The data reveal differences between the three children and differences between the three modes, as well as the degree to which the children accurately use the three forms of English. The results of this study present a possible interpretation as to the English development which is occurring in many children engaged in Signed English programs. Further examination, particularly on a longitudinal basis, is recommended. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Social trait {{inference}} from faces exerts a {{huge impact}} on social outcomes ranging from mate choice to voting preferences (Todorov et al. 2005; Rhodes, G., 2006). Although previous studies have identified from static faces the morphological face features which influence social judgements (Dotsch &# 38; Todorov, 2012), {{the question is whether the}} dynamics of facial muscles can flexibly and transiently produce specific expressions that signal important social traits for social interactions. We addressed this question by: (i) quantifying the influence of dynamic facial expressions on judgments of social traits; (ii) teasing apart the contribution of facial morphology and facial expressions to social trait judgments; and (iii) measuring the similarities of facial expressions between social traits and emotions. We used a computer graphics platform that parametrically controls the dynamics of any facial muscle group (coded as 41 different Action Units, Ekman, 1978), each animated with 6 temporal parameters: peak amplitude, peak latency, onset latency, offset latency, acceleration, deceleration (Yu et al. 2012). Twelve participants judged the trustworthiness, dominance, attractiveness (and perceived intensity) of a series of facial animations of randomly chosen Action Units and their dynamic parameters. Reverse correlation estimated the expressions as sets of facial movements associated with the perception of each social trait and their intensity. Results were highly consistent between participants, with attractiveness and trustworthiness positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with dominance. In addition, a comparison of these facial expressions with those similarly derived for facial emotions (Jack et al. 2012) showed that social trait expressions are not simple one-to-one <b>overgeneralisations</b> of emotional expressions, but a distinct set of signals composed of movements from different emotion categories. To conclude, we show that the face can flexibly and transiently produce facial movements that modulate social signals of attractiveness, trustworthiness and dominance that are paramount for social interactions...|$|R

In a large corpus of English locative utterances (e. g., the woman sprayed water onto the wall/wall with water), we found structural biases which changed over development and which could explain <b>overgeneralisation</b> behaviour. Children and adults had similar verb classes and a correspondence analysis suggested that lexical distributional regularities in the adult input could help to explain the acquisition of these classes.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of past participle {{agreement}} by young preschool children and adults speaking Québec French. The results show {{that this type of}} optional agreement in the target grammar is a late acquisition, starting probably in school-aged children. The main features of {{the use of}} past participle agreement seem to be lexical and individual variation, <b>overgeneralisation</b> of the non-agreeing form, and use of agreement in incorrect constructions. Following a distinction between inconsistent and variable input, it is proposed that past participle agreement in Québec French is a type of inconsistent input and as such it is regularized by children as non-agreement. It is proposed that the underlying syntactic mechanism is inert, while the optionality comes from variation over the choice of different lexical forms as a function of their frequency in the input...|$|E

The paper presents a study based on an analysis of grammatical errors which was carried out at Vytautas Magnus University.

The analysis has shown that the most frequent error is incorrect usage of case, affecting either form or meaning or both. This paper discusses the errors of <b>overgeneralisation</b> in case marking, dif culties in acquiring prepositional constructions and in ectional paradigms.

40|$|Theoretical {{arguments}} {{based on}} the "poverty of the stimulus" have denied a priori the possibility that abstract linguistic representations can be learned inductively from exposure to the environment, given that the linguistic input available to the child is both underdetermined and degenerate. I reassess such learnability arguments by exploring a) the type and amount of statistical information implicitly available in the input {{in the form of}} distributional and phonological cues; b) psychologically plausible inductive mechanisms for constraining the search space; c) the nature of linguistic representations, algebraic or statistical. To do so I use three methodologies: experimental procedures, linguistic analyses based on large corpora of naturally occurring speech and text, and computational models implemented in computer simulations. In Chapters 1, 2, and 5, I argue that long-distance structural dependencies - traditionally hard to explain with simple distributional analyses based on ngram statistics - can indeed be learned associatively provided the amount of intervening material is highly variable or invariant (the Variability effect). In Chapter 3, I show that simple associative mechanisms instantiated in Simple Recurrent Networks can replicate the experimental findings under the same conditions of variability. Chapter 4 presents successes and limits of such results across perceptual modalities (visual vs. auditory) and perceptual presentation (temporal vs. sequential), as well as the impact of long and short training procedures. In Chapter 5, I show that generalisation to abstract categories from stimuli framed in non-adjacent dependencies is also modulated by the Variability effect. In Chapter 6, I show that the putative separation of algebraic and statistical styles of computation based on successful speech segmentation versus unsuccessful generalisation experiments (as published in a recent Science paper) is premature and is the effect of a preference for phonological properties of the input. In chapter 7 computer simulations of learning irregular constructions suggest {{that it is possible to}} learn from positive evidence alone, despite Gold's celebrated arguments on the unlearnability of natural languages. Evolutionary simulations in Chapter 8 show that irregularities in natural languages can emerge from full regularity and remain stable across generations of simulated agents. In Chapter 9 I conclude that the brain may endowed with a powerful statistical device for detecting structure, generalising, segmenting speech, and recovering from <b>overgeneralisations.</b> The experimental and computational evidence gathered here suggests that statistical language learning is more powerful than heretofore acknowledged by the current literature.

40|$|Linear (or proportional) {{relations}} {{receive a}} lot of attention in elementary and secondary mathematics education. Several authors have warned, however, that this may lead to a tendency in students to use linear models also in situations where they are not applicable. Until recent years, there were no systematic investigations with respect to this phenomenon. The first studies focussing on this tendency were conducted by De Bock (2002). He showed that 12 - 16 -year old students often assume that when a geometrical figure is enlarged k times, the area and volume of that figure enlarge k times as well. It was pointed out that the over-use of linearity generally persisted despite the provision ofconsiderable support, and that it was due to lacks in students geometrical knowledge, to the intuitive character of proportionality and to a superficial approach to mathematical problem solving. The current dissertation builds on the doctoral research by De Bock (2002). The goal is twofold: (1) further clarifying the psychological and educational factors underlying the tendency to respond linearly to non-linear geometry problems and (2) broadening the scope of the over-useof linearity to manifestations in other mathematical domains, and increasing our understanding of the psychological and educational roots of the phenomenon in general. The first four manuscripts of the dissertation are related to the firstgoal. Manuscript I deals with the impact of the More A  more B  and Same A  same B  intuitive rules (Stavy & Tirosh, 2000) on students thinking. An empirical study pointed out whether upper secondary students in Flanders actually tend to give answers in line with these rules, and whether  in that case  their reasoning processes also are affected by those rules. In manuscript II, a study is described that investigated whether upper secondary students tendency to give linear answers to non-linear geometry problems is influenced by the fact that these geometry problems are formulated with indirect measures for the area and volume (instead of direct measures). In manuscript III, it is studied whether a rather drastic change of the experimental context (offering non-linear problems as meaningful performance tasks instead of traditional word problems as happened in all the previous studies) can break the over-use of linearity in upper elementary students. Manuscript IV reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of an experimental lesson series aimed at developing in lower secondary students the necessary knowledge elements, skills and attitudes to respond adequately to linear and non-linear geometry problems. The last three manuscripts deal with the second goal of the dissertation. Manuscript V reports on the elaboration of the research on the over-use of linearity to the domain of probabilistic reasoning. A literature review was conducted to see whether certain probabilistic errors can be interpreted as <b>overgeneralisations</b> of the linear model, and an empirical investigation revealed whether upper secondary students are indeed prone to these errors. Manuscript VI presents a study that focused on the over-use of linearity in elementary and lower secondary students solving relatively simple arithmetic word problems. This study also allowed to describe the development of the tendency to over-use linear methods with the age and educational experience of students. Manuscript VII, finally, provides a more general overview of manifestations of students over-use linearity {{in a wide variety of}} mathematical tasks and subdomains. Different appearances of the over-use of linearity are categorised and analysed, and the psychological and educational factors that are at the roots of the phenomenon are listed and discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

One assumption on an rational agent is that an agent is to behave to maximise his expected payoff. Results of the current experiment, however, show subjects ’ seemingly puzzled tendency inconsistent with the assumption above. The law of small numbers is observed in the experiment.

40|$|AbstractChildren {{must learn}} the {{structural}} biases of locative verbs {{in order to}} avoid making <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors (e. g., ∗I filled water into the glass). It is thought that they use linguistic and situational information to learn verb classes that encode structural biases. In addition to situational cues, we examined whether children and adults could use the lexical distribution of nouns in the post-verbal noun phrase of transitive utterances to assign novel verbs to locative classes. In Experiment 1, children and adults used lexical distributional cues to assign verb classes, but were unable to use situational cues appropriately. In Experiment 2, adults generalised distributionally-learned classes to novel verb arguments, demonstrating that distributional information can cue abstract verb classes. Taken together, these studies show that human language learners can use a lexical distributional mechanism that is similar to that used by computational linguistic systems that use large unlabelled corpora to learn verb meaning...|$|E

The results revealed that learners relied on three major learning strategies - native language transfer, synonymy, and <b>overgeneralisation</b> that could lead to uncommon and deviant use of English delexical structures by learners.

40|$|Main Research Project: Self-critical {{thinking}} and <b>overgeneralisation</b> in depression and eating disorders: An experimental study This {{study investigated the}} hypothesis that self-critical thinking {{plays an important role}} in ‘overgeneralisation’ where specific negative experiences result in more global negative self-views (sometimes known as ‘core beliefs’ or ‘schemas’). Two experimental tasks, one involving word puzzles of varying difficulty, and one focused on body image, were used to elicit self-critical thoughts in participants with depression (n= 26), eating disorders (Anorexia, Bulimia and ED-NOS; n= 26) and nonclinical participants (n= 26). As predicted, following failure experiences on the word puzzle task, the clinical groups showed greater global negative self-views, controlling for baseline scores, compared to controls. Both habitual and increases in state self-critical thinking was associated with <b>overgeneralisation</b> while negative perfectionism was not. As predicted from Barnard and Teasdale’s (1991) Interacting Cognitive Subsystems model, increased global negative self-views were more strongly associated with post-task lowering of mood than self-criticism. Unexpectedly, participants with eating disorders did not report significantly more appearance-related self-criticism or greater global negative self-views after the body image task than the other groups. Overall, the findings are consistent with the suggestion that self-criticism may play an important role in the activation of global negative self-views after a specific negative experience, and this <b>overgeneralisation</b> may in turn result in low mood. Keywords: Self-criticism, depression, eating disorder, overgeneral, failure, perfectionism Service Improvement Project: Service user perspectives on the use of outcome measures in psychological therapy Despite much research into the benefits of outcome measurement, service user opinions on this as part of the therapy process have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess service users’ experiences of completing measures during psychological therapy, with a view to exploring how therapists can maximise how helpful measures are in therapy. Fifteen participants completed surveys about the use of measures in their current episode of care. Results showed that despite mixed experiences in how measures were explained and used, service users showed generally favourable attitudes towards their use in therapy, with them being perceived as most helpful when well integrated into sessions by their therapists. Implications for clinical practice, service development, and further research are discussed. Keywords: outcome measures, service user views, questionnaires, therapy, routine outcome measurement Critical Literature Review: Hoarding among older adults: An evaluative review This article presents an evaluative review of the literature on hoarding in older adult populations. Interest in hoarding is growing rapidly, with significant media attention and the inclusion of ‘hoarding disorder’ in DSM- 5. Studies are now beginning to examine the phenomenon within particular client groups. This article aims to synthesise and examine research findings regarding older adults with hoarding problems. Database and journal searching revealed a small but growing body of work in this area, which was reviewed with respect to a number of theoretical issues. The reviewed studies tended to rely on purely descriptive methodologies, meaning that typical case presentations and circumstances are well documented but underlying causal and maintenance mechanisms are less well understood. There is a clear need for longitudinal work and cross-sectional designs comparing age groups, utilising appropriate control groups where possible.

40|$|BACKGROUND Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) {{procedures}} {{have been used}} to train individuals to interpret ambiguous information in a negative or benign direction and have provided evidence that negative biases causally contribute to emotional vulnerability. METHOD Here we present the development and validation of a new form of CBM designed to manipulate the cognitive errors known to characterize both depression and anxiety. Our manipulation was designed to modify the biased cognitions identified by Beck's cognitive error categories (e. g. arbitrary inference, <b>overgeneralisation)</b> and typically targeted during therapy. RESULTS In a later test of spontaneous inferences, unselected (Experiment 1) and vulnerable participants (Experiment 2) who had generated positive alternatives rather than errors perceived novel hypothetical events, their causes and outcomes in a non-distorted manner. These groups were also less vulnerable to two different types of emotional stressor (video clips; and an imagined social situation). Furthermore participants' interpretation of their own performance on a problem-solving task was improved by the manipulation, despite actual performance showing no significant change. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that Cognitive Error Modification can promote positive inferences, reduce vulnerability to stress and improve self-perceptions of performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the manipulation of}} English interrogatives by francophone learners in informal situations. This study equally intends to discuss the inherent interrogative difficulties face by these learners as they negotiate interaction outside the classroom. Using the purposive sampling technique, a sample of 122 informants was used. Data collection {{was done with the}} aid of a tape-recorder and personal observation. The study used descriptive and inferential statistics to analyse data. Using Quirk et al (1972) framework on interrogatives, four interrogative forms were examined and the following findings recorded: that the production of interrogative forms by francophone students of English deviates tremendously from the standard British English; that these learners face much difficulty in the use of tag questions than any of the other interrogatives; that francophone learners make errors caused by language interference, <b>overgeneralisation</b> of the rule, language rectification, poor mastery of the English language and lastly, what can be termed “the linguistic deficit of the English language”. It was equally discovered that most of the students failed to understand the pragmatic value of English rhetorical questions. Key words: interrogatives, pragmatic value, francophone learners...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of immediately modelling the correct solution to a task on which children were making errors. The technique is based on proposals by Saxton (1997) who, in his contrast theory of negative input, claims that corrective speech input is particularly effective when it immediately follows a child's error, such as an <b>overgeneralisation</b> of a verb ending. Our study concerns a very different domain, that of children learning to balance beams on a fulcrum, but one in which children also tend to overgeneralise a particular strategy. On a pre-test on the balance beam task, we {{identified a number of}} children (N = 79, mean age = 74. 82 months) who were making errors. These children were randomly assigned to two groups and either (a) watched the correct solution being modelled by an adult, or (b) saw the correct solution being modelled by an adult immediately after their own error. The latter, contrast modelling, condition produced a significantly higher number of children who had improved at the task at post-test. The implications of these findings for general models of development are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|How do {{children}} {{eventually come}} {{to avoid the}} production of <b>overgeneralisation</b> errors, in particular, those involving the dative (e. g., *I said her ‘‘no’’) ? The present study addressed this question by obtaining from adults and children (5 ! 6, 9 ! 10 years) judgements of well-formed and over-general datives with 301 different verbs (44 for children). A significant effect of pre-emption*whereby {{the use of a}} verb in the prepositional-object (PO) -dative construction constitutes evidence that double-object (DO) -dative uses are not permitted*was observed for every age group. A significant effect of entrenchment*whereby the use of a verb in any construction constitutes evidence that unattested dative uses are not permitted*was also observed for every age group, with both predictors also accounting for developmental change between ages 5 ! 6 and 9 ! 10 years. Adults demonstrated knowledge of a morphophonological constraint that prohibits Latinate verbs from appearing in the DO-dative construction (e. g., *I suggested her the trip). Verbs ’ semantic properties (supplied by independent adult raters) explained additional variance for all groups and developmentally, with the relative influence of narrow- vs broad-range semantic properties increasing with age. We conclude by outlining an account of the formation and restriction of argument-structure generalisations designed to accommodate these findings.

40|$|This thesis explores childrenâ€™s {{acquisition}} of Shona morphology, {{in particular the}} {{acquisition of}} grammatical morphemes. The thesis describes how the morphology of Shona-speaking children develops. Of key interest is how they acquire inflections and the strategies they adopt. Slobinâ€™s Operating Principles (henceforth OPs) are used as the framework for data analysis. The hypotheses {{that are used in}} this thesis generate from Slobinâ€™s OPs. The data is analysed using morphological analysis and hypotheses derived from Slobinâ€™s OPs. The findings of this study show that nouns and verbs are first produced in the form of content words without the grammatical morphemes (GMs) then they occur with a vowel {{that is part of the}} target GM. The final stage of the development of GMs is when children produce words that are similar to adult words. The strategies that are used by the children conform to the hypotheses that are derived from Slobinâ€™s OPs. There is evidence of <b>overgeneralisation</b> of the plural morpheme (ma-). This study also reveals the order of acquisition of some GMs. A noteworthy feature of the three childrenâ€™s speech is the sheer number of productive GMs that they could handle. The findings of this study contribute to the areas of morphology and child language acquisition of Bantu languages in general and of Shona in particular. The data that are gathered for this study could also be used in studies of other aspects of the acquisition of Shona such as that of syntax...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was an attempt to {{investigate}} the use of conjunctions in argumentative essays written by English as a Foreign Language fourth-year undergraduate Libyan students majoring in English at Omar Al-Mukhtar University in Libya. A corpus of 32 argumentative essays was collected from a sample of 16 students in order to be investigated in terms of Halliday and Hassan's (1976) taxonomy of conjunction. Findings showed that the Libyan EFL students used the conjunctions inappropriately, and that the adversative conjunctions posed the most difficulty for the learners, followed by additives and causals. Of the adversatives, on the otherhand was the most difficult conjunction for the participants, followed by but and in fact. With the use of additive conjunctions, moreover was the most problematic, followed by andandfurthermore. Among the causals, the conjunction so was the most challenging, followed by because. The findings of this study confirm previous studies that learners of English as a foreign language have difficulty in using conjunctions in their writing. The difficulties encountered by participants in employing the conjunctions can be attributed to three reasons: 1) first language (Arabic) negative transfer; 2) <b>overgeneralisation</b> in the second language (English) and 3) the presentation of conjunctions in lists in ESL/EFL textbooks without showing the subtle difference between them in terms of semantic function. These findings are discussed in this paper with implications for teaching the use of conjunctions in the Libyan context.

40|$|This {{research}} is focussed on students' syntactic errors {{as seen in}} their writing final examinations. The data is taken from English Language Institute's (Lembaga Bahasa Inggris) students, intermediate and advance classes. During their process of learning English, the learners have {{learned a lot of}} tenses and rules. However, they cannot use these tenses and rules well and the learners make errors. The writer is interested in analysing the errors and she is curious to know what the error types which are made by the students of LBI. Besides the types of errors, she also analyses the strategics that the learners try to use in learning English as a foreign language and what strategy which is used mostly during their learning process. These errors are analysed based on Surface Strategy Taxonomy in which they are categorised into the skeleton of English clause, auxiliary system, passive sentences, temporal conjunctions, sentential complements, misuse among parts of speech and pronouns and miscellaneous parts. Then, they are classified into more specific groups such as missing part, liave and be, modals, problem with formation of passive sentences, etcetera and each error which has its own characteristics shows the strategies that the learners use. The strategies are <b>overgeneralisation,</b> ignorance of rule restrictions and transfer. The learners like combining two tenses together into one tense, disregarding rule restrictions or transfering first language into second language. Finally, the writer calculates the total number of errors as well as the strategies, the result shows what strategy which is mostly used during their process of learning English...|$|E
