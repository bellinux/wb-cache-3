5|$|Inside Man was {{director}} of photography Matthew Libatique's second film with Lee. Because the filmmakers intended to finish with a digital intermediate (the post-production digital manipulation <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> lighting), Libatique chose to shoot Inside Man in the Super 35 format for a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. He mainly used Kodak Vision2 500T 5218 and Vision2 Expression 500T 5229 film stocks. The film was shot with Arricam and Arriflex cameras and Cooke S4 lenses.|$|E
5|$|The five {{subspecies}} {{have different}} genetic and ecological histories, phenotypically {{expressed in a}} range <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> skin patterns. Although the long-toed salamander is classified as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN, many forms of land development threaten and negatively affect the salamander's habitat.|$|E
5|$|The partly ionic {{structure}} of BN layers in h-BN reduces covalency and electrical conductivity, whereas the interlayer interaction increases resulting in higher hardness of h-BN relative to graphite. The reduced electron-delocalization in hexagonal-BN is also indicated by its absence <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> a large band gap. Very different bonding – strong covalent within the basal planes (planes where boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded) and weak between them – causes high anisotropy of most properties of h-BN.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the topics}} in the {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>color</b> {{is the problem of}} the ontology <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind <b>of</b> properties <b>colors</b> are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> <b>and</b> the relationship between the representation <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> <b>and</b> their ontological constitution.|$|R
5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work {{with a touch of}} social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{wings are}} {{fundamental}} in identifying and classifying species {{as there is}} no other set of structures in studying insects more significant. Each order and insect family has distinctive wing shapes and features. In many cases, even species may be distinguished from each other by differences <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> pattern. For example, just by position one can identify species, albeit to a much lesser extent. Though most insects fold their wings when at rest, dragonflies and some damselflies rest with their wings spread out horizontally, while groups such as the caddisflies, stoneflies, alderflies, and lacewings hold their wings sloped roof-like over their backs. A few moths wrap their wings around their bodies, while many flies and most butterflies close their wings together straight upward over the back.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind {{a layer of}} glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E

5|$|Zephaniah Kingsley wrote {{a defense}} of slavery and the three-tier social system that {{acknowledged}} the rights of free people of color that existed in Florida under Spanish rule. Kingsley briefly served on the Florida Territorial Council, planning the transition when Florida was annexed by the United States. During his time on the council, he attempted to influence Florida lawmakers to recognize free people <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> allow mixed-race children to inherit property. In addition to the architectural qualities, the site is significant as his home {{and that of his}} unique family.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{played a}} major role in the development of the breed, as large numbers of horses died from lack of food and exposure to the elements. Between 874 and 1300AD, during the more favorable climatic conditions of the medieval warm period, Icelandic breeders selectively bred horses according to special rules <b>of</b> <b>color</b> <b>and</b> conformation. From 1300 to 1900, selective breeding became less of a priority; the climate was often severe and many horses and people died. Between 1783 and 1784, around 70% of the horses in Iceland were killed by volcanic ash poisoning and starvation after the 1783 eruption of Lakagígar. The eruption lasted eight months, covered hundreds of square miles of land with lava, and rerouted or dried up several rivers. The population slowly recovered during the next hundred years, and from the beginning of the 20th century selective breeding again became important. The first Icelandic breed societies were established in 1904, and the first breed registry in Iceland was established in 1923.|$|E
