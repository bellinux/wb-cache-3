5|$|On 19 April 2009, 21 polo ponies died {{shortly before}} a match in the United States Polo Open. Three days later, a {{pharmacy}} {{released a statement}} explaining that the horses had received an incorrect dose of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> used in a vitamin/mineral supplement compound that had been incorrectly compounded by a compounding pharmacy. Analysis of blood levels of inorganic compounds in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were ten to fifteen times higher than normal in the blood samples, and 15 to 20 times higher than normal in the liver samples. Selenium was later confirmed to be the toxic factor.|$|E
30|$|As regards customs {{procedure}} <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> experts {{vary depending on}} their field and experience. Some experts agree that <b>the</b> certificate <b>of</b> origin issued by country B (last transformation country) should state <b>the</b> originating country <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>ingredient</b> and provide an authenticated photocopy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> certificate <b>of</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>ingredient</b> issued by country A (producing country <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredient),</b> while an expert responded “No”, and some experts have other considerations.|$|R

50|$|Side effects. Effective {{ingredients}} {{also tend}} to have side effects. To minimize backlash from dissatisfied customers and possible lawsuits, yet still benefit from <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> including <b>the</b> <b>ingredient,</b> angel dusting may be employed. Ironically, {{the only way the}} consumer may know <b>the</b> quantity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> is from information supplied by the manufacturer while defending themselves from a lawsuit over side effects.|$|R
5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may thicken, and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|The 8 March Revolution {{has often}} been viewed as a mere {{military}} coup, but it had many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> of national revolts from below. The revolution was led by an anti-oligarchical alliance of a radicalised lower middle class, strategic members of the officer corps, marginalised minorities and {{a significant number of}} peasants who were mobilised for agrarian conflict. In an international context, the revolution took place because the state boundaries established by France were artificial and the hostility within the newly established Syria to the creation of Israel. The traditional elite that took power in Syria when the country gained independence had come to power during the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The external imposition of arbitrary state boundaries on Syria with no corresponding popular acceptance led to discontent. The national struggle was shaped by ideologies such as Arab nationalism, pan-Islamism and Greater Syrianism. The plebeian character of the struggle, and the radical ideologies, spawned radical solutions to the agrarian problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was self-sufficiency with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients.</b> Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E

25|$|A major {{advance in}} {{manufacturing}} began in Europe {{in the late}} 14th century when the safety and thoroughness of incorporation was improved by wet grinding; liquid, such as distilled spirits or perhaps the urine of wine-drinking bishops was added during the grinding-together <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> and the moist paste dried afterwards. The principle of wet mixing to prevent the separation of dry ingredients, invented for gunpowder, is used today in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E

50|$|Ingredient-branding takes {{a special}} {{position}} in marketing, as it cannot be clearly allocated to either industrial or consumer goods marketing. On the one hand, {{the consumer is}} <b>the</b> end-user <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredient,</b> but at <b>the</b> same time is not part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buying decision for the component, as this is up to <b>the</b> producer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> end product. On the other hand the producer will only decide on <b>the</b> usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> - or at least take it into account in the communication policy - if <b>the</b> image <b>of</b> this <b>ingredient</b> will {{have an effect on}} the consumer, meaning a positive influence on his or her buying decision.|$|R
50|$|Coalescence: in case <b>of</b> a liquid, <b>the</b> {{multiple}} droplets may {{merge to}} form a uniform continuous layer. Characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> {{in relation to the}} product, such as viscosity and surface tension associated to a mechanical effect (friction) are critical.|$|R
25|$|It's {{important}} to check {{whether there are}} any undesired interactions between the preparation and the container. For instance, if a plastic container is used, tests are carried out to see whether any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> become adsorbed on to the plastic, and whether any plasticizer, lubricants, pigments, or stabilizers leach out of the plastic into the preparation. Even the adhesives for the container label need to be tested, to ensure they do not leach through the plastic container into the preparation.|$|E
25|$|When one {{substance}} is dissolved into another, a solution is formed. This {{is opposed to}} the situation when the compounds are insoluble like sand in water. In a solution, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> are uniformly distributed at a molecular level and no residue remains. A solvent-solute mixture consists of a single phase with all solute molecules occurring as solvates (solvent-solute complexes), as opposed to separate continuous phases as in suspensions, emulsions {{and other types of}} non-solution mixtures. The ability of one compound to be dissolved in another is known as solubility; if this occurs in all proportions, it is called miscible.|$|E
25|$|The Mediterranean diet {{forms the}} basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and {{vegetables}} and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> rather than on elaborate preparation. Dishes and recipes are often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs, so many recipes are ideally suited for home cooking, this being {{one of the main reasons}} behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America to Asia. Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region.|$|E
30|$|In {{a mixture}} experiment, {{it is not}} <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single <b>ingredient</b> that matters, but rather its {{proportion}} {{in relation to other}} <b>ingredients.</b> <b>The</b> sum <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> is a constant total T, which is equal to 100 % or 1 unless any constant mixture factors are present (Lundstedt et al. 1998).|$|R

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attributes considered was an ingredient label that read: “Grapes, Sulphur dioxide, Yeast, Diammonium phosphate, Bentonite, Pectinolytic enzymes", versus labels {{that did not have}} any <b>ingredients</b> listed. <b>The</b> survey included choice experiments for which respondents had to choose one bottle to hypothetically purchase from among four options that varied in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information provided on the back label. <b>The</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> list negatively affected the probability that a consumer chose the bottle for about a third of respondents. For 13  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample, <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> choosing <b>the</b> bottle dropped by 59  % with <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> list.

25|$|In the 18th century, Johann Heinrich Pott (1692–1777) and Andreas Sigismund Marggraf {{demonstrated}} that alumina was a constituent. Pott in his Lithogeognosia {{showed that the}} precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum {{is quite different from}} lime and chalk, with which it had been confounded by G.E. Stahl. Marggraf showed that alumina is one of the constituents of alum, but that this earth possesses peculiar properties, and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> in common clay. He also showed that crystals of alum can be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulfuric acid and evaporating the solutions, and when a solution of potash or ammonia is dropped into this liquid, it immediately deposits perfect crystals of alum.|$|E
25|$|Ice cream {{was made}} by hand {{in a large bowl}} placed inside a tub filled with ice and salt. This was called the pot-freezer method. French confectioners refined the pot-freezer method, making ice cream in a sorbetière (a covered pail with a handle {{attached}} to the lid). In the pot-freezer method, the temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> is reduced by the mixture of crushed ice and salt. The salt water is cooled by the ice, and the action of the salt on the ice causes it to (partially) melt, absorbing latent heat and bringing the mixture below the freezing point of pure water. The immersed container can also make better thermal contact with the salty water and ice mixture than it could with ice alone.|$|E
25|$|Bob Markham (Mark Harmon) - A logger, widower, {{and single}} father to his {{daughter}} Abby. After his wife died, he sunk everything he had into logging.

By some luck, Abby had picked one of them before, and Jane showed her how to press it, thus preserving it. After Abby and Markham's men were cured, they ceased logging and started to plant the seeds saved from the flower.|$|E
