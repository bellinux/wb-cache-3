5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals <b>of</b> <b>powdered</b> glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E

New types <b>of</b> used ceramic <b>powders</b> are so called pyrochlores of the RE 2 Zr 2 O 7 general formula. Design/methodology/approach: A scope of investigations comprised review of up-to-now used criteria of assessment and verification <b>of</b> them on <b>powders</b> <b>of</b> new types. Investigations of chemical composition were realized, in consideration of carbon and sulphur contents and gas oxygen and nitrogen contents. Investigations on sizes <b>of</b> <b>powders</b> by a sieve method and investigations on surface morphology were carried out. Assessment of microstructure, considering homogeneity in chemical composition and porosity, was carried out. Assessment of phase contents <b>of</b> exemplary <b>powders</b> was carried out.

25|$|Although {{chewing gum}} {{can be traced}} back to civilizations around the world, the {{modernization}} and commercialization of this product mainly took place in the United States.

In this way, the industrializing West, having forgotten about tree gums, rediscovered chewing gum through the First Americans. Around 1850 a gum made from paraffin wax, which is a petroleum product, was developed and soon exceeded the spruce gum in popularity.
