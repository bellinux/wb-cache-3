5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps {{on the road to}} the pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
5|$|Between 1839 and 1843 Royal Naval Captain James Clark Ross, {{commanding}} his {{two ships}} HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, completed three voyages to the Antarctic continent.

5|$|The Ross {{expedition}} was {{a voyage}} of scientific exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> in 1839 to 1843, led by James Clark Ross, with two unusually strong warships, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror.

The young botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker made his name on the expedition.|$|E

5|$|The expedition, {{named after}} its supply ship, {{was a private}} venture, financed by public {{contributions}} augmented by a government grant. It had further backing from the Admiralty, which released experienced seamen to the expedition, and from the Royal Geographical Society. The expedition's team of scientists carried out a comprehensive scientific programme, while other parties explored Victoria Land and the Western Mountains. An attempted landing and exploration of King EdwardVII Land was unsuccessful. A journey to Cape Crozier in June and July 1911 was the first extended sledging journey in the depths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> winter.|$|E

5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop {{that lives}} on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|After the Canadian {{government}} withdrew promised {{financial support}} for the expedition, the delay in finding replacement funding ate into the Arctic sailing season. Shackleton, not wanting to delay departure any longer than he had to, decided to go south instead and attempt a circumnavigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> continent. The expedition, known as the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (John Rowett, {{an old friend of}} Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern winter in the Pacific islands. The expedition included several Endurance veterans in addition to Worsley; Frank Wild was again second in command, and Leonard Hussey was the meteorologist. Worsley was the master of the Quest, but would also be the expedition's hydrographer.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, {{scientific and}} geographical goals. He considered forming {{a company to}} exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Antarctic</b> interior.|$|E
