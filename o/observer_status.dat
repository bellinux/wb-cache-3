40|$|Many service {{providers}} on the Internet use multiple mirror servers {{to cope with}} request congestion. Here, the problem is how to select the best server out of them. We propose a DNS-based mechanism for server selection with preferred policies. DNS (Domain Name System) is used in almost all services and implementations. Therefore, our approach is generally applicable. The mechanism consists of two components. One is query preprocessor. The other is network <b>status</b> <b>observer.</b> The network <b>status</b> <b>observer</b> probes the <b>status</b> of network periodically. The query preprocessor traps queries to the DNS, and selects the optimal server automatically under a given policy. Some practical experiments substantiated the effectiveness of our mechanism...|$|R
