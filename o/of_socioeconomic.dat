5|$|Louis-René Villermé (10 March 1782 – 16 November 1863) was a French {{economist}} and physician. He {{was known for}} his early studies of social epidemiology, or the effects <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> status on health, in early industrial France, and was an advocate for hygienic reform in factories and prisons. His work is considered pivotal {{in the history of the}} fields of sociology and statistical inquiry, and he is considered a founder of epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, {{but many of the}} Pieds-Noirs had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited. The settlers encompassed a range <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.|$|E
5|$|The United States is a {{founding}} member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The U.S. economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas and is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total, Americans hold 33.2% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending. It is also a global leader in science and technology.|$|E

30|$|The {{schools that}} were {{examined}} {{are located in}} areas <b>of</b> different <b>socioeconomic</b> backgrounds. The results do not show differences based on the background, which probably indicates the homogeneity of Finnish schools. All schools receive the same resources from the city, and parents do not make financial contributions for the education. The school from the area <b>of</b> lowest <b>socioeconomic</b> status has participated in various projects during years, and this has promoted {{the capacity of the}} teaching staff. Teachers’ development orientation has supported the school to develop advanced practices regardless <b>of</b> challenging <b>socioeconomic</b> background <b>of</b> the pupils.|$|R
50|$|People <b>of</b> lower <b>socioeconomic</b> status {{are found}} to be more {{vulnerable}} to air pollutant, PM 2.5, due to their location. PM 2.5 is an air pollutant, arising from the blend of power plants, refineries, and diesel engines, among other sources, and this particle penetrates the lungs. Communities <b>of</b> low <b>socioeconomic</b> statuses are frequently concentrated in areas near highways, busy roads, and refineries. Therefore, limiting one's exposure to air pollution in an impoverished environment is nearly impossible. Communities <b>of</b> low <b>socioeconomic</b> status face an unequal access to environmental health services and resources.|$|R

40|$|The {{increasingly}} social {{orientation of}} {{the management of the}} national economy requires making the transition from the evaluation of the economic effectiveness of new technology to the determination <b>of</b> its <b>socioeconomic</b> effectiveness, which has made it necessary to deal with a number of new and complex methodological problems. These problems include: defining the essence <b>of</b> the <b>socioeconomic</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> new technology; establishing the interrelationship between the economic and social aspects of its introduction; developing the concept <b>of</b> the <b>socioeconomic</b> effect <b>of</b> new technology; substantiating the evaluation of the indicator <b>of</b> its <b>socioeconomic</b> effect to the national economy, etc. Some of them have been reflected in the draft "Basic Guidelines for Determining the <b>Socioeconomic</b> Effectiveness <b>of</b> New Technology" developed by the Institute of Economics of the USSR Academy of Sciences and in a number of articles.

50|$|Socio{{economic}} Status (SES) is an individual's or group's sociological {{and economic}} status in society.

25|$|Although {{women around}} the world share many {{similarities}} in terms of the health-impacting challenges, there are also many distinct differences that arise from their varying states <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> conditions.

50|$|Initial {{assumptions}} on co-sleeping may {{place it}} in a context <b>of</b> income and <b>socioeconomic</b> status.

However, statistical data shows the prevalence of co-sleeping in wealthy Japanese families and the ability of poor Western families to still find a separate space for their child, suggests that the acceptance of co-sleeping is a result of culture.|$|R

Race was also often used questionable, such as an indicator <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> status. Racial genetic explanations may be overemphasized, ignoring the interaction with {{and the role of}} the environment.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of lynchings rose during years of poor economy and low prices for cotton, demonstrating {{that more than}} social tensions generated the catalysts for mob action against the underclass. Researchers have studied various models to determine what motivated lynchings. One study of lynching rates of blacks in southern counties between 1889 and 1931 found a relation to the concentration of blacks {{in parts of the}} Deep South; where black population was concentrated, lynching rates were higher. Such areas also had a particular mix <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> conditions, with a high dependence on cotton cultivation.|$|E
25|$|After the 1979 Revolution, the new {{government}} established a new Unified National Health System that instated the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health (MINSA) {{at the head of}} health services throughout the nation. This system also integrated the Nicaraguan Social Security Institute (INSS) under MINSA's direction {{in order to make it}} financially feasible to provide a single national health service available to all Nicaraguan citizens, regardless <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> background. With the combination of these institutions, the INSS hospitals and clinics, previously only accessible to insured employees, then opened their doors to the larger population.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, such {{socially}} responsible forestry {{was encouraged by}} state community forestry agencies. They emphasized such projects as planting wood lots on denuded communal cattle-grazing grounds to make villages self-sufficient in fuelwood, to supply timber needed {{for the construction of}} village houses, and to provide the wood needed for the repair of farm implements. Both individual farmers and tribal communities were also encouraged to grow trees for profit. For example, in Gujarat, one of the more aggressive states in developing programmes <b>of</b> <b>socioeconomic</b> importance, the forestry department distributed 200 million tree seedlings in 1983. The fast-growing eucalyptus is the main species being planted nationwide, followed by pine and poplar.|$|E
