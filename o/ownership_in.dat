5|$|After Rolf Skår was {{appointed}} director of NSC, plans were launched {{to try to}} win the ground station contract for NASA's planned Earth Observing System (EOS). NASA was considering locating the ground station in Greenland, at McMurdo Station in Antarctica or at Esrange in Sweden. Skår invited a NASA delegation to visit Svalbard, and from 1996 NSC and NASA started negotiating a contract to establish a ground station at Longyearbyen. The first satellite to use SvalSat was Landsat 7, which was launched on 15 April 1999. NSC bought SSC's <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> TSS and Lockheed Martin's <b>ownership</b> <b>in</b> SvalSat in 2001.

Tradable ownership and particularly concentrated tradable ownership reduce earnings management, while total ownership concentration fosters earnings management...|$|R
