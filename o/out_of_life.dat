5|$|In season five, Lex becomes {{obsessed with}} {{uncovering}} Clark's secret; he breaks three metahuman criminals out of Belle Reve and sends {{them to the}} Kent Farm, where they hold several people close to Clark hostage. The scheme amounts to nothing, however, and Clark cuts Lex <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> completely upon finding out. His curiosity into the symbols, which he believes to be alien in nature, results in Brainiac (James Marsters) arranging him to be possessed by {{the spirit of the}} Kryptonian criminal Zod. In season six, Lex married Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) after deceiving Lana into being pregnant with his child. Upon learning the truth, Lana faked her own death and attempted to pin the murder on Lex.|$|E

25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and make sense <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must {{be thought of as}} created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E

25|$|Daniel was {{initially}} {{portrayed as a}} happy-go-lucky, easy-going, hippy, who {{wanted to make the}} most <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> He is a keen photographer, skateboarder and surfer. Phillipps used traits from his own personality to flesh out the character. Daniel came to Erinsborough to see where his parents fell in love and decided to stay for his uncle. Phillipps stated that Paul and Daniel have a great relationship, as they both want to be good influences on each other. Daniel's first major storyline was a love triangle involving himself, Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) and Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Amber and Daniel were later engaged. Daniel's past was explored a little further when his ex-girlfriend Rain Taylor (Airlie Dodds) was introduced towards the end of 2014. The character has also formed a relationship with Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) and been manipulated by Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy). Daniel's personality also changed, as he became more ruthless and career driven. The character has received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the core}} {{character}} deficits of highly psychopathic individuals {{are likely to}} be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings. It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.|$|E

500|$|Cuties come in four colors: Red, Black, Blue and Gold. When defeated, a Cutie {{releases}} a {{soul of the}} same color, which {{is added to the}} player's stock. Red Cuties' souls replenish the player's life gauge. The other three colors fill one or more of six special move buttons, allowing the player to use different attacks when the buttons are filled. When a new game is started, the player begins with 15 life points, one of which is expended each time the player moves to an adjoining tile. If the player's life points are depleted then their reaper dies, the player must slay as many red Cuties as possible to continue playing.

[...] He added, [...] "Ibuki’s personality has been limited to game endings and oh-so brief lines of dialogue from her victory quotes, so expanding upon those with this focused story is an honour and a challenge."

Spears described it as a teen movie that deals with real issues that normal teenagers live on a daily basis.

[...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote [...] "For years I have wondered, during 'Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,' why we were not to cry. Now I understand: We need not cry because (a) Evita got everything <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> she dreamed of, and (b) Argentina should cry for itself. Even poor Juan Peron [...] should shed a tear or two; he is relegated...to {{the status of a}} 'walker,' a presentable man who adorns the arm of a rich and powerful woman as a human fashion accessory." [...] The song's lyrics are a [...] "string of meaningless platitudes" [...] according to Rice, who felt that it worked as an emotionally intense but empty speech by a [...] "megalomaniac woman" [...] trying to win the favor of the Argentines. It features the lyrics [...] "And as for fortune, and as for fame / I never invited them in / Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired / They are illusions".|$|E
