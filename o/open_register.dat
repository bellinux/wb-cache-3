5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an <b>open</b> <b>register</b> are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|E

500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed air column and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The <b>open</b> <b>register</b> key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments overblow at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to overblow at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments overblow at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not overblow at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E

In 1923 he moved to Paris, where he worked as a photographer, and in 1929 he published his first novel, Retreat Without Song, after a serialized publication in the Harach newspaper of Paris (it is translated into several languages). In 1933 he published his second book, also written in Armenian, The Betrayal of the Gods, which is a collection of short stories. In 1937 he fell victim to a terrible bone disease (Osteolysis), which disabled him and caused him much pain and suffering {{for the rest of his}} life, mostly spent in hospitals after he lost his home in 1939. In 1945, having partially recovered from his illness, he started writing in French under the name Armen Lubin, and from then on he was highly acclaimed as a French poet and received several literary awards. He published in French several collections of poetry: The Furtive Passer-by, Sacred Patience, The Nightly Transport, The High Cage, and Fire With Fire. In 1962 a collection of his Armenian works was printed in Yerevan by the Armenian State Press.

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} {{of the first and}} second resonance frequencies on tuning, timbre (or tone colour) and ease of playing is investigated for reed instruments, such as the clarinet, alto saxophone and oboe. Theoretical analyses of the eflects of the reed and the player embouchure (i. e. lip position and pressure on the reed) are reviewed, as well as the consequences of inharmonicity in the resonance frequencies. This review allows us to present interesting interpretations of the numerous experiments reported here. Three kinds of results are given: (I) comparison of playing frequencies andfirst resonance frequencies, for severalfmgerings with or without <b>open</b> <b>register</b> hole, leading to the deJinition of a frequency independent length correction for the embouchure; (2) examination of the eflect of inharmonicity of the two jirst resonance frequencies on both tone colour and ease of playing, the causes coming from either the player embouchure or the instrument construction; (3) comparison between theory and experiment for the inharmonicity produced by the changes in conicity in oboes, leading to an interpretation of the maker's choices. The results show how judicious use of simple tools, such as calculations or measurements of input impedance or playing data obtained using an arttjicial mouth, can be of help to the understanding of instrument construction and to the instrument designer...|$|E

Lexical Cohesion and conjunction as two crucial elements to textual cohesion and comprehension {{have been the}} focus {{of a wide range of}} studies up to now. Yet the relationship between the <b>open</b> <b>register</b> and cohesive devices has not been thoroughly investigated in discourse studies. This study concentrates on the potential similarities and differences between literature for children and adult level (regular) with respect to the frequency of lexical cohesive markers and conjunctions. To this end, selected excerpts of two contemporary famous novels were analyzed and codified for the use of different kinds of lexical cohesion (reiteration and collocation), conjunctions (elaboration, extension and enhancement) and their subcategories. The results of Chi square tests showed that the children and regular novel texts were significantly different in terms of reiteration and collocation as the main categories of lexical cohesion as well as total frequency of lexical cohesive pairs. Also, the use of conjunctions, elaboration and extension showed significant difference. Yet, the difference was non-significant for enhancement. The findings of this study add to the existing literature of research on cohesion and inspire researchers in discourse studies, child language studies, and English teaching and learning of young children.

40|$|Choosing {{the correct}} flag {{is a matter}} of crucial {{importance}} to a shipowner, never more so than today. In the last years, there has been an increase of available options: a traditional national register in the shipowner's country of origin, an <b>open</b> <b>register</b> provided by one of the increasing number of countries which allow their national flag to be used by shipowners which little or no connection with the country concerned, or a national offshore register such as those offered by a number of United Overseas Territories or, in the case of France, by the Kerguelen Islands. Finally, there are the growing number of international, or secondary, registers operated by traditional maritime nations such as Norway, Denmark and Germany. These afford the prestige of a national register with some of the advantages of an open registry, very often including a relaxation of tax and social security liabilities for seafarers and their employers. The Cyprus Registry today occupies the sixth place worldwide in terms of registered tonnage. Moreover, Cyprus is the third larger management centre in the whole maritime world; a fact supported by the increasing number of offshore Shipmanagement Companies that choose Cyprus as the base of their operations. These achievements were the consequence of the co-ordinated efforts of both the government and the private sector.
