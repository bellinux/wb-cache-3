5|$|A Love Surreal {{comprises}} a {{cycle of}} slow-burning songs about different stages of love, including infatuation, seduction, romance, estrangement, longing, renewal, and existential peace.

In contrast to Airtight's Revenge, A Love Surreal deals more with feelings <b>of</b> <b>lust</b> and flirting rather than personal and societal issues.|$|E

In a collective prayer to the Mahavidyas in the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, the devotee prays to emulate Chhinnamasta in her generosity to others. Other goals common to worship of all Mahavidyas are: poetic speech, well-being, control of one's foes, removal of obstacles, ability to sway kings, ability to attract others, conquest over other kings, and, finally, moksha (salvation).|$|E

The album's subject matter incorporated sexual innuendos and references to drugs and death as well as themes <b>of</b> <b>lust</b> and exuberance.|$|E

After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits.

5|$|Match Point is a 2005 British-Luxembourgish {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by Woody Allen and starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, and Penelope Wilton. In the film, Rhys Meyers's character marries into a wealthy family, but his social position is threatened by his affair with his brother-in-law's girlfriend, played by Johansson. The film treats themes of morality, greed, and the roles <b>of</b> <b>lust,</b> money, and luck in life, leading many to compare it to Allen's earlier film Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). It was produced and filmed in London after Allen had difficulty finding financial support for the film in New York. The agreement obliged him to make it there using a cast and crew mostly from the United Kingdom. Allen quickly re-wrote the script, which was originally set in New York, for a British setting.|$|E
