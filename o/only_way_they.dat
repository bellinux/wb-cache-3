5|$|In 1985, Dallas {{electrician}} and rodeo cowboy Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) {{is diagnosed}} with AIDS and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses {{to accept the}} diagnosis, but remembers having unprotected sex {{with a woman who}} was an intravenous drug user. He is soon ostracized by family and friends and gets fired from his job, believed by family, friends and coworkers to have had homosexual relations, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Dr. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as this is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can determine if the drug is working.|$|E
25|$|I can't talk {{fellowship}} to you who {{are gathered}} here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience {{it is up to}} the working people to save themselves. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.|$|E
25|$|Like fellow South African {{jazz musicians}} Dollar Brand and Hugh Masekela, they {{understood}} that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could play freely was by escaping the oppressive social and political climate of their home country. As a mixed-race band (McGregor the sole white member), they were especially prone to police harassment. In mid-1964, they left South Africa.|$|E

50|$|During the 1820-1870s America's Victorian {{middle class}} used the human-animal bond {{to aid in}} children's socialization. This was an entirely gendered process, as parents and society {{believed}} only boys had an innate tendency towards violence {{and needed to be}} socialized towards kindness and empathy through companion animals. Over time pet keeping to socialize children became more gender neutral, but even into the 1980s and 90s there remained a belief that boys especially benefited from pet keeping {{due to the fact that}} it was one of <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> could practice nurturing given the limiting gender norms.|$|R
25|$|Plasma {{recirculation}} {{would significantly}} improve {{the function of}} these machines. It {{has been argued that}} efficient recirculation is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can be viable. Electrons or ions move through the device without striking a surface, reducing conduction losses. Bussard stressed this; specifically emphasizing that electrons need to move through all cusps of the machine.|$|E
25|$|We {{have tried}} you citizens; {{we are trying}} you now, {{and you have a}} couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, {{brothers}} and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> know to protest against conditions which are unbearable the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.|$|E
25|$|The labour {{shortage}} was worsened {{by the fact}} {{that a large number of}} the French were also held as prisoners of war in Germany. Beyond these hardships and dislocations, the occupation became increasingly unbearable. Onerous regulations, strict censorship, incessant propaganda and nightly curfews all played a role in establishing an atmosphere of fear and repression. The sight of French women consorting with German soldiers infuriated many French men, but sometimes it was the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could get adequate food for their families.|$|E

It was established in January 2006 by former MP Bahaedin Adab and belongs to the reformist tendency. According to Adab, the front aims to [...] "raise awareness among Kurds of their rights and help them choose the right representatives in town councils and the parliament as these are the <b>only</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> can get through to the authority".|$|R
50|$|This {{keeps going}} on every {{week of the}} championship. Lil has to keep making up stories, and telling Achilles that the Williamses said bad stuff about him when they {{actually}} didn't.

25|$|Fossils in China {{demonstrate}} a migration of Asian mammals into North America around 55 million years ago. By 20 million years ago, evidence in North America shows a further interchange of mammalian species. Some, like the ancient saber-toothed cats, have a recurring geographical range: Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> {{could reach the}} New World was by the Bering land bridge. Had this bridge not existed at that time, the fauna {{of the world would}} be very different.|$|E
25|$|Brigadier General Hanford MacNider, {{in charge}} of the G-4 (Logistics) unit in MacArthur's {{headquarters}} group, learned almost immediately upon his arrival in Port Moresby that the previously chosen route to Wairopi across the peninsula, proposed by headquarters staff, was not practical. It traversed the Australian's rear area and a region where the soldiers could be cut off by the Japanese. It was also so mountainous that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could receive supplies would be by air. Two alternative routes were considered, from Kapa Kapa to Jaure, and from Abau to Jaure. From Jaure other minor trails would lead the soldiers to Wairopi and Buna.|$|E
25|$|Large sharks {{species are}} apex predators in their environment, {{and thus have}} little fear of any {{creature}} (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers {{are thought to be}} caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark.|$|E

50|$|If {{there are}} no {{external}} flows, then all these methods (time-weighted return, internal rate of return, Modified Dietz Method etc.) give identical results - it is <b>only</b> the various <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> handle flows which makes them different from each other.|$|R
25|$|Clerical housing {{began to}} be rented at 10% of their {{commercial}} value in 1929 (in comparison to 1–2% for others {{living in the same}} type of building). Clergy that had annual income surpassing 3000 rubles could not remain in nationalized or municipalized buildings and they had to be evicted by April 8, 1929. No further leases of such buildings to clergy of any income were permitted, and it was also made illegal for them to reside in the homes of others. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could live then was in private houses that they rented, of which after the collectivization nothing remained except semi-rural cottages. In the context of the persecution few laypeople would offer such housing to clergy out of fear of reprisal. This lack of housing forced many priests to leave their vocation and take civilian jobs.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{what the}} Dragon means, Henry leads {{everyone}} {{back to the}} fountain, where he proceeds to wish for his family to be brought back, encouraging Emma, Regina, Gold, and Violet to do the same. Suddenly, the crystal starts to pulsate. Henry then climbs a statue and convinces the citizens of New York City to help them return magic to the world. The portal opens in the Bethesda fountain, and Gold walks through it. Hook, Snow, David, Jekyll and Zelena appear {{in front of the}} others. Regina, Henry, Emma, and Violet see them in the Bethesda fountain as they reunited. Unfortunately, Henry is left saddened that the crowd believed that the rescue was simply an illusion; Emma consoles him, explaining that it's the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can understand it. She was much like them until his near-death experience forced her to believe in magic.|$|E
25|$|Social class {{mobility}} {{could be}} low because of housing inequality. People who live or {{were born in}} the housing inequality, they have more problems to solve instead of making money. And what's more, Their children are less likely to get higher education in order to get into higher class in their futures. It could lower the social class mobility to our self and so does our next generation. The major problem of first generation is about earning money for family because of housing inequality. It's hard to get a loan from bank and lots of bills to pay. They just worry how to survive to tomorrow. But for our children, they deserve a better future, but under housing inequality, they need more time and money to get the same education as who are not suffering from housing inequality. These makes them give up their education easily but this is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can get into higher class in the future. Not so many of people can make it.|$|E
5000|$|Marianela Tovar, an LGBT {{activist in}} Caracas at the {{organization}} Contranatura, explains that travesti experience violence from police and clients of sex work but still feel {{forced to do}} sex work because “it’s the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>they</b> can be their true gender identity.” [...] In other professions common for women in Venezuela, such as nursing, trans women {{would not be able}} to present as their chosen gender identity.|$|R

50|$|The {{demographic}} {{that most}} commonly commits obscene phone calls ranges {{from the age}} of 12 to 16 years, with an average of 14 years of age. Often they are emotionally or behaviorally maladjusted and have shown previous signs of sexual abuse, as well as having already committed sexual abuse. Obscene phone callers are often male, feel inadequate, have feelings of isolation, have trouble forming relationships and consider making obscene phone calls to be the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> that <b>they</b> can sexually express themselves.|$|R
25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives and she might take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
25|$|Royal Challengers Bangalore {{started their}} season with an unconvincing win against KKR at Kolkata, {{supported}} by a knock of 96 by Chris Gayle. But they lost their next three matches in Bengaluru to SRH, MI, and CSK. Two great bowling performances ensured RCB secured dominant wins against RR and DD, winning by 9 wickets and 10 wickets respectively. Their next match against RR got washed out after a strong batting performance from RCB. They lost a close match to CSK, but recovered by crushing Kings XI Punjab by 138 runs, {{supported by a}} century by Chris Gayle, and a four wicket haul for Sreenath Aravind and Mitchell Starc. Royal Challengers' good form continued when AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli smashed the highest T20 partnership ever (later beaten by the same pair in IPL 2016) against Mumbai Indians, to secure a good win. Later, RCB lost to Kings XI Punjab in a rain affected match, putting their playoff qualification in doubt. They faced SRH in the next match, again affected by rain. Amidst a lot of drama, and stunning performances from Virat Kohli and Gayle, RCB won an unlikely match in Hyderabad. Now, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> could {{be out of the}} playoffs became very unlikely, yet possible. RCB lost their chance to be placed second in the points table after rain washed out their final match against DD.|$|E

500|$|Governor Henry Bellmon {{opposed the}} Chickasaw Turnpike, arguing {{it would be}} a money loser. Bellmon had the turnpike built with only two lanes and {{shortened}} it to its current termini. Dewey F. Bartlett, Jr., an OTA board member (and future mayor of Tulsa), was later quoted as saying [...] "I think it stinks. We never wanted to build it. It was not anything we thought was appropriate. But in order to build the three turnpikes that were necessary, that is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> would build it." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{central theme}} is haste: Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet spans {{a period of}} four to six days, in {{contrast}} to Brooke's poem's spanning nine months. Scholars such as G. Thomas Tanselle believe that time was [...] "especially important to Shakespeare" [...] in this play, as he used references to [...] "short-time" [...] for the young lovers as opposed to references to [...] "long-time" [...] for the [...] "older generation" [...] to highlight [...] "a headlong rush towards doom". Romeo and Juliet fight time to make their love last forever. In the end, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> seem to defeat time is through a death that makes them immortal through art.|$|E

Norris convinced them to stay by persuading them that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> would get back to safety was {{to stay with the}} team. They cautiously searched the river shore for two more hours without success and reluctantly returned to their forward operating base to rest and hope they would be more successful the next night.
