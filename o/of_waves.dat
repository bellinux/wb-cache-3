5|$|The Severn bore is a {{tidal bore}} {{seen on the}} tidal reaches of the River Severn in south western England. It is formed when the rising tide moves into the funnel-shaped Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary and the surging water forces its way {{upstream}} in a series <b>of</b> <b>waves,</b> as far as Gloucester and beyond. The bore behaves differently in different stretches of the river; in the lower, wider parts it is more noticeable in the deep channels as a slight roller, while the water creeps across the sand and mudflats. In the narrower, upper reaches, the river occupies the whole area between its banks and the bore advances in a series <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> that move upstream. Near Gloucester, the advancing water overcomes two weirs, and sometimes one in Tewkesbury, before finally petering out.|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{properties}} of the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) are classical {{in the case of}} nucleon emission processes, while they are quantum mechanical for the processes without nucleon emission. We first clarify that there coexist mutually opposite two statistics in the AMD framework: One is the classical statistics of the motion <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packet centroids and the other is the quantum statistics of the motion <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packets which is described by the AMD wave function. We prove the classical statistics <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packet centroids by using the framework of the microcanonical ensemble of the nuclear system. We show that the quantum statistics <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packets emerges from the classical statistics <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packet centroids. It is emphasized that the temperature of the classical statistics <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packet centroids is different from the temperature of the quantum statistics <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packets. We then explain that the statistical {{properties of}} AMD for nucleon emission processes are classical because nucleon emission processes in AMD are described by the motion <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> packet centroids.

40|$|Ocean {{wave energy}} {{conversion}} is evolving towards commercial viability. Succinct resource assessment {{is essential to}} the conversion <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy for grid supply electrical generation. The ability to differentiate potential wave energy locations by means of comprehensible evaluations is particularly useful to the commercial developers <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy power plants. This report establishes an assessment <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy that provides an understanding of the resource in both spatial and temporal resolution. Three aspects <b>of</b> the <b>wave</b> resource are established; mapping <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy hotspots due to <b>wave</b> focusing, visualisation <b>of</b> the probability <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy exceedance and persistence, and calculation of the predictability <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy for a particular aspect of coast. These three assessments are explained with a review of the science surrounding the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> creation and propagation, the development <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy converter devices, as well as visualisation and manipulation <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> resource assessments. The outputs of these assessment methodologies are comparable, uncomplicated, graphic representations of the resource. Case studies for seven locations encircling New Zealand were investigated, in order to demonstrate the practicalities <b>of</b> the <b>wave</b> energy resource assessment methodology developed by this project. This study modelled the transformation of several hundred combinations <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> height, period and direction from deep-water to shore. The different conditions were ranked in terms of probability of occurrence. Recombination of these iterations created hotspot maps. The locations examined in this study were then compared to other infrastructure for wave energy utilisation. Historical wave data was processed to establish the probability <b>of</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy being exceeded and persisting. This information establishes how often a potential wave energy plant might provide significant output and for how long this output might persist. Collection <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> prediction data for aspects of New Zealand allowed the comparison of up to seven day forecasts with a "now forecast". Assessment was then made of the predictability of the climatic conditions creating waves for a location. The ability to be able to provide accurate forecasts <b>of</b> potential <b>wave</b> energy plants is of significant interest to generation companies in New Zealand in order to manage a diverse generation portfolio. Key finding of this investigation: â€¢ Waves and wave energy have significant variation of spatial, and temporal scales. â€¢ Waves can be predicted for an aspect of coastline dependant upon the predictability of the climatic conditions <b>of</b> the <b>wave</b> generation location. â€¢ Wave energy resource assessment is often presented as a single figure of averaged kilowatts per meter wave front that fails to adequately incorporate the temporal, spatial, and predictive aspects of the resource. â€¢ A methodology was compiled to create "hotspot" (areas <b>of</b> intensified <b>wave</b> energy) mapping <b>of</b> a location utilising a wave transformation model. These maps can then be used to access spatial relationships to other digital information (electricity grid nodal locations, marine protected areas, navigation requirements, etc). â€¢ Processing <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> climate data utilising MatlabÂ© script developed by ASR Ltd identified the probability <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy being exceeded and persisting for a given location. â€¢ Forecasts <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> characteristics are published on the Internet. Calculation of error between a "now forecast" and the previous day's forecast for today (up to six days out), can give an assessment of the predictability of an aspect of a location provided the wave forecast model utilises significant climatic variables. â€¢ Case studies <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> energy resource assessment (using the developed hotspot, exceedence persistence, and predictability methods) for seven locations encircling New Zealand, identified three classes <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> resource; exceptional (Southland), good (Otago, Taranaki, Auckland, Hokianga), and poor (Canterbury, Wellington) ...|$|R

5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
5|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>waves,</b> while {{directly}} {{powered by}} the wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E

All three mangrove species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms.

All three types of trees absorb the energy <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> and storm surges. Everglades mangroves also serve as nurseries for crustaceans and fish, and rookeries for birds.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of {{laboratory}} experiments the nonlinear wave transformation above submerged rectangular permeable and solid bars was investigated. A transmission coefficient and a change <b>of</b> mean <b>wave</b> period as parameters <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> transformation were considered. Both of these parameters can characterize an ability of submerged structure to reduce a wave impact in coastal zone. It was revealed that for decreasing <b>of</b> mean <b>wave</b> period solid submerged bar is more effective, but permeable bar is more effective for decreasing <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> height. The optimal relations for transmission coefficient and change <b>of</b> mean <b>wave</b> period in dependence of parameters <b>of</b> bar and <b>waves</b> were revealed. For decreasing <b>of</b> <b>wave</b> mean period the optimal length of solid bar must be 0. 4 of initial wavelength and 0. 1 - for permeable bar.
