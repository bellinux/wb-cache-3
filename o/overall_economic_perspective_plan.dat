40|$|I n recent years, many {{countries}} {{have sought to}} expand theirexports. Many governments have tried to reduce biases againstexports and to neutralize incentives between export and im-port-competing activities. 1 Their policies have sometimes included "active " instruments of export promotion, such as export credit and export insurance programs. Export credit programs provide credit for export activities before or after shipment; export credit insur-ance programs insure export credit against commercial or political risks. 2 This article examines from an <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> <b>perspective</b> reasons for these programs and briefly reviews their use in three industrial and seven developing countries. It focuses on the subsidy elements of the programs and their effects on exports and resource allocation. Domestic Distortions Rationales The theory of domestic distortions provides much of the rationale ~^!/~? 7 for export promotion in general, and particularly for export credit Creuir programs (Bhagwati and Ramaswami 1963; Bhagwati 1971; John-son 1966, 1971). It demonstrates that where protection creates a bias against exports and where policymakers are unwilling to elimi-nate the bias, an equivalent subsidy to export activities can restore neutrality, encourage trade along lines of comparative advantage, and improve economic welfare. These antiexport biases arise whe...|$|R
40|$|At {{the present}} stage of our country's {{development}} {{the role of}} economic study has grown as never before {{and in the future}} it will continually increase. This is determined by the great increase in the scale of production, by fundamental changes in its structure, by the expansion and greater complexity of economic ties between regions of the country and within individual regions, between branches of production, and so forth. Working out national <b>economic</b> <b>plans,</b> particularly <b>perspective</b> <b>plans,</b> determining the most effective means of developing production, selecting the best variants for the introduction of new technique and the rational directions of capital investments, preventing possible disproportions in the national economy, correctly utilizing such economic levers as prices, profits, premiums, wages - this is a far from complete list of the problems posed to economists. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{economic aspects}} of ageing and investigates incentives and outcomes {{related to this}} process. The thesis {{is a collection of}} five essays. An introductory chapter provides an <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> <b>perspective</b> of ageing. Essay 1 (ch 2) examines mortality risks via duration analysis of widowed individuals in Scania, Sweden during the 19 th century. The findings are qualitatively in line with previous results of studies based on modern data: Widowers in general face higher relative mortality risks than widows and the effect of spousal bereavement on mortality is decreasing through time. The estimated relative risks for widowers are dependent on socio-economic status; being landless implies high relative risks. Quantitatively, the magnitudes of our estimates are large in comparison with studies based on more recent data. Essay 2 (ch 3) investigates gender-dependent division of labour within the household. In economics this division is commonly attributed to gender differences in relative productivity. We assume completely gender-neutral production capacities, and introduce instead gender-dependent mortality risks as a factor affecting the allocation of resources within a household. In an ordinary marriage the wife faces lower mortality risk than the husband, indicating that the probability of entering into widowhood and the expected length of a potential widowhood period are greater for her. In our model this implies that the wife, via behaviour during marriage, will prepare for widowhood to a larger extent than the husband. Essay 3 (ch 4) tentatively, in the light of economic theory, analyses factors influencing the presence of a social network. Specifically, the structure of social support networks of 500 older men, aged 68 (born 1914 in Malmoe, Sweden), is studied in terms of their children and close friends. We find some support for the hypothesis that the "number of close friends", reported by the studied individuals, is negatively connected with the number of own children. This could be a result of the presence of own children diminishing the incentives for parents to create and maintain social relations with others. Essay 4 (ch 5) explores how diffusion of medical technology to older and older patient groups may have contributed to increasing health care expenditures in the industrialised world. Two specific cases are studied, both representing costly procedures: coronary bypass surgery and dialysis. In both cases, we observe significant diffusion to older age groups. Essay 5 (ch 6), proceeding from the results of the previous chapter, presents a simple theoretical framework, founded in ordinary welfare maximisation, of the diffusion of medical technology across age groups as a consequence of exogenously given technology development. The empirical part reveals major improvements for the CABG-technique regarding the mortality risk of newly treated patients and rehabilitation processes. According to welfare analysis this implies that afflicted individuals, in weaker and weaker general condition (e. g. older and older) and with lighter and lighter disability from the considered complaint, will be treated. Taking the estimates of technological improvements into account, the actual diffusion of the CABG-technique across age groups is consistent with the theoretical framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to shed light on the {{importance}} of sustainable urban planning development for communities and give a comprehensive review of key issues in terms of underpinning concepts, principles and challenges. The study will focus on a number of aspects related to the built environment, neighbourhoods and services, including the infrastructure, and public transport. Moreover, it aims to critically evaluate the most common and established frameworks of sustainable urban communities. Limitations of these frameworks are discussed, including regional variations. These are factored in a new approach for sustainable communities. The contribution of this research is to propose a scalable framework for an effective sustainable urban planning development for communities that address the gaps and the limitations of the existing models. This takes into account the core issues of urban communities including environmental, social, <b>economic</b> and <b>planning</b> <b>perspectives...</b>|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} a popular term within the {{official}} and local government. The concept of sustainability is now as visible {{in the work of}} the municipalities as it is at a national level. However, the term sustainability lacks a viable definition in city planning. The ecological and the social dimensions of sustainability are clearly more visible in planning processes and in planning documents than economic sustainability. Research shows that the <b>economic</b> <b>perspective</b> in city <b>planning</b> often is neglected compared to the other dimensions of sustainability. Thus the importance of economic sustainability is diminished in planning processes and is often left to be used as a framework to the ecological and the social dimensions of sustainability. Given this problem, this study wishes to unfold if the municipality of Trollhättan, Sweden plans for a economic sustainable development. A qualitative case-study is used were data is generated by an interview in addition to several literature analysis. In the literature analysis code words were identified to help find the relevant data. The empirical data is then analyzed and the results of the study were that the municipality of Trollhättan plans for an economic sustainable development, however the term is rather inserted in other aspects of sustainable development than treated as a sole aspect. Understanding the usage of the implementation of the term economic sustainability in city planning can help further research of development and economically sustainable communities...|$|R
