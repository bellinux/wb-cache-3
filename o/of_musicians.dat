5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five {{movements in}} a symmetrical arrangement of two framing duets surrounding recitatives and a central aria. Bach scored {{the work for}} two vocal soloists (soprano (S) and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of originally two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that the scoring for just two voices and strings was probably intended to ease the workload <b>of</b> <b>musicians</b> who had a busy time during the Christmas season. In the later version, Bach added a trio of two oboes (Ob) and taille (Ot). The duration is given as 17 minutes.|$|E

A Bax Memorial Room at University College Cork, was opened by Vaughan Williams in 1955. He was knighted in the 1937 Coronation Honours and was advanced to KCVO in 1953.

5|$|Bloc Party {{commissioned}} Silent Alarm Remixed to {{show that}} remixes and dance music were relevant to the band and to the rock landscape at large. The band members gave each of the original tracks to a number <b>of</b> <b>musicians</b> from different genres; Ladytron, Four Tet, and Nick Zinner were amongst those who reworked the songs. Critics often considered the record as showcasing the potential high quality of remix albums, although some reviewers treated it as disjunct and a poor marketing decision.|$|E

He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting.

One {{of the members of}} Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who would eventually be asked to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, they {{recorded}} the Bert and John album together, featuring {{much of this}} material. Late in 1967 they tired of the all-nighters at Les Cousins and became the resident musicians at a music venue set up by Bruce Dunnet, a Scottish entrepreneur, at the Horseshoe pub (now defunct), at 264–267 Tottenham Court Road. This became the haunt of a number <b>of</b> <b>musicians,</b> including the singer Sandy Denny. Another singer, Jacqui McShee, began performing with the two guitarists and, {{with the addition of}} Danny Thompson (string bass) and Terry Cox (drums), they formed the group, Pentangle. The venue evolved into a jazz club, but by then the group had moved on.|$|E

5|$|In Shaanxi in {{the north}} of China, drum {{ensembles}} accompany yangge dance, and in the Tianjin area there are ritual percussion ensembles such as the Fagu hui Dharma-drumming associations, often consisting of dozens <b>of</b> <b>musicians.</b> In Korea, a style of folk music called Nongak (farmers' music) or pungmul has been performed for many hundred years, both by local players and by professional touring bands at concerts and festivals. It is loud music meant for outdoor performance, played on percussion instruments such as the drums called janggu and puk, and the gongs ching and kkwaenggwari. It originated in simple work rhythms to assist repetitive tasks carried out by field workers.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{the hall}} became the main London base {{of two new}} orchestras, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. These two {{ensembles}} raised the standards of orchestral playing in London to new heights, and the hall's resident orchestra, founded in 1893, was eclipsed and it disbanded in 1930. The new orchestras attracted another generation <b>of</b> <b>musicians</b> from Europe and the United States, including Serge Koussevitzky, Willem Mengelberg, Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Felix Weingartner.|$|E

5|$|L.A. Noires open {{world is}} a {{recreation}} of 1947 Los Angeles. The development team conducted field research in Los Angeles throughout the game's development, and compiled multiple aerial photographs to gather traffic and building information. Various plot points and investigations in the game are based on real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case. Like other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio. Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station. The game also features an original score composed by a group <b>of</b> <b>musicians</b> and inspired by 1940s films.|$|E
5|$|Living in the Material World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against {{his status as}} a superstar, as well as for what many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using a core group <b>of</b> <b>musicians</b> comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E
5|$|Released as the {{follow-up}} to the duo's 1996 album ATLiens, Aquemini expands {{on the previous}} record's outer space-inspired compositions by incorporating live instrumentation. The commercial success of ATLiens allowed for more creative freedom for the group, {{which led to the}} members self-producing the majority of the tracks. The band employed a large number <b>of</b> <b>musicians</b> for the album, who frequently entered and exited the studio throughout the recording process and had a major influence on the writing development of the album's songs. Lyrically, Aquemini explores various themes including human nature, addiction, and interpersonal relationships.|$|E
