500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one <b>on</b> <b>you!</b> <b>For</b> {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E

[...] Instead, you seem to say it’s political statement at every brushstroke. [...] Your tendentious opinions betray a lack of understanding of the artist and a blindness to the paintings themselves. [...] Every painting is, according to you, an evil, cunning, greedy “Anglo-American.” Shame <b>on</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> choosing to make a statement (a very limited statement) about your “political correctness” instead of really looking at the art for what it says about the appeal of the West to our collective imagination. [...] Art is bigger than everyday logic.” (Signed VC, Alexandria, VA) ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{statement}} in a 2005 authorized biography about the Queen (entitled Margrethe) {{focused on her}} views of Islam: [...] "We are being challenged by Islam these years. Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, {{run the risk of}} having unflattering labels placed <b>on</b> <b>you.</b> <b>For</b> there are some things for which one should display no tolerance. And when we are tolerant, we must know whether it is because of convenience or conviction." ...|$|E
