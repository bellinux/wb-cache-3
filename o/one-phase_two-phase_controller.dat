Our theoretical approach follows a standard diffuse-interface model of partially miscible regular binary mixtures wherein convection and diffusion are coupled via a nonequilibrium capillary force, expressing the tendency of the phase-separating system to minimize its free energy. Based on 2 D simulation results, we discuss the influence of viscosity ratio on basic statistics of the mixing (segregation) process triggered by a rapid heating (quench), assuming that the ratio of capillary to viscous forces (a. k. a. the fluidity coefficient) is large. We show that, for a phase-separating system, at a fixed value of the fluidity coefficient (with the continuous phase viscosity taken as a reference), the separation depth and the characteristic length of single-phase microdomains decrease monotonically for increasing values of the viscosity of the dispersed phase. This variation, however, is quite small, in agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, as one might expect, at a fixed viscosity of the dispersed phase both of the above statistics increase monotonically as the viscosity of the continuous phase decreases. Finally, we show that for a mixing system the attainment of a single-phase equilibrium state by coalescence and diffusion is retarded {{by an increase in}} the viscosity ratio at a fixed fluidity for the dispersed phase. In fact, for large enough values of the viscosity ratio, a thin film of the continuous phase becomes apparent when two drops of the minority phase approach each other, which further retards coalescence...|$|R

The IC is implemented with simple hardware, requiring small silicon area, and {{can operate as}} a single-phase or a <b>two-phase</b> <b>controller.</b> To minimize the area and eliminate known mode transition problems of the optimal response controllers, two novel blocks are combined. Namely, an asynchronous track-and-hold analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a “large-small ” signal compensator are implemented. The ADC utilizes a pre-amplifier and only four comparators having approximately eight times smaller silicon area and power consumption than an equivalent windowed flash architecture. The “large-small ” signal compensator consists of two parts, a digital PID minimizing small variations and a zero-current detection-based compensator suppressing large load transients. The large-signal compensator requires no extra calculations and has a low sensitivity to parameter variations. It utilizes a synchronization algorithm and the PID calculation results to obtain a bumpless mode transition and stable response to successive load transients. The IC occupying only 0. 26 mm 2 silicon area is implemented in a CMOS 0. 18 µm process and its minimum deviation response is verified with a single and dual-phase 12 V-to- 1. 8 V, 500 kHz 60 / 120 W buck converter.

Hence this report first derive equations of motion of two-fingered soft finger robotic hand on the basis of energy-based analysis, and explain that an equilibrium point on a combined energy function exists even in the case of manipulat-ing motions by the hand. In this paper, the equilibrium point is called LMEEwC that is unfolded as Local Minimum of Elastic Energy with Constraints.

We explained these differences by the structural disorder and multiple twinning in the nanoparticles.

In this paper, we introduce a method that synergistically combines an analytical pattern generator and a feedback controller frame, which are developed for the purpose of synthesizing dynamic quadrupedal trot-walking locomotion on flat and uneven surfaces. To begin with, the pattern generator analytically produces feasible and dynamically balanced joint motions in accordance with the desired trot-walking characteristics, with no empirical parameter tuning requirements. In concurrence with the pattern generation, a <b>two-phased</b> <b>controller</b> frame is constructed for closed-loop sensory feedback: (i) virtual admittance controller via force sensing, (ii) upper torso angular momentum regulation via gyro sensing. The former controller evaluates joint force errors and generates the corresponding joint displacement for a given set of virtual spring-damper couples. Together with the position constraints, these displacements are additionally fed-back to local servos for achieving compliant quadrupedal locomotion with which the position/force trade-off is addressed. The second controller, that is simultaneously used, evaluates the upper torso angular momentum rate change error using measured and reference orientation information. It then regulates the torso orientation in a dynamically consistent way as the rotational inertia is characterized. In order to validate the proposed methodology several experiments are conducted on both flat and uneven surfaces, using two robots with distinct properties; a ∼ 7 kg cat-sized electrically actuated quadruped (RoboCat- 1), and a ∼ 80 kg Alpine Ibex-sized hydraulically actuated quadruped (HyQ). As a result we demonstrate continuous, repetitive, compliant and dynamically balanced trot-walking cycles in real-robot experiments, adequately confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
