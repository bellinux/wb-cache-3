However, classic lymphatic vessels consisted of endotheliocytes are not found within CNS. Indeed, the central lymphatic circulation exists. Virchow-Robin space (VRS) is regarded as main component of the central lymphatic circulation, which resembles peripheral lymphatic system functionally and {{plays an important role in}} the regulation <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> VRS plays the function of central lymphatic drainage, through which the macromolecular substances in cerebral interstitial fluid are cleared. Also, VRS is the main part of immune surveillance system.

40|$|Blood {{vessels are}} {{critical}} to deliver oxygen and nutrients {{to all of the}} tissues and organs throughout the body. The blood vessels that vascularize the central nervous system (CNS) possess unique properties, termed the blood–brain barrier, which allow these vessels to tightly regulate the movement of ions, molecules, and cells between the blood and the brain. This precise control <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis</b> allows for proper neuronal function and also protects the neural tissue from toxins and pathogens, and alterations of these barrier properties are an important component of pathology and progression of different neurolog-ical diseases. The physiological barrier is coordinated by a series of physical, transport, and metabolic properties possessed by the endothelial cells (ECs) that form thewalls of the blood vessels, and these properties are regulated by interactions with different vascular, immune, and neural cells. Understanding how these different cell populations interact to regulate the barrier properties is essential for understanding how the brain functions during health and disease.

It has only recently been appreciated that astrocyte dysfunction is a primary cause of many neurological disorders. Despite their importance in disease very little is known about global gene expression for human astrocytes. We have performed a microarray expression analysis of human fetal astrocytes to identify genes and signaling pathways that are important for astrocyte development and maintenance. Our analysis confirmed that the fetal astrocytes express high levels of the core astrocyte marker GFAP and the transcription factors from the NFI family which have been shown to play important roles in astrocyte development. A group of novel markers were identified that distinguish fetal astrocytes from pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and NSC-derived neurons. As in murine astrocytes, the Notch signaling pathway appears to be particularly important for cell fate decisions between the astrocyte and neuronal lineages in human astrocytes. These findings unveil the repertoire of genes expressed in human astrocytes and serve as a basis for furthe...|$|E

How the two {{structurally}} distinct immunophilin–drug complexes bind the same target has remained unknown. We report the crystal structure <b>of</b> calcineurin (<b>CN)</b> in complex with CyPA-CsA at 2. 8 -Å resolution.

40|$|Macrophages {{are major}} cell types {{of the immune}} system, and they {{comprise}} both tissue-resident populations and circulating monocyte-derived subsets. Here, we discuss microglia, the resident macrophage within {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), and CNS-infiltrating macrophages. Under steady state, microglia play important roles in the regulation <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis</b> through the removal of damaged or unnecessary neurons and synapses. In the face of inflammatory or pathological insults, microglia and CNS-infiltrating macrophages not only constitute {{the first line of defense}} against pathogens by regulating components of innate immunity, but they also regulate the adaptive arms of immune responses. Dysregulation of these responses contributes to many CNS disorders. In this overview, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the highly diverse and complex function of microglia and macrophages during CNS autoimmunity—multiple sclerosis and cancer—malignant glioma. We emphasize how the crosstalk between natural killer (NK) cells or glioma cells or glioma stem cells and CNS macrophages impacts on the pathological processes. Given the essential role of CNS microglia and macrophages in the regulation of all types of CNS disorders, agents targeting these subsets are currently applied in preclinical and clinical trials.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is a {{perfectly}} regulated environment with conditions far different {{from those in the}} rest of the organism. Even slight changes in this machinery affect its functioning. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the frontier that isolates brain tissues from the substances circulating in the blood vascular system. It is also a diffusion barrier that allows only water and small lipophilic molecules to freely access the brain in accordance with their concentration gradients. Moreover, animal studies have revealed differences in the barrier tightening time-course during development. The BBB becomes resistant to larger molecules before it stops smaller ones. Thus, its maturation has a progressive scheme. Asimilar scheme is true for BBB transporters. Due to all of these facts, the BBB is the most significant element responsible for the preservation <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> As a functional system, the BBB can be investigated as a frontier composed of pericytes, astrocytic end feet, and brain endothelial cells (ECs). Special emphasis is placed on the tight junctions (TJs) existing between them. An alternative point of view considers the BBB to be a functional complex consisting not only of bricks of cells but also of structures between those cells and their cofunctioning elements.

For these studies, cultured bovine brain microvascular endothelial cells (BBMvEC’s) were exposed to laminar shear stress (0 - 10 dynes/cm 2, 0 - 24 h) in conjunction with targeted inhibition strategies to delineate the intracellular signaling pathways mediating adaptation of BBB phenotype to fluid shear stress. Initial findings showed that shear-dependent reduction in BBMvEC permeability was initially observed after 3 - 6 h of shear onset (10 dynes/cm 2), with more significant decreases observed after 12 and 24 h. These responses were temporally mirrored by BBMvEC morphological realignment, and were reversed by flow reduction (i. e. to 1 dynes/cm 2, 24 h), the latter flow reduction also attenuated the enhanced cell-cell border localization of ZO- 1 and reduction in phosphotyrosine (pTyr) -occludin levels induced by high shear. ...|$|E

However, it is known that the correlation between profiles <b>of</b> <b>CN</b> and gene expression does not highly correlate. Factors which determine the degree of correlation remain largely unexplained.

40|$|International audienceAbstractThe aim of {{this review}} is to outline {{evidence}} that adenosine receptor (AR) activation can modulate blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and the implications for disease states and drug delivery. Barriers of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) constitute a protective and regulatory interface between the CNS {{and the rest of the}} organism. Such barriers allow for the maintenance of the homeostasis of the CNS milieu. Among them, the BBB is a highly efficient permeability barrier that separates the brain micro-environment from the circulating blood. It is made up of tight junction-connected endothelial cells with specialized transporters to selectively control the passage of nutrients required for neural homeostasis and function, while preventing the entry of neurotoxic factors. The identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the development and function of CNS barriers is required for a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis</b> in both physiological and pathological settings. It has long been recognized that the endogenous purine nucleoside adenosine is a potent modulator of a large number of neurological functions. More recently, experimental studies conducted with human/mouse brain primary endothelial cells as well as with mouse models, indicate that adenosine markedly regulates BBB permeability. Extracellular adenosine, which is efficiently generated through the catabolism of ATP via the CD 39 /CD 73 ecto-nucleotidase axis, promotes BBB permeability by signaling through A 1 and A 2 A ARs expressed on BBB cells. In line with this hypothesis, induction of AR signaling by selective agonists efficiently augments BBB permeability in a transient manner and promotes the entry of macromolecules into the CNS. Conversely, antagonism of AR signaling blocks the entry of inflammatory cells and soluble factors into the brain. Thus, AR modulation of the BBB appears as a system susceptible to tighten as well as to permeabilize the BBB. Collectively, these findings point to AR manipulation as a pertinent avenue of research for novel strategies aiming at efficiently delivering therapeutic drugs/cells into the CNS, or at restricting the entry of inflammatory immune cells into the brain in some diseases such as multiple sclerosis...|$|E

Both preterm and asphyxiated full term infants {{are at high risk}} of developing such injuries, and intrauterine infection has been identified as an independent risk factor. Whilst the primary causes of perinatal brain injury may be diverse and often elude diagnosis, inflammation is a common feature. We have analysed various aspects of inflammation in perinatal models of sterile and infectious insult. Our particular interests have been: initiation of central inflammation, central nervous system (CNS) recruitment of peripheral immune cells, and inflammation-induced disruption <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis</b> and physiological processes. We demonstrate constitutive expression of all Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a sub-family of pathogen recognition receptors, in the neonatal CNS and active regulation of TLRs 1, 2, 5, 7 & 8 following, sterile, hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. We provide evidence of diminished lesion size in TLR 2 -KO mice, a result strongly implicating TLR 2 as an important mediator of lesion development following HI. Additionally, we display active and prolonged recruitment of peripheral immune cells to the injured regions of the CNS following HI, a process that occurs in distinct “waves” and continues for up to two weeks. Interestingly, such recruitment was absent in a model of infectious insult, as initiated by peripheral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Here, numerous signs of enhanced central inflammation were observed. We detected acute increases in microglial proliferation and total number of microglia, changes coupled to regulation of several inflammation associated genes in the hippocampus. This increased hippocampal inflammatory profile was present for at least two weeks after administration of LPS and occurred in parallel to decreases of neuronal commitment among hippocampal progenitor cells. Together these results indicate involvement of the TLRs in rapid initiation of inflammation following HI and display active and prolonged participation of peripheral immune cells this inflammatory response. Additionally, we demonstrate that inflammation initiated outside the CNS is sufficient to upregulate cerebral inflammatory responses and transiently disrupt developmental microgliogenesis and neurogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Microglial cells play a {{vital role}} in the innate immune {{response}} occurring in the Central Nervous System (CNS). Under physiologic conditions, microglia dynamically patrol the brain parenchyma and participate in the remodeling of active neuronal circuits. Accordingly, microglia can boost synaptic plasticity by removing apoptotic cells and by phagocytizing axon terminals and dendritic spines that form inappropriate neural connections. Upon brain and spinal cord injury or infection, microglia act as the first line of immune defense by promoting the clearance of damaged cells or infectious agents and by releasing neurotrophins and/ or proneurogenic factors that support neuronal survival and regeneration. Recently, two main pathways were suggested for microglia activation upon stimuli. Classical activation is induced by Toll-like receptor agonists and Th 1 cytokines and polarizes cells to an M 1 state, mainly leading to the release of TNF-alpha, IL- 6 and nitric oxide and to grave neural damage. Alternative activation is mediated by Th 2 cytokines and polarizes cells to an M 2 a state inducing the release of antiinflammatory factors. These findings have further fueled the discussion on whether microglia has a detrimental or beneficial action (M 1 or M 2 -associated phenotypes, respectively) in the diseased or injured CNS and, more importantly, on whether we can shift the balance to a positive outcome. Although microglia and macrophages share several common features, upon M 1 and M 2 polarizing conditions, they are believed to develop distinct phenotypic and functional properties which translate into different patterns of activity. Moreover, microglia/macrophages seem to have developed a tightly organized system of maintenance <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis,</b> since cells found in different structures have different morphology and specific function (e. g. meningeal macrophages, perivascular macrophages, choroid plexus macrophages). Nevertheless, though substantial work has been devoted to microglia function, consensus around their exact origin, their role during development, as well as the exact nature of their interaction with other cells of the CNS has not been met. This issue discusses how microglial cells sustain neuronal activity and plasticity in the healthy CNS as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms developed by microglia in response to injury and disease. Understanding the mechanisms involved in microglia actions will enforce the development of new strategies to promote an efficient CNS repair by committing microglia towards neuronal survival and regeneration...|$|E

40|$|Every {{single cell}} within an {{organism}} is constantly facing the demanding task {{of preserving the}} integrity of its genomic material to secure proper function and clearance from disease. To accomplish this cells rely on DNA repair mechanisms that are well-conserved throughout evolution and highly specialized in removing particular types of DNA damage. The ability of rapidly repairing DNA lesions is paramount for cells in both the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS), not only to preserve their differentiation potential but also to ensure that post mitotic cells, which comprise the CNS vast majority, are spared and continue {{to contribute to the}} maintenance <b>of</b> <b>CNS</b> <b>homeostasis.</b> Due to their putative enhanced repair capacity, neural stem cells (NSCs) may not only {{play a critical role in}} sustaining the pool of neural progenitors over the course of neurogenesis, but also in certain conditions, replenish the loss of terminally differentiated cells due to a variety of damage inducing events. The work presented in this thesis aimed to further explore the significance of DNA glycosylase activity both in neural stem and cancer cells and to develop a probe for rapid assessment of neuronal characteristics in neurons differentiated from NSCs. In paper I we propose the DNA glycosylases OGG 1 and NEIL 3 play roles beyond direct removal of oxidized bases and that they are necessary for typical expression levels of genes conferring normal neural stem cell characteristics and multipotency required for differentiation into the various cell lineages found in the mammalian CNS. Further, we show that NEIL 3 deficiency can enhance formation of senescence related heterochromatin foci, suggesting an influence in regulatory functions of this cellular pathway. In paper II we first demonstrate we can generate C 6 glioma cells with stem cell-like characteristics (C 6 SCs), as it could be assessed by an increased ability of these cells to differentiate into astrocytes and neurons after CNTF and VPA treatment respectively. In addition, we show that RNA knockdown of the DNA glycosylase OGG 1 in C 6 SCs affects differentiation potential and increases the histone modification mark, acetylation of histone 3 in lysine 56 (H 3 K 56 ac) associated with increased DNA damage response (DDR). This enhancement of the DDR may confer a certain degree of resistance to cancer therapies that should be carefully taken in account. Finally, in paper III we introduce a new method for the use of a commercially available voltage sensitive dye (VSD), JPW 3027, for accurate characterization of neurons differentiated from NCSs, regarding their ability to generate action potentials (AP). We found that extracellular application of this dye improves labeling of cellular processes, and upon excitation it reports changes in fluorescent translating precise AP kinetics, which are of overall superior quality compared to calcium indicators. Furthermore, JPW 3027 proved to possess a lesser degree of toxicity, which represents a great advantage when monitoring cells for extended periods of time after dye loading. Finally, we propose the use of a finite element model of the NSC culture cover slip to optimize electrode positioning relatively to the patched cells this way producing an electrical stimulation that is homogenous to all cells. With this approach we are able to predict isopotential fields where electrodes can be placed minimizing the perturbation of cells away from the field of view...|$|E
