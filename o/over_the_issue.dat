5|$|At {{the time}} Zara Yaqob assumed the throne, the Ethiopian church had been divided <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Biblical Sabbath {{observance}} for roughly a century. One group, {{loyal to the}} Coptic bishops, believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday, or Great Sabbath; another group, the followers of Ewostatewos, believed with their founder that both the original seventh-day Sabbath (i.e., Saturday, or Lesser Sabbath) and Sunday should be observed.|$|E
5|$|By some accounts, Smith {{had been}} {{teaching}} a polygamy doctrine {{as early as}} 1831, and there is unconfirmed evidence that Smith was a polygamist by 1835. Although the church had publicly repudiated polygamy, in 1837 there was a rift between Smith and Oliver Cowdery <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> Cowdery suspected Smith had engaged {{in a relationship with}} his serving girl, Fanny Alger. Smith never denied a relationship, but insisted it was not adulterous, presumably because he had taken Alger as a plural wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1305, Edward and {{his father}} quarrelled, {{probably}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of money. The Prince had an altercation with Bishop Walter Langton, {{who served as the}} royal treasurer, apparently over the amount of financial support Edward received from the Crown. Edward I defended his treasurer, and banished his son and his companions from his court, cutting off their financial support. After some negotiations involving family members and friends, the two men were reconciled.|$|E

5|$|In December 2011, {{the sale}} of uranium to India was a {{contentious}} issue. MPs clashed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> and protesters were marched from Sydney's convention centre before Prime Minister Julia Gillard's motion to remove a party ban on uranium sales to India was narrowly supported 206 votes to 185. Long-time anti-nuclear campaigner Peter Garrett MP spoke against the motion.|$|E
5|$|In May, Quisling was {{shattered}} {{by the death of}} his mother Anna, as the two had been particularly close. At the same time, the political crisis over Norwegian independence deepened, with Quisling threatening Terboven with his resignation <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of finance. In the end, the Reichskommissar agreed to compromise on the issue, but Quisling had to concede on the SS issue: A brigade was formed, but as a branch of the Nasjonal Samling.|$|E
5|$|In the 1895 gubernatorial election, Kentucky elected its first-ever Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Bradley {{was able}} to {{capitalize}} both on divisions within the Democratic Party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Free Silver and {{on the presence of}} a strong third-party candidate, Populist Thomas S. Pettit, to secure victory in the general election by just under 9,000 votes. This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true, two-party competition in Kentucky politics.|$|E

5|$|Victoria's {{household}} {{was largely}} run by her childhood governess, Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover. Lehzen {{had been a}} formative influence on Victoria, and had supported her against the Kensington System. Albert, however, thought Lehzen was incompetent, and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter's health. After a furious row between Victoria and Albert <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842, and Victoria's close relationship with her ended.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 {{they seem to have}} been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
50|$|Under Jeremy Corbyn's {{leadership}} of the Labour Party, the GMB has clashed with <b>the</b> party <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of Trident renewal and fracking, {{both of which are}} opposed by Corbyn.|$|R
25|$|During the American Civil War, East Tennessee and her {{citizens}} were deeply divided <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of slavery, States' rights, and secession that {{ultimately led to}} Tennessee's break with the Union.|$|R
50|$|Stoughton {{subsequently}} {{became a}} Republican <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of {{preservation of the}} union and abolition of slavery. He served in the Vermont Senate from 1862 to 1864 and was Senate President from 1863 to 1864.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned to run for {{president}} a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b> In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. One advantage over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E
5|$|Coenwulf {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries. The breakdown {{in the relationship between}} the two eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years. A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf's successor, King Ceolwulf, but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf's grants of religious property.|$|E
50|$|Owing to the {{dismissal}} of the judicial review {{and the lack of}} public concerns <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> after <b>the</b> Public Consultation Exercise crisis, the Airport Authority had officially embarked on the implementation of the Master Plan 2030.|$|R
2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{resulting from}} his publication in July 1979 of his [...] "1844" [...] Re-Examined Syllabus, Ford's October 1979 , and the alarmed reaction of church administrators saw some depart from <b>the</b> church <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> that were raised.|$|R
5000|$|There {{have been}} {{disagreements}} between <b>the</b> two countries <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> {{of climate change}} and the Kyoto Protocol. The main point of friction between Tuvalu and the United States has been the latter's non-ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.|$|R
5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals {{was made possible by}} the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|During Bush's second term, a {{controversy}} arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House {{maintained that the}} U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue,</b> along with other {{senior members of the}} Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers Harriet Miers and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the MCA {{assessed}} the NEP {{and other government}} policies from a Chinese point of view. Its findings expressed concern {{over a number of}} problems, including alleged disrespect of the citizenship of the Malaysian Chinese and the Malay-dominated civil service, claiming the NEP's goal of eradicating identification of race with economic function had been abrogated. In addition, it was argued that non-Malays were under-represented in Parliament and the Cabinet because of gerrymandering; mostly Malay rural Parliamentary constituencies outnumbered heterogeneous urban constituencies, despite the total population of urban constituencies exceeding that of rural ones. However, UMNO avoided directly confronting the MCA <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2009, {{the post}} of {{ambassador}} remained vacant for several months because of tensions between the Vatican and <b>the</b> Obama administration <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of abortion and same-sex marriage.

50|$|After {{the start}} of Suriname’s {{political}} self-government from the Netherlands in 1954, changes were instigated to the country’s monetary system; on 1 April 1957 the Central bank of Suriname was established in Paramaribo and took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuing</b> of currency.|$|R
5000|$|The {{controversy}} {{resulting from}} his publication in July 1979 of his [...] "1844" [...] Re-Examined Syllabus, Ford's October 1979 response to it, and the alarmed reaction of church administrators saw some depart from <b>the</b> church <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> that were raised.|$|R
5|$|In October 1849 the {{southern}} interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis, {{in response to}} a convention in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there, to connect with an El Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of financing. The convention president, Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia, preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and others thought that federal land grants to railroad developers would be necessary.|$|E
5|$|In his {{new role}} Nichols clashed with the AEC <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of whether it or the Department of Defense should have custody of nuclear weapons. The administration's policy {{remained}} firmly in favor of AEC control. This was tested during the Berlin Blockade, when Truman ordered B-29 bombers to Europe. For a time {{there was talk of}} calling off the Operation Sandstone nuclear weapons tests, but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E.M. Armstrong.|$|E

5000|$|The Silver Republican Party was a United States {{political}} {{party in the}} 1890s.

The main Republican Party supported the gold standard.|$|R
