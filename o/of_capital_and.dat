5|$|Britten {{was born}} in the fishing port of Lowestoft in Suffolk, on the east coast of England on 22 November 1913, the feast day of Saint Cecilia. He was the {{youngest}} of four children of Robert Victor Britten (1878–1934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, née Hockey (1874–1937). Robert Britten's youthful ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> <b>and</b> he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at Charing Cross Hospital in London he met Edith Hockey, the daughter of a junior Home Office official. They were married in September 1901 at St John's, Smith Square, London.|$|E

In March 1890 Samuel Webster & Sons became a {{registered}} company with £175,000 (£17.5million in 2010) <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> Isaac Webster, Samuel's eldest son, its first chairman. In 1892 net profit was £20,000 (£2million in 2010). In 1896 the company took over H & T T Ormerod of Brighouse, West Yorkshire which could trace its origins back to 1760. Isaac Webster died in 1899, leaving an estate of £87,454 (£9million). By 1900 the company's office had moved to 57 Northgate, Halifax.|$|E
5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E

5|$|On November 29, 1820, the Assembly {{chartered}} the Bank of the Commonwealth, {{another source}} from which debtors could obtain money. Creditors {{did not want}} to accept payment from either the Bank of Kentucky or the Bank of the Commonwealth; the notes of the former were depreciated due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> the latter had no capital and no guarantee of state credit. In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes from the Bank of the Commonwealth but not the Bank of Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the Bank of Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E
5|$|The Napoleonic Wars were {{therefore}} ones in which Britain invested large amounts <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy, which won a decisive victory over a Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar in 1805. Overseas colonies were attacked and occupied, {{including those of}} the Netherlands, which was annexed by Napoleon in 1810. France was finally defeated by a coalition of European armies in 1815. Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the Ionian Islands, Malta (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), Mauritius, Saint Lucia, and Tobago; Spain ceded Trinidad; the Netherlands Guyana, and the Cape Colony. Britain returned Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Réunion to France, and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands, while gaining control of Ceylon (1795–1815).|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E

Light was order per S. O. No. 62 to establish a station by July 1877. On June 22, 1877, the station was established {{on the second floor}} of the Overland Hotel on the northwest corner of 8th and Main Street. Weather observations began at the station on July 1st, 1977. The station was moved to a third story addition to the Hotel shortly after Hosea Eastman bought it in 1878. The station was moved twice, next door to the Davis building in September 1880 and the Perrault Building on the southeast corner <b>of</b> <b>Capital</b> <b>and</b> Main Streets in January 1888. The weather instruments were on the roof except for the thermometers which were in a window shelter from 1877 to 1885. The thermometers placed in a Cotton region shelter on December 1, 1885. A lack of funding and Chief Signal Officer Adolphus Greely opening of a new station in Baker City, Oregon lead to the closure of the Boise station on June 30, 1890. Greenly felt the Baker City Station would be more valuable than the Boise station which was not supported by his forecasters in Washington. Barnet Light, James Kenealy, Henry Boynton and William Korts were the only four observers during the stations 13 years in Boise.|$|E

40|$|The long-standing {{criticism}} of Marx’s theory of prices of production in Volume 3 <b>of</b> <b>Capital,</b> from Bortkiewicz on, is that Marx “failed {{to transform the}} inputs ” <b>of</b> constant <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> variable <b>capital</b> from values to prices of production.

I argue that the magnitudes <b>of</b> constant <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> variable <b>capital</b> are taken as given, both in the theory of surplus-value in Volume 1 and in the theory of prices of production in Volume 3. And the crucial point is that the same quantities <b>of</b> constant <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> variable <b>capital</b> are taken as given in both of these stages of the theory- the actual quantities <b>of</b> money <b>capital</b> advanced to purchase means of production and labor-power in {{the first phase of the}} circulation <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in the real capitalist economy [the M in M- C [...] .

The instrument used to determine whether the turnover <b>of</b> working <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> <b>capital</b> structure has a significant effect on profitability is to use regression analysis with panel data.

The calibration to the Chinese economy implies that the rapid increase in the share <b>of</b> housing <b>capital</b> <b>and</b> the simultaneous decrease in the consumption-output ratio observed in China can be rationalized {{by a combination of}} three factors: a high elas-ticity of substitution between the two sectors, a high <b>capital</b> intensity <b>of</b> production of the housing sector, and a low initial share <b>of</b> housing <b>capital</b> before the Chinese housing market reform.
