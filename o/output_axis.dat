A subbase joins the reducer with an electric motor, and serves to limit the misalignment between the motor shaft and the reducer input shaft.

Impeding the implementation of lower cost designs is the lack of an equation to properly choose subbase dimensions for acceptable values of shaft misalignment. Trial and error in subbase construction may provide designs that give acceptable results for misalignment.

50|$|In a rate {{indicating}} gyroscope, the gyroscope {{is turned}} {{at a steady}} rate about its input axis and a torque {{is applied to the}} spin axis. This causes the gyroscope to precess about the output axis.The rate indicating gyroscope consists of a damping fluid between the float assembly can and the outer casing. This viscous fluid resists the motion of the gimbal precession. This causes the gimbal to accelerate initially in the fluid, until the damping effect is equal to the precessing force.The rate of precession, will hence be directly proportional to the rate of turn of the gyroscope about its input axis and the total angle of movement about the <b>output</b> <b>axis</b> will be proportional to the speed and length of time the input axis is turning.|$|E

40|$|Micromechanical {{resonant}} displacement gain stages {{have been}} demonstrated that employ directionally engineered stiffnesses in resonant structures to effect displacement amplification from a driven input axis to an <b>output</b> <b>axis.</b> Specifically, the introduction of slots along the <b>output</b> <b>axis</b> of a 53 -MHz wine-glass mode disk resonator structure realizes a single gain stage with a measured input-to-output displacement amplification of 3. 08 x. Multiple such mechanical displacement gain stages can then be cascaded in series via half-wavelength beam couplers to achieve multiplicative gain factors; e. g., two cascaded gain stages achieve a total measured gain of 7. 94 x. The devices have also been operated as resonant switches, where displacement gain allows impact switching via actuation voltages of only 400 mV, which is 6 x smaller than for previous resoswitches without displacement gain. The availability of such high frequency displacement gain strategies for resonant switches may soon allow purely mechanical periodic switching applications (such as power amplifiers and power converters) with much higher efficiencies than current transistor-based versions.

40|$|Background: Public health {{research}} on sedentary behavior (SB) in youth has heavily relied on accelerometers. However, {{it has been}} limited {{by the lack of}} consensus on the most accurate accelerometer cut-points as well as by unknown effects caused by accelerometer position (wrist vs. hip) and <b>output</b> (single <b>axis</b> vs. multiple axes). The present study systematically evaluates classification accuracy of different Actigraph cut-points for classifying SB using hip and wrist-worn monitors and establishes new cut-points to enable use of the 3 -dimensional vector magnitude data (for both hip and wrist placement). Methods: A total of 125 children ages 7 – 13 yrs performed 12 randomly selected activities (from a set of 24 different activities) for 5 min each while wearing tri-axial Actigraph accelerometers on both the hip and wrist. The accelerometer data were categorized as either sedentary or non-sedentary minutes using six previously studied cut-points: 100 counts-per-minute (CPM), 200 CPM, 300 CPM, 500 CPM, 800 CPM and 1100 CPM. Classification accuracy was evaluated with Cohen’s Kappa (k) and new cut-points were identified from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). Results: Of the six cut-points, the 100 CPM value yielded the highest classification accuracy (k = 0. 81) for hip placement. For wrist placement, all of the cut-points produced low classification accuracy (ranges of k from 0. 44 to 0. 67). Optimal sedentary cut-points derived from ROC were 554. 3 CPM (ROC-AUC of 0. 99) for vector magnitude for hip, 1756 CPM (ROC-AUC of 0. 94) for vertical axis for wrist, and 3958. 3 CPM (ROC-AUC of 0. 93) for vector magnitude for wrist placement...|$|R

A significant challenge has been to unravel the circuitry and mechanisms providing for regulation of HPA output, as these limbic forebrain regions do not provide any direct innervation of HPA effector cell groups in the paraventricular hypothalamus. Recent evidence will be highlighted that endorse a discrete region within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis {{that acts as a}} neural hub for receiving and integrating these influences, whereas the prevailing view involves a layer of cell groups providing an array multisynaptic parallel pathways between the forebrain and PVH.

40|$|Wound healing {{capability}} is inextricably linked with diverse aspects {{of physical fitness}} ranging from recovery after minor injuries and surgery to diabetes and some types of cancer. Impact of the microbiome upon the mammalian wound healing process is poorly understood. We discover that supplementing the gut microbiome with lactic acid microbes in drinking water accelerates the wound-healing process to occur in half the time required for matched control animals. Further, we find that Lactobacillus reuteri enhances wound-healing properties through up-regulation of the neuropeptide hormone oxytocin, a factor integral in social bonding and reproduction, by a vagus nerve-mediated pathway. Bacteria-triggered oxytocin serves to activate host CD 4 +Foxp 3 +CD 25 + immune T regulatory cells conveying transplantable wound healing capacity to naive Rag 2 -deficient animals.
