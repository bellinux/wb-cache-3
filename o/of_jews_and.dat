5|$|After {{the start}} of the war, Himmler {{intensified}} the activity of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} Germany Must Perish! which called for the sterilization of the German people {{and the distribution of}} the German lands. The text was used extensively in Nazi propaganda, often as a justification for the persecution <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> was specifically cited as a reason to round up the Jews of Hanover, Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{final scene}} (set 8 months later) shows {{the changes that}} Borat's {{observations}} from America have brought to his village, including the apparent conversion {{of the people to}} Christianity (the Kazakh version of which includes crucifixion and torturing <b>of</b> <b>Jews)</b> <b>and</b> the introduction of computer-based technology, such as iPods, laptop computers and a high-definition, LCD television.|$|E
50|$|He {{acted as}} {{chairman}} of the National Committee against Nazi Persecution <b>and</b> Extermination <b>of</b> the <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> the Philippine War Relief Committee.

50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1922 census of Palestine, Gedera had a {{population}} of 140 inhabitants, consisting <b>of</b> 136 <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 4 Christians. The 1931 census, recorded 63 occupied houses and a population <b>of</b> 201 <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 7 Muslims. By 1945, the population had increased to an estimated 970 Jews.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the {{majority of whom}} are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims (of which many are Ahmadis). Haifa also includes Druze and Bahá'í communities. In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15-29 group, in which 27% of the Arab {{population is}} found, and the age 30-44 group (23%). The population <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the White House Hanukkah Party, Obama's White House Passover Seder {{was not a}} {{political}} event. The guest list did not include rabbinical figures, Jewish lobbyists, members of Congress, or Israeli representatives. The guest list of approximately 20 remained basically the same each year. Attendees included {{the president and his}} family, members of the president's and first lady's staff and their families, and friends of the Obamas, with a mix <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|Active {{resistance}} in Belgium {{took the form}} of sabotaging railways and lines of communication as well as hiding Jews and Allied airmen. The resistance produced large numbers of illegal newspapers in both French and Dutch, distributed to the public to provide news about the war not available in officially approved, censored newspapers. Some such publications achieved considerable success, such as La Libre Belgique, which reached a circulation of 70,000. Attacks on German soldiers were comparatively rare as the German administration made a practice of executing at least five Belgian hostages for each German soldier killed. At great personal risk, Belgian civilians also hid large numbers <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> political dissenters hunted by the Germans.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Eckstein {{founded the}} International Fellowship <b>of</b> Christians <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>of</b> Canada; in 2006, La Fraternidad Internacional de Cristianos y Judíos;, in 2012, the International Fellowship <b>of</b> Christians <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>of</b> Australia, <b>and,</b> also in 2012, a new Fellowship {{affiliate}} in South Korea.|$|R
50|$|After {{serving as}} {{national}} co-director of inter-religious {{affairs for the}} Anti-Defamation League, Eckstein founded the Holyland Fellowship <b>of</b> Christians <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> in 1983 to help Christians <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> work together on projects promoting the safety <b>and</b> security <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> in Israel <b>and</b> around the world. The organization was renamed the International Fellowship <b>of</b> Christians <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> in 1991.|$|R
50|$|An {{opinion poll}} {{released}} in March 2016 by the Pew Research Center found high {{support for a}} Halachic state among religious Israeli Jews. The poll found that 86% <b>of</b> Israeli Haredi <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 69% <b>of</b> non-Haredi religious <b>Jews</b> support making Halacha Israel's legal code, while 57% <b>of</b> traditional <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> 90% <b>of</b> secular <b>Jews</b> oppose such a move.|$|R
5|$|However, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{criticized the}} design of Grandpa Boris and charged it with being anti-Semitic. The {{controversy}} erupted when a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was published, featuring Boris in a synagogue reciting the Mourner's Kaddish. The ADL {{issued a statement saying}} that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions <b>of</b> <b>Jews,</b> <b>and</b> the fact that the character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity. The Washington Post, the newspaper who published the strip, issued a similar statement in their Editor's Note section, criticizing Nickelodeon for not showing better judgment in editing the strip.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno extermination camp, Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting <b>of</b> <b>Jews),</b> <b>and</b> therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E

5|$|The Parthian Empire, being {{culturally}} and politically heterogeneous, had {{a variety of}} religious systems and beliefs, the most widespread being those dedicated to Greek and Iranian cults. Aside from a minority <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> early Christians, most Parthians were polytheistic. Greek and Iranian deities were often blended together as one. For example, Zeus was often equated with Ahura Mazda, Hades with Angra Mainyu, Aphrodite and Hera with Anahita, Apollo with Mithra, and Hermes with Shamash. Aside from the main gods and goddesses, each ethnic group and city had their own designated deities. As with Seleucid rulers, Parthian art indicates that the Arsacid kings viewed themselves as gods; this cult of the ruler {{was perhaps the most}} widespread.|$|E
5|$|After hearing NSDAP leader Hitler {{speak for}} the first time in 1920 at a Munich rally, Hess became {{completely}} devoted to him. They held a shared belief in the stab-in-the-back myth, the notion that Germany's loss in World War I was caused by a conspiracy <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> Bolsheviks rather than a military defeat. Hess joined the NSDAP on 1 July as member number 16. As the party continued to grow, holding rallies and meetings in ever larger beer halls in Munich, he focused his attention on fundraising and organisational activities. On 4 November 1921 he was injured while protecting Hitler when a bomb planted by a Marxist group exploded at the Hofbräuhaus during a party event. Hess joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) by 1922 and helped organise and recruit its early membership.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Robert excommunicated Palatine Denis and put Hungary {{under an}} interdict on 25 February 1232, because the {{employment}} <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> Muslims continued despite the Golden Bull of 1231. Since the archbishop accused the Muslims of persuading Andrew to seize church property, Andrew restored properties to the archbishop, who soon suspended the interdict. Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory sent Cardinal Giacomo Pecoraria as his legate to Hungary and promised {{that nobody would}} be excommunicated without the pope's special authorization. Although Andrew departed for Halych to support his youngest son in a fight against Daniel Romanivich, he continued his negotiations with the papal legate. On 20 August 1233, in the forests of Bereg, he vowed {{that he would not}} employ Jews and Muslims to administrate royal revenues, and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues. Andrew repeated his oath in Esztergom in September.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{used his}} {{position}} {{to create an}} extensive bureaucracy and involve himself {{as much as possible}} in the decision making. He gained acceptance into Hitler's inner circle, and accompanied him everywhere, providing briefings and summaries of events and requests. He began acting as Hitler's personal secretary on 12 August 1935. Bormann assumed Hess' former duties, with the title of Head of the Parteikanzlei (Party Chancellery), after Hess' solo flight to Britain on 10 May 1941 to seek peace negotiations with the British government. He had final approval over civil service appointments, reviewed and approved legislation, and by 1943 had de facto control over all domestic matters. Bormann was one of the leading proponents of the ongoing persecution of the Christian churches and favoured harsh treatment <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> Slavs in the areas conquered by Germany during World War II.|$|E
5|$|During the Crimean campaign, Manstein was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} atrocities against the Soviet population, especially those committed by Einsatzgruppe D, {{one of several}} Schutzstaffel (SS) groups that had been tasked with {{the elimination of the}} Jews of Europe. Einsatzgruppe D travelled in the wake of Manstein's 11th Army, and were provided by Manstein's command with vehicles, fuel, and drivers. Military police cordoned off areas where the Einsatzgruppe planned to shoot Jews to prevent anyone from escaping. Captain Ulrich Gunzert, shocked to have witnessed Einsatzgruppe D massacre a group of Jewish women and children, went to Manstein to ask him to do something to stop the killings. Gunzert states that Manstein told him to forget what he had seen and to concentrate on fighting the Red Army. Eleven of the seventeen charges against Manstein at his later war crimes trial were related to Nazi maltreatment and killing <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> prisoners of war in the Crimea.|$|E
5|$|Racism, {{especially}} antisemitism, was {{a central}} feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of the Aryan race and were therefore viewed as the master race. Millions <b>of</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.|$|E
50|$|As <b>of</b> 2001, Orthodox <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jews</b> {{affiliated}} with an Orthodox synagogue accounted for approximately 50% <b>of</b> British <b>Jews</b> (150,000), 26.5% <b>of</b> Israeli <b>Jews</b> (1,500,000), <b>and</b> 13% <b>of</b> American <b>Jews</b> (529,000).
