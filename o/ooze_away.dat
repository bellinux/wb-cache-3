60|$|Too late, I endeavoured to go {{to earth}} behind the chandler, only to {{discover}} that there was no chandler there. Some appointment, suddenly remembered--possibly a promise to his wife that he would be home to tea--had caused him to <b>ooze</b> <b>away</b> while my attention was elsewhere, leaving me right out in the open.|$|E
60|$|It may be {{that there}} is a {{companionship}} in a mirror, especially to a woman; that the reflection of oneself is an emboldening presence, a personality which is better than the actuality of an unvalued stranger. Certainly, when Stephen closed the door and stood in the wainscoted passage, which was only dimly lit by the high window at either end, her courage seemed at once to <b>ooze</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{he marched}} on, however, his {{defiance}} began to <b>ooze</b> <b>away.</b> He went over every word Ruth or he had said, {{and when he}} reached his room he sat deep in an arm-chair, like a hurt animal crouching, his coat still on, his felt hat over his eyes, his tie a trifle disarranged, his legs straight out before him, {{his hands in his}} trousers pockets, while he disconsolately contemplated a photograph of Forrest Haviland in full-dress uniform that stood on the low bureau among tangled ties, stray cigarettes, a bronze aviation medal, cuff-buttons, and a haberdasher's round package of new collars. His gaze was steady and gloomy. He was dramatizing himself as hero in a melodrama. He did not know how the play would end.|$|E

60|$|In {{the monotony}} of my life, and in my {{constant}} apprehension of the re-opening of the school, {{it was such an}} insupportable affliction! I had long tasks every day to do with Mr. Mell; but I did them, there being no Mr. and Miss Murdstone here, and got through them without disgrace. Before, and after them, I walked about--supervised, as I have mentioned, by the man with the wooden leg. How vividly I call to mind the damp about the house, the green cracked flagstones in the court, an old leaky water-butt, and the discoloured trunks of some of the grim trees, which seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees, and to have blown less in the sun! At one we dined, Mr. Mell and I, at the upper end of a long bare dining-room, full of deal tables, and smelling of fat. Then, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Mell drank out of a blue teacup, and I out of a tin pot. All day long, and until seven or eight in the evening, Mr. Mell, at his own detached desk in the schoolroom, worked hard with pen, ink, ruler, books, and writing-paper, making out the bills (as I found) for last half-year. When he had put up his things for the night he took out his flute, and blew at it, until I almost thought he would gradually blow his whole being into the large hole at the top, and <b>ooze</b> <b>away</b> at the keys.|$|E

60|$|When the Midsummer {{vacation}} approached, no indecent {{manifestations of}} joy were {{exhibited by the}} leaden-eyed young gentlemen assembled at Doctor Blimber's.

60|$|But for {{her mother}} she had to remove her nurse's uniform. And at the same time, she had to {{constitute}} herself nurse. Miss Frost, {{and a woman who}} came in, and the servant had been nursing the invalid between them. Miss Frost was worn and rather heavy: her old buoyancy and brightness was gone. She had become irritable also. She was very glad that Alvina had returned to take this responsibility of nursing off her shoulders. For her wonderful energy had ebbed and <b>oozed</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{staggered}} {{towards the}} bottle. Trent watched him, interfering no longer. With a little chuckle of content he seized upon it and, too fearful of interference from Trent {{to wait for}} a glass, raised it to his lips. There was a gurgling in his throat--a little spasm as he choked, and released his lips for a moment. Then the bottle slid from his nerveless fingers to the floor, and the liquor <b>oozed</b> <b>away</b> in a little brown stream; even Trent dropped his pack of cards and sprang up startled. For bending down under the sloping roof was a European, to all appearance an Englishman, in linen clothes and white hat. It was the man for whom they had waited.|$|R
6000|$|The most difficile {{woman in}} a shoe-store has at least a definite, {{tangible}} foot to fit. But the holiday crowd were buying presents for persons of whom Father knew nothing--though the shoppers expected him to know everything, from the sizes of their wrists to their tastes in bill-folds. They haggled and pushed and crowded; they {{wanted it to be}} less expensive, as well as more blessed, to give than to receive. He spent twenty minutes in showing the entire line of diaries to one woman. She apparently desired {{to make sure that they}} were all of them moral or something of the sort.

60|$|The {{thing had}} begun with the {{lowering}} glances that Francesco had observed, and {{had grown to}} gibes and insults after he had disappeared. But Lanciotto had preserved an unruffled front, being a man schooled in the Count of Aquila's service to silence and a wondrous patience. This insensibility those hinds translated into cowardice, and emboldened by it--like the mongrels that they were--their offensiveness grew more direct and gradually more threatening. Lanciotto's patience was slowly <b>oozing</b> <b>away,</b> and indeed, {{it was no longer}} anything but the fear of provoking his master's anger that restrained him. At length one burly ruffian, who had bidden him remove his head-piece in the company of gentlemen, and whose request had been by Lanciotto as disregarded as the rest, advanced menacingly towards him and caught him by the leg, as Ercole had caught his master. Exasperated at that, Lanciotto had swung his leg free, and caught the rash fellow a vicious kick in the face that had felled him, stunned and bleeding.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Gladstone's brief {{notes of}} his first and second {{cabinets}} are worth transcribing: the judicious reader will have little difficulty in guessing the topic for deliberation; it figured in the latest of his cabinets as in the earliest, {{as well as in}} most of those that intervened. 'May 15.--My first cabinet. On Irish repeal meetings. No fear of breach of the peace, grounded on reasons. Therefore no case for interference. (The duke, however, was for issuing a proclamation.) May 20.--Second [cabinet] Repeal. Constabulary tainted.' It would be safe to say of any half dozen consecutive meetings of the Queen's servants, taken at random during the reign, that Ireland would be certain to crop up. Still, protection was the burning question. From one cause or another, said Mr. Gladstone looking back to these times, 'my reputation among the conservatives on the question of protection <b>oozed</b> <b>away</b> with rapidity. It died with the year 1842, and early in 1843 a duke, I think the Duke of Richmond, speaking in the House of Lords, described some renegade proceeding as a proceeding conducted under the banner of the vice-president of the board of trade.' He was not always as careful as Peel, and sometimes came near to a scrape.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the last}} ice age in the Pleistocene, the Rhine started at the southwestern tip of the Black Forest, while the waters from the Alps that today feed the Rhine were carried east by the {{so-called}} Urdonau (original Danube). Parts of this ancient river's bed, which was much larger than today's Danube, can still be seen in (now waterless) canyons in today's landscape of the Swabian Alb. After the Upper Rhine valley had been eroded, most waters from the Alps changed their direction and began feeding the Rhine. Today's upper Danube is but a meek reflection of the ancient one.Since the Swabian Alb is largely shaped of porous limestone, and since the Rhine's level is much lower than the Danube's, today subsurface rivers carry much water from the Danube to the Rhine. On many days in the summer, when the Danube carries little water, it completely <b>oozes</b> <b>away</b> noisily into these underground channels at two locations in the Swabian Alp, which are referred to as the Donauversickerung (Danube Sink). Most of this water resurfaces only 12 km south at the Aachtopf, Germany's wellspring with the highest flow, an average of , north of Lake Constance—thus feeding the Rhine. The European Water Divide applies only for those waters that pass beyond this point, and only during the days of the year when the Danube carries enough water to survive the sink holes in the Donauversickerung.|$|R
40|$|Periglacial surface {{structures}} {{like ice}} wedge polygons and thermokarst depressions are widely distributed in Siberian permafrost landscapes. Features of comparable morphology occur {{also on the}} Martian surface, especially in mid-latitude regions. We present polygon structures and thermokarst phenomena of different shapes and sizes, which were observed within {{the last four years}} during several German-Russian expeditions in Northern Yakutia. The morphology of the structures is studied quantitatively by air-borne and satellite imagery. Additionally, the geological and hydrological conditions for the formation of the periglacial features are described. Similar quantitative analyses of Martian analogue features have been carried out in order to obtain information on the lithological and hydrological environment in which they formed. These structures are often situated close to the mouths of the large outflow channel systems on Mars. Therefore, it is assumed that water from the flood events that carved the outflow channels <b>oozed</b> <b>away</b> into the ground forming a permafrost layer. Depth and thickness of this layer is not known. A model derived from rampart crater data (see Costard & Kargel, Icarus 114, 1994) for the ice content in Acidalia Planitia, proposes a ground ice layer > 2500 m thick below a layer of fluvial sediments containing ice segregations ~ 940 - 1000 m thick. By comparing the results of both terrestrial and martian investigations we will try to draw conclusions for the genesis of the observed structures on Mars as well as the depth and thickness of the possible permafrost layer...|$|R

60|$|Of course, {{all this}} is soul-sickness, life-sickness. It is the penalty the imaginative man must pay for his {{friendship}} with John Barleycorn. The penalty paid by the stupid man is simpler, easier. He drinks himself into sottish unconsciousness. He sleeps a drugged sleep, and, if he dream, his dreams are dim and inarticulate. But to the imaginative man, John Barleycorn sends the pitiless, spectral syllogisms of the white logic. He looks upon life and all its affairs with the jaundiced eye of a pessimistic German philosopher. He sees through all illusions. He transvalues all values. Good is bad, truth is a cheat, and life is a joke. From his calm-mad heights, with the certitude of a god, he beholds all life as evil. Wife, children, friends--in the clear, white light of his logic they are exposed as frauds and shams. He sees through them, and all that he sees is their frailty, their meagreness, their sordidness, their pitifulness. No longer do they fool him. They are miserable little egotisms, {{like all the other}} little humans, fluttering their May-fly life-dance of an hour. They are without freedom. They are puppets of chance. So is he. He realises that. But there is one difference. He sees; he knows. And he knows his one freedom: he may anticipate the day of his death. All of which is not good for a man who is made to live and love and be loved. Yet suicide, quick or slow, a sudden spill or a gradual <b>oozing</b> <b>away</b> through the years, is the price John Barleycorn exacts. No friend of his ever escapes making the just, due payment.|$|R

60|$|When {{he got to}} the Maypole, however, and Joe, {{responding}} to his well-known hail, came running out to the horse's head, leaving the door open behind him, and disclosing a delicious perspective of warmth and brightness--when the ruddy gleam of the fire, streaming through the old red curtains of the common room, seemed to bring with it, as part of itself, a pleasant hum of voices, and a fragrant odour of steaming grog and rare tobacco, all steeped as it were in the cheerful glow--when the shadows, flitting across the curtain, showed that those inside had risen from their snug seats, and were making room in the snuggest corner (how well he knew that corner!) for the honest locksmith, and a broad glare, suddenly streaming up, bespoke the goodness of the crackling log from which a brilliant train of sparks was doubtless at that moment whirling up the chimney in honour of his coming--when, superadded to these enticements, there stole upon him from the distant kitchen a gentle sound of frying, with a musical clatter of plates and dishes, and a savoury smell that made even the boisterous wind a perfume--Gabriel felt his firmness <b>oozing</b> rapidly <b>away.</b> He tried to look stoically at the tavern, but his features would relax into a look of fondness.
