50|$|Apristurus albisoma, the whitish {{catshark}}, is a catshark of {{the family}} Scyliorhinidae. The area of occupancy of this small benthic endemic shark is presumed very limited (less than 2,000 km²), being restricted to a narrow depth band on insular and seamount slopes. It has only been reported from a few locations. There is concern that this species may be taken as un-utilised bycatch by deepwater trawl fisheries and that, like <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> <b>species,</b> {{it may not be}} sufficiently fecund to withstand exploitation pressure in these fisheries.|$|E
40|$|With {{slow growth}} rates, late {{maturity}} {{and a high}} maximum age of 100 years or more, orange roughy can be classified as a vulnerable deepwater fish species that can only sustain low rates of exploitation. Historical patterns of exploitation associated with this species {{suggest that it is}} currently not possible to manage its fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic sustainably, and the total allowable catch for orange roughy has been gradually reduced to zero for European fisheries since 2010. Orange roughy to the west of Ireland and Britain occurs on distinct bathymetric features (seamounts, hills and canyons) as well as on flat ground along the continental slope. Productivity-susceptibility analysis (PSA) was performed to evaluate the biological vulnerability of orange roughy in relation to <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> <b>species</b> and the risk that recent and current fisheries pose to its populations in the study area. Time-dependant PSA, based on the spatial overlap between orange roughy distribution and recent and current deepwater fisheries demonstrated a strong reduction in risk over time when fisheries stopped directed targeting practices and continued with mixed deepwater trawl fisheries. Some spatial overlap between the species and current fisheries remains, and while the method can show relative risk reduction, it cannot provide information on whether the risk is low enough to allow the recovery of depleted populations.

40|$|Two {{new species}} of Stenhelia (Copepoda, Harpacticoida, Diosaccidae) are {{described}} from subtidal sediments in the Bohai Sea, China. The traditional subgeneric division of Stenhelia is abandoned since both subgenera, Stenhelia(Stenhelia) and Stenhelia (Delavalia), are polyphyletic taxa. The latter is tentatively upgraded to generic rank pending a phylogenetic analysis of the Stenheliinae. The genus Stenhelia is restricted to {{a core group of}} species formerly allocated to the subgenus Stenhelia (Stenhelia), including S. gibba, S. proxima, S. curviseta, S. divergens, S. peniculata, S. pubescens and both new species from the Bohai Sea, S. sheni sp. nov. and S. taiae sp. nov., which are most closely related to S. pubescens, described from the Sea of Japan. The genus Beatricella, erroneously considered a junior objective synonym of Stenhelia, is reinstated to accommodate S. aemula as the type species. The problematic S. asetosa is transferred to a new genus Anisostenhelia primarily on account of the sexual dimorphism of the swimming legs and is regarded as the sistergroup of Stenhelia. The P 1 endopod of the bathyal S. diegensis is reinterpreted and consequently the species is re-assigned to the genus Delavalia where it is most closely related to <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> <b>species.</b> S. xylophila is designated as the type of a new genus Hicksia. Swimming leg morphology suggests a close relationship with Delavalia hanstromi and D. bocqueti, indicating at least a dual origin of the 2 -segmented P 1 endopod in the Stenheliinae...|$|E
5000|$|This fish {{lives in}} the great depths of the lake, below 80 m. It can reach up to a foot in length, about 30 cm. Salvelinus evasus has a blunt snout and the mouth in subinferior position. Its flanks are silvery to yellowish, often with paler spots. Unlike <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> char <b>species</b> its lower fins have white margins.|$|R
500|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of little {{economic}} value, the blackmouth catshark is caught incidentally {{in large numbers}} by commercial bottom trawl and longline fisheries. In particular, it {{is among the most}} commonly bycaught sharks in trawls targeting deepwater lobsters and shrimps (Nephrops norvegicus, , Aristeus antennatus, and Aristaeomorpha folicea), operating off Portugal and in the Mediterranean. Most captured sharks are discarded, probably with heavy mortality. Some fisheries, such as those off Portugal and Italy, retain and utilize a small subset of the largest individuals for human consumption fresh or dried and salted, and for leather; the fishing fleet of Viareggio, Tuscany reported landing [...] in 2005. In the northeastern Atlantic, this shark is being increasingly targeted by fishers following the decline of <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> shark <b>species.</b>|$|R
5|$|The false {{catshark}} is an infrequent bycatch of longlines {{and bottom}} trawls. It has minimal economic value, though its meat, fins, and liver oil may be utilized. In Okinawa, its oil is traditionally used {{to seal the}} hulls of wooden fishing boats. Like <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> sharks, this <b>species</b> {{is thought to be}} highly susceptible to overfishing due to its slow reproductive rate. However, it is rarely caught and there is no information available on its population. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Least Concern.|$|R
40|$|The study {{seeks to}} {{increase}} our knowledge on deepwater demersal fish assemblages and the biological adaptations of Antimora rostrata. This widespread deep-living demersal teleost is essentially used as an example species. Managing deepwater resources and communities is especially difficult since {{our knowledge of the}} community structure, ecology and biology of individual species is limited, and fishery independent information is scarce. In this account focus is directed towards the use of longlines in describing deepwater assemblages. New information on the biology of A. rostrata is presented, and experimental and alternative ageing methods are explored. The study was an element of MAR-ECO, a field project of the Census of Marine Life (www. coml. org), studying the diversity and biology of biota along the mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). As part of the 2004 MAR-ECO expedition to the mid-Atlantic Ridge, the chartered Norwegian fishing vessel M/S Loran deployed longline sets across the ridge axis, sampling a depth range of about 4000 m. Overall, chondrichthyans dominated the catches on the MAR and contributed nearly 60 % in terms of weight and numbers. Multivariate analysis (MDS) using species-by-station data indicated an assemblage distribution that related primarily to factors varying by depth and latitude. Grouping patterns of stations were not very pronounced, suggesting a gradual rather than abrupt change in species composition by depth or latitude. Catch rates peaked at the shallower stations in the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ), and generally decreased with depth. Relatively large individuals dominated, and the overall mean weight was 2. 4 kg. Average fish weight was higher in the sub-area sampled just north of the Azores archipelago than in the CGFZ sub-area. No depth-related pattern of individual fish size was found. The findings suggest that the use of longline is a valuable and possibly necessary tool for describing the larger scavenging fish assemblages on rough bottom at greater depths. Among the many different species caught frequently on longlines A. rostrata was analysed in more detail. Additional data from MAR, off Greenland and the British Isles were included, and used to exemplify adaptations of a deepwater species with respect to distribution and life history traits. Data on A. rostrata are presented from 42 °N on the MAR to 65 °N on the slope off West and East Greenland, along a northsouth range of approximately 1400 nm (~ 2600 km). The species occurred in the depth interval 670 - 3060 m in trawl and longline experiments sampling the depth range 400 - 4300 m. Length frequencies indicated both latitudinal and depth-related variation. Along the ridge abundance peaked between 1200 and 2700 m with generally low or no catches outside this range. Examination of growth patterns in transverse sections of otoliths suggested a strong cyclic zonation pattern in A. rostrata. Similarly, frequency distributions of fish length and otolith weight showed a number of modes, suggesting groups of specimens of similar size and age. Distances between modes were consistent and corresponded to what was expected based on the interpretation of the zonation pattern in otoliths. Assuming that the otolith growth zones counted represent annuli and that unbiased age readings was achieved, the growth of A. rostrata seemed linear with age for both otolith weight and fish length within the length range investigated. This corresponded to approximately 25 mg/y and 4 cm/y respectively. The oldest fish recorded was about 25 years old and sexual growth dimorphism, where females grow larger, older, and possibly faster, was suggested. The results indicate that more attention should be directed towards using frequency distributions, especially of otolith weight, for deriving information on age structure and population growth data for certain fish stocks. For A. rostrata, and many <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> <b>species,</b> greater efforts should be made to validate age determination methods...|$|E
50|$|The {{affinity}} of {{this species}} for native sulfur {{has yet to be}} explained. The morphology of S. thermophilus does not show any differences from <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> Symphurus <b>species</b> that would suggest adaptations to its unique habitat. However, S. thermophilus likely possesses extensive physiological and biochemical adaptations for coping with the harsh conditions around hydrothermal vents, such as temperature and pH fluctuations, and exposure to heavy metals. In particular, they must have high hemoglobin oxygen affinities and efficient respiratory systems to deal with the toxic hydrogen sulfide in venting fluid. S. thermophilus is also capable of tolerating pH as low as 2, akin to sulfuric acid, and can rest over pools of molten sulfur without harm. Individuals of S. thermophilus often show skeletal abnormalities such as undeveloped fin rays or fused bones, likely attributable to the vent environment.|$|R
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} commercial fisheries {{into the deep}} sea has raised concerns about the vulnerability of this and <b>other</b> <b>deepwater</b> shark <b>species</b> to overfishing, as these sharks have slow growth and reproductive rates. This is exemplified by the rapid stock depletion and collapse of the Azores kitefin shark fishery. This targeted fishery {{began in the early}} 1970s for the production of liver oil. In the early 1980s, the fishing fleet was enlarged with the addition of industrial vessels equipped with demersal gillnets, resulting in a fishery peak in 1984 of 937 tons landed. After 1991, kitefin shark catches declined precipitously to under 15 tons annually which, along with a drop in the global price of liver oil, led to the fishery becoming unprofitable {{by the end of the}} decade. A population assessment has suggested that the northeastern Atlantic stock had fallen to 50% of the pre-exploitation biomass.|$|R
