2500|$|Each {{of these}} {{material}} objects carries {{along with its}} stories or memories the ability for family members to experience simultaneity in the home. [...] "…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times {{of our lives and}} our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present." [...] The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> <b>and</b> the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item. [...] "The artifacts that family members make, use, or display can be an unseen backdrop to the duties and demands of family life. Alternatively, they might be carefully crafted statements about the values and expectations of family tradition bearers." [...] The candy bowl on the coffee table or the silver tea service set out in the dining room speak of an elegance of hospitality which is customary in this family.|$|E

6000|$|And {{then the}} crowd whooped, roared <b>and</b> rolled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> barrels, and roared and whooped again. They stamped and yelled, and ran around like fiends, kicking the boxes and banging the coal scuttle {{in a perfect}} pandemonium of mirth, leaving the old man {{standing}} there helpless in his wrath, mad enough to shoot. Steve was just preparing to seize the old man from behind, when Squire Gordon, struggling to his feet among the spittoons, cried out, {{in the voice of}} a colonel of Fourth of July militia: ...|$|R

60|$|The Jew, placing <b>the</b> candle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> {{drew back}} <b>the</b> heavy bolts and {{cautiously}} opened the door.

2500|$|Each night, 6000 wagons {{converged on}} Les Halles, {{carrying}} meat, seafood, produce, milk, eggs and {{other food products}} from the train stations. The wagons were unloaded by 481 men wearing large hats called les forts (the strong), who carried the food in baskets to the pavilions. Pavilion no. 3 was the hall for meat; no. 9 for seafood; no. 11 for birds and game. [...] Merchants in the pavilions rented their stalls for between one and three francs a day. During the night, fruits and vegetables also arrived at night by carts from farms and gardens around Paris; the farmers rented small spaces of one by two meters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk outside the pavilions to sell their produce. The meat was carved, the produce put out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sellers, called [...] "counter criers", were in place by 5 AM, when the market opened.|$|R
5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling <b>the</b> soft drinks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters</b> <b>and</b> floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|R

5000|$|Necessity as {{a defense}} to {{criminal}} acts conducted to meet political ends was rejected {{in the case of}} United States v. Schoon.

6000|$|Cranly did {{not answer}} or turn. He laid his book <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> passed out, his well-shod feet {{sounding}} flatly on the floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon repeated: ...|$|E
6000|$|Half an {{hour later}} the two girls entered the store and found the {{proprietor}} alone. Mary Louise made a slight purchase, as an excuse, and then Josie laid ten silver dollars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> <b>and</b> said carelessly: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. NASICON {{materials}} {{can be used}} as the solid electrolyte component in the sensor system, because they have excellent Na+ conductivity. This study prepares NASICON materials by solid state reaction method, and their phase, microstructure and electrical property will be characterized by XRD, SEM and EIS. Then an amperometric NO 2 sensor is fabricated to detect NO 2 gas in the level of ppb. The sensor current signal will be studied by changing different NO 2 concentrations, employing different materials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> electrode <b>and</b> using different applied voltages when the working temperature is 150 °C...|$|R
