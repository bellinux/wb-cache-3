25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for <b>our</b> <b>heads.</b> <b>And</b> what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
25|$|Kant then asks {{why we have}} {{to follow}} the {{principle}} of morality. He is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us {{from our point of view}} the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.|$|E

500|$|Baker {{ran against}} Patrick in an {{atmosphere}} of voter discontent, with a slow economy and high unemployment, which he used to his advantage during the campaign. Patrick, facing low approval ratings, criticized Baker {{for his role in the}} Big Dig financing plan, and for raising health premiums while head of Harvard Pilgrim. Despite an anti-incumbent mood among voters, Baker was defeated in the November 2 general election with 42 percent of the vote. Patrick was re-elected with 48 percent of the vote. [...] "We fought the good fight," [...] said Baker in his concession speech. [...] "We have no cause to hang <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> will be stronger for having fought this one." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{contributor}} to Bentley's Miscellany wrote in 1846: [...] "To those who never saw him, description is fruitless; {{to those who}} have, no praise comes up to their appreciation of him. We therefore shake <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> say 'Ah! You should have seen Grimaldi!'" [...] Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by [...] "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities." [...] The British dramatist James Planché worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi's death meant {{the end of a}} genre: [...] "Pantomime's best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!" ...|$|E
500|$|Ciaran {{has stated}} that the Super Furry Animals were [...] "very hands-on" [...] during {{the making of the}} DVD. Initially the band were mainly {{concerned}} with the sound quality, describing the presentation of the album's tracks in surround sound as [...] "radical, like the change from mono to stereo". The group directed the surround sound mix themselves, instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers: [...] "We want that one bit of sound to travel from the centre, over <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> finish on my right shoulder ... Let's have the main vocal in the middle, then each harmony in its own speaker." [...] They soon became equally as interested in the remixes, visuals and interactive elements however. Ciaran has described this process as [...] "not always a nice position to be in" [...] when, for example, they had to reject music videos they weren't happy with. The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album Guerrilla themselves. According to singer Gruff Rhys the band [...] "tended to go for illustrators who could [...] cheaply using Flash ... and artists who like to work". The directors were asked to make the visuals as [...] "extreme as possible" [...] in an effort to avoid making videos that looked like just [...] "another pop promo ... like MTV" [...] and, according to Ciaran, had to [...] "work even harder at creating something interesting" [...] due to the limited budget available. Many of those who made videos for the DVD release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a [...] "really fresh ... kind of scruffy" [...] end product. According to Rhys the band made separate music videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for the songs. Rhys {{has stated that}} the Super Furry Animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on the videos on Rings Around the World rather than concentrating on the music, as a result of which the band used [...] "really bland images" [...] on the DVD release of their next album Phantom Power.|$|E

500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
2500|$|Emily: [...] "The {{stakes were}} {{definitely}} higher on that song. We {{knew it was}} special {{because it was so}} autobiographical, and we had to get it right. We've all gone through so many emotions about the incident. We talked for days with Dan before putting pen to paper, and he really helped get inside <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> put these feelings out. And once we had this song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{journalist}} {{remained a}} figurehead, publishing appeals to calm and obedience, and leaving most administrative work to his second-in-command, Nandor Gingold, M. D.

2500|$|Healthy in Paranoid Times was {{met with}} mixed reviews. It was loved and hated by many critics who either called it the band's best work to date or their weakest. It was also called [...] "their most sonically mature album to date." [...] and their best album since Clumsy by Circle 6 Magazine. At the time, the band praised their own efforts on the album. Duncan Coutts said in an interview, [...] "I {{think this is the}} closest we've ever come to {{achieving}} what we heard in <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> got on (record). For us this is the most complete record, start to finish.

2500|$|The philosopher Michel Foucault, in his {{preface to}} Anti-Oedipus, {{writes that the}} book can best be read as an [...] "art", {{in the sense that}} is {{conveyed}} by the term [...] "erotic art." [...] Foucault sees the three [...] "adversaries" [...] of Anti-Oedipus as being the [...] "bureaucrats of the revolution", the [...] "poor technicians of desire" [...] (psychoanalysts and semiologists), and fascism, which Foucault calls [...] "the major enemy". Foucault uses the term [...] "fascism" [...] to refer [...] "not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini...but also the fascism in us all, in <b>our</b> <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us." [...] Foucault adds that Anti-Oedipus is [...] "a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time", and that this perhaps its popular success. Foucault suggests that the book could be called Introduction to the Non-Fascist Life. Foucault argues that putting the principles espoused in Anti-Oedipus into practice involves freeing political action from [...] "unitary and totalizing paranoia" [...] and withdrawing allegiance [...] "from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality." [...] The psychiatrist David Cooper calls Anti-Oedipus, [...] "a magnificent vision of madness as a revolutionary force", crediting its authors with using [...] "the psychoanalytic language and the discourse of Saussure (and his successors), linguistics against itself in what is already proving to be an historic act of depassment." [...] The critic Frederick Crews writes that when Deleuze and Guattari [...] "indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder" [...] and [...] "pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society" [...] in Anti-Oedipus, their [...] "demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable" [...] and [...] "devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris." ...|$|E
