5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt Lake and Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated with the Union Pacific Railroad). The TRAX tracks north of the station follow the old route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake and Utah, while the tracks south of the area follow those used by Union Pacific. The electrified spur track visible to the northwest of the current station is the northern continuation of the original Union Pacific mainline; only a few traces of the southern continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake and Utah line (which headed due southwest to the vicinity of UTA's Redwood Junction station before turning south) remain.|$|E
