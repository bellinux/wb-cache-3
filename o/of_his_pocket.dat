5|$|Between 1794 and 1795, in the {{aftermath}} of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10hours of 100minutes each. The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified the dial <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> watch to decimal time. A clock in the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread. Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult for writers to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
25|$|By 1772, Arnold had {{finalized}} {{the design}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> timekeepers and started series production with a standardized movement caliper, this being around 50mm in diameter, {{larger than a}} conventional watch of the period, and showing seconds with a pivoted detent escapement and spiral compensation curb. However, the latter appears to have proved ineffective, {{which seems to have}} substantially slowed the rate of production.|$|E

25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E

Webb also had a muesli bar with him, which he offered to cut in half and share with Russell. The men initially agreed to wait 24 hours to eat it, but they continually extended the time, until they decided to eat it on 29 April. They then ate small pieces of the bar at a time, to make it {{last as long as}} possible. However, Russell later lost a large portion of his half of the bar when it fell out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yamazaki {{was raised}} in Okinawa, growing up on the streets alone {{fighting}} against sailors during his teenage years, then as an enforcer for a criminal mob. In contrast {{with most of the}} other fighters in combat video games, Yamazaki does not use any particular martial art - he is a self-taught brawler, and uses a wide variety of attacks in his fighting, including unfair and dishonest moves such as kicking sand in his opponent's eyes, and his ever-present knife. He also rarely takes his right hand out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> unless he is using his knife. In order to adapt him to KOF, the game planner had to provide new moves to Yamazaki. The new moves were initially noted to be failures, but designers later thought of them as successful. Yamazaki is a very sadistic person who enjoys violence as well as injuring people and making them bleed. However, he normally hides this madness with a calmer and more confident personality which he has when he is not fighting. As a criminal, Yamazaki started a rivalry with the Hong Kong detective Hon Fu, who becomes determined to arrest Yamazaki, while Yamazaki continually evades him.|$|E

25|$|The most {{well-known}} of his literary jabs at Boulstred is his “Epigram on the Court Pucell,” which many critics call a “disturbingly ‘personal’ {{attack on a}} woman.” Jonson supposedly wrote this poem {{as a response to}} a criticism Boulstred made of his play draft Epicoene: the Silent Woman. He claimed that his epigram was stolen out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> when he was drunk and given to Boulstred, which he had not wanted to happen. Regarding the title of the poem, “pucell” was the early modern term for prostitute, so Jonson seems to be calling Boulstred a prostitute in this poem. He also accuses Boulstred of being promiscuous, bisexual, pretentious, hypocritical, and much more. His accusation of bisexuality stems from her close relationship with Lucy Russell, the countess of Bedford. However, another reading of the poem is that rather than a direct criticism of Boulstred, the work was meant to be one of a “generic court pucelle, and by that means, an image of the false world.” Yet another reading is that the poem is a representation of Jonson’s frustration with having to rely on a woman, like the countess of Bedford, for literary success. Lucy Russell was the matron of many writers, such as John Donne, and Jonson attempted to gain her matronage for many years. Jonson may have been frustrated by this apparent “inversion of traditional gender codes,” so he used the “trope of prostitution” in this poem to reassert his position of power as a male.|$|E

500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E

Burke would refuse money from Fitzwilliam again on 21 November. Fitzwilliam continued his friendship with Fox but his opinions were moving more in Burke's direction.

A fire in the pits at the TT Grandstand followed which was extinguished by pit-attendants and Stanley Woods using an overcoat. Further problems occurred at Braddan Bridge when Stanley Woods had to stop to re-place an exhaust valve after the inlet push-rod had broken.

2500|$|Ray Lamphere {{was arrested}} on May 22, 1908, and tried for murder and arson. He denied the charges. His defense hinged on the {{assertion}} that the body was not Gunness'. Lamphere's lawyer, Wirt Worden, developed evidence that contradicted Norton's identification of the teeth and bridgework. A local jeweler testified that, though the gold in the bridgework had emerged from the fire almost undamaged, the fierce heat of the conflagration had melted the gold plating on several watches and items of gold jewelry. Local doctors replicated {{the conditions of the}} fire by attaching a similar piece of dental bridgework to a human jawbone and placing it in a blacksmith’s forge. The real teeth crumbled and disintegrated; the porcelain teeth came out pocked and pitted, with the gold parts rather melted (both the artificial elements were damaged to a greater degree than those in the bridgework offered as evidence of Gunness' identity). The hired hand Joe Maxson and another man also testified that they’d seen [...] "Klondike" [...] Schultz take the bridgework out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> and plant it just before it was [...] "discovered." [...] Lamphere was found guilty of arson, but acquitted of murder. On November 26, 1908, he was sentenced to 20 years in the State Prison (in Michigan City).
