25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} for social anxiety disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with medications recommended only in {{those who are not}} interested in therapy. CBT is effective in treating social phobia, whether delivered individually or in a group setting. The cognitive and behavioral components seek to change thought patterns and physical reactions to anxiety-inducing situations. The attention given to social anxiety disorder has significantly increased since 1999 with the approval and marketing of drugs for its treatment. Prescribed medications include several classes of antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Other commonly used medications include beta blockers and benzodiazepines. It is the most common anxiety disorder with up to 10% <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>being</b> affected {{at some point in their}} life.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, about 53% of the {{population}} were Swiss Reformed, while almost 40% were Roman Catholic. Since then both large Swiss churches, the Roman Catholic Church and Swiss Reformed Church, have been constantly losing members, though for the Catholic Church the decrease started 20 years later in around 1990. Nevertheless, for {{the last twenty years}} both confessions have been reduced by 10% to the current figures (census 2010): 30% Roman Catholic and 26% Swiss Reformed (organized in Evangelical Reformed Church of the Canton of Zürich). In 1970, only 2% of Zürich's inhabitants claimed to be not affiliated with any religious confession. In accordance with the loss by the large Swiss churches, the number of people declaring themselves as non-affiliated rose to 17% in the year 2000. In the last ten years, this figure rose to more than 25%. For the group <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> <b>being</b> between 24 and 44 years old, this is as high as one in every third person.|$|E

Ukrainian and Belarusian legends are more [...] "conventional", although in Ukraine the vampires may sometimes not be described as dead at all, or may be seen as engaging in vampirism long before death. Ukrainian folklore also described vampires as having red faces and tiny tails.

500|$|Henry II, king of England from 1154 to 1189, granted {{land for}} the {{construction}} of All Hallows' Church to the monks of St. Denys Priory during his reign. [...] The original church, located {{on the corner of the}} High Street and East Street, a short distance south of the Bargatehad a chancel and nave with north aisle, and a tower in three stages at its western end. The parish registers date from 1653. The Great Ejection of 1662 led to a number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>being</b> ejected from All Hallows, and these went on to form what would become Above Bar Church and Avenue St Andrew's United Reformed Church. Among their number was the rector of the church at the time, Nathaniel Robinson. The church had five bells, but three of them were stolen one night in September 1682 and never found, despite an award being offered by the Mayor of Southampton, John Speed, in the London Gazette.|$|E
500|$|Join Hands {{was written}} {{over a period}} of six months. In 1979, the band watched news reports from Iran, {{including}} scenes of repression and curfews; {{it was one of the}} first times they had seen images <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>being</b> shot and killed on television. In England, the political situation was also unstable, with rubbish piling up in the streets of London. Siouxsie Sioux saw it as [...] "a real time, everything in flocks and uncertain but also festering underneath, and because this stuff from the past that was just left there rotting there and it needed to be acknowledged and then cleaned up, not just swept away still rotting". The band were inspired by these events. The theme of war emerged through the songs: rather than a pro-military message, the lyrics were meant to capture the spirit of what things were like at the time. Miranda Sawyer stated that Join Hands took [...] "the very un-rock'n'roll topic of World War I as its inspiration".|$|E
500|$|McIntee praises Alien as [...] "possibly the {{definitive}} combination of horror thriller with science fiction trappings." [...] He notes, however, {{that it is}} a horror film first and a science fiction film second, since science fiction normally explores issues of how humanity will develop under other circumstances. Alien, on the other hand, focuses on the plight <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>being</b> attacked by a monster: [...] "It's set on a spaceship in the future, but it's about people trying not to get eaten by a drooling monstrous animal. Worse, it's about them trying not to get raped by said drooling monstrous animal." [...] Along with Halloween and Friday the 13th (1980), he describes it as a prototype for the slasher film genre: [...] "The reason it's such a good movie, and wowed both the critics, who normally frown on the genre, and the casual cinema-goer, is {{that it is a}} distillation of everything that scares us in the movies." [...] He also describes how the film appeals to a variety of audiences: [...] "Fans of Hitchcockian thrillers like it because it's moody and dark. Gorehounds like it for the chest-burster. Science fiction fans love the hard science fiction trappings and hardware. Men love the battle-for-survival element, and women love not being cast as the helpless victim." ...|$|E
