25|$|Input {{and output}} {{impedances}} of a negative-feedback amplifier (closed-loop amplifier) become {{sensitive to the}} gain of an amplifier without feedback (<b>open-loop</b> amplifier)—that exposes these impedances to variations in the <b>open-loop</b> gain, for example, due to parameter variations or nonlinearity of the <b>open-loop</b> gain.|$|E
25|$|In some systems, {{closed-loop}} and <b>open-loop</b> {{control are}} used simultaneously. In such systems, the <b>open-loop</b> control is termed feedforward and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.|$|E
25|$|The <b>open-loop</b> {{amplifier}} decides settling time. It {{sets the}} time scale of Figure 3, and {{the faster the}} <b>open-loop</b> amplifier, the faster this time scale.|$|E
25|$|Finite gain: <b>Open-loop</b> gain is {{infinite}} in {{the ideal}} operational amplifier but finite in real operational amplifiers. Typical devices exhibit <b>open-loop</b> DC gain ranging from 100,000 to over 1 million. So {{long as the}} loop gain (i.e., the product of <b>open-loop</b> and feedback gains) is very large, the circuit gain will be determined entirely {{by the amount of}} negative feedback (i.e., it will be independent of <b>open-loop</b> gain). In cases where closed-loop gain must be very high, the feedback gain will be very low, and the low feedback gain causes low loop gain; in these cases, the operational amplifier will cease to behave ideally.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} {{the limitations of}} the <b>open-loop</b> controller, control theory introduces feedback.|$|E
25|$|In {{the typical}} 741 op amp, the {{common-mode}} rejection ratio is 90dB, implying an <b>open-loop</b> common-mode voltage gain of about 6.|$|E
25|$|Another typical {{specification}} is {{the rejection}} of a step disturbance; including an integrator in the <b>open-loop</b> chain (i.e. directly before the system under control) easily achieves this. Other classes of disturbances need different types of sub-systems to be included.|$|E
25|$|In {{negative}} feedback systems, the dominant closed-loop response is often well-modeled by a second-order system. The phase {{margin of the}} <b>open-loop</b> system sets the quality factor Q of the closed-loop system; as the phase margin decreases, the approximate second-order closed-loop system is made more oscillatory (i.e., has a higher quality factor).|$|E
25|$|Below, {{the voltage}} gain of the {{amplifier}} with feedback, the closed-loop gain AFB, is derived {{in terms of}} the gain of the amplifier without feedback, the <b>open-loop</b> gain AOL and the feedback factor β, which governs how much of the output signal is applied to the input (see Figure 1). The <b>open-loop</b> gain AOL in general may be a function of both frequency and voltage; the feedback parameter β is determined by the feedback network that is connected around the amplifier. For an operational amplifier, two resistors forming a voltage divider may be used for the feedback network to set β between 0 and 1. This network may be modified using reactive elements like capacitors or inductors to (a) give frequency-dependent closed-loop gain as in equalization/tone-control circuits or (b) construct oscillators. The gain of the amplifier with feedback is derived below {{in the case of a}} voltage amplifier with voltage feedback.|$|E
25|$|By 2000 {{the group}} succeeded in {{building}} a BCI that reproduced owl monkey movements while the monkey operated a joystick or reached for food. The BCI operated in real time and could also control a separate robot remotely over Internet protocol. But the monkeys {{could not see the}} arm moving and did not receive any feedback, a so-called <b>open-loop</b> BCI.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} damping of the {{response}} is set by ρ, that is, by the time constants of the <b>open-loop</b> amplifier. In contrast, the frequency of oscillation is set by μ, that is, by the feedback parameter through βA0. Because ρ is a sum of reciprocals of time constants, {{it is interesting to}} notice that ρ is dominated by the shorter of the two.|$|E
25|$|For MIMO systems, pole {{placement}} can {{be performed}} mathematically using a state space representation of the <b>open-loop</b> system and calculating a feedback matrix assigning poles in the desired positions. In complicated systems this can require computer-assisted calculation capabilities, and cannot always ensure robustness. Furthermore, all system states are not in general measured and so observers must be included and incorporated in pole placement design.|$|E
25|$|Without {{negative}} feedback, {{and perhaps}} with positive feedback for regeneration, an op-amp {{acts as a}} comparator. If the inverting input is held at ground (0V) directly or by a resistor Rg, and the input voltage Vin applied to the non-inverting input is positive, the output will be maximum positive; if Vin is negative, the output will be maximum negative. Since there is no feedback from the output to either input, this is an <b>open-loop</b> circuit acting as a comparator.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the wide}} slew range and lack of {{positive}} feedback, the response of all the <b>open-loop</b> level detectors described above will be relatively slow. External overall positive feedback may be applied, but (unlike internal positive feedback that may be applied within the latter stages of a purpose-designed comparator) this markedly affects {{the accuracy of the}} zero-crossing detection point. Using a general-purpose op-amp, for example, the frequency of Ei for the sine to square wave converter should probably be below 100Hz.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>open-loop</b> gain {{has several}} poles, {{rather than the}} single pole of the above example, {{feedback}} can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its step response. In the case {{of more than two}} poles, the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate. See the discussion of gain margin and phase margin. For a complete discussion, see Sansen.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{amplifiers}} use {{current or}} voltage as input and output, so {{four types of}} amplifier are possible (any of two possible inputs with any of two possible outputs). See classification of amplifiers. The objective for the feedback amplifier may be {{any one of the}} four types of amplifier and is not necessarily the same type as the <b>open-loop</b> amplifier, which itself may be any one of these types. So, for example, an op amp (voltage amplifier) can be arranged to make a current amplifier instead.|$|E
25|$|The input {{impedance}} of the simplified non-inverting amplifier is high, of order Rdif × AOL times the closed-loop gain, where Rdif is the op amp's {{input impedance}} to differential signals, and AOL is the <b>open-loop</b> voltage gain of the op amp; {{in the case}} of the ideal op amp, with AOL infinite and Rdif infinite, the input impedance is infinite. In this case, though, the circuit will be susceptible to input bias current drift because of the mismatch between the impedances driving the V+ and V− op amp inputs.|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or <b>open-loop)</b> control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E
25|$|At {{times of}} low {{electrical}} demand, excess generation capacity {{is used to}} pump water into the upper reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating electricity. Reversible turbine/generator assemblies act as a combined pump and turbine generator unit (usually a Francis turbine design). In <b>open-loop</b> systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows, while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river. Plants that do not use pumped-storage {{are referred to as}} conventional hydroelectric plants; conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage by deferring output until needed.|$|E
25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined <b>open-loop</b> feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E
2500|$|Feedback {{controls}} the amplitude of oscillation about final value {{for a given}} <b>open-loop</b> amplifier and given values of <b>open-loop</b> time constants, [...] τ1 and τ2.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} that the <b>open-loop</b> gain has two poles (two time constants, τ1, τ2), the step {{response}} is a bit more complicated. The <b>open-loop</b> gain is given by: ...|$|E
2500|$|Closed-loop {{controllers}} {{have the}} following advantages over <b>open-loop</b> controllers: ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{the system}} is {{originally}} <b>open-loop</b> unstable, feedback is necessary to stabilize the system. [...] Right-half-plane (RHP) poles represent that instability. [...] For closed-loop stability of a system, the number of closed-loop roots in the right half of the s-plane must be zero. Hence, the number of counter-clockwise encirclements about [...] must be equal {{to the number of}} <b>open-loop</b> poles in the RHP. [...] Any clockwise encirclements of the critical point by the <b>open-loop</b> frequency response (when judged from low frequency to high frequency) would indicate that the feedback control system would be destabilizing if the loop were closed. [...] (Using RHP zeros to [...] "cancel out" [...] RHP poles does not remove the instability, but rather ensures that the system will remain unstable even in the presence of feedback, since the closed-loop roots travel between <b>open-loop</b> poles and zeros in the presence of feedback. In fact, the RHP zero can make the unstable pole unobservable and therefore not stabilizable through feedback.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{have large}} <b>open-loop</b> signal gain (voltage gain of 200,000 is {{obtained}} in early integrated circuit exemplars), and ...|$|E
2500|$|If the <b>open-loop</b> {{transfer}} function [...] has a zero pole of multiplicity , then the Nyquist plot has a discontinuity at [...] During further analysis {{it should be}} assumed that the phasor travels [...] times clock-wise along a semicircle of infinite radius. After applying this rule, the zero poles should be neglected, i.e. {{if there are no}} other unstable poles, then the <b>open-loop</b> {{transfer function}} [...] should be considered stable.|$|E
2500|$|... where AOL = <b>open-loop</b> gain, AFB = {{closed-loop}} gain (the gain {{with negative}} feedback present) and β = feedback factor.|$|E
2500|$|If the <b>open-loop</b> {{transfer}} function [...] is stable, then the closed-loop system is unstable for any encirclement {{of the point}} -1.|$|E
2500|$|The net <b>open-loop</b> small-signal {{voltage gain}} of the op amp {{involves}} {{the product of}} the current gain hfe of some 4 transistors.|$|E
2500|$|A control {{problem can}} have several specifications. Stability, of course, is always present. The {{controller}} {{must ensure that}} the closed-loop system is stable, regardless of the <b>open-loop</b> stability. A poor choice of controller can even worsen {{the stability of the}} <b>open-loop</b> system, which must normally be avoided. Sometimes it would be desired to obtain particular dynamics in the closed loop: i.e. that the poles have , where [...] is a fixed value strictly greater than zero, instead of simply asking that [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{dependence}} of settling time upon μ is not obvious, and the approximation of a two-pole system probably is not accurate {{enough to make}} any real-world conclusions about feedback {{dependence of}} settling time. However, the asymptotes [...] and [...] clearly impact settling time, and they are controlled by the time constants of the <b>open-loop</b> amplifier, particularly the shorter of the two time constants. That suggests that a specification on settling time must be met by appropriate design of the <b>open-loop</b> amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|First the loaded <b>open-loop</b> gain is found. The {{feedback}} {{is turned off}} by setting g12 = g21 = 0. The idea is to find how much the amplifier gain is changed because of the resistors in the feedback network by themselves, with the feedback turned off. This calculation is pretty easy because R11, RB, and rπ1 all are in parallel and v1 = vπ. Let R1 = R11 // RB // rπ1. In addition, i2 = −(β+1) iB. The result for the <b>open-loop</b> current gain AOL is: ...|$|E
2500|$|... where AOL is the <b>open-loop</b> gain of the {{amplifier}} (the term [...] "open-loop" [...] {{refers to}} the absence of a feedback loop from the output to the input).|$|E
2500|$|In many cases, {{the forward}} {{amplifier}} can be sufficiently well modeled {{in terms of}} a single dominant pole of time constant τ, that it, as an <b>open-loop</b> gain given by: ...|$|E
