5|$|If Gage did not dip {{his hand}} {{unnecessarily}} {{in the public}} till, he did engage in the relatively common practices of nepotism and political favouritism.

5|$|After resigning the {{presidency}} of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become {{the president of a}} mining company, Clark & Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark's partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark's reputation, his own finances and the fortunes of many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.|$|E

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next in line to the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|Count Zrinski {{found himself}} besieged by a hostile army {{of at least}} 150,000 {{soldiers}} with powerful artillery. Zrinski had assembled a force of around 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers prior to the siege. These consisted of his personal forces and those <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> allies. The majority of the defenders were Croatian, with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the men-at-arms and the leadership.|$|E

Campbell was cast as Ash Williams, the main character. To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put an ad in The Detroit News. Betsy Baker {{was one of the}} actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast. The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.|$|E

Gregg was sentenced to death for these crimes, but following his sentence, he escaped to Greene County, Pennsylvania to the company <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> supporters, as the Gregg family was prominent in the region.|$|E
5|$|During Edward's reign, Stigand was an {{influential}} advisor at court {{and used his}} position to increase his own wealth {{as well as that}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family. Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in Domesday Book, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{the tour}} company R.K. Swan invited Wheeler to provide lectures on the {{archaeology}} of ancient Greece aboard their Hellenic cruise line, {{which he did}} in 1955. In 1957, he then gave {{a guided tour of}} the archaeology of the Indian subcontinent for the rival tour company Fairways and Swinford. After Swans appointed him to the position of chairman of their Hellenic Cruise division, he made two fortnight tours a year, in spring and summer. In late 1969 he conducted the Swans tour to the Indian subcontinent, visiting the south and east of the republic as well as Ceylon. During this period, Wheeler had kept in contact with many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> colleagues in India and Pakistan, helping to secure them work and funding where possible.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Corder {{left the}} house, Maria {{set out to}} meet him at the Red Barn which was {{situated}} on Barnfield Hill, about half a mile from the Martens' cottage. This was the last time that she was seen alive. Corder also disappeared, but later turned up and claimed that Marten was in Ipswich, Great Yarmouth, or some other place nearby, and that he could not yet bring her back as his wife for fear of provoking the anger <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> relatives. The pressure on Corder to produce his wife eventually forced him to leave the area. He wrote letters to Marten's family claiming that they were married and living on the Isle of Wight, and he gave various excuses for her lack of communication: she was unwell, she had hurt her hand, or the letter must have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{he finally}} sailed into Piraeus where {{the crowd had}} gathered, {{desiring}} to see the famous Alcibiades. He entered the harbor full of fear till he saw his cousin and others <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> acquaintance, who invited him to land. Upon arriving on shore he was greeted with a hero's welcome. Nevertheless, some saw an evil omen {{in the fact that}} he had returned to Athens on the very day when the ceremony of the Plynteria (the feast where the old statue of Athena would get cleansed) was being celebrated. This was regarded as the unluckiest day of the year to undertake anything of importance. His enemies took note of this and kept it in mind for a future occasion.|$|E

5|$|Although Etty painted {{many private}} portraits <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> acquaintances, he {{produced}} very few publicly exhibited portraits, fewer than 30 {{of which were}} shown during his lifetime. Portraiture {{was seen as a}} vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century, and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class. Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, critics generally disliked his portraits, preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did, however, serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite, boosting his status and leading to further commissions. Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices. Charlotte Williams-Wynn became a noted letter writer and diarist; Mary Williams-Wynn married Member of Parliament James Milnes Gaskell. Both Charlotte and Mary died in April 1869.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa suggest Homer have a go at voice acting {{when they}} read {{that there will be}} open auditions. Homer auditions to read for Poochie's voice, and gets the part. He and June Bellamy, his fellow voice actor, make several {{publicity}} stops to promote Poochie, where Homer confronts the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show. However, the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics, and by emphasizing Poochie, contains none of the show's trademark violence. Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive. Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie's debut was a dud, and he decides {{to get rid of the}} character. Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off, and resolves to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than reading from the script, he implores the audience, through lines that he wrote, to give Poochie a fair chance. The writing team appears moved by Homer's statement. However, on airing, his statement is dubbed over by Myers and Poochie is killed off in a poorly edited fashion. The in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the affair to the nature of show business.|$|E
5|$|By 1823 Cofresí was {{probably}} on {{the crew of the}} corsair barquentine El Scipión, captained by José Ramón Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayagüez, José María Ramírez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. El Scipión employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofresí turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Orígenes portorriqueños Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí's time aboard El Scipión, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Ursula Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofresí into piracy.|$|E

5|$|Nelson gave chase, {{but after}} {{arriving}} in the Caribbean, spent June in a fruitless search for the fleet. Villeneuve had briefly cruised around the islands before heading back to Europe, in contravention of Napoleon's orders. The returning French fleet was intercepted by a British fleet under Sir Robert Calder and engaged in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, but managed to reach Ferrol with only minor losses. Nelson returned to Gibraltar {{at the end of}} July, and travelled from there to England, dismayed at his failure to bring the French to battle and expecting to be censured. To his surprise he was given a rapturous reception from crowds who had gathered to view his arrival, while senior British officials congratulated him for sustaining the close pursuit and credited him with saving the West Indies from a French invasion. Nelson stayed briefly in London, where he was cheered wherever he went, before visiting Merton to see Emma, arriving in late August. He entertained a number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> relations there over the coming month, and began plans for a grand engagement with the enemy fleet, one that would surprise his foes by forcing a pell-mell battle on them.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of the Pravda editorials coincided with the composition of Shostakovich's Fourth Symphony. The work marked a great shift in style for the composer, owing to the substantial influence of Gustav Mahler {{and a number of}} Western-style elements. The symphony gave Shostakovich compositional trouble, as he attempted to reform his style into a new idiom. The composer was well into the work when the fatal articles appeared. Despite this, Shostakovich continued to compose the symphony and planned a premiere at the end of 1936. Rehearsals began that December, but after a number of rehearsals Shostakovich, for reasons still debated today, decided to withdraw the symphony from the public. A number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> colleagues, such as Isaak Glikman, have suggested that it was in fact an official ban which Shostakovich was persuaded to present as a voluntary withdrawal. Whatever the case, it seems possible that this action saved the composer's life: during this time Shostakovich feared for himself and his family. Yet Shostakovich did not repudiate the work; it retained its designation as his Fourth Symphony. A piano reduction was published in 1946, and the work was finally premiered in 1961, well after Stalin's death.|$|E
5|$|Árbenz's role {{as defense}} {{minister}} {{had already made}} him a strong candidate for the presidency, and his firm support of the government during the 1949 uprising further increased his prestige. In 1950 the economically moderate Partido de Integridad Nacional (PIN) announced that Árbenz would be its presidential candidate in the upcoming election. The announcement was quickly followed by endorsements from most parties on the left, including the influential PAR, {{as well as from}} labor unions. Árbenz carefully chose the PIN as the party to nominate him. Based on the advice <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>friends</b> <b>and</b> colleagues, he believed it would make his candidacy appear more moderate. Árbenz himself resigned his position as Defense Minister on February 20 and declared his candidacy for the presidency. Arévalo wrote him an enthusiastic personal letter in response but publicly only reluctantly endorsed him, preferring, it is thought, his friend Víctor Manuel Giordani, who was then Health Minister. It was only the support Árbenz had, and the impossibility of Giordani being elected, that led to Arévalo deciding to support Árbenz.|$|E
