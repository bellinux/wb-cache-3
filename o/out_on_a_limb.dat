Mills ended their relationship five days before their planned wedding day, later telling friends in the media that she had called the wedding off because Terrill was gay, an MI6 agent, and that his mission was to sabotage her anti-landmine work. Terrill had once told Mills that he had been interviewed by the intelligence services when he was thinking of a career with the Foreign Office, but later said, [...] "I soon realised that Heather [...] had a somewhat elastic relationship with the truth, which she was able to stretch impressively sometimes". Terrill also claims that although Mills said she was a vegetarian at the time, she often cooked her speciality dish, Lancashire hotpot, which contains lamb, for him; and her former sister-in-law, Dianna Karmal, claims that Mills became a vegetarian after meeting McCartney.|$|E

40|$|The amazing {{world of}} natural history made its first impact on me during World War I 1 on the {{tropical}} island of Barbados. My Scottish father had become manager of the British Union Oil Company there. a srnall outfit that evplorcd {{for oil and gas}} on the island and refined crude oil from Venezuela. I had arrived in Barbados in Api-il of 1939, and with the outbreak of war and appearance of German U-boats in the region, my family became trapped <b>on</b> the island. <b>As</b> a result. I spent seven of my foi-mative years in a house in the tropics that had a golf cousse at the back and the emerald Caribbean Sea a short distance in front. This is where i t all began. The golf course became my hunting ground for butterflies and bird and reptile eggs. What a challenge i t was to try to net those elusive butterflies or reach <b>a</b> nest way <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> thin <b>limb.</b> Molluscs were also highly sought after. Sunrise Tellins (Tellirm radiata), which we called "auroras " because of their radiating colors, were a special prize. To capture them, I had to pump holes in the shallow back-reef sand with my feet until I could feel one of these slippery bivalves and dive i t up. When slit open and spread out to dry, they resembled butterflies. About the time I started school, I met the "ultimate collector, " Dr Alfred Senn. the British Union Oil Company's geologist. I used to spend hours after school watching him picking microfossils- mostly foraminifera, I think- out of samples and filing them in endless rows of small vials. This was the Iife for me: 1 decided then and there to become an oil company geologist. When the war ended, my father, convinced that an 1 1 -year old who was spending all his spare time in trees or in the sea was simply not taking life seriously enough, decided to ship me off to boarding school in Scotland. There I was expected to develop character and apply myself to more serious studies. So in 1946, still set <b>on</b> becoming <b>an</b> oil company geologist, I headed for the land of chilblains. After completing my secondary education, I turned my gaze to the New World because of the expanding opportunities for work in oil companies there.

60|$|There {{were not}} many wild berries {{in the country}} near the Boy's Town, or what seemed near; but {{sometimes}} my boy's father took him a great way off to a region, long lost from the map, where there were blackberries. The swimming lasted so late into September, however, that the boys began to go for nuts {{almost as soon as}} they left off going into the water. They began with the little acorns that they called chinquepins, and that were such a pretty black, streaked upward from the cup with yellow, that they gathered them half for the unconscious pleasure of their beauty. They were rather bitter, and they puckered your mouth; but still you ate them. They were easy to knock off the low oaks where they grew, and they were so plentiful that you could get a peck of them in no time. There was no need of anybody's climbing a tree to shake them; but one day the boys got to telling what they would do if a bear came, and one of them climbed a chinquepin-tree to show how he would get <b>out</b> <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> small <b>limb</b> that the bear would be afraid to follow him; and he went so far <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the limb that it broke under him. Perhaps he was heavier than he would have been if he had not been carrying the load of guilt which must burden a boy who is playing hookey. At any rate, he fell to the ground, and lay there helpless while the other boys gathered round him, and shared all the alarm he felt for his life. His despair of now hiding {{the fact that he had}} been playing hookey was his own affair, but they reasoned with him that the offence would be overlooked in the anxiety which his disaster must arouse. He was prepared to make the most of this, and his groans grew louder as he drew near home in the arms of the boys who took turns, two and two, in carrying him the whole long way from Dayton Lane, with a terrified procession of alternates behind them. These all ran as soon as they came in sight of his house and left the last pair to deliver him to his mother. They never knew whether she forgave him fully, or merely waited till he got well. You never could tell how a boy's mother was going to act in any given case; mothers were so very apt to act differently.|$|R

500|$|In March 1955, St. Laurent tabled {{legislation}} {{to make the}} Department of Defence Production permanent. This would also extend the extraordinary powers of the Minister. [...] Fearful of another damaging confrontation between Howe and the Opposition, the Cabinet agreed that St. Laurent would guide the bill through, but after {{the first day of}} debate St. Laurent, who was prone to depression, absented himself. Tory frontbencher Donald Fleming contended that the extension could make the minister [...] "the virtual dictator of the economy". [...] With St. Laurent absent (or when present, silent), Howe took charge of the bill, and according to his biographers, Robert Bothwell and William Kilbourn, [...] "utterly failed to perceive that the bill and his manner of defending it were a godsend to the opposition". When Howe alluded to the Avro Arrow project and that he [...] "was <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> for $30 million", which gave him [...] "the shudders", the Opposition met the statement with jeers and cries of [...] "What's a million?" [...] The Tories were supported by the Social Credit MPs, while the Government gained the support of the CCF on this issue. [...] Interrupted by a lengthy governmental trip by Howe to Australia and New Zealand, the debate stretched on until midyear. In early July, Howe left town for a long weekend, after asking St. Laurent and Minister of Finance Walter Harris to maintain his stand while he was gone, although he gave Harris the authority to do as he saw fit. Without informing Howe, St. Laurent contacted Drew, and the two men agreed that the minister's powers would expire in 1959 unless sooner renewed. The amended bill passed the Commons in Howe's absence, and when he returned, he furiously accused Harris of making a deal behind his back. However, when Howe was told that it had been the Prime Minister's decision, he accepted it. [...] Howe had earlier turned down an Opposition offer to agree to a three-year extension of his ministerial powers, saying [...] "That would mean coming back to Parliament in three years, and I've more to do with my time than amusing Parliament."

[...] He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining.

[...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', but I found myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some very thoughtful, mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "It’s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things and going <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limb</b> even at episode No. 150."
