5|$|A {{study in}} 1971–72 found that {{although}} Cleveland's crime rate {{was significantly lower}} than other large urban areas, most Cleveland residents feared crime. In the 1980s, gang activity was on the rise, associated with crack cocaine. A task force was formed and was partially successful at reducing gang activity by a combination <b>of</b> <b>removing</b> gang-related graffiti and educating news sources to not name gangs in news reporting.|$|E

5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost <b>of</b> <b>removing</b> the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E

5|$|Biman's {{handling}} of Hajj flights {{has also been}} beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high. In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step <b>of</b> <b>removing</b> the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights {{to cope with the}} backlog of passengers.|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result <b>of</b> <b>removing</b> half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} if the number <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> lymph nodes in radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy (RHL) influences survival of patients with early stage cervical cancer and to analyze the relation of different factors like patient age, tumour size and infiltration depth {{with the number of}} nodes examined in node-negative early stage cervical cancer patients. METHODS: Of consecutive patients, who underwent RHL between January 1984 and April 2005, 331 had negative nodes (group A) without adjuvant therapy and 136 had positive nodes (group B). The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to detect statistical significance. Factors associated with excision of nodes were confirmed with linear regression models. RESULTS: The median number <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> nodes was 19 and 18 for group A and group B, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the number <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> nodes and the cancer specific survival (CSS) or disease free survival (DSF) for patients of group A (p= 0. 625 and p= 0. 877, respectively). The number <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> nodes in group B was not significantly associated with the CSS (p= 0. 084) but it was for the DSF (p= 0. 014). Factors like patient age, tumour size and infiltration depth were not associated with the number of nodes. CONCLUSIONS: No relation was found between the number of negative nodes examined after RHL for the treatment of early stage cervical cancer and CSS or DFS. However, a higher amount <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> lymph nodes leaded to a better DFS for patients with positive nodes. It is suggested that patients with positive nodes benefit from a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy and a sufficient yield <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> node...|$|R

5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} <b>of</b> <b>removing</b> salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use {{large quantities of}} energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E

5|$|Game critics praised Giants for {{state-of-the-art}} graphics, humorous story, {{and success}} in blending in one genre with another. Criticisms of the game centered on crippling software bugs and lack of an in-game save feature.

Giants sold poorly initially for both Windows and PlayStation2; however, it sold well afterwards and the game has gained a cult following.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} the predictability of phosphorus removal based on simultaneously removed sulphur and mass-input of iron ore leached in potassium hydroxide. The reaction vessel containing the solution and ore was heated at {{a temperature of}} 600 °C for 10 minutes. The model; P = 61. 8477 x 10 - 3 μ- 2. 27 S shows that the predicted concentration <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> phosphorus, {{is dependent on the}} mass-input of iron oxide ore and the concentration <b>of</b> sulphur simultaneously <b>removed</b> during the reduction process. The validity of the model is rooted in the expression k 1 P = (2 μ – k 2 S) where both sides of the expression are correspondingly equal. The maximum deviation of the model-predicted (D-Model) concentrations <b>of</b> <b>removed</b> phosphorus (during the beneficiation process) from the concentrations obtained from experiment is less than 3. 6861 %. This translates to confidence level of over 96 %. The concentrations <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>removed</b> per unit mass-input of iron oxide ore as obtained from experiment (ExD), derived model (D-Model) and regression model (R-Model) are 1. 01, 1. 1549 and 0. 87 mg kg- 1 g- 1 respectively. Similarly, the concentrations <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>removed</b> per unit concentration <b>of</b> sulphur simultaneously <b>removed</b> as obtained from experiment, D-Model and R-Model are 1. 8843, 2. 1546 and 1. 6231 mg kg- 1 (mg kg- 1) - 1 respectively. The standard errors in D-Model prediction <b>of</b> the <b>removed</b> phosphorus concentration for each value <b>of</b> simultaneously <b>removed</b> sulphur concentration is 0. 0167 compared to ExD (0. 6439) and R-Model (2. 05 x 10 - 5) ...|$|R
