5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge <b>of</b> <b>practical</b> details. The {{operation}} followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a review about the {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>practicals</b> in science education at the secondary and tertiary levels. Through {{more than one hundred}} references, the authors conclude solid arguments have not been provided to justify the great deal of material and human resources needed for the implementation of this educational tool. In spite of these disappointing findings, the authors do not deny the central role <b>of</b> <b>practicals</b> in science education, and they justify these negative results by invoking the great complexity of the subject, the ambiguity that surrounds the term «practicals», and an unsuitable methodology that researchers use to measure their effectiveness. Finally, some plausible solutions to the problem are suggested, such as the characterisation of the educational objectives <b>of</b> <b>practicals,</b> or the use of a qualitative evaluation methodology...|$|R

5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique <b>of</b> <b>Practical</b> Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Farms was the {{original}} location for the School <b>of</b> <b>Practical</b> Agriculture and Horticulture, established by the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture in conjunction with Walter Law. The school's purpose was to teach students in farming, gardening, poultry-keeping, and other agriculture-related skills. The school moved to a farm near Poughkeepsie in 1903, and the school building was run as a hotel for two years until it became Miss Knox's School. After the building burned down in 1912, Miss Knox's School was relocated several times; since 1954, the Knox School has been located in St. James, New York.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This {{essay is}} about how four deeply {{important}} Kantian ideas can significantly illuminate some essentially intertwined issues in philosophical theology, philosophical logic, the metaphysics of agency, and above all, morality. These deeply important Kantian ideas are: (1) Kant’s argument for the impossibility of the Ontological Argument, (2) Kant’s first “postulate <b>of</b> pure <b>practical</b> reason, ” immortality, (3) Kant’s third postulate <b>of</b> pure <b>practical</b> reason, the existence of God, and finally (4) Kant’s second postulate <b>of</b> pure <b>practical</b> reason, freedom...|$|R

40|$|Motivating {{students}} to learn computer networking concepts is often difﬁcult because many students ﬁnd the subject rather technical, dry, and boring. To overcome this problem, the author has prepared some practical laboratory exercises (practicals) and other materials. They are designed around a network operating system and a multiuser, multitasking operating system and are suitable for classroom use in undergraduate computer networking courses. The effectiveness <b>of</b> these <b>practicals</b> has been evaluated both formally by students and informally in discussion within the teaching team. The implementation <b>of</b> the <b>practicals</b> was judged to be successful because of the positive student feedback and also because students scored better in the ﬁnal exam. This paper describes the practicals, their overall effectiveness, and plans for further projects. The impact <b>of</b> <b>practicals</b> on student learning and comprehension is also discussed...|$|R

It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Trilingualism {{was perhaps}} not {{uncommon}} among educated {{people who came}} from regions where a language other than Latin or Greek was spoken.

These papyri, named for a Jewish woman {{in the province of}} Arabia and dating from 93 to 132 AD, mostly employ Aramaic, the local language, written in Greek characters with Semitic and Latin influences; a petition to the Roman governor, however, was written in Greek.|$|E

5|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{contributed to the}} cancellation. The XF-85's {{deficiencies}} revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development <b>of</b> <b>practical</b> aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also {{a factor in the}} cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup.

5|$|Bernoulli's work {{influenced}} {{many contemporary}} and subsequent mathematicians. Even the afterthought-like tract on calculus has been quoted frequently; most notably by the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin. Jacob's program of applying his art of conjecture to the matters <b>of</b> <b>practical</b> life, which was terminated by {{his death in}} 1705, was continued by his nephew Nicolaus Bernoulli, after having taken parts verbatim out of Ars Conjectandi, for his own dissertation entitled De Usu Artis Conjectandi in Jure which was published already in 1709. Nicolas finally edited and assisted in the publication of Ars conjectandi in 1713. Later Nicolaus also edited Jacob Bernoulli's complete works and supplemented it with results taken from Jacob's diary.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} afterwards, his main {{literary}} output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, {{most of which}} were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations <b>of</b> <b>practical</b> aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of Letters on Yoga. In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem {{for the rest of his}} life. It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, Savitri, an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.|$|E

The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal <b>of</b> <b>practical</b> experience in electrical engineering.

Spurred by intense competition from the formidable Pennsylvania Railroad, the dominant railroad in the lucrative New YorkWashington market since the 1880s, the Royal Blue in its mid-1930s reincarnation was noted {{for a number of}} technological innovations, including streamlining and the first non-articulated diesel locomotive on a passenger train in the U.S., a harbinger of the steam locomotive's eventual demise.|$|E
5|$|The Reformist Party {{supported}} privatization, {{opposing the}} Modernist Party, which had dominated politics {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu and the subsequent regency of Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The Modernists argued that state monopolies provided abundant raw materials, good working conditions, and high quality iron; the Reformists countered that state-owned ironworks produced large and impractical implements designed to meet quotas rather than to be <b>of</b> <b>practical</b> use, were of inferior quality, and were too expensive for commoners to purchase. In 44 BC, the Reformists had both the salt and iron monopolies abolished, but the monopolies were reinstated in 41 BC after their abrupt closure resulted in significant losses of revenue for the government and disruption of the private economy.|$|E
