5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere between the anti-meridian and 100°E are officially {{named by the}} Japan Meteorological Agency when they become tropical storms. However, PAGASA also names tropical cyclones that occur <b>or</b> <b>develop</b> into tropical depressions within their self-defined area of responsibility between 5°N–25°N and 115°E-135°E. This often results in tropical cyclones in the region having two names.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, <b>or</b> <b>develop</b> 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E

5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base <b>or</b> <b>develop</b> a coterie of followers. He was {{motivated}} by his loyalty to Hitler {{and a desire to}} be useful to him; he did not seek power or prestige or take advantage of his position to accumulate personal wealth. He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
5|$|Morotai is a {{small island}} located in the Halmahera group of eastern Indonesia's Maluku Islands. Most of the island's {{interior}} is rugged and covered in thick jungle. The Doroeba Plain in Morotai's south-west corner is {{the largest of the}} island's few lowland areas. Prior to the outbreak of war, Morotai had a population of 9,000 and had not been commercially developed. It formed part of the Netherlands East Indies and was ruled by the Dutch through the Sultanate of Ternate.

5|$|In 2013, {{leading up}} to the release of Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, Baba called Symphonia the most {{successful}} title in the series in the west thus far, although the series' main target audience was still in Japan. In an earlier interview, Baba commented that the team behind the series put a large amount of effort and development in keeping the series fresh while retaining the base elements across each installment. The positive reaction of gamers in the US to Symphonia influenced the way the various teams developed titles after that point. Speaking in 2014, production manager Denis Lee said that, since Symphonias release, the popularity of the series has grown. In response, Bandai Namco have focused on getting more entries out in western territories. Much of their research about what titles to release <b>or</b> <b>develop</b> in the future revolves around direct conversation with Tales series fans at gaming conventions and special events.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, <b>or</b> <b>develop</b> internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's {{population}} fell precipitously {{through the}} first half of the 20th century, leading eventually to the island's final abandonment at the end of the 1950s. There was no single cause that precipitated the collapse of Stroma's population. Living conditions on the island were always basic; there was no running water or electricity, and gas only arrived in the 1950s, which contrasted poorly with the improvements being made on the mainland. The fishing deteriorated after the First World War, and crofting became an increasingly difficult way to make a living. The island was relatively overpopulated; by 1901 the population was nearly twice that of sixty years previously, and there was little spare land left for farming. Families of six to eight children were common, but there was simply not enough work for all, so the eldest often left for the mainland or emigrated to Canada or the United States to find work. The lack of a proper harbour meant that the islanders could not make use of larger boats <b>or</b> <b>develop</b> a modern fishery. Young people started moving away to seek better-paying opportunities elsewhere, eventually followed by their parents.|$|E
