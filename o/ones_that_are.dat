5|$|Worms Armageddon is a 2D {{artillery}} turn-based tactics {{video game}} developed by Team17 {{and part of}} the Worms series. The player controls a team of up to eight worms in combat against opposing teams either AI- or player-controlled, using weapons both based on real-life weapons and <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> cartoonish. The player can customize battles, teams, and maps for near-infinite gameplay options.|$|E
5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E

6000|$|TROGLODYTE, n. Specifically, a cave-dweller of the paleolithic period, {{after the}} Tree {{and before the}} Flat. A famous {{community}} of troglodytes dwelt with David in the Cave of Adullam. The colony consisted of [...] "every <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> in distress, and every <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> in debt, and every <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> discontented"--in brief, all the Socialists of Judah.|$|R
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> potentially habitable, {{have enabled}} SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d {{and the more}} habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|Within the congregation, {{there are}} many {{organizations}} that specialize in various activities, all of which strive to better the church or community or both. These groups allow parishioners to work {{with each other in}} order to reach common goals and also allows them to become more involved in Mt. St. Peter Church. This way, the congregation can remain a close knit family, not just a church where parishioners spend an hour praying on Sunday mornings. The organizations listed are the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> currently active, there were in the past, many others, like the Committee of a hundred (mentioned in the history section), which are no longer in existence.|$|E

The group meets on the third Tuesday of February, April, May, August, September, October and November in the Marble Hall of Mt. St. Peter Church. The meetings consist of discussing projects and praying together. The St. Anthony Guild is known for their visits to the home-bound of the parish at Christmas and Easter and also for their Tree of Angels Campaign. This campaign allows parishioners to purchase angels in memory of loved <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> placed on the church's Christmas tree. The money raised from these angel ornaments is donated to children in need. The guild also has many entertaining fundraisers to raise money for their charity projects. Some of these include a dance for parishioners in the fall, bingo nights, and selling coupons for special shopping days at Macy's.|$|E
5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious of strangers, they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "Cave of Adullam" [...] {{has been}} used by {{political}} commentators referring to any small group remote from power but planning to return.

25|$|The {{principle}} of cross-cutting relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.|$|E
25|$|K-Café is an in-store {{restaurant}} that serves a fairly standard menu of hamburgers, hot dogs, fries and such other sandwiches as grilled cheese and Philly cheesesteaks. They {{also offer a}} full breakfast menu of baked goods, bagels and egg platters with bacon or sausage and such snacks as nachos, pretzels, popcorn and ice cream. In addition to the cafe's menu, hot food items can also be purchased at the deli and eaten in the Deli Cafe at Super Kmart Center stores. However, K-Café has been discontinued in some stores.

25|$|Rats {{raised with}} {{environmental}} enrichment have thicker cerebral cortices(3.3–7%) that contain 25% more synapses. This effect of environmental richness upon the brain occurs {{whether it is}} experienced immediately following birth, after weaning, or during maturity. When synapse numbers increase in adults, they can remain high in number even when the adults are returned to impoverished environment for 30 days suggesting that such increases in synapse numbers are not necessarily temporary. However, the increase in synapse numbers has been observed generally to reduce with maturation. Stimulation affects not only synapses upon pyramidal neurons (the main projecting neurons in the cerebral cortex) but also stellate <b>ones</b> (<b>that</b> <b>are</b> usually interneurons). It also can affect neurons outside the brain in the retina.|$|E
