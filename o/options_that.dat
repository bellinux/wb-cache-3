In its place is Action Center, which displays notifications and settings toggles. It is accessed by clicking an icon in the notification area, or dragging {{from the right}} of the screen. Notifications can be synced between multiple devices. The Settings app (formerly PC Settings) was refreshed and now includes more <b>options</b> <b>that</b> were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) {{released}} a report entitled Rebuilding Public Confidence in Financial Reporting: An International Perspective. By studying the international company collapses {{as a result of}} accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue <b>options</b> <b>that</b> would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} modes {{that can be}} played with teams from either the American League or the National League: regular season games, All-star games or the World Series (interleague). The World Series rounds, however, are only one match each, which is not {{accurate}} to the real World Series. Due to the licensing, the teams even appear complete in their official uniforms and colours and also have all the <b>options</b> <b>that</b> a real baseball player would have, including bunting, pitching out, base stealing and throwing errors.|$|E
30|$|Decisions in {{organizations}} are frequently {{characterized by the}} fact that the decision maker does not choose the <b>option</b> <b>that</b> is best for the organization but instead chooses the <b>option</b> <b>that</b> protects him or herself from potentially negative future consequences. This is called a ‘defensive decision’.|$|R

5|$|Waiters {{signed a}} $16.7 million {{four-year}} contract (two years, plus two team <b>options)</b> <b>that</b> {{was based on}} the rookie wage scales determined by the collective bargaining agreement. Drummond also signed a multi-year contract. Kaman signed a one-year $8 million contract with the Dallas Mavericks. Wallace re-signed with the Nets for 4 years and $40 million. The Memphis Grizzlies did not make Mayo a $7.2 million qualifying offer, thus allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent. He subsequently signed with the Mavericks for two years (with a player option in the second year). The New Orleans Hornets matched the Phoenix Suns' 4-year $58 million contract for Gordon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of <b>options</b> <b>that</b> determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for <b>options</b> <b>that</b> will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E
5|$|Howe was {{determined}} that the pipeline not be delayed, and proposed that the government advance money to the pipeline company to ensure construction in 1956. He emotionally pleaded with his Cabinet colleagues, who agreed both to the proposal and {{to the use of}} rarely used closure to limit the debate. Closure had not been applied in the House since 1932. The issue was attractive to the Tories and CCF with an election due within two years; it would allow them to portray Howe as an arrogant dictator, and play to those citizens who disliked the American involvement in the pipeline project. If the bill did not receive Royal Assent by 7 June 1956, <b>options</b> <b>that</b> Trans-Canada held for steel pipe would expire.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in Windows 8.1; PC Settings was {{expanded}} to include <b>options</b> <b>that</b> were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas, and additional editing tools {{were added to the}} Photos app (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed). A number of additional stock apps were also added, including Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder, Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from apps through OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does not support data loss protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store is enabled by default within Windows To Go environments.|$|E

5|$|The Milford {{area study}} has been dormant since July 2007 due to {{community}} opposition to DelDOT's proposed alternatives through Lincoln and Milford. After studying various <b>options</b> <b>that</b> included upgrading the current alignment and constructing bypass routes {{to the west and}} east of Milford, DelDOT decided to move forward with a pair of eastern bypass alternatives in June 2007. Both alternatives head east from US113's current alignment southwest of Lincoln, bypass the village to the south and east, have an interchange with DE 30 and Johnson Road, and meet DE1 at an interchange south of the latter highway's interchange with the south end of DE1Business. On June 15, 2007, DelDOT announced it would move forward with plans to build the bypass despite the majority of the department's advisory group of community representatives opposing the bypass, far below the required 75percent for consensus to have been achieved. On July 1, 2007, in response to DelDOT overriding its advisory group, the Delaware General Assembly passed Senate Bill 155, which prohibited DelDOT from proceeding with the US113 North/South Improvements Project in the Milford and Lincoln areas and directed DelDOT to continue to work to achieve consensus on an acceptable bypass route. Citing a lack of community consensus, DelDOT abandoned its plans for the US113 bypass of Milford in January 2008.|$|E
