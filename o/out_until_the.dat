5|$|Fighting {{continued}} around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings {{were heavily}} invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended {{the house and}} the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{fighting}} on 31 August, the Japanese forces ashore had reported {{the situation to}} their headquarters at Rabaul. In response, plans were made to send the Aoba Detachment, which comprised the Army's 4th Infantry Regiment and an artillery company, to Rabi to complete the capture of the airfield. However, they were not scheduled to arrive until 11 September {{and so it was}} planned in the meantime to reinforce Yano's men with 130 men from the 5th Yokosuka SNLF. An abortive attempt was made to land these troops on 2 September and then again on 4 September. By that time, however, as further reports were received by the Japanese headquarters, it became apparent that Yano's troops {{would not be able to}} hold <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Aoba Detachment could arrive. As a result, on 5 September, the Japanese high command ordered a withdrawal. This was carried out from the sea that evening.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, Doyle {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Blackpool, newly relegated to League One. He was named club captain, and selected as starting goalkeeper, ahead of Kyle Letheren, {{for the opening}} match of the season, away to Colchester United. He made several saves to keep his team in the match, but damaged a shoulder in thwarting Colchester's Gavin Massey and {{had to leave the}} field. After an initial prognosis of three months out, a scan suggested he could return to action within a month. He was back in the team for the visit to Scunthorpe United on 5 September, and produced a man-of-the-match performance that earned him a place in the Football League's Team of the Week as Blackpool won their first match of the season. Ankle ligament damage suffered in early November kept him <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> new year.|$|E
5|$|Operation Yoav {{had left}} Faluja as an enclave within Israeli-held {{territory}} and during November 1948 the Hammers routinely returned to bomb {{what became known}} as the Faluja Pocket. The town would nonetheless hold <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the war. On December 22 Israel launched Operation Horev, its last major offensive of the war, to finally defeat the Egyptian expeditionary force and expel it beyond the borders of Mandatory Palestine. 69 Squadron once again flew in support of Israeli efforts in the south, targeting the air base at El-Arish, Khan Younis, Gaza and Rafah. The squadron also revisited Faluja to prevent an Egyptian sortie from the beleaguered pocket, and on New Year's Day 1949 flew a failed attempt to bomb an Egyptian Navy flotilla which had shelled Tel Aviv. 69 Squadron flew its last missions of the war in the early morning of January 7, 1949, against Rafah. Having evaded Egyptian flak on most occasions, both participating bombers were hit, rendering one unserviceable.|$|E

5|$|Steve Jennings {{became the}} first signing of the winter {{transfer}} window, returning to Tranmere on a permanent basis, signing a six-month deal. He was followed by Northern Irish striker Rory Donnelly who joined on loan from Swansea City {{until the end of}} the season. At the same time, Adams announced five players as transfer listed – Antonie Boland, Eliot Richards, James Rowe, Abdulai Bell-Baggie and George Donnelly. On the next day former Tranmere defender Alan Rogers joined the Club's coaching staff. Defender Marcus Holness suffered serious knee ligament damage on 10 January that ruled him <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> end of the season. On 17 January, youth midfielder Mitch Duggan made his senior debut as a late substitute for Shamir Fenelon.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers almost {{exceeded}} their worst-ever loss, a 42–0 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers, on its 10th anniversary. They {{were shut}} <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter, and only scored when Chicago Bears safety Todd Bell intercepted a Steve Young pass and lateraled it to Mike Richardson, who attempted to lateral it to Shaun Gayle, only to have Tampa Bay receiver Vince Heflin intercept the lateral and run it in for a score. Mike Tomczak ran for the Bears' first score. Later, a Walter Payton touchdown was called back on a holding penalty. The Buccaneers stopped the Bears on fourth-and-1, but an offside penalty on Craig Swoope gave the Bears another chance. Tomczak fumbled, however, causing him to be benched in favor of Doug Flutie. Flutie scored two touchdowns, one passing and one running, before Tomczak returned in the second half. Tampa Bay scored a second time on Young's 14-yard pass to Calvin Magee, but Lew Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. Magee's 143 receiving yards remain (as of 2009) the Buccaneers' single-game record for a tight end.|$|E
5|$|The German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union began on 22 June. Over the next two days, the sporadic revolts by Serbs against the NDH in eastern Herzegovina erupted into mass rebellion, triggered by Ustaše persecution, Serb solidarity with the Russian people, hatred and fear of the NDH authorities, and other factors. Serb rebels, {{under the leadership of}} both local Serbs and Montenegrins, attacked police, gendarmerie, Ustaše and Croatian Home Guard forces in the region. In the first few days, the rebels captured gendarmerie posts in several villages, set up roadblocks on the major roads and ambushed several military vehicles. On the night of 26 June, the rebels mounted a sustained attack on the town of Nevesinje in an attempt to capture it, but the garrison held <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> morning of 28 June when NDH troops broke through the rebel roadblocks.|$|E

The match began with the teams of The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) and The Highlanders (Robbie and Rory McAllister). The first {{elimination}} was made when Benjamin pinned Robbie after a superplex. The World's Greatest Tag Team, defeated the second tag team Jim Duggan and Super Crazy. The third team, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defeated The World's Greatest Tag Team after Cade performed a diving elbow drop on Haas and scored the pinfall. The final team, Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG), won the match after performing a G9 and pinning Cade to become the top contenders to the World Tag Team Championship, though they never received their championship match.|$|E
5|$|The town's tram, {{trolleybus}} and {{bus fleet}} was always painted in crimson and off-white colours, with ornate gold lining <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> outbreak of World War II.

At local government reorganisation in April 1974, the Wigan Corporation Transport Department became part of Greater Manchester Transport.

5|$|Away to Wigan Athletic on 16 August 2016, Donaldson's {{penalty was}} saved, {{although}} the encroaching David Davis scored from the rebound to give Birmingham a lead {{they failed to}} protect. Two weeks later, he converted a penalty to open his account for the season before {{taking advantage of a}} defensive error to complete a 3–0 win over Norwich City. In the next match, Donaldson again missed a penalty, then ignored managerial orders that Jacques Maghoma should take any further spot kick and scored the winning goal from the penalty awarded after 49 minutes. After the match, Rowett confirmed that Donaldson would remain as designated taker, but advised him to practise. He duly scored from the spot in the very next match. Donaldson's sixth goal, again a penalty, came against Ipswich Town in December. He was stretchered off soon afterwards with an Achilles tendon injury which kept him out for three months, by which time the team were in a relegation battle under the management of Gianfranco Zola, who had taken over the day after the Ipswich match. He made four appearances, with only one start, before a knee injured in training forced him <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> last 20 minutes of the final match, away to Bristol City, in which he helped Birmingham defend a 1–0 lead to avoid relegation.|$|E

5|$|On 21 February 1809, a large French fleet under Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez {{attempted}} to escape Brest and was chased by the blockade squadron and driven to shelter under the Ile d'Aix. Shortly afterwards, three French frigates {{attempted to}} break out of Lorient, but were challenged and destroyed at the Action of 24 February 1809. These operations were the preliminaries to the Battle of Basque Roads in April, but also provided the cover required for Troude's force to escape Lorient while the British were engaged elsewhere. Travelling rapidly across the Atlantic, the French encountered no British warships but were able to seize a number of lone British merchant ships, from whom Troude learned that the invasion of Martinique was already underway. While Troude's expedition had been preparing at Lorient, Cochrane had been preparing his own operation to Martinique, following the interception of the same despatches warning of the island's low morale and preparedness in the summer of 1808. Amassing an expeditionary force of 44 ships and 10,000 men at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, Cochrane began the invasion on 30 January 1809 and his troops rapidly overran the French defences, despite stiff resistance in the central highlands. By 10 February, the only remaining point in French hands was Fort Desaix, which held <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> magazine was breached on 24 February, at which point Governor Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse surrendered unconditionally.|$|E
5|$|Thanks {{to popular}} support within Poland, {{as well as}} to {{international}} support and media coverage, the Gdańsk workers held <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (Komisja Rządowa) including Mieczysław Jagielski arrived in Gdańsk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike. This agreement {{came to be known as}} the August or Gdańsk agreement (Porozumienia sierpniowe). Other agreements were signed in Szczecin (the Szczecin Agreement of August 30), and Jastrzębie-Zdrój on September 3. It was called the Jastrzębie Agreement (Porozumienia jastrzebskie) and as such is regarded as part of the Gdańsk agreement. Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the Party's monopoly of power. The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and recognition of a legal right to strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gdańsk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanisław Kania as Party First Secretary.|$|E
5|$|The 2000–01 season started {{early for}} Bradford after {{chairman}} Geoffrey Richmond decided {{to enter the}} Intertoto Cup.

Bradford subsequently lost both legs. Wetherall started the league season but after playing all 52 league games since joining Bradford without leaving the field, Wetherall limped off before half-time during a 2–0 defeat to their nearest rivals Derby County in November 2000. Days after new manager Jim Jefferies took over, Wetherall was ruled <b>out</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> following February following a groin operation.
