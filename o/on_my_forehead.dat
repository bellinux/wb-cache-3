2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day in my living room, I'd just walk around with those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b> I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must,' he acquiesced, {{after half}} raising himself and falling back. 'Oh, {{can it be}} about the prize? Some of that stuff <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> please, Clem.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the matter, Smith, {{you seem}} ill?" [...] she said; and then, laying her fresh palm <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> added: [...] "Your head burns like fire." ...|$|E
60|$|The radiant and yet serene eyes of Anna {{seemed to}} read my soul; and when I had done {{speaking}} she arose, stole timidly to {{my side of the}} table, as woman approaches when she feels most, placed her velvet-like hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> burning <b>forehead,</b> pressed its throbbing pulses gently to her heart, burst into tears, and fled.|$|R
6000|$|Shall I come to you? Say so; say so, and I will go at once, if I did [...] crawl <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knees. Oh, what {{a joy to}} see my Julie! And do {{not think}} [...] I will trouble you about money. No, your Sophie will be too proud [...] for that. Not a word will I say but to love you. Nothing will I do [...] but to print one kiss <b>on</b> <b>my</b> Julie's <b>forehead,</b> and then to retire [...] forever, asking God's blessing for her dear head.|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned back}} in her seat, murmuring {{something}} to herself which I could not catch. Past-mistress of deceit though she may have been, I was convinced that her consternation at my statement was honest. She did not speak or look at me again for some time. As for me, I sat silent with the horror of a thought. Underneath the rug my limbs were cold and lifeless. I sat looking out of the rain-splashed window into the darkness, with fixed staring eyes, and a hideous fancy in my brain. Every now and then I thought that I could see it--a white evil face pressed close to the blurred glass, grinning in upon me. Every shriek of the engine--and there were many just then, for we were passing through a network of tunnels--brought beads of moisture <b>on</b> to <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> made me start and shake like a criminal. Surely that was a cry! I started in my seat, only to see that my companion, now her old self again, was watching me intently.|$|R
6000|$|But I did {{not intend}} to be subdued as easily as he imagined. The blow <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> pained not a little, and it made me mad [...] "clear through." ...|$|E
60|$|I felt a gust {{of intense}} irritation, which passed {{as quickly as it}} came. I flung myself into the chair again, and pressed my hands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b> The puma began once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, poor boy, you {{are very}} ignorant," [...] she returned, placing her hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b> [...] "You must {{know that this is}} a mother's book, and only a mother may read in it." ...|$|E
60|$|I now raised myself <b>on</b> <b>my</b> elbow, {{and putting}} {{my hand to}} <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> found {{that it had been}} cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good deal of blood.|$|R
5000|$|Urdhva Pundra tilak or the Tilak Chandlo is a mark applied <b>on</b> the <b>forehead</b> <b>my</b> {{members of}} the Swaminarayan sampraday It is {{composed}} of two elements: the “U” shaped tilak made of yellow sandal paste, and the red kumkum dot in the middle. It is applied after the morning puja by followers of the faith and is representative of their theological principle of Akshar Purushottam Upasana. Members of the Swaminarayan Sampraday apply the mark every day during their puja.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{farewell}} morning at Limmeridge she touched <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> with her lips. A tear dropped <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face as she kissed me. She turned quickly, pointed to the chair from which I had risen, and left the room.|$|R
60|$|I felt a chill breath <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> {{and saw a}} {{few feet}} of the steel stand out darker than the darkness, disappear--it was then the dinghy shot away from it--and emerge once more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mamma, then I {{never had}} {{the sign of the}} cross <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead!</b> It does not feel blest!' And then, hastily and low, she muttered,' Oh! is that why I never could bear the cross in all my life!' ...|$|E
6000|$|I fell flat down again, {{in which}} {{position}} Jack left {{me to go}} and fetch me some dinner. He returned quickly with a plate of soup. Before commencing to eat it I pressed my hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> and said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was like}} this," [...] Rowan continued, {{speaking}} hoarsely, and with difficulty, [...] "that night he wasn't quite so drunk. I pressed {{him a little}} too closely about his claim, and where he kept the paper. He was suddenly suspicious and quarrelsome. He tried to turn me out, and when I wanted to soothe him down, he struck me. He was a strong man and I was weak. I think that he meant to murder me. I remember I was half <b>on</b> the floor. <b>My</b> <b>forehead</b> was bleeding already, and he was coming towards me, shrieking with rage. 'I am going to finish you!' he called out. Then I struck, hoping only to stun him, and, as you know, the blow killed him. I forgot {{for a moment about}} the paper. I thought only about making my escape. I had bad luck, and I did not succeed. I am afraid it was a bungling sort of job, Deane." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} {{for a time}} looking down at me and, I could feel, perplexed by me, but I wanted to go <b>on</b> with <b>my</b> thinking, and so I did not look up, and presently she stooped to <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> and kissed me and went rustling softly to her room.|$|R
60|$|I shambled {{out behind}} him, and wiped <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> in the hall.|$|R
60|$|I felt Lucy's hasty but warm kiss <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> as she quitted the room. It {{seemed to}} me a seal of a compact between us that was far too sacred ever {{to allow me to}} dream of violating it.|$|E
60|$|I stooped {{and kissed}} her. Then a {{moisture}} broke out <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> and I {{began to feel}} weak. I saw the red stains vanish from Chloe's apron, {{and the head of}} Louis Devoe turn to a brown, dried cocoanut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop {{calling me}} a boy. It will soothe my agony immensely and give me courage to appear in a low-necked coat and curl <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> for I'm not used to such elegancies and I find them no end of a trial." ...|$|E
60|$|After some {{prayers and}} blessings, rhythmically spoken or sung by an {{invisible}} choir, the priest took the rings {{from the open}} book, and, after signing <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> thrice with the gold one as he repeated the blessing in each case, placed it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right hand; then he gave my Lady the silver one, with the same ritual thrice repeated. I suppose it was the blessing which is the effective point in making two into one.|$|R
60|$|I rubbed <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> for {{the doctor}} had {{incidentally}} thrown out an embarrassing idea.|$|R
60|$|She leant over me {{and kissed}} <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> with a burst of genuine delight.|$|R
6000|$|Whitewash on the {{forehead}} hardens the brain {{into a state of}} obstinacy perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> my obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, [...] "I mean pretty well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The red print <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> [...] Small flame for a red star, [...] In the van of {{the violent}} marching, then [...] When the sky is torn of the {{trumpets}} ten, [...] And {{the hands of the}} happy howling men [...] Fling wide the gates of war.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Another lady, Miss H., who was present, {{laughed at}} the whole thing, {{especially}} when Miss ---- insisted on holding my hand and patting her other hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead!</b> Miss H. in a scornful manner took up a book, and, crossing {{to the other side}} of the room, left us to our folly.|$|E
60|$|She took {{my face in}} {{her hands}} and pressed a kiss against <b>my</b> <b>forehead....</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>On</b> {{recovering}} from <b>my</b> swoon I found myself {{lying on a}} bank of soft grass, under shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his knees by my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and endeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a wound in <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ralph! Ralph! {{tell me you}} are not hurt!" [...] she said, and {{something}} in her voice and eyes thrilled me through, but, though I struggled to do so, I could not as yet overcome the weakness, and lay still, no doubt a ghastly half-drowned object, with the blood from the wound the branch made trickling down <b>my</b> <b>forehead,</b> until stooping further she laid her hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, {{and there was more}} than compassion in the eyes that regarded me so anxiously.|$|R
60|$|It was horrible. I was {{trembling}} all over, and I {{could feel the}} shivers {{running up and down}} my spine and the sweat standing out <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b> Surely there can be little in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{describe}} to you how odd we both felt at this strange transformation. We both instinctively put up our hands--he {{to feel his}} hair, which was, of course, dressed like a woman, and I to raise the turban which pressed heavily <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b> But {{we did not know}} what had happened to us, for the night was still dark.|$|E
60|$|All {{the working}} {{of the ship}} seems to be done <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>forehead.</b> It is {{scrubbed}} and holystoned (my head--not the deck) at three every morning. It is scraped and swabbed all day. Eight pairs of heavy boots are now clattering on it, getting the ship under sail again. Legions of ropes'-ends are flopped upon it as I write, and I must leave off with Dolby's love.|$|E
60|$|I was unharmed {{except for}} a slight bruise upon <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> where it had struck the stone {{flagging}} as I fell.|$|R
60|$|Mother {{cried out}} in a fright, and {{struggled}} up into a sitting posture, and clutched wildly at anything that would help her. Amongst other things, she clutched the wreath of flowers that Dr. Van Helsing insisted <b>on</b> <b>my</b> wearing round my neck, and tore it away from me. For {{a second or two}} she sat up, pointing at the wolf, and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat. Then she fell over, as if struck with lightning, and her head hit <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> and made me dizzy for a moment or two.|$|R
60|$|Against the air, {{that in that}} stillness deep And solemn, struck upon <b>my</b> <b>forehead</b> bare, The slow, soft {{stroke of}} a continuous...|$|R
