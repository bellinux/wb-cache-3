5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the championship, several wrestlers have been forced to {{relinquish}} the title due to an inability to participate in title defenses. When a wrestler has been injured <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> compete for other reasons, tournaments have been held to determine the new champion.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics {{may be used to}} achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E

Twenty-three passengers and the two air hostesses {{were found to have}} died from multiple injuries and burns, or incineration. Only 12 of the 28 victims could be formally identified. The remaining 16 victims were either unrecognisable <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> be identified and were buried in a mass grave at Perth's Karrakatta cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Turmoil {{marked the}} {{legislative}} sessions of Brown's term; his supporters had been either unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> influence {{the rest of}} the Democratic slate, and tensions over the currency issue soon split the administration. Attorney General William Jackson Hendricks, Treasurer Henry S. Hale, and Auditor Luke C. Norman were all free silver supporters and feuded with Brown and his (appointed) secretary of state, John W. Headley, throughout Brown's term. Over time, the rift deepened and spread to the entire Democratic party. Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several of the bills it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden.|$|E
5|$|Dewhurst {{occasionally}} captained Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament and was {{a candidate}} to captain the West Indies cricket team in England in 1928, when the two most likely men were unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> lead the team. Dewhurst had acted as vice-captain of the West Indies team in 1926 to Harold Austin, but in the event, Karl Nunes was selected as captain. Dewhurst was also overlooked as vice-captain in favour of Vibart Wight although the latter had no captaincy experience. Dewhurst was named in the team to tour England, but he withdrew. Some newspaper reports blamed illness for his decision, others suggested business reasons. Critics believed that Dewhurst's absence adversely affected the team; the replacement wicket-keepers were not regarded as equal to Dewhurst's ability, and the vice-captain had little success. It was suggested that Dewhurst only missed the tour because {{he had not been}} chosen as vice-captain.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|In August 1982, he fronted a {{consortium}} – funded by Saudi brothers Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti {{of the company}} Allied Properties – that took Wolverhampton Wanderers out of liquidation, beating a rival bid from Doug Ellis. The brothers wanted anonymity, and were only revealed to the public after investigation by journalists. He sacked manager Ian Greaves and replaced him with former Wolves teammate Graham Hawkins. However the council rejected planning permission for the club to construct a supermarket, and the Bhattis were unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> provide further funding for the club. Wolves won promotion out of the Second Division in 1982–83, but were relegated out of the First Division in last place in 1983–84, and Dougan sacked Hawkins and replaced him with Tommy Docherty. Dougan resigned in January 1985.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E

5|$|Prince Paul {{recognised}} {{the lack}} of national solidarity and political weakness of his country, and after he assumed power he made repeated attempts to negotiate a political settlement with Maček, {{the leader of the}} dominant Croat political party in Yugoslavia, the HSS. In January 1937, Prime Minister Milan Stojadinović met with Maček at Prince Paul's request, but Stojadinović was unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> grapple with the issue of Croat dissatisfaction with a Yugoslavia dominated by the Serb ruling class. In 1938, the Anschluss brought the Third Reich to the borders of Yugoslavia, and early elections were held in December. In this background, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force (VVKJ) commander, General Dušan Simović had been involved in two coup plots in early 1938 driven by Serb opposition to the Concordat with the Vatican, and another coup plot following the December election.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the waterless stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{can be held}} in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which are injured <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{was kept}} secluded {{by his wife}} and {{personal}} physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, {{he was unable to}} do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling <b>or</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E
