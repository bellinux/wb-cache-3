5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from <b>one</b> <b>level</b> to another, although many are initially blocked off until Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|Each {{level in}} the game is {{intended}} to have a unique theme, in either fiction or game mechanic. In <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover. In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given a device that lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift {{back and forth between}} the two points in time.|$|E

5|$|Blood Money is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players move through four stages on the planet, {{taking control of}} a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a fighter jet in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which players use to attack all advancing enemies. Players can upgrade their vehicle with power-ups, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs. The vehicles' energy acts as players' health, and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all energy is lost, players lose a life; three lives are provided {{at the beginning of}} the game, and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels. When all three lives are lost, the game ends and players are sent to the title screen. The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game; after <b>one</b> <b>level</b> is complete, players can select any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, players must defeat a boss.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} individuals with different cultural orientations (bicultural, independent, interdependent, and marginal) proposed by Kim et al. (1996) and intercultural sensitivity and perceived communication predispositions (classroom communication apprehension and argumentativeness). Cultural orientations of individuals were treated as rank-ordering (Bicultural = 4, Independent = 3, Interdependent = 2, and Marginal = 1). In the hypothesized path model, {{it is expected that}} <b>one's</b> bicultural <b>level</b> increases <b>one's</b> <b>level</b> of intercultural sensitivity, which, in turn, leads to a higher degree of argumentativeness and a lower level of classroom communication apprehension. Similarly, it is hypothesized that <b>one's</b> bicultural <b>level</b> decreases <b>one's</b> <b>level</b> of intercultural sensitivity, which, in turn, leads to a lower degree of argumentativeness and a higher level of classroom communication apprehension. Data to test the model were drawn from both the undergraduate and graduate East Asian international students studying in Hawaii. The data were partially consistent with the theoretical prediction made. The implications of the results for theory and practice are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from <b>one</b> <b>level</b> to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E

5|$|Some of Mighty Jill Offs {{gameplay}} is {{borrowed from}} the 1986 arcade game Mighty Bomb Jack as a tribute. Players control Jill in only three ways: moving, jumping, and slowly descending. In the air, players may cause Jill to slowly descend by rapidly pushing the jump button while pointing in the direction that they want her to go. Players can switch direction while they do this. There are three types of obstacles: spikes, fire, and spiders; the latter can move to attack Jill when she comes close. Coming into contact with these obstacles kills Jill instantly, forcing her {{to start at the}} most recent checkpoint—typically located at a change in room. There is only <b>one</b> <b>level</b> in the game, but with several rooms in it. The screen scrolls vertically with Jill as she ascends up the tower. Each room transition is demonstrated by a change in the room's background colour. Jill has infinite lives, allowing players to play as long as they like without having to start the game over.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies chose Capel in the 24th {{round of}} the 1980 MLB draft, but Capel did not sign with the team: instead, he opted to attend the University of Texas. Capel played on the 1982 USA College All-Star Team, which competed in the Amateur World Series in Seoul and placed third. The next year, Capel and the Texas Longhorns won the College World Series. After he was drafted by the Cubs, Capel left Texas and signed to play {{professional}} baseball; he played in six seasons of minor league baseball before he made his MLB debut in 1988.
