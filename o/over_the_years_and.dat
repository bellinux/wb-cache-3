5|$|By 1241, the Gran Castello or Cittadella on Gozo was {{definitely}} fortified, although a settlement {{on the hill}} had existed since the Bronze Age.

5|$|In the {{original}} script the employees were the principal characters, and Norm and Cliff were not included. Later revisions added Norm and Cliff, and scenes were restructured and rewritten. Originally, Cheers set {{would be a}} hotel, but it was ultimatelly changed to a bar. Ratings were low when the episode first aired, but were moderately successful in reruns.

The interior consists of a spiral staircase which was also restored in 2016.|$|E
5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} {{going to follow}} the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking what they thought were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E
50|$|San Carlo dei Lombardi is a Gothic-style, Roman Catholic church {{located on}} Via dei Calzaiuoli in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy.

50|$|Iceland observes UTC {{all year}} round despite being at longitudes (13°W-24°W) which would {{indicate}} UTC−1. Iceland's high latitude (the Reykjavík region, home to {{nearly two-thirds of the}} country's people, is at 64°N) means that sunset and sunrise times change by many hours <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> effect of changing the clock by one hour would, in comparison, be small.|$|R
5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> residents didn't want the murder to be re-created in their neighborhood, so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection {{as it was in}} 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E
5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of newly appointed headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E

5|$|Donen's final {{television}} film was the made-for-TV movie Love Letters, which aired on ABC in April 1999. The film starred Steven Weber and Laura Linney and {{was based on}} the play by A.R. Gurney. Weber plays a successful US Senator who finds out that his long lost love (Linney) has recently died. The two had only corresponded through mail <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> Weber remembers Linney through his collection of old love letters. Donen had wanted to make a theatrical film version of the play, but was unable to secure financing from any major studio and instead took the project to ABC. In 2002 Donen directed Elaine May's musical play Adult Entertainment starring Danny Aiello and Jeannie Berlin in Stamford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, which once {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) flask.|$|E
