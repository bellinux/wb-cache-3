40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review is to evaluate the physical activity time (PAT) of white collar <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> {{in order to assess}} the levels of sedentary activity in an office environment. Analysing the <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> PAT will not only allow an insight into how an office based job could impact a person’s overall health and wellness status, but will also allow for the development of future office based inter ventions aimed at increasing the overall physical activity among white collar <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Methodology Using the PRISMA 2009 guidelines a literature review was conducted to assess the PAT of <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> and the typical sedentary nature of their work could affect their health. The review consisted of 8 peer reviewed studies, collected through the entry of 9 initial search terms relating to the physical activity, sedentariness and overall health of white collar workers into Discovery, PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Results Results suggesting low physical activity time spent among white collar <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> with the average minutes spent sedentary on a working day mean(±SD), (529 ± 75. 3), minutes in light activity, (164. 9 ± 51. 1) and vigorous activity time, (28. 2 ± 15. 9). Low levels of physical activity were also found during non working days with the average sedentary time being mean (±SD), (460. 1 ± 63. 2), minutes in light physical activity, (251. 2 ± 102. 1), and moderate to vigorous physical activity time (MVPA) time, (17. 9 ± 29. 3). Conclusion White collar <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> are spending greater amounts of work time in sedentary behavior.

40|$|The {{workplace}} {{is considered a}} strategic location for health promotion. According to the Texas Workforce Commission, <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> represent up to 40 % of the workforce in Texas and the general nature {{of the type of}} work is sedentary. Additional study is needed on how the built environment near the worksite area impacts walking behaviors and to determine interventions effective in increasing walking as part of daily routines among <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> The two aims of this dissertation were: 1) investigate the differences that urban and suburban settings may have on walking behavior (walk trips, walk duration, total step count) of <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> in Texas and 2) to examine the impact of a simple intervention in increasing walking within the respective land use settings. This study utilized on-line survey and travel diary, pedometer, and Geographic Information System to capture the study variables, which included personal, social and cultural, organizational, and built environmental factors. Results showed that urban <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> walk, on average, 600 steps more per day than the suburban <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Office</b> <b>workers</b> in both land use settings on average have not met the recommended level of walking steps per day of 10, 000 steps per day (Urban Mean= 4, 932 steps per day, Suburban Mean= 4, 347 steps per day). Post-intervention step count averaged 5, 734 steps per day for urban <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> in contrast to 4, 257 steps per day for suburban <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> This translated to a 16 % increase and 2 % decrease in walking steps for urban and suburban <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> respectively. The built environment in terms of land use setting, urban versus suburban, and availability of land use destinations showed associations with walking behavior for <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Destinations positively associated with the number of walking trips, including access to bookstores and coffee shops. Access to convenience stores and food establishments for suburban <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> were more relevant for walking duration. Significant destinations for the urban office workers' walking duration per week included the number of banks and food establishments within one fourth mile from their office building. The results for the second aim, testing the tailored information intervention, were informative, though not significant. The intervention did not yield a significant change in walking step count, but provided insight on opportunities for future studies...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Office</b> <b>workers</b> {{sit down}} to work for {{approximately}} 8 hours a day and, as a result, {{many of them do}} not have enough time for any form of physical exercise. This can lead to musculoskeletal discomforts, especially low back pain and recently, many researchers focused on home/office-based exercise training for prevention/treatment of low back pain among this population. Objective: This Meta analyses paper tried to discuss about the latest suggested exercises for the <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> based on the mechanisms and theories behind low back pain among <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Method: In this Meta analyses the author tried to collect relevant papers which were published previously on the subject. Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed were used as sources to find the articles. Only articles that were published using the same methodology, including <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> musculoskeletal discomforts, low back pain, and exercise training keywords, were selected. Studies that failed to report sufficient sample statistics, or lacked a substantial review of past academic scholarship and/or clear methodologies, were excluded. Results: Limited evidence regarding the prevention of, and treatment methods for, musculoskeletal discomfort, especially those in the low back, among <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> is available. The findings showed that training exercises had a significant effect (p< 0. 05) on low back pain discomfort scores and decreased pain levels in response to office-based exercise training. Conclusion: Office-based exercise training can affect pain/discomfort scores among <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> through positive effects on flexibility and strength of muscles. As such, it should be suggested to occupational therapists as a practical way for the treatment/prevention of low back pain among <b>office</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fast food {{consumption}} among <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> {{is a common}} phenomenon. Frequent consumption of fast food is linked to cardiovascular risk factors. The pervasiveness of these risk factors has debilitated the <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 health and contributed to low performance and absenteeism. However, there remains a significant gap in the current literature regarding the health impacts of frequent fast {{food consumption}} behavior of <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Consuming large portions of fast food {{has been associated with}} obesity. The purpose of this correlation study was to investigate the relationship between fast food consumption and obesity and hypertension among <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> The theoretical foundations for this study are based on socio ecological model which is concerned with interactions between the individual and the different elements of the environment. Of 145 randomly selected <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> 55 completed surveys about their food behavior and 36 of them had body mass index and blood pressure measured. Spearman rank-ordered correlations revealed significant correlations of moderate strength between fast food portion size and obesity (rs =. 37) and between frequent fast food consumption and hypertension (rs =. 40). These results constitute an important contribution to the existing literature and can be used by the health professionals and management to design workplace health intervention which focuses on the <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> and the social environment.

40|$|Background: Manual {{workers in}} the public sector have {{previously}} been found to be at risk of mental sickness absence (SA). As the impact of mental illness differs across economic sectors, this study investigated mental SA in the industrial sector, differentiating between <b>office</b> and production <b>workers.</b> Methods: Ten-year observational cohort study including 14 369 (8164 production and 6205 <b>office)</b> <b>workers</b> with a total of 101 118 person years. SA data were retrieved from an occupational health register. Mental SA episodes were medically certified as emotional disturbances [10 th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10 R 45) ] or mental and behavioural disorders (ICD- 10 F 00 –F 99). The first mental SA episode since baseline was called index mental SA. Recurrences were defined as any mental SA episode occurring > 28 days after recovery from index mental SA. Results: The incidence of mental SA was higher in production <b>workers</b> than in <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> but <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> needed longer time to recover from mental SA. Mental SA recurred as frequently in production <b>workers</b> as in <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> The median time to recurrence was 15. 9 months and tangibly shorter in <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> (14. 9 months) than in production workers (16. 7 months). Production and <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> aged > 55 years were at increased risk of recurrent mental SA within 12 months of recovery from index mental SA. Conclusions: The incidence of mental SA was higher in production <b>workers</b> than in <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> whereas recurrence rates did not differ between them. Occupational health providers should pay special attention to older workers as they are at increased risk of recurrent mental SA.
