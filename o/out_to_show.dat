5|$|A final trip to Europe {{took place}} in 1950. She set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> her husband the sights of a Europe she knew well, and to find a teacher of {{sculpture}} for their son Rix. She was distressed {{by the standards of}} artistic practice she found, and instead discouraged Rix from any career in the arts at all.|$|E
5|$|On 33 {{seconds the}} 'game' itself {{begins with the}} two player {{characters}} walking {{from left to right}} down a deserted street. As the first chorus begins several zombies enter from the right and are shot by the player characters. After 53 seconds the villain from the introduction appears and laughs before disappearing as the playing area is filled with zombies. The view changes to a cut scene showing close-ups of the two players sunglasses then pans <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a spaceship illuminating the area with yellow light.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E

5|$|Alice (Milla Jovovich) {{wakes up}} disoriented in a mansion {{laying in the}} showers floor. She wanders through the halls, where she defeats several obstacles, {{including}} a deadly laser beam obstacle and a giant blade that falls from the ceiling. However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be a clone. The camera zooms <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a shack camouflaging the facility's above-ground entrance - {{with the rest of}} the facility located underground, surrounded by a high fence and thousands of zombies.|$|E
5|$|All of the spaceships in {{the film}} were miniatures, as visual effects {{supervisors}} believed CGI was not effective enough to create realistic spaceships. The USM Auriga was originally designed by artist Nigel Phelps and resembled a medical instrument. This design proved to be too vertical for the film's opening shot, in which the camera pans <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the ship, and did not appear satisfactory {{in the film}}'s 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Three days before the design had to be finalized, Jeunet rejected it. Phelps, production illustrator Jim Martin, and concept artist Sylvain Despretz were tasked to redesign the ship. Jeunet felt Martin's design was too much like a space station, while he accepted Despretz's design due to its streamlined and horizontal appearance.|$|E
5|$|For Catherine, these {{entertainments}} {{served a}} political purpose {{that made them}} worth their colossal expense. She presided over the royal government {{at a time when}} the French monarchy was in steep decline. With three of her sons on the throne in succession and the country torn by religious civil war, Catherine set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of Francis I and her husband Henry II. At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.|$|E

On the way to Willow's dorm she trips, turns around and sees The Gentlemen {{floating}} toward her. In Willow's dorm she frantically knocks on doors which no one will open; The Gentlemen steadily pursue her. Willow hears Tara's panicked knocking {{down the hall and}} exits her room as Tara sprints into her, sending them both tumbling. They lock themselves into a laundry room and try to barricade the door with a vending machine, but it is too heavy for them to move. Willow, injured, sits and concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing. They clasp hands and the machine moves swiftly across the room, blocking the door.|$|E
25|$|Temple's {{first film}} {{was a short}} {{documentary}} called Sex Pistols Number1, which set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{the rise of the}} band from 1976–1977, in a series of short clips from television interviews and gigs. This led to Temple making The Great Rock And Roll Swindle, another documentary. As band members Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious had left the band by this time, the story of the group is told from the viewpoint of their manager, Malcolm McLaren.|$|E

Sokal and Bricmont set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how those intellectuals have used concepts from the physical sciences and mathematics incorrectly. The extracts are intentionally rather long to avoid accusations of taking sentences out of context.|$|E

2500|$|The Dead Kennedys toured widely {{during their}} career, {{starting}} in the late 1970s. They began playing at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens (their home base) and other Bay Area venues, later branching <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>shows</b> in southern Californian clubs (most notably the Whisky a Go Go), but eventually they moved to major clubs across the country, including CBGB in New York. Later, they played to larger audiences such as at the 1980 Bay Area Music Awards (where they played the notorious [...] "Pull My Strings" [...] for the only time), and headlined the 1983 Rock Against Reagan festival.|$|R
25|$|The court called Hitler {{to appear}} on the witness stand on 8 May 1931. Litten set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that the SA Sturm 33 ("Storm 33") was a rollkommando (a small, mobile {{paramilitary}} unit, generally murderous) and that its attack of the Eden and the resulting murders were undertaken with the knowledge of the party leadership. This would mean that the Nazi Party was not, in fact, a legal and democratic organization and would undermine Hitler's efforts {{to be seen as a}} serious politician and statesman.|$|E
25|$|Time {{independent}} {{solutions to}} field equations do not emit radiation, because a time independent background conserves energy. Based on this principle, Hawking set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that black holes do not radiate. But, to his surprise, a careful analysis {{convinced him that}} they do, and {{in just the right}} way to come to equilibrium with a gas at a finite temperature. Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.|$|E
25|$|The {{union was}} created in April 1881, by Peter J. McGuire and Gustav Luebkert. The two men {{organized}} groups for collective bargaining, and started a newspaper called The Carpenter to facilitate their idea of a national union. The Brotherhood held its first convention in Chicago in August 1881. The cornerstone of local and regional affiliations in support of common goals was laid <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> ways to maximize the unions bargaining potential. The immediate common goals were wage and hour demands, and death and sickness benefits. The union grew from its 1881 membership of 2000, to 50,000 by 1890, and 100,000 by 1900.|$|E

25|$|Billy's levels {{involve a}} degree of stealth. Unlike Ray, Billy can move totally silently whilst in sneak mode, and can hide in bushes and shadows. When he does so, he is hidden from enemy sight, and his {{character}} icon on the HUD is blacked <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> he cannot be seen. Often, {{even if he is}} seen, if he can hide quickly enough, he will escape permanent detection. Both Billy and Ray can also ride horses during the game, from which they can shoot, jump large distances and enter gallop mode. Gallop mode can only be maintained for a certain amount of time, however, before the horse becomes tired.|$|E
25|$|Seurat took {{to heart}} the color theorists' {{notion of a}} {{scientific}} approach to painting. He believed that a painter could use color to create harmony and emotion in art {{in the same way}} that a musician uses counterpoint and variation to create harmony in music. He theorized that the scientific application of color was like any other natural law, and he was driven to prove this conjecture. He thought that the knowledge of perception and optical laws could be used to create a new language of art based on its own set of heuristics and he set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> this language using lines, color intensity and color schema. Seurat called this language Chromoluminarism.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jake & Jim and grew from an idea the band had to record a video in Iceland {{at the start of}} 2003 which didn't come off. The video begins with a close up of a cardboard box featuring a logo of two apples with the title 'Golden'. The band is shown playing along to [...] "Golden Retriever" [...] inside the box with Gruff Rhys wearing a red sports visor. Bassist Guto Pryce and keyboardist Cian Ciaran are both sat on settees with guitars on their laps which they are not playing. As the chorus begins the band transform into yetis and all begin playing [...] "Golden Retriever", several members headbanging in time with the track. The group wear their regular clothes for the second verse before the yeti costumes reappear for the second chorus. As the video ends the camera zooms <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> a Golden Retriever approach the box in an alleyway. The Super Furries raise their hands in the air and look up at the dog who then urinates on the box and runs away.|$|E

500|$|In an {{appearance}} on RTÉ One's Saturday Night with Miriam on 14 July 2007, Coyle announced that Girls Aloud were not splitting up, and that the group would film a new music video the following week. On 7 August 2007, behind-the-scenes pictures of the accompanying music video were published by Daily Mail. The music video was directed by Trudy Bellinger, and premiered on 13 August 2007. It opens with Cole then singing the introduction, as she and the group are seen wearing latex catsuits while {{standing in front of}} a red material. The material is being used by a seamstress who is starting work on a dress. As the chorus begins, the camera zooms <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> the girls wearing giant inflatable red dresses. The seamstress starts putting large pins into her dress, poking their way around the girls, until the pins start tearing into their dresses. The pins tear the dresses off, and the girls are back in their catsuits, surrounded by the threads of their dresses. Journalist Peter Robinson deemed the video [...] "iconic" [...] and [...] "stylish".|$|E
500|$|By 1837, Marx {{was writing}} both fiction and non-fiction, having {{completed}} a short novel, Scorpion and Felix, a drama, Oulanem, {{as well as}} a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen, though none of this early work was published during his lifetime. Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, art history and the translation of Latin classics. He began co-operating with Bruno Bauer on editing Hegel's Philosophy of Religion in 1840. Marx was also engaged in writing his doctoral thesis, The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature, which he completed in 1841. It was described as [...] "a daring and original piece of work in which Marx set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy". The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Marx decided instead to submit his thesis to the more liberal University of Jena, whose faculty awarded him his PhD in April 1841. As Marx and Bauer were both atheists, in March 1841 they began plans for a journal entitled Archiv des Atheismus (Atheistic Archives), but it never came to fruition. In July, Marx and Bauer took a trip to Bonn from Berlin. There they scandalised their class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.|$|E
500|$|Jack {{is delighted}} {{when he thinks}} his mother, Colleen, is unable to visit him for the {{holidays}} due to her flight from Florida being grounded by Hurricane Zapato. Unexpectedly, Colleen arrives because {{she was able to}} travel by bus to Atlanta and get a flight from there. Also arriving at 30 Rockefeller Plaza is Liz's family, including her brother Mitch who has [...] "Trauma Induced Nivea Aphasia" [...] which means that his memory is stuck on December 7, 1985, and he believes that he is still 17 years old, when he is actually 40. Jack's mother immediately dislikes the Lemons due to their constant optimism and happiness. Colleen sets <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> Jack that they're just as screwed up as their relationship is. Jack, Colleen and the Lemons spend the day together and eventually end up going to dinner with each other. At the dinner, Colleen comments that it appears that Liz is the [...] "favorite" [...] child leading Mitch to reveal that his parents, Dick and Margaret, took him to see The Goonies in 1985 when they should have been watching Liz at her football game. Liz then gets into in argument with her parents, culminating in her accidentally revealing to Mitch that he is in fact 40 years old. The Lemons then spiral into a drunken fight, unknowingly falling for Colleen's plan.|$|E
