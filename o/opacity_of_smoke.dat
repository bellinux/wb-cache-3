40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} fuel, biodegradable {{and produced}} from vegetable oil or from animal fat through transesterification. The viability of this product {{as a source}} of alternative energy depends on various factors, among which the mixture proportion and the stability during storage time stand out. This is because the availability of the raw material is seasonal and varies in accordance with the harvests of different cultures. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the operational performance of an agricultural tractor working with palm oil biodiesel while performing the operation of tillage with a chisel plow, also opacity, the density of the fuel and the outflow from the filling pump were studied regarding storage time and biodiesel/diesel mixture proportion. The experiment was conducted in the Department of Rural Engineering at UNESP, Jaboticabal, Brazil, in partnership with LADETEL/USP-Ribeirão Preto. Storage time was with new fuel (soon after production), three months and six months, and the percentage proportions used for biodiesel + diesel were B 0 (0 + 100), B 5 (5 + 95), B 50 (50 + 50) e B 100 (100 + 0). When comparing the treatments, we evaluated the fuel consumption, the real velocity of displacement, the sliding of the wheels, the strength of the traction bar, the fuel density, the outflow from the filling pump and the opacity of the fuel smoke. The results show an increase in consumption specific to a mixture starting from 25 % biodiesel, although the storage time did not affect consumption. In relation to the <b>opacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke,</b> there was a reduction, even with only 5 % biodiesel in the mixture, again with the storage time having no influence...|$|E

Of {{the total of}} evaluated vehicles, 19. 938 they consume gasoline and 5. 233 vehicles operate to diesel engine. One was that the 14. 7 % of the vehicles to gasoline do not fulfill the limit allowed for carbon monoxide established by the enviromental authority {{of the city and}} the 22. 6 % fail to fulfill the hydrocarbon standard. Also it was identified that the 30. 8 % of the vehicles to diesel engine display porcentage <b>of</b> <b>opacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>smoke</b> over the allowed limit.

40|$|Following {{an earlier}} report which dealt with {{measurements}} of the rate <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> spread and the depth <b>of</b> the <b>smoke</b> layer in experimental fires in a disused railway tunnel representing a pedestrian mall, data are now given for the temperature and <b>opacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>smoke</b> layer. The fall of temperature <b>of</b> the <b>smoke</b> layer as it passed along the tunnel could be accounted for entirely by convection and radiation transfer. to the walls and floor of the tunnel so that there {{seems to have been}} little mixing of the layer with the cold air underneath, a factor which could also lead to a fall in temperature along the tunnel. One smoke test was made outside the tunnel under a canopy. This emphasised' the dependence <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> spread on the wind conditions and showed that smoke logging to a low level could occur even when the smoke was not completely confined. Values can be derived for the optical density <b>of</b> the <b>smoke</b> produced by burning a given weight of kerosine in a given volume, enabling an estimate of the visibility to be derived in other comparable situations where the burning rate and mixing conditions are known. The values obtained exhibit substantial variation so that the precision of an estimate of visibility is low, though sufficient for the present pur-pose, Such variation has a bearing on the problem of relating the behaviour of materials in a smoke test to some assumed real fire situation;. a problem which itself falls outside the scope of this report...|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel is an {{environment-friendly}} {{diesel fuel}} which is economically feasible and readily available. It {{can be used}} to replace petroleum diesel or can be blended together with petroleum diesel fuel in any percentage. Production of biodiesel was involved transesterification process that implicated the reaction between used cooking oil and methanol with aid of KOH. The reaction was carried out at 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, and 120 min to evaluate the effect of reaction time on the yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). The highest yield of FAME was obtained at reaction time 60 min. Besides that, the yield of fatty acid methyl ester was studied by changing the reaction temperature at 30 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, 90 °C, and 120 °C. The maximum yield of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) was obtained at 60 °C. All samples of biodiesel at different reaction time and temperature were contained high impurities of bounded glycerol due to the insufficient of purification techniques. Biodiesel was successfully reduced 39. 2 percent <b>opacities</b> level <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> released by diesel engine that performed with petroleum diesel.

40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} include {{gases and}} liquids, {{as well as}} solid particles. They include material derived from both oceans and landmass, as well as particles that form within the atmosphere, such as sulfates. Solid particles entrained in the atmosphere by detachment from poorly vegetated surfaces (the process of deflation) include, for example, rock and mineral dust, fine mineral aggregates, fibrous minerals, fibrous organic materials, and sea salt. The burning of vegetation (biomass) yields black carbon, which adds to the <b>opacity</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere. <b>Smoke</b> plumes from fires, both natural and anthropogenic, are often carried thousands of kilometers from their sources, so increasing the air pollution hazard.

40|$|The Development <b>of</b> a Real-Time-Based <b>Smoke</b> Belching Monitoring System for Public Utility Vehicle is {{designed}} {{in order to}} monitor smoke belchers or violators among public utility vehicles (PUV) that uses diesel such as jeepneys or buses. The concept of the project is to measure the <b>opacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>smoke</b> being emitted by the PUV {{with the use of}} a predesigned sensor unit incorporated by Light Dependent Resistor Sensor and Light Source facing each other, 4 inches apart. By allowing the smoke to pass through the LDR and Light Source, the desired resistance is acquired and processed by the microcontroller to obtain the Light Absorption Coefficient. This value is the basis for being a smoke belcher (If it exceeds 2. 5 k). The system then sends the data (Plate Number and K -value) for every one (1) hour to the Database System and to the operator with the aid of GSM Microcontroller that leads to a real time monitoring. The system is possible to implement and has a potential to be used for emission testing centers since it has the features <b>of</b> the commercial <b>opacity</b> meter which is common in emission centers to measure the smoke emitted by the diesel-fueled vehicles. This project serves as an innovation in emission testing because it monitors the smoke belchers in real-time and operators or owners of the vehicle are not required anymore to go to the emission testing center every year to renew their car registration. ...|$|R
40|$|NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer {{images taken}} over the Brazilian Amazon Basin during the biomass burning season of 1987 are used to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> aerosol {{particles}} on the properties of low cumulus and stratocumulus clouds. The reflectance at a wavelength of 0. 64 μm and the drop size, derived from the cloud reflectance at 3. 75 μm, are studied {{for tens of thousands}} <b>of</b> clouds. The <b>opacity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>smoke</b> layer adjacent to each cloud is also monitored simultaneously. Though from satellite data it is impossible to derive all the parameters that influence cloud properties and smoke-cloud interaction (e. g., detailed aerosol particles size distribution and chemistry, liquid water content, etc.); satellite data can be used to generate large-scale statistics of the properties of clouds and surrounding aerosol (e. g., smoke optical thickness, cloud-drop size, and cloud reflection of solar radiation) from which the interaction of aerosol with clouds can be surmised. In order to minimize the effect of variations in the precipitable water vapor and in other smoke and cloud properties, biomass burning in the tropics is chosen as the study topic, and the results are averaged for numerous clouds with the same ambient smoke optical thickness. It is shown in this study that the presence <b>of</b> dense <b>smoke</b> (an increase in the optical thickness from 0. 1 to 2. 0) can reduce the remotely sensed drop size of continental cloud drops from 15 to 9 μm. Due to both the high initial reflectance of clouds in the visible part of the spectrum and the presence of graphitic carbon, the average cloud reflectance at 0. 64 μm is reduced from 0. 71 to 0. 68 for an increase in smoke optical thickness from 0. 1 to 2. 0. The measurements are compared to results from other years, and it is found that, as predicted, high concentration of aerosol particles causes a decrease in the cloud-drop size and that smoke darkens the bright Amazonian clouds. Comparison with theoretical computations based on Twomey's model show that by using the measured reduction in the cloud-drop size due to the presence <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> it is possible to explain the reduction in the cloud reflectance at 0. 64 μm for <b>smoke</b> imagery index <b>of</b> - 0. 02 to - 0. 03. Smoke particles are hygroscopic and have a similar size distribution to maritime and anthropogenic sulfuric aerosol particles. Therefore, these results may also be representative of the interaction of sulfuric particles with clouds...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Smoke {{rendering}} is {{a standard}} technique for flow visualization. Most approaches {{are based on a}} volumetric, particle based, or image based representation <b>of</b> the <b>smoke.</b> This paper introduces an alternative representation <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> structures: as semi-transparent streak surfaces. In order to make streak surface integration fast enough for interactive applications, we avoid expensive adaptive retriangulations by coupling the <b>opacity</b> <b>of</b> the triangles to their shapes. This way, the surface shows a smoke-like look even in rather turbulent areas. Furthermore, we show modifications of the approach to mimic smoke nozzles, wool tufts, and time surfaces. The technique is applied to a number of test data sets. Index Terms—Unsteady flow visualization, streak surfaces, smoke visualization. ...|$|R
