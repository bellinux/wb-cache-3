Independently continuing her research, Jill realizes that the maid's death was masking a much older recording, left many thousands of years ago. Brock cruelly dismisses her findings, and forces Jill to take a two-month leave to prevent her from continuing her research.|$|E
5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology.

5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an interview}} with Splits Magazine, cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) demands that new cheerleader Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) lose ten pounds in a week. She reserves the school auditorium for cheer practice, so glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has to find the club a new rehearsal space. He visits a local roller rink where he finds former glee club member April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), who tells him that she is the mistress of the wealthy eighty-year-old tycoon who owns the rink. Upon learning that Will is looking to sublet his apartment, April invites herself to visit. After spending the night sharing a bed, Will forbids April from staying <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> tells her she is worth more than being a mistress. April says she will break up with her tycoon.|$|E

5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane {{is working on a}} stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of the}} desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.|$|E

25|$|England lost Alastair Cook in {{the first}} <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> needed to bat the final day out (or score an {{unlikely}} 350 to win). The biggest threat was clearly Muralitharan, {{and so it was}} therefore of some disappointment that the 4 wickets to fall during the morning session on the final day were to the seam bowlers. At 125/5 at lunch, their quest seemed doomed, but Ian Bell and Matt Prior batted for 45 overs through the tea break and beyond to give England a chance of a draw.|$|E

25|$|The {{disaster}} in Hobyo shocked Italian policymakers in Rome.

Blame soon fell on Governor De Vecchi, whose perceived incompetence was blamed for Omar's rise. Rome instructed De Vecchi {{that he was}} to receive the reinforcement from Eritrea, but that the commander of the Eritrean battalions was to assume the military command and De Vecchi was confined to Mogadishu and limited to an administrative role. The commander was to report directly to Rome, bypassing De Vecchi entirely.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Mr Osborne, Amelia, Jos, George and Dobbin go to Pumpernickel (Weimar in Germany), where they {{encounter}} the destitute Becky. Becky has fallen in life.

Dobbin forbids this, and reminds Amelia of her jealousy of Becky with her husband. Amelia feels that this dishonours {{the memory of her}} dead and revered husband, and this leads to a complete breach between her and Dobbin. Dobbin leaves the group and rejoins his regiment, while Becky remains with the group.|$|E
25|$|From the {{departure}} of the Australian Mounted Division steps were taken to make it appear that the valley was still fully garrisoned.

After the treatment, Jason gets his memory back and remembers his life with Sam, but the procedure causes a brain aneurysm. Jason initially refuses to have surgery to repair the damage, and he and Sam move to Hawaii to live out his last days peacefully. However, Jason realizes that he wants to live to be with Sam, and returns to Port Charles to have the surgery, which ended up saving his life.|$|E
25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers over and <b>over</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} {{over and over again}} in such a way or ways that {{the one who}} is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E
25|$|Castleford {{where the}} winner would reach the final. 3,000 people turned up to first see Thompson score a penalty after 15 minutes, but then Nigere Tariu slid over {{to put the}} Islanders ahead. Just before the break however, Tait charged through three players to put Scotland back in the game. In the second half the Cook Islands, with several NRL players in their ranks, showed their {{strength}} as Sonny Shepherd scored a controversial try as Scottish players complained about the grounding. From a play the ball Shepherd went <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> in the 73rd minute Tariu scored a converted try. The Bravehearts did get a late consolation, skipper Tait going over for Scotland's last try before Islander Ali Davys sealed Scotland's fate with a drop-goal. The match finished Scotland 10–21 Cook Islands. In the final the Cook Islands beat Ireland 22–6 in Bury to win the tournament and secure {{a place in the}} next World Cup. Despite losing this final match the Scotland team and supporters thought that they had done very well considering how young the team was and how well their performances had been against Russia and the USA.|$|E

25|$|Jean's {{first meeting}} with Charles Xavier and Magneto is shown in a {{flashback}} taking place twenty years before {{the events of the}} first film. In the present day, the X-Men, particularly Scott and Logan, continue to mourn Jean's death. After hearing Jean's voice, Scott travels alone to Alkali lake, where he encounters Jean herself, having survived the flood. They kiss passionately, but Scott suddenly vanishes. Xavier senses it and sends Logan and Storm to Alkali, finding Jean unconscious but alive and taking her back to the mansion, where Xavier reveals to a shocked Logan that due to the instability of Jean's powers, he created psychic barriers inside her mind to prevent her alternate personality, the destructive Phoenix, from taking over. Jean awakens shortly after in front of Logan; they almost make love before Logan discovers she is not herself. Though Jean begs Logan to kill her, the Phoenix takes over and knocks Logan out before leaving the mansion for her childhood home. Both the X-Men and Brotherhood track her down; though Xavier attempts to placate Jean, the Phoenix takes <b>over</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> vaporises Xavier, destroying most of the house, and joins the Brotherhood under Magneto while still distrusting him. Jean, however, manages to psychically call for Logan, seeing him as the only one able stop the Phoenix. Logan goes after her but is defeated by Magneto.|$|E

A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and <b>over</b> <b>again.</b> <b>And</b> we have decided that it appears to go just a little too far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking."
