Panoramic views of Himalayas are created by several peaks like Nampa, Jethi Bahurani and others. The beauty of this landscape is unforgettable.|$|E
30|$|The {{economic}} {{context for}} variable retention harvesting {{is also an}} important consideration in its implementation. That is, the ongoing harvesting of forests needs to be assessed not only against the condition of the broader ecosystem subject to management, but also relative to the economic values of <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> that are diminished {{as a direct result of}} logging in the same ecosystem. Work based on environmental and economic accounting has revealed that the value of the timber and pulpwood derived from logging Mountain Ash forests is a small fraction (<[*] 1 / 25 th) of the value of the water from these same forests (Keith et al. 2017). The water yield from forests regenerating after logging is significantly lower than the water yield of intact, uncut (old-growth) forests (Vertessy et al. 2001). The economic case for ongoing timber harvesting, irrespective of the silvicultural system employed, would therefore appear to be tenuous at best (Keith et al. 2017), especially with the growth in demand for water from a rapidly growing population in Melbourne (which draws almost all of its water from Mountain Ash forests (Keith et al. 2017).|$|E

The use of coal does, however, cause various environmental damages due to pollution externalities and emissions; these are impacts that place strains and limitations on the use of <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> beyond the mere extraction thereof. These social costs have not been internalised by industry though and therefore this paper examines the cost of these environmental externalities that arise through the combustion of coal by South African industries. Though the paper alludes to the local impact of volatile matter and sulphur, {{the focus is on the}} cost of carbon dioxide and methane emissions. It is concluded that the monetary values of these externalities are significant and that the environmentally inclusive price (including negative environmental externalities) of coal is appreciably higher than the private or market price thereof paid by each respective industry...|$|E

30|$|The {{implementation}} {{and maintenance of}} the variable retention harvesting experiment in Victorian’s Mountain Ash forests {{has been a major}} long-term challenge and remains so. Nevertheless, the work has shown that this silvicultural system is operationally achievable and has environmental benefits for some key groups such as small mammals and birds and likely also vascular plants. Variable retention harvesting has value not only in green-tree logging but also in post-fire salvage logging where the retention of patches of retained forest can provide valuable habitat for birds and plants. Despite these positive outcomes, important operational issues remain, including the severe negative impacts of high-severity regeneration burns on the integrity and condition of retained patches within cutblocks. The low percentage of cutblocks currently harvested using this silvicultural system (<[*] 4 %) is also of concern and appears to be {{due to a lack of}} motivation to implement the method rather than operational hurdles preventing uptake. More significantly, the ecological and economic context for variable retention harvesting must be addressed. In some cases, including in the Mountain Ash forests, overarching issues like the sustained yield of wood production and the relative economic value of <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> (such as water) that are traded off when the forests are logged need to be carefully assessed.|$|E

Based on assessment of the contribution of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (UK NEA) and other work, this paper makes a series of propositions in relation to the design of a <b>natural</b> <b>asset</b> check: 1. While the UK NEA draws together much of the information needed to design a <b>natural</b> <b>asset</b> check, a development of this framework will be required in order to perform the check. 2. Some kind of accounting model is likely to be more useful as a basis for a <b>natural</b> <b>asset</b> check than the frameworks used for ecosystem assessments. 3. A classification approach that links ecosystem services to the <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> that underpin them is probably more efficient in capturing what is important in policy terms, than one that is based on a more abstract and generic classification of assets. 4. There are sufficient data resources available for a preliminary audit of <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> to be made. 5. While a focus on non-marginal or irreversible changes in natural systems is important, it would be too restrictive to make this the exclusive concern of any <b>natural</b> <b>asset</b> check. 6.

40|$|Key points New Zealand {{producers}} and consumers get much value from <b>natural</b> <b>assets.</b> Much of this value is intangible. This {{is a fundamental}} reason to make special effort to measure the value of <b>natural</b> <b>assets,</b> {{to make sure we}} make the right decisions about their use and conservation. But a key barrier to using economic valuation is the cost and uncertainty of values obtained from the variety of techniques being used. This is a real issue, to the extent that doubts are being expressed in resource management cases whether economics has much to add when considering environmental effects. To remove this barrier, valuations need to be cheaper and easier to compare. A standardised technique could provide relative values for different types of <b>natural</b> <b>asset</b> or service. This would make economic value estimates from across a range of <b>natural</b> <b>asset</b> settings more consistent. Developing a practical, reliable standardised technique would involve: building on studies done to date, showing how much economic activity depends on <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> in a robust and comparable waycarrying out a meta - analysis, to obtain consistent and comparable value estimates for a range of ensure economic activities from economic impact studies done to datelearning how biophysical cause - and - effect relationships translate into economic value, to identify the sensitivity of econo mic activity to changes in <b>natural</b> <b>assets,</b> such as biodiversitycommissioning a stated preference study of the value of broad categories of <b>natural</b> <b>assets,</b> {{as a starting point for}} identifying value in specific situations.  Decision - makers need to understand how and where economic valuation can support their decisions. Providing them with explanatory materials will help. It is important to make progress. There is currently a gap in the knowledge about the full contribution of <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> to New Zealand’s economic well-being. This creates a risk that <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> will be undervalued. Ecosystems and the valuable services they provide may be lost or damaged. Economic valuation of environmental assets can fill the knowledge gap. To date, non-market valuations in New Zealand do not appear to have been used much to make management choices in conservation, whether those relate to responding to pest incursions or to economic development. A less ad hoc approach to weighing up the value of <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> can make treatment of <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> more consistent in decisions, and increase the efficiency of use of natural resources.

40|$|As {{the debate}} on the impacts of global climate change goes on at global and {{regional}} scale, climate change impacts are already being felt at local level. The thesis aims at exploring climate change as a driver of environmental and smallholder farmers’ livelihood vulnerability in Makonde District of Zimbabwe. Specifically the study seeks to: determine climate change trends and manifestations; evaluate household-level impacts of climate change and associated environmental changes on smallholder farmers’ livelihoods and lastly; to investigate the extent of household-level coping and adaptation strategies to climate change in the Makonde rural community in Zimbabwe, especially farmers in Makonde Communal Lands. Given the fact that the subject under study is multidimensional in scope, a mix of research methods was adopted in this case study. Whilst it is largely qualitative in design, the study involved some quantitative data and thus, a triangulation of different data sources and data gathering instruments was employed. The instruments used include; key informant interviews, structured observations and a household questionnaire survey. The analysis was based on a final sample of 434 out of the originally anticipated 500 households. In addition to the households’ sample, were twenty key informants and transect walk observations. The qualitative data was analyzed by means of coding, memoing, descriptions, typologies, taxonomies and visual representations, whilst quantitative data was processed through the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and complimented by Microsoft Excel to generate various forms of descriptive statistics. The findings suggest that climate change in the Makonde Rural District that includes the Makonde Communal Lands has been significant during the past thirty years. The climate change has contributed to significant local environmental stresses affecting local resources such as forests, fauna, water, pastures and soil among <b>other</b> <b>natural</b> <b>assets.</b> The local livelihoods show high levels of vulnerability to climate change due to notable low adaptive capacity. The high level of vulnerability to changing climate is exposing the study population to increased prevalence of: poverty, crop and livestock failures, food insecurity, malnutrition, disease and rural urban migration among other impacts. The study concludes that the factors creating barriers to climate change adaptation are related those contributing to poverty and holding back sustainable local development. Among the key suggestions to enhance the community’s climate change adaptation capacity, the thesis presents an establishment of a government-driven, multi-dimensional and multi-stakeholder intervention mechanism to help local communities manage their vulnerability.
