5|$|In March 2010, Virgin America {{announced}} {{its intention to}} start flying to Toronto from Los Angeles and San Francisco, making it the airline's first international destination. Following the Department of Transportation's approval of Virgin America's proposal to fly to Canada, international service began on June 29, 2010. However, due to high operating costs and higher demand for Dallas/Fort-Worth, Virgin America terminated Toronto service on April 6, 2011. Virgin America began its service to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in December 2010, and continued until after {{the repeal of the}} Wright Amendment in October 2014, which prompted the airline to establish a focus city at the Dallas Love Field and enhance the number <b>of</b> <b>connecting</b> destinations. As a result, Virgin America transported almost 31,000 passengers through Dallas Love Field in the first month, achieving 3.58% market share at Dallas Love Field.|$|E
5|$|On 6August1860 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A), {{with the}} 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as {{chairman}} and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object <b>of</b> <b>connecting</b> the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via Quainton, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23September1868. The new line {{was connected to the}} Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines {{at the point where the}} Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. Verney Junction railway station was built at the point where the lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, since there was no nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.|$|E

5|$|SR-103 {{serves the}} {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>connecting</b> {{the town of}} Clearfield, and residents along I-15 to Hill Air Force Base. The base, , was the sixth largest employer {{in the state of}} Utah and is the third largest employer which is neither the state government nor a state-funded higher education institution. SR-103 is one of four Utah state highways that connect to Hill Air Force Base, the others being SR-97, SR-168 and SR-232, Only SR-168 has a lower average daily traffic count, with roughly 1,000vehicles-per-day traveling along the highway compared to SR-103's approximately 16,000vehicles-per-day. This is a decline from previous years (in 2007 the average on SR-103 was 22,525; in 2006, the average was 22,215; in 2005, 21,275). Four percent of this traffic was composed of trucks. The measurement point for the traffic counts is at the eastern terminus of SR-103, the entrance to the Falcon Hill National Aerospace Research Park. The highway is codified as Utah Code §72-4-116, and is designated as a minor arterial, which the Federal Highway Administration defines as linking major arterials at a lower volume than a primary arterial.|$|E
5|$|Several {{features}} and accessories were {{developed for the}} WonderSwan. The WonderWitch is an official software development kit aimed at amateur programmers that was released by Qute Corporation. It sold {{at a cost of}} ¥11,800 and allows for games to be developed in the C programming language. An adapter was created to connect headphones to the handheld, as the WonderSwan lacks a headphone port. A remote-controlled robot known as the WonderBorg can be operated through the unit. In addition, the handheld can be connected to a PocketStation, a memory card peripheral for the PlayStation console, through a device known as the WonderWave. The WonderSwan and its later models were also capable <b>of</b> <b>connecting</b> to the internet via a mobile phone network.|$|E
5|$|The first railway to Milford Haven {{was with}} the {{completion}} of the South Wales Railway in 1856. Brunel had a vision <b>of</b> <b>connecting</b> London to New York via a railway through Wales and then to a commuter port. The initial plan was to terminate the line at Fishguard and to create a ferry service to Ireland, but after a failure to complete Irish rail links the terminus was changed to New Milford, (Neyland), which was completed in April 1856. The first rail link direct to Milford Haven was completed in 1863, which was originally conceived as a plan to create an impressive Milford to Manchester railway. The trains using the line were operated by Great Western Railway who had part funded the original railway. Today the town is served by Milford Haven railway station. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Arriva Trains Wales on the West Wales Line. It is the terminus, and from here, trains depart every two hours to Manchester Piccadilly via Carmarthen, Swansea, and Cardiff Central.|$|E
