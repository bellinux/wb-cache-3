50|$|Esophageal atresia (or <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>atresia)</b> is a {{congenital}} {{medical condition}} (birth defect) {{that affects the}} alimentary tract. It causes the esophagus to end in a blind-ended pouch rather than connecting normally to the stomach. It comprises a variety of congenital anatomic defects that are caused by an abnormal embryological development of the esophagus.

40|$|Information on oesophageal, {{duodenal}} and rectal atresias {{was collected}} from the hospitals, malformation register and death certificates in Finland from 1970 - 79. The respective prevalence rates were 4. 1, 1. 4 and 3. 6 per 10, 000 births, which are among the highest rates cited in the literature. Mothers of children with <b>oesophageal</b> and duodenal <b>atresias</b> were older than the average for child-bearing women in Finland. The sex ratio (male/female) of rectal atresia patients was 2. 4. About 50 % of the atresia patients had associated malformations. The data indicated time-spaced clustering for atresias. Furthermore, the cases of <b>oesophageal</b> and duodenal <b>atresias</b> appeared to spread within a time period of 30 days from a province to its neighbouring provinces to the north. Spreading was not observed for rectal atresias but clustering was noted when smaller geographic areas and individual communities were analysed. Occupations involving animal contacts were overpresented among the fathers of atresia patients.

40|$|Solitary median maxillary central incisor {{syndrome}} (SMMCI) is {{a complex}} disorder consisting of multiple, mainly midline defects of development resulting from unknown factor(s) operating in utero about the 35 th– 38 th day(s) from conception. It is estimated to occur in 1 : 50, 000 live births. Aetiology is uncertain. Missense mutation in the SHH gene (I 111 F) at 7 q 36 {{may be associated with}} SMMCI. The SMMCI tooth differs from the normal central incisor, in that the crown form is symmetric; it develops and erupts precisely in the midline of the maxillary dental arch in both primary and permanent dentitions. Congenital nasal malformation (choanal atresia, midnasal stenosis or congenital pyriform aperture stenosis) is positively associated with SMMCI. The presence of an SMMCI tooth can predict associated anomalies and in particular the serious anomaly holoprosencephaly. Common congenital anomalies associated with SMMCI are: severe to mild intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, cleft lip and/or palate and less frequently, microcephaly, hypopituitarism, hypotelorism, convergent strabismus, <b>oesophageal</b> and duodenal <b>atresia,</b> cervical hemivertebrae, cervical dermoid, hypothyroidism, scoliosis, absent kidney, micropenis and ambiguous genitalia. Short stature is present in half the children. Diagnosis should be made by eight months of age, but can be made at birth and even prenatally at 18 – 22 weeks from the routine mid-trimester ultrasound scan. Management depends upon the individual anomalies present. Choanal stenosis requires emergency surgical treatment. Short stature may require growth hormone therapy. SMMCI tooth itself is mainly an aesthetic problem, which is ideally managed by combined orthodontic, prosthodontic and oral surgical treatment; alternatively, it can be left untreated...|$|R

40|$|When {{a newborn}} {{develops}} feeding difficulties, is blowing bubbles or has excessive saliva, {{it is important}} to consider the diagnosis of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia.</b> Prenatal detection of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> is difficult.

We present three cases to illustrate the difficulties of early recognition and the consequences of a late detection of this condition. The first and third cases show that a delayed diagnosis of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> can lead to dangerous situations. Our second case illustrates that not every poorly drinking neonate has <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia,</b> and that this diagnosis may be rejected if the physician is able to pass a nasogastric tube.

METHODS: This case–control study included 40 participants: 10 newborns with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> and their mothers, and 10 healthy newborns and their mothers. Whole blood malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and {{the activities of}} antioxidant enzymes (catalase, carbonic anhydrase [CA], glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase [G- 6 -PD], and superoxide dismutase [SOD]) were measured. RESULTS: MDA levels and CA activity were significantly higher, and catalase, SOD and G- 6 -PD activities were significantly lower, in newborns with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> and their mothers than in healthy newborns and their mothers. Although CA activity was similar between the newborns and mothers in the patient group, it was significantly lower in newborns than in mothers in the healthy group.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} anatomical {{and family}} study {{was made of}} 345 patients with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> who {{were born in the}} South West of England between 1942 and 1973. There were 186 males and 159 females. Twenty-one cases were stillborn. Eighty-five percent of the patients had a combination of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> with a tracheo-oesophageal fistula to the distal oesophageal segment, and 9 percent had atresia without a fistula. Fifty-five per cent of the patients had other congenital malformations and these tended to be multiple rather than single. Thirty-six per cent of singletons had unequivocal fetal growth retardation, and {{there is some evidence that}} nearly all cases have poor fetal growth. There appeared to be a maternal age effect, with an excess of mothers under 20 and over 35, and there was an unexplained excess of fathers employed in the Armed Forces. Ten per cent of the cases were illegitimate. There were 21 twins which is nearly three times the expected number; there were two pairs of twins concordant for <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia,</b> one being monozygotic and the other dizygotic. In one case there were two sibs with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia.</b> Five out of 365 sibs had anencephaly. The blood group distributions of the patients and their mothers did not significantly differ from the expected distribution. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> is aetiologically heterogenous. In this series there were at least five, and probably 10 cases of trisomy 18 and four cases of trisomy 21. Five mothers had overt diabetes, and there is some suggestion from other work that maternal diabetes or its treatment may be aetiologically important. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> was part of a possibly recessively inherited malformation syndrome in two cases. A sibship with a case of rectal atresia, a case of Hirschprung's disease and a case of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> may represent the action of another recessive gene.

40|$|Background: Isolated <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> without {{tracheo-oesophageal fistula}} {{represents}} {{a major challenge}} for most paediatric surgeons. Here, we present our experience with six neonates with isolated <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> who successfully underwent immediate primary anastomosis using multiple Livaditis circular myotomy. Materials and Methods: All six neonates were gross type A isolated <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> (6 %), from among 102 neonates with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia,</b> treated between January 2009 and December 2013. Five neonates were female; one was male. The mean birth weight was 2300 (range 1700 - 3100) g. Results: All six neonates successfully underwent immediate primary anastomosis using multiple myotomies (mean 3; range 2 - 4) within 10 (median 3) days after birth. The gap under traction ranged from 6 to 7 cm. One neonate died of a major cardiac anomaly. Another neonate was lost to follow-up after being well for 3 months. Three anastomotic strictures were treated with balloon dilatation, and four anastomotic leaks were treated conservatively. The mean duration of follow-up was 33 months.

Primary repair of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> at our centre was perceived to be associated with a high mortality rate. In view of this, almost all patients seen since January 2014 were offered initial surgery for staged repair. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of records of infants with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> seen at the centre from January 2007 to December 2014 was used in this study. Results: Eighty-five cases of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> were seen over the study period. Of these, 74 (87. 1) had surgery performed. Surgical outcome was, however, indicated in 67 of the 74, with overall survival rate of 40. 3 %. Among the 67 patients, early primary repair was performed in 24 (35. 8 %) with a survival rate of 45. 8 % (11 patients). Totally, 12 (17. 9 %) of the 67 had initial procedure for delayed primary repair, with a survival rate of 16. 7 % (2 patients).

40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} prevalence, {{prenatal diagnosis}} and epidemiological data on <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> from 23 well-defined European regions {{and compare the}} prevalence between these regions. Design. Population-based study using data from a large European database for surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT) for two decades (1987 – 2006). Settings. Twenty-three participating registries based on multiple sources of information including information about live births, fetal deaths with gestational age ? 20 weeks and terminations of pregnancy. Patients. 1222 cases of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> in a population of 5019804 births. Results. The overall prevalence was 2. 43 cases per 10 000 births (95 % CI 2. 30 to 2. 57).

In {{the case of the}} evaluated 135 pregnancies only 1. 48 % revealed a postnatal <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia.</b> 21 patients showed a polyhydramnion during pregnancy, revealing a small or absent stomach bubble together with a polyhydramnion.

Another 7. 69 % from these showed prenatally an absent stomach bubble and a polyhydramnion. Likewise 7. 69 % were affected with a polyhydramnion as isolated phenomenon with an unobtrusive stomach. 38 % of all newborn babies with an <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> had further deformities, 4 children suffered from a cardiac defect, two of these within a VACTERL-association, another child had a trisomy 21. A health dysfunction had to be diagnosed on 40. 2 % of all fetus with a small or absent stomach bubble. Only two children with a trisomy 21 showed a small or absent stomach bubble as the only anomaly in the sonographic fetal diagnostic. All the others, i. e. 97. 3 % of the postnatal diseased children showed further abnormalities in the sonogram. From all of the 60 % healthy children only 12. 4 % showed further abnormalities in the sonogram.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the incidence of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> in Iceland and to evaluate the results of operations at the Department of Pediatric surgery at The Children's Hospital, Landspítal inn - University Hospital in Iceland. Material and methods: This retrospective study included all children diagnosed with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> in Iceland between 1963 and 2002. Information was gathered from hospital records, including birth-weight, gestational age, the type of atresia and the presence of other congenital anomalies. The results of operation were determined including post operative complications. Information on life births in Iceland for the same period was gathered from the Icelandic National Register. Results: Thirtyseven children were diagnosed with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> in these 40 years. The average birth-weight was 2626 g, including 14 children (38 %) with low birth-weight (< 2500 g). Fifteen children (41 %) were prematurely born (< 38 weeks). Thirtyfour children (92 %) had the most common type of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> with proximal blind loop and distal tracheooesophageal fistula. Thirtyfour children were operated on, including one in Denmark. Nine children died within 60 days after surgery. The most common cause of death was lung inflammation (n= 7, 78 %).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPostpneumonectomy {{syndrome}} (PPS) is {{an ominous}} complication, caused by mediastinal shift following massive lung resection. Presentation of the caseA neonate with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> and tracheo-oesophageal fistula developed {{acute respiratory distress}} shortly after surgery, despite mechanical ventilation. The patient {{was found to have}} an associated oesophageal right lung that collapsed after <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> repair and a left pulmonary artery sling causing left main bronchus stenosis mimicking a postpneumonectomy syndrome. DiscussionWe will describe the diagnostic work-up and the therapeutic measures used both in the acute phase and as definitive treatment in this challenging case. ConclusionsNeonatologists and paediatric surgeons should be aware of this rare association that may cause acute life threatening and worsening of patient’s clinical status. Prompt realignment of the mediastinum in the normal position is critical to obtain rapid improvement of the patient’s clinical conditions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{describe}} the incidence and outcomes to one-year in infants born with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> (OA) with no distal tracheoesophageal fistula within a population cohort. Method A prospective multicentre population cohort study was undertaken of all infants born with OA investigating clinical outcomes {{up to one}} year following initial surgery. Outcomes of infants with OA and a lower pouch fistula have previously been reported. A subgroup analysis describing the outcomes of infants with OA and no tracheoesophageal fistula, (Type A) and those with only an upper pouch fistula, (Type B) was performed. Main Results Twenty-one of 151 infants were diagnosed with Type A or B <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> (14 %). Fifteen were Type A (71 %) and 6 Type B (29 %). With the exception of an infant with Type A, who died before reconstruction; all but four infants (all Type B) underwent more than one operation. Median time to delayed primary anastomosis in infants with Type A and Type B was 82 days (75 - 89 days) (n= 7). The median time to oesophageal replacement was 94 days (89 - 147 days) (n= 8). Median length of stay for infants with Type A or B OA from first operation to first discharge was 101 days (31 - 123 days). Conclusions <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> with no distal tracheoesophageal fistula is uncommon. Infants with</p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess effect of number of associated anomalies on outcome in <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> with or without tracheoesophageal fistula patients. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of records of neonates admitted with a diagnosis of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> (EA) with or without tracheoesophageal fistula during January 2005 to May 2011. Preoperative investigation included chest X-Ray, ultrasonography of abdomen and echocardiography. Associated anomalies were grouped as minor or major depending on whether life threatening or not. Major anomalies were further sub grouped according to the involvement of single, two or > 2 organ systems. Survival was correlated with the presence of anomalies and the number of systems involved. Results: Out of 301 patients with EA, 240 survived (79. 7 %). Of these 301, 117 (38. 9 %) had no associated anomalies. Of the total 61 deaths, 59 % (36 / 61) were in patients with cardiac anomalies and 44 % (27 / 61) were in those with > 2 associated anomalies. The mortality rate was highest in those with > 2 anomalies 27 / 34 (79. 4 %), whereas survival was best in those without any associated anomalies 104 / 117 (88. 9 %). Conclusions: Apart from other factors, an association of more than two system anomalies influence the mortality in <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Reports on the {{management}} and outcome of rare conditions, such as <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia,</b> are frequently limited to case series reporting single-centre experience over many years. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify all infants born with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> in the UK and Ireland to describe current clinical practice and outcomes. Methods: This was a prospective multicentre cohort study of all infants born with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> and/or tracheo-oesophageal fistula in 2008 - 2009 in the UK and Ireland to record current clinical management and early outcomes. Results: A total of 151 infants admitted to 28 paediatric surgical units were identified. Some aspects of perioperative management were universal, including oesophageal decompression, operative technique and the use of transanastomotic tubes. However, there were a number of areas where clinical practice varied considerably, including the routine use of perioperative chest drains, postoperative contrast studies and antireflux medication, with each of these being employed in 30 - 50 per cent of patients. There was a trend towards routine postoperative ventilation. Conclusion: The prospective methodology used in this study can help identify practices that all surgeons employ and also those that few surgeons use. Areas of clinical equipoise can be recognized and avenues for further research identified. Copyright © 2013 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd. Published by John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: With {{advances}} in minimally invasive surgery, thoracoscopic repair of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> has become popular in many centres worldwide and indeed {{has been described}} as the pinnacle of neonatal surgery. Here, we report our experience in two tertiary referral centres. METHODS: Thoracoscopic technique was introduced in 2007. Thus, a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> was carried out. Patients who had thoracoscopic repair were included, and those who had open repair due to co-morbidities were excluded. Patient demographics, operative data, complications, and associated anomalies were noted. RESULTS: A total of thirty-three patients underwent thoracoscopic repair during the time period. Thirty-one were successfully repaired thoracoscopically. Two patients had conversions due to intra-operative instability. The mean body weight of the neonates was 2. 58 kg. The mean operative time was 146 min. Three patients suffered from minor anastomotic leaks, which healed on conservative management. Seven patients had anastomotic strictures, which responded successfully to endoscopic dilatation. Two patients died in the post-operative period due to pneumonia. One patient had a recurrent fistula 3 months after the primary repair, and he subsequently underwent a successful second repair. CONCLUSIONS: In experienced hands, thoracoscopic repair of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> is at least as good as open surgery but with less surgical trauma. Standard of post-operative care contributes significantly to post-operative outcome. Thoracoscopic technique is now our preferred approach...|$|E
40|$|LB {{was a male}} infant born via {{spontaneous}} vaginal delivery at term in {{a peripheral}} centre. A provisional diagnosis of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> (OA) with tracheoesophageal fistula (TOF) was made and the child was transferred to a tertiary centre for further evaluation. On day two of life he underwent repair of his <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> and division of his distal tracheoesophageal fistula. The upper and lower oesophageal segments were brought together with average tension. An extrapleural drain was inserted with the tip sutured close to the anastomosis. His post-operative course was complicated by two failed extubations secondary to respiratory distress {{and the development of}} a salivary leak. Despite repositioning of the extrapleural drain on two separate occasions, the salivary leak continued. Day 25 post-operatively he underwent direct laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and oesophagoscopy. The extrapleural drain was found to be causing tracheal compression and the tip of the drain was located within the lumen of the oesophagus. Saliva leak is not an uncommon complication of this <b>oesophageal</b> <b>atresia</b> repair. This is the first report of an extrapleural drain being found in the oesophagus causing salivary leak and tracheal compression. These complications may have been prevented by ensuring the drain did not impinge on the anastomosis site, by pulling the drain back at an earlier time or by not having used an extrapleural drain at all...|$|E
