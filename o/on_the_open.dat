5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} cyclones {{that formed}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea {{and did not}} affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E

5|$|As NHL {{play was}} set to resume for the 2005–06season, Näslund became an {{unrestricted}} free agent. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> market for several days, he re-signed with the Canucks for three more years on 3 August 2005, at $6million per season. Vancouver newspaper The Province reported that two other teams had offered deals that matched the contract he signed, but Näslund ultimately chose to remain with the Canucks because he felt the club had {{a better chance of}} winning the Stanley Cup. At the time, Näslund said he hoped to retire as a Canuck.|$|E

5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> deck.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of fertiliser subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production. It {{has been reported that}} this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> markets that remained.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next in perpetuity. Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> market.|$|E

5|$|Late 20th-century {{technical}} examination has shown {{significant differences in}} technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies {{may be the result}} of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for modifying the alphabet or the chart is to propose {{the change in}} the Journal of the IPA.

Reactions to the proposal may be published in the same or subsequent issues of the Journal (as in August 2009 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> central vowel). A formal proposal is then put to the Council of the IPA – which is elected by the membership – for further discussion and a formal vote.|$|E

5|$|USS Dictator was a single-turreted ironclad monitor, {{designed}} for speed, and to sail <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea. Originally {{to be named}} , the Navy Department preferred a more aggressive name, and thus she was named Dictator. She was the sister ship of USS Puritan. Despite her being {{designed for}} speed, design problems limited her {{to a maximum of}} 10 knots. She served in two different periods; from 1864 to 1865, serving with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and from 1869 to 1877, with the North Atlantic Fleet. After her final decommissioning in 1877, she was sold in 1883.|$|E
5|$|USS Indiana (BB-1) was {{the lead}} ship of her class and the first {{battleship}} in the United States Navy comparable to foreign battleships of the time. Authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship also pioneered {{the use of an}} intermediate battery. She was designed for coastal defense and as a result, her decks were not safe from high waves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> ocean.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
