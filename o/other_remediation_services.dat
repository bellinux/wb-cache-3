40|$|The {{solid waste}} {{industry}} (Waste Management and Remediation, NAICS 562) consists of 3 groups: Collection; Treatment and Disposal; and <b>Other</b> Waste <b>Remediation</b> <b>Services.</b> In 2010, approximately 478, 000 workers {{were employed in}} the solid waste industry with about 355, 000 in private industry. About 72, 500 of the private waste industry employees are classified as Refuse and Recyclable Materials Collectors (SOC 53 - 708) and 49, 000 of these collection workers are employed by local government agencies. Occupational traumatic injury fatality data for 2003 - 2009 have been published for public and private sector workers but occupational injury and illness data for this period are available only for private sector workers. Effective health and safety programs which include hazard recognition and controls can reduce occupational injuries and illnesses and improve work conditions in the solid waste industry.

40|$|Abstract: Administrative and Support and Waste Management and <b>Remediation</b> <b>Services</b> sector {{comprises}} establishments performing routine support {{activities for}} the day-to-day operations of other organizations. These essential activities are often undertaken in-house by establishments in many sectors of the economy. The establishments in this sector specialize {{in one or more}} of these support activities and provide these services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households. Activities performed include: office administration, hiring and placing of personnel, document preparation and similar clerical services, solicitation, collection, security and surveillance services, cleaning, and waste disposal services. This paper research provides information relating to employment and unemployment in waste management and <b>remediation</b> <b>services.</b> While most data are obtained from employer or establishment surveys, information on industry unemployment comes from a national survey of households. The following tables present an overview of the industry including the number of jobs, the unemployment rate of those previously employed in the industry, mass layoffs, data for occupations common to the industry, and projections of occupational employment change. We are gather information from Albanian projects and incentives on waste management. Why waste management is still with problems in Albania? In this paper research we want to analyze the factors for promoting and recycling the waste in Albania region.

Sample data were assembled for sixteen radionuclides and thirty-five chemical analytes. The characterization data were provided to Pacific Northwest National Laboratory {{in support of}} the Tank Waste <b>Remediation</b> <b>Services</b> Privatization Support Project. The purpose of this report is to present the results and document the methodology used in preparing the waste characterization information data set to support the Tank Waste <b>Remediation</b> <b>Services</b> Privatization Support Project. This report describes the methodology used in assembling the waste characterization information and how that information was validated by a panel of independent technical reviewers. Also, contained in this report are the various data sets created: the master data set, a subset, and an unreviewed data set. The master data set contains waste composition information for Tanks 241 -AN- 102 and - 107, 241 -AP- 102 and - 105, 241 -AW- 101; and 241 -AZ- 101 and - 102. The subset contains only the validated analytical sample data from the master data set. The unreviewed data set contains all collected but unreviewed sample data for Tanks 241 -AN- 104, - 105, and - 106; 241 -AP- 104; 241 -AW- 103 and- 105; and 241 -C- 109. The methodology used to review the waste characterization information was found to be an accurate, useful way to separate the invalid or questionable data from the more reliable data. In the future, this methodology should be considered when validating waste characterization information...|$|R
