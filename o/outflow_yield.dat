40|$|Hu 1 - 2 is a {{planetary}} nebula that contains an isolated knot located northwestern {{of the main}} nebula, which {{could be related to}} a collimated outflow. We present a subsarcsecond Hα+[N ii] image and a high-resolution, long-slit spectrum of Hu 1 - 2 that allow us to identify the southeastern counterpart of the northwestern knot and to establish their high velocity (> 340 km s^- 1), collimated bipolar outflow nature. The detection of the northwestern knot in POSS red plates allows us to carry out a proper motion analysis by combining three POSS red plates and two narrow-band Hα+[N ii] CCD images, with a time baseline of ≃ 57 yr. A proper motion of 20 ± 6 mas yr^- 1 along position angle 312 ^∘ ± 15 ^∘, and a dynamical age of 1375 ^+ 590 _- 320 yr are obtained for the bipolar outflow. The measured proper motion and the spatio-kinematical properties of the bipolar <b>outflow</b> <b>yield</b> a lower limit of 2. 7 kpc for the distance to Hu 1 - 2.

We analyzed two experiments in which the measured cumulative outflow is fitted using different variants of unimodal and bimodal functions in the inverse procedure.

Our simulations include a well-constrained prescription for galactic outflows following momentum-driven wind scalings, and a sophisticated chemical evolution model. Our simulation with no outflows reproduces observed iron abundances in X-ray emitting gas, but the oxygen abundance is too low; including <b>outflows</b> <b>yields</b> iron and oxygen abundances in good agreement with data. X-ray measures of [O/Fe] primarily reflect metal distribution mechanisms into hot gas, not {{the ratio of}} Type Ia to Type II supernovae within the group. Iron abundance increases by x 2 from z= 1 - 0 independent of group size, consistent with that seen in clusters, while [O/Fe] drops by ~ 30 %. Core entropy versus temperature is elevated over self-similar predictions regardless of outflows due to radiative cooling removing low-entropy gas, but outflows provide an additional entropy contribution below 1 keV. This results in a noticeable break in the L_X-T_X relation below 1 keV, as observed. Importantly, outflows serve to reduce the stellar content of groups to observed levels. Radial profiles from simulations are in broad agreement with observations, but there remain non-trivial discrepancies that may reflect an excess of late-time star formation in central group galaxies in our simulations. Our model with outflows suggests a connection between physical processes of galaxy formation and both pre-heating and enrichment in intragroup gas, though more definitive conclusions must await a model that simultaneously suppresses cooling flows as observed.

40|$|Mrk 231 is {{a nearby}} ultra-luminous IR galaxy exhibiting a kpc-scale, {{multi-phase}} AGN-driven outflow. This galaxy represents the best target to investigate {{in detail the}} morphology and energetics of powerful outflows, {{as well as their}} still poorly-understood expansion mechanism and impact on the host galaxy. In this work, we present the best sensitivity and angular resolution maps of the molecular disk and outflow of Mrk 231, as traced by CO(2 − 1) and (3 − 2) observations obtained with the IRAM/PdBI. In addition, we analyze archival deep Chandra and NuSTAR X-ray observations. We use this unprecedented combination of multi-wavelength data sets to constrain the physical properties of both the molecular disk and outflow, the presence of a highly-ionized ultra-fast nuclear wind, and their connection. The molecular CO(2 − 1) outflow has a size of ~ 1 kpc, and extends in all directions around the nucleus, being more prominent along the south-west to north-east direction, suggesting a wide-angle biconical geometry. The maximum projected velocity of the outflow is nearly constant out to ~ 1 kpc, thus implying that the density of the outflowing material must decrease from the nucleus outwards as ~r- 2. This suggests that either {{a large part of the}} gas leaves the flow during its expansion or that the bulk of the outflow has not yet reached out to ~ 1 kpc, thus implying a limit on its age of ~ 1 Myr. Mapping the mass and energy rates of the molecular <b>outflow</b> <b>yields</b> OF = [500 − 1000] M⊙ yr- 1 and Ėkin,OF = [7 − 10] × 10 ^(43) erg[*]s^(- 1). The total kinetic energy of the outflow is Ekin,OF is of the same order of the total energy of the molecular disk, Edisk. Remarkably, our analysis of the X-ray data reveals a nuclear ultra-fast outflow (UFO) with velocity − 20 000 km[*]s^(- 1), UFO = [0. 3 − 2. 1] M_⊙ yr^(- 1), and momentum load UFO/ rad = [0. 2 − 1. 6]. We find Ėkin,UFO ~ Ėkin,OF as predicted for outflows undergoing an energy conserving expansion. This suggests that most of the UFO kinetic energy is transferred to mechanical energy of the kpc-scale outflow, strongly supporting that the energy released during accretion of matter onto super-massive black holes is the ultimate driver of giant massive outflows. The momentum flux OF derived for the large scale outflows in Mrk 231 enables us to estimate a momentum boost OF/ UFO ≈ [30 − 60]. The ratios Ėkin,UFO/Lbol,AGN = [1 − 5] % and Ėkin,OF/Lbol,AGN = [1 − 3] % agree with the requirements of the most popular models of AGN feedback...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} some general implications of bright gamma-ray counterparts to fast radio bursts (FRBs). We show {{that even if}} these manifest in {{only a fraction of}} FRBs, gamma-ray detections with current satellites (including Swift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the energy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a magnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the intergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the required gamma-ray energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or extended emission of short gamma-ray bursts. While this can be reconciled with the rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios, the prompt <b>outflow</b> that <b>yields</b> the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to escape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a wind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB emission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio afterglow emission from gamma-ray bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated. Gravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests. Comment: 8 pages, version to appear in ApJL, minor changes (references and discussions added...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} resolves {{a longstanding}} {{discussion of a}} mathematical problem important in contaminant hydrogeology and chemical-reaction engineering, the proper mathematical description for a miscible solute undergoing longitudinal convective-dispersive transport with production, decay, and sorption in a porous medium. Initial and input concentrations may be any continuously differentiable functions {{and the problem is}} stated for a finite domain. This domain yields a mass balance which requires Robin (i. e., third-type) boundaries, which describe a continuous flux but a discontinuous resident-concentration. The discontinuity in the resident concentration at the <b>outflow</b> boundary <b>yields</b> an underdetermined system when the exit concentration is not experimentally measured. This is resolved by defining the unknown effluent concentration from a semi-infinite problem which satisfies a Dirichlet (i. e., first-type) condition at the origin. The solution is represented in a uniformly convergent series of real variables. The large volume of antecedent literature on finite solutions for convective-dispersive transport equations grew out of the historical precedents set by Danckwerts (1953) and Wehner and Wilhelm (1956) whom made simplifying assumptions of continuous boundary concentrations. This dissertation includes the demonstration that continuous-concentration hypotheses, whether rendered as Dirichlet or homogeneous Neumann (i. e., second-type) conditions, satisfy external mass conservation yet fail to provide solutions that are internally consistent with the governing equation.

Global factors, especially global risk, are significantly associated with extreme capital flow episodes. Contagion, whether through trade, banking, or geography, is also associated with stop and retrenchment episodes.

40|$|The {{question}} "what is {{the observable}} electromagnetic (EM) signature of a compact binary merger?" is an intriguing one with crucial consequences to {{the quest for}} gravitational waves (GW). Compact binary mergers are prime sources of GW, targeted by current and next generation detectors. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that these mergers eject energetic sub-relativistic (or even relativistic) outflows. This is certainly the case if the mergers produce short GRBs, but even if not, significant outflows are expected. The interaction of such outflows with the surround matter inevitably leads to a long lasting radio signal. We calculate the expected signal from these outflows (our calculations are also applicable to short GRB orphan afterglows) and we discuss their detectability. We show that the optimal search for such signal should, conveniently, take place around 1. 4 GHz. Realistic estimates of the <b>outflow</b> parameters <b>yield</b> signals {{of a few hundred}} μJy, lasting a few weeks, from sources at the detection horizon of advanced GW detectors. Followup radio observations, triggered by GW detection, could reveal the radio remnant even under unfavorable conditions. Upcoming all sky surveys can detect a few dozen, and possibly even thousands, merger remnants at any give time, thereby providing robust merger rate estimates even before the advanced GW detectors become operational. In fact, the radio transient RT 19870422 fits well the overall properties predicted by our model and we suggest that its most probable origin is a compact binary merger radio remnant...|$|R
40|$|Glaucoma is {{the second}} leading cause of {{blindness}} worldwide, affecting approximately 67 million people and costing the US healthcare system an estimated 2. 5 billion annually. The greatest risk factor for the diagnosis and progression of glaucoma is high eye pressure. All glaucoma medications and procedures are designed to reduce eye pressure, slowing disease progression and preserving vision. The eye’s aqueous humor nourishes avascular tissues in the anterior segment. It also maintains the eye’s geometry by pressurizing the globe, facilitating its ability to focus light on the retina. The balance between aqueous humor production and uptake {{is responsible for the}} pressure within the eye. Most glaucoma medications are designed to reduce pressure by increasing aqueous humor outflow, and surgeries are designed to enhance or bypass exiting outflow pathways. But, the effects of medications and procedures on a patient by patient basis on outflow remain speculative. Here, techniques for the non-invasive direct mapping and measurement of aqueous humor outflow in the living human eye are proposed. Mapping provides morphometric insights and measurements of the components of the outflow system, while the flow technique is the first to provide direct measurements of outflow, free of the assumptions plaguing other modalities. “Virtual casting” of the <b>outflow</b> system <b>yields</b> 3 D maps from which terminal branches are identified.

The MHD values at this altitude are used to inject an ionospheric outflow source of ions for the Mars Test Particle (MTP). The resulting loss distributions (in both real and velocity space) from this ionospheric source term are compared against those from high‐altitude ionization mechanisms, in particular photoionization, charge exchange, and electron impact ionization, {{each of which has}} its own source regions, albeit overlapping. For the nominal MHD settings, this ionospheric outflow source contributes only 10 % to the total O + loss rate at solar maximum, predominantly via the central tail region. This percentage has very little dependence on the initial temperature, but a change in the initial ion density or bulk velocity directly alters this loss through the central tail. A density or bulk velocity increase of a factor of 10 makes the ionospheric outflow loss comparable in magnitude to the loss from the combined high‐altitude sources. The spatial and velocity space distributions of escaping O + are examined and compared for the various source terms to identify features specific to each ion source mechanism.

The presence of PV BALs indicates that other BALs like CIV are saturated, such that variability in those lines favours clouds crossing the line of sight.

Emphasis is made on some robust results that general relativistic (magneto) hydrodynamic simulations have established regarding the aforementioned subject. 1. What do we know about the progenitor systems of sGRBs? Our knowledge about the progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts is relatively small.

In this review {{we focus on the}} metal deficient galaxies, in particular the most metal-poor ones, because they play a crucial rôle in the cosmic scenery. We first set the stage by discussing the difficult problem of defining a global metallicity and how this quantity can be measured for a given galaxy. The mechanisms that control the metallicity in a galaxy are reviewed in detail and involve many aspects of modern astrophysics: galaxy formation and evolution, massive star formation, stellar winds, chemical <b>yields,</b> <b>outflows</b> and inflows etc. Because metallicity roughly scales as the galactic mass, it is among the dwarfs that the most metal-poor galaxies are found.

The question on how they are related and may evolve from one class of objects to another is discussed.

We also consider the possibility that the gas expelled by stars in these mass ranges does not mix with the ISM instantaneously thus delaying the 3 He produced in these stars, according to standard yields, from reaching the ISM.

In many water supply systems based on open water bodies, increased turbidity during periods of high rainfall is commonplace and reduces the quality of water for human consumption. The cause of this increased turbidity is invariably rapid land conversion that induces {{a change in the}} path through which water moves within the landscape. In this respect the ratio of surface (turbid) flow / sub-surface (clean) flow increases, resulting in a significant increase in sediment loads. Limited attention has been given to the downstream off-site impacts of elevated sediment and nutrient loads associated with waters emanating from these upper basins, and to their potential impact on water quality and the livelihoods of rural communities. Inappropriate land management in upland agricultural production systems can have negative effects on the life span of reservoirs and other structures through sedimentation, and lead to water quality deterioration and degradation of downstream aquatic ecosystems, resulting in a decline in fish catches.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to the characterization of the general properties of the Long Period Comets (LPCs) family, and in particular to report on the dust environment of comet C/ 2009 P 1 (Garradd). The comet was observed at two epochs pre-perihelion, at ~ 6 AU and at ~ 2. 5 AU: broad-band images have been used to investigate its coma morphology and properties and to model the dust production rate. Comet C/ 2009 P 1 (Garradd) is one of the most active and "dust producing" LPCs ever observed, even at the large heliocentric distance rh~ 6 AU. Its coma presents a complex morphology, with subtle structures underlying the classical fan-shaped tail, and, at rh~ 2. 5 AU, also jet-like structures and spiralling outflows. In the reference aperture of radius ρ= 5 °× 104 km, the R-Afρ is 3693 ± 156 cm and 6368 ± 412 cm, in August 2010 (rh~ 6 AU) and July 2011 (rh~ 2. 5 AU), respectively. The application of a first order photometric model, under realistic assumptions on grain geometric albedo, power-law dust size distribution, phase darkening function and grain dust <b>outflow</b> velocity, <b>yielded</b> a measure of the dust production rate for the two epochs of observation of Qd= 7. 27 × 102 kg/s and Qd= 1. 37 × 103 kg/s, respectively, for a reference outflow dust velocity of vsmall= 25 m/s for small (0. 1 - 10 μm) grains and vlarge= 1 m/s for large (10 μm- 1 cm) grains. These results suggest that comet Garradd is one of the most active minor bodies observed in recent years, highly contributing to the continuous replenishment of the Interplanetary Dust Complex also in the outer Solar System, and pose important constraints on the mechanism(s) driving the cometary activity at large heliocentric distances.

This method provides new results, as well as independent test for previous measurements obtained with other techniques. Our spectral data come from observations of a low latitude, on-disk coronal hole. A potential field source surface model was used to calculate the angle between the magnetic field lines and the line of sight for each spatial bin of the observation. A fit was performed to determine the line widths and Doppler shifts parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. For each line width component we derived parallel and perpendicular ion temperatures and non-thermal velocities. The perpendicular ion temperature was cooler than off-limb polar coronal hole measurements. The parallel ion temperature was consistent with a uniform temperature of 1. 8 +/- 0. 2 x 10 ^ 6 K for each ion. Since parallel ion heating is expected to be weak, this ion temperature should reflect the proton temperature. A comparison between our results and others implies a large proton temperature gradient around 1. 02 R_sun. The non-thermal velocities are thought to be proportional to the amplitudes of various waves. Our results for the perpendicular non-thermal velocity agree with Alfvén wave amplitudes inferred from off-limb polar coronal hole line width measurements. Our parallel non-thermal velocity results are consistent with slow magnetosonic wave amplitudes inferred from Fourier analysis of time varying intensity fluctuations. Doppler shift measurements <b>yield</b> <b>outflows</b> of 5 km s^- 1 for ions formed over a broad temperature range. This differs from other studies which found a strong Doppler shift dependence on formation temperature. Comment: Accepted for The Astrophysical Journa...|$|R
40|$|Metallicity {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{that controls}} many aspects in the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. In this review {{we focus on the}} metal deficient galaxies, in particular the most metal-poor ones, because they {{play a crucial role in}} the cosmic scenery. We first set the stage by discussing the difficult problem of defining a global metallicity and how this quantity can be measured for a given galaxy. The mechanisms that control the metallicity in a galaxy are reviewed in detail and involve many aspects of modern astrophysics: galaxy formation and evolution, massive star formation, stellar winds, chemical <b>yields,</b> <b>outflows</b> and inflows etc. Because metallicity roughly scales as the galactic mass, it is among the dwarfs that the most metal-poor galaxies are found. The core of our paper reviews the considerable progress made in our understanding of the properties and the physical processes that are at work in these objects. The question on how they are related and may evolve from one class of objects to another is discussed. While discussing metal-poor galaxies in general, we present a more detailed discussion of a few very metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies like IZw 18. Although most of what is known relates to our local universe, we show that it pertains to our quest for primeval galaxies and is connected to the question of the origin of structure in the universe. We discuss what QSO absorption lines and known distant galaxies tell us already? We illustrate the importance of star-forming metal-poor galaxies for the determination of the primordial helium abundance, their use as distance indicator and discuss the possibility to detect nearly metal-free galaxies at high redshift from Lyα emission.

40|$|La microirrigation est une {{technique}} dont l'uniformité de distribution d'eau par les goutteurs est très sensible aux faibles variations de pression. Pour maîtriser ces variations, avec davantage de précision, le présent travail est basé sur une analyse hydraulique approfondie de l'écoulement aboutissant à des équations différentielles aux dérivées partielles dont la pression et la vitesse de l'eau sont des inconnues. Ces équations non linéaires sont résolues en utilisant la méthode d'intégration Runge-Kutta d'ordre quatre. Les modèles développés dans la présente étude permettent de simuler la dynamique de l'eau dans la rampe et dans le réseau et sont utilisés pour déterminer le dimensionnement optimal du réseau. Les résultats obtenus corroborent ceux publiés par d'autres auteurs ayant utilisé la méthode des volumes de contrôle ou la méthode des éléments finis. Micro-irrigation {{is recommended}} for use in arid and semi-arid countries such as Algeria. This method consists of accurately providing {{the right amount of}} water and mineral nutrients to the plant's root area. The goal is to provide water efficiently by applying it at the correct rate. However, irrigation efficiency is clearly a function of the uniformity of water application. Micro-irrigation is a technique in which a delicate instrument known as an emitter (a terminal element of the network) operating with low pressure is used. The emitter, designed and manufactured with high precision, is a system with hydraulic laws and norms considered as a black box model that discharges water at atmospheric pressure. The emitter is an element of a network that constitutes a unit called a system or physical model. Water and mineral elements are delivered to a localized place, to the level of each plant by the emitters whose discharge is a function of lateral pressure. The precision of the dosage of irrigation, which must exactly satisfy the requirement for cultivation, depends fundamentally on the design of the network. It takes into account the pressure variations, which are due not only to head loss in the lateral branches of the network but also to the land slope and to the characteristics of the emitters. Water and air temperature and the possible plugging of the emitter orifice also influence the discharge of an emitter. The network is designed to satisfy the water needs of all the plants. Uniformity of water distribution is a main criterion for network design. To understand the variations in water distribution with more precision, we based the present work on a hydraulic analysis focussed on the <b>outflow.</b> This approach <b>yields</b> differential equations in which the pressure and the velocity of water in the pipeline network are unknown; the uniformity of water distribution is largely dependent on these variables. The differential second-order equations obtained are non-linear and analytical resolution is impossible, due to the empirical relation of the discharge emitter and the energy loss relation. Thus, the solution is obtained by numerical methods using the Runge Kutta integration method. The conditions in the limit equation modelling the outflow in the lateral pipes are different from those for the submain pipe. For the lateral pipes, the velocity of water at the extremity of the downstream region is inevitably minimal, as the whole region of discharge in the last pipe section is delivered by the last emitter where the pressure is minimal (Hmin). The velocity and pressure are calculated step by step along the lateral pipe until the entrance of water into the network where the pressure is maximal (Hsmax). The algorithm developed to simulate the emitter discharge distribution from the lateral pipes is called the "RK" model, and when it includes the discharge in the submain pipe it is called the "RS" model. These two models are transcribed in Fortran language by a computer program that automates iterations and calculations. Twelve parameters are changed in turn, or per group according to the cases studied, and the choice of the optimal solution of the parameters includes: emitter coefficients (a, y and Cvf); length and diameter of lateral pipes; the submain and main network (Lr, Dr, Ls, Ds, Lp, Dp); the roughness of the pipes (C); the spacing between the emitters (Δxr); the spacing between the lateral pipes (Δxs); and the water temperature. From these data of discharge and available pressure {{to the level of the}} parcel, the model precisely describes the distribution of the pressure and the discharges to all network emitters. In this case, the total discharge and the total required pressure, the uniformity of pressure and discharges are determined for each pattern of design. The combination of structural, functional and environmental factors is applied to guarantee an optimal exploitation taking into account the limits imposed by the specific norms for the micro-irrigation and the technical limits of velocity and pressure tolerance. Parameters that influence variations in uniformity are numerous and variable, which is why it is not easy to integrate them into this phase of study. The proposed model has merit as it avoids the complex numerical method of finite elements, recommended by some researchers (BRALTS et al., 1993; KANG and NISHIYAMA, 1994). The finite element method based on matrix structuring requires an important volume of iterations and calculations that could constitute a major constraint in the case of a large network. The model of BRALTS et al. (1993) is of particular interest in this regard; our results have been confronted with those obtained with their model. Thus, the models presented in this study permit the simulation of water dynamics in micro-irrigation networks and offer the opportunity to determine the optimal design for such networks. Optimization is based on the variation of twelve classical parameters plus the associated geometric structure of the network, which was shown to be a non-negligible parameter. Optimization would not only reduce irrigation water volumes, but also fertilizer use and pumping energy. The example illustrated in Table 4 shows that although the networks deliver the same total discharge and have some similar design characteristics, the consumption of pumping energy changes from one geometric structure to another. Once a network is installed, it is impossible to change its design, so it is important to assure precision of the design calculations. This work shows promise in the simulation of the optimal design of micro-irrigation networks and also constitutes an economic means of making decisions. Moreover, the modelling results can guide field experimentation to explore other methods. Micro-irrigation can potentially solve many water shortage problems, but it requires further research in the safe reuse of low quality water and wastewater, the development of long term sustainability and the minimization salt accumulation and drainage problems...|$|R
