5|$|When Selvo {{approached}} the city, Guiscard's ships had already {{anchored in the}} harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet {{under the command of}} his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Venice</b> was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax exemption for Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the future economic and political expansion <b>of</b> <b>Venice</b> in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

This work pictured a bucentaur afloat in the Arsenale without oars or decoration save for a large wooden sculpture of Justice in the bow. A similar illustration was produced by Andrea Valvassore between 1517 and 1525.|$|E

5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} the siege <b>of</b> <b>Venice,</b> {{it was believed}} that the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E

5|$|In 1205, the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Venice</b> invaded Dalmatia {{with the}} forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, {{eventually}} becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive work was done on the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to Hillside preparatory {{school in}} Surrey as his elder {{brothers}} had done.

Hillside encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including Mark Antony in Julius Caesar and Shylock in The Merchant <b>of</b> <b>Venice.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{his last}} {{surviving}} letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still {{hoping for the}} settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge <b>of</b> <b>Venice</b> to intervene on his behalf. He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the Church of the Frari. He was survived by his sons; Masimilliano died in 1661, Francesco after 1677.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} to the structure itself, the inner city is notable for the audience hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{description}} of a method and the accompanying software, the package LABSUP, for representing C 1 interpolating surfaces. The application to the lagoon <b>of</b> <b>Venice's</b> bed is also proposed. The surfaces are built over the Delaunay triangulation and the polynomial patches used for the representation can be chosen among the Q 18 element, the Clough-Tocher or the Powell–Sabin finite elements or simply using global Bézier methods. The first three patches require {{the knowledge of the}} gradients at the nodes, or at least a suitable estimation of them. Therefore, interesting in itself is the derivative estimation process based on the minimization of the energy functional associated with the interpolant. For the representation of the lagoon <b>of</b> <b>Venice's</b> bed we only used the reduced Clough-Tocher finite element, due to the high number of points involved for which one needs to compute the Delaunay triangulation, and simply the partial derivatives of first order. A brief description of the software modules together with some graphical results of parts of the lagoon <b>of</b> <b>Venice's</b> bed are also presented...|$|R
