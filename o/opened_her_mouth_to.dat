60|$|Mrs. Crocker <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> speak, closed it, re-opened it. Then {{she found}} that {{she had nothing to}} say.|$|E
60|$|Maud had <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> explain, to {{say that}} it was all a mistake. She closed it again without speaking.|$|E
6000|$|Ver. 11. [...] "And now {{art thou}} cursed from the earth, which hath <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> receive thy brother's blood from thy hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate {{was about}} <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> make an indignant reply, when he exclaimed, [...] "But here comes a boat from the town; {{perhaps it is}} your father!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Liza <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> retort: he {{pops the}} half {{chocolate}} into it]. You shall have boxes of them, barrels of them, every day. You shall live on them. Eh? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do I know if she's an artist? She won't <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> me; {{what she}} wants is to make me say things to her. She does make me--I don't know how--and she sits there gaping at me with her big eyes. They look like open pockets!" ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{searched for}} strawberries, {{but she found}} none, and {{returned}} home in a very bad temper. When she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> tell her mother what had befallen her in the wood, a toad jumped out, so that everyone was quite disgusted with her.|$|E
60|$|For a {{while the}} two women sat still, waiting the doctor's coming, and Liza lay gazing vacantly at the wall, panting for breath. Sometimes Jim crossed her mind, and she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> call for him, but in her despair she {{restrained}} herself.|$|E
60|$|Olive made no answer, but {{handed him}} the quarter with which he retired to make change. Mrs. Easterfield <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> speak, but Olive put her finger on her lips and shook her head; the {{situation}} astonished her, {{but she did not}} wish to ask that stranger to explain it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] {{she said}} with perfect assurance. [...] "I tell you she daren't <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> him. And she isn't as silly as she looks. She wouldn't give us away. She knows a trick worth two of that. She'll help--that's what she'll do, if she dares do {{anything}} at all." ...|$|R
60|$|Emily {{moved off}} in disgust. Lettie <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> sharply <b>to</b> speak, but {{remained}} silent.|$|R
50|$|The rest of {{the tribe}} can prevent a {{deceased}} woman from returning as a langsuyar by putting glass beads {{in the mouth of}} the corpse, a hen's egg under the armpits, and needles in the palms of the hands. It is believed that if this is done, the deceased woman cannot become a langsuyar since she cannot <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> shriek or wave <b>her</b> arms and <b>open</b> and close <b>her</b> hands while flying.|$|R
6000|$|The {{girl had}} never heard of such a name, and did not like it, so she {{determined}} to pay no attention; but as she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> tell her father that her husband must be called Njal, she found herself answering instead: 'If I do marry it will be to no one except Habogi.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> speak, {{but said}} nothing, being too {{intrigued}} by this sudden and most sweet flattery. Her mere beauty had oft been praised, {{and in terms}} that glowed like fire. But what was that compared with this fine appreciation of her less obvious mental parts--and that from one who had seen the world? ...|$|E
6000|$|The Daughter of the House <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> say: [...] "I do {{not like}} her. She had no enthusiasm, or real goodness, {{to give up her}} work so soon and for such reasons." [...] But she {{suddenly}} reflected that Mary had been the speaker's wife, and she shut her mouth with a little vicious snap.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic critic Thom Jurek gave Sleepless Nights a four-star rating out of five, saying [...] "Loveless takes each {{of these}} cuts deep into the well of her heart and let's them rip." [...] Jurek also said that Emory Gordy, Jr., Loveless' husband and producer, [...] "showers songs in emotion and Loveless simply needs <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> tell {{the story behind the}} words to get it across to the listener, where it resonates deeply." ...|$|R
60|$|Jane {{drew back}} with a startled air, and <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> all agog, <b>to</b> let in a deep breath.|$|R
5000|$|At EA's Studio Showcase on July 20, 2010, {{more details}} about the game were shown, {{including}} its current title, Alice: Madness Returns. In addition to further pieces of concept art and actual, in-game screenshots, the first official teaser was released. Despite (or perhaps because of) the fan video eight months prior, it also portrays Alice in therapy: after being hypnotized by her doctor in a bizarre office filled with dismembered arms hanging from the ceiling, as she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> speak, large amounts of blood and teeth pour out. As the game title appears, a whispering voice is heard saying, [...] "What have you done?" ...|$|R
60|$|Gombauld ceased talking, and Mary, {{flushed and}} outraged, <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> refute him. But {{she was too}} slow. Before she could utter a word Mr. Scogan's fluty voice had {{pronounced}} the opening phrases of a discourse. There was no hope of getting {{so much as a}} word in edgeways; Mary had perforce to resign herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "What for? What for?" [...] Sandra would say, {{putting the}} book back, and strolling to the looking-glass and {{pressing}} her hair. And Miss Edwards would be startled at dinner, as she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> admit roast mutton, by Sandra's sudden solicitude: [...] "Are you happy, Miss Edwards?"--a thing Cissy Edwards hadn't thought of for years.|$|E
60|$|At this Pattycake {{began to}} scream with rage, {{and threw her}} shoe {{straight}} at his head. Timtom dodged the shoe and {{paid no attention to}} the naughty action, but continued to look at the pretty Princess smilingly. Seeing this, Pattycake rushed forward and seizing him by his hair began to pull with all her strength. At the same time she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> scream, and while it was open Timtom threw the golden pill down her throat.|$|E
50|$|As Bobbie {{prepares for}} a live show {{where she will}} open for George Strait, her drunken father comes into her {{dressing}} room (escorted by security). After exchanging harsh words, Bobbie tells him she hates him, wishes she'd never met him, and tells him to get out. When he refuses and becomes violent Strait intervenes and has a physical altercation with him. She has, sadly, broken the third rule - never break a promise. As she heads out on stage, a strong wind blows and takes her voice - her gift - away with it. When Bobbie <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> sing, only a hoarse noise issues forth. She runs from the stage.|$|R
5000|$|Gaga's {{performance}} {{also received}} mixed reviews from critics. Matt Zoller Sietz of Vulture called Gaga [...] "terrible {{here in the}} way that Madonna was terrible in a lot of her '90s films, at once too poised and too blank." [...] David Weigand of the San Francisco Chronicle said Gaga [...] "makes an enormous visual impact, but the minute she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> deliver a line, it's obvious that acting just isn't one of her many talents." [...] Ben Travers of IndieWire wrote that he [...] "wouldn't {{go so far as to}} say Gaga's talent adds much to the proceedings, but her presence - and the manner in which its captured - certainly does." ...|$|R
5000|$|Large {{statue of}} the Queen at the Temple of Ramesses II at Akhmin. On the dorsal pillar the Queen is {{identified}} as [...] "... whose forehead is beautiful bearing the uraeus, the beloved of her Lord, the great one the harem of Amen-Re, player of Mut, menat player of Hathor, songstress of Atum, King's Daughter of ? [...]. MritImn.w." [...] "the fair of face, beautiful in the palace, the Beloved of the Lord of the Two Lands, she who is beside her Lord as Sothis is beside Orion, one is pleased with what is spoken when she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> pacify the Lord of the Two Lands, King's Daughter in the palace ? of the Lord of many festivals ? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, bless us--an' our wittles," [...] said Mrs Rampy, {{suddenly}} shutting {{her eyes}} as she <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>to</b> the intense surprise of her guests. [...] "Now then," [...] she added, in a tone of great relief, [...] "go a-'ead w'en you've got the chance. There's more w'ere that come from. 'And about the cake, Mrs Blathers, like a good creetur. An' it ain't much o' this blow-hout you owes to me. I on'y supplied the sugar, 'cause that was in the 'ouse anyways." ...|$|E
60|$|A Tartar {{came forward}} quietly {{from the crowd}} with a curved sword. At a word from Niaz he raised the sword aloft in the air. One second it glanced bright in the torchlight; the next second a Turcoman's head lay rolling in the dust, and a little torrent of blood spurted {{suddenly}} from the still kneeling corpse. Olga <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> scream at the horrid sight, but happily her voice at once forsook her as in a dream, and she stood fixed to the spot in a perfect fascination of awe and terror.|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} release the hand Joe had grasped in his broad palm, but in vain; the more she {{struggled}} the firmer was his hold. A frown wrinkled her brow and her eyes sparkled with spirit. She saw the fur-trader's wife looking out of the window, and remembered laughing and telling the good woman {{she did not like}} this young man; it was, perhaps, because she feared those sharp eyes that she resented his audacity. She <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> rebuke him; but no words came. Joe had bent his head and softly closed her lips with his own.|$|E
6000|$|Then, as {{the only}} way by which she could express her displeasure with her surroundings, the child <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> tiny <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> its fullest extent, and from the little pink throat came as shrill a scream as was ever uttered by one of [...] "old Mis' Carter's kids." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is a cold}} January {{morning and}} Shetland lies buried beneath a deep layer of snow. Trudging home, Fran Hunter notices a vivid splash of colour on the white ground, ravens {{circling}} above. It is the strangled body of her teenage neighbour Catherine Ross. As Fran <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> scream, the ravens continue their deadly dance ...The locals on the quiet island stubbornly focus their gaze on one man—loner and simpleton Magnus Tait, who was the prime suspect {{a number of years}} earlier when a young girl named Catriona disappeared. But when police insist on enlarging their investigation, a veil of suspicion and fear is thrown over the entire community. For the first time in years, Catherine's neighbours nervously lock their doors, whilst a killer lives on in their midst.|$|R
50|$|The fourth part {{moves forward}} {{a few more}} years. Wilf has died from the {{complications}} of a stroke, and Nancy takes the opportunity to travel. She is in a large city when she randomly encounters Ollie. She and Ollie have a long discussion, in which he discusses his travels with Tessa in the United States. He says that funding for research disappeared after World War II, forcing him and Tessa {{to work on the}} vaudeville circuit. The strain of performing gave Tessa horrible headaches and gradually eroded her powers, but she and he developed an intricate system with which to deceive their audiences. Eventually, Ollie says, Tessa died. Nancy does not contradict him. He drives her back to her hotel, and she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> invite him up. Before she speaks, however, Ollie refuses. Nancy resolves to find Tessa and bring her to Ollie. She does not succeed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{for that}} matter--" [...] She tossed her head, <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> {{complete}} the retort, then changed her mind. [...] "I shall {{go on with}} my history. Dad had practically nothing left, {{and he decided to}} return to the sea. He'd always loved it, and I half believe that he was glad things had happened as they did. He was like a boy again, busy with plans and preparations from morning till night. He used to sit up half the night talking things over with me. That was after I had shown him that I was really resolved to go along.|$|E
60|$|But Isa had by {{no means}} as yet done. So far the {{interview}} had progressed exactly as she had anticipated. She had never supposed it possible that her uncle would grant her so important a request {{as soon as she}} <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> ask it. She had not for a moment expected that things would go so easily with her. Indeed she had never expected that any success would attend her efforts; but, if any success were possible, the work which must achieve that success must now commence. It was necessary that she should first state her request plainly before she began to urge it with such eloquence as she had at her command.|$|E
60|$|While {{the maid}} shadowed him and Mother <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> rebuke him, Father boldly {{pushed open the}} door on the right. He had guessed correctly. It was a bedroom. Mother haughtily stayed {{in the center of the}} living-room, but she couldn't help glancing through the open door, and she sighed enviously as she saw the splendor of twin beds, with a little table and an {{electric}} light between them, and the open door of a tiled bathroom. It was too much that the mistress of the house should have left her canary-yellow silk sweater on the foot of one bed. Mother had wanted a silk sweater ever since she had beheld one flaunted on Cape Cod.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could have}} {{understood}} it," [...] he moaned, [...] "if she had dropped on me while I was--well, I suppose, {{you might say}} lecturing her. She had listened to it like a lamb--hadn't <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> except <b>to</b> say 'yes, dear,' or 'no, dear.' Then, when I only asked her if she'd like a new hat, she goes suddenly raving mad. I never saw a woman go so mad." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{then turns}} into an alley. By {{now it is}} getting darker, and stars are {{starting}} to appear. We learn he {{is on his way}} to meet Norma. He sees a woman walking down the alleyway, and he rushes up to her. He calls her name, and she looks around. He says: [...] "I've bought some flowers for you, Norma."The woman tells him: [...] "You must be mistaken, my name is-"She then sees a hammer in his pocket and <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> scream. The man kills the woman because she isn't Norma, just as he has done five times previously. After an unspecified amount of time, he leaves the alleyway. Through the narrator, we find out that [...] "Norma" [...] has been dead for ten years, and the grief most likely drove the man to insanity, convincing himself that nearly every woman is Norma. The young man says that his name is Love. He feels optimistic, sure that he will find Norma some day soon.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the show}} itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the New York Post proclaimed, [...] "Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use {{trying to pick}} a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a {{consistent}} characterization and stay with it to the show's end. And when she <b>opens</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> sing, she sings!" [...] William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram said that Merman was [...] "bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time" [...] and asserted that the show itself was {{comparable to those of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, [...] "For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in Annie have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark".|$|R
