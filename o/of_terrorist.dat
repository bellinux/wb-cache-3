5|$|Bush had {{originally}} outlined an ambitious domestic agenda, but his priorities were significantly altered following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Wars were waged in Afghanistan and Iraq, {{and there were}} significant domestic debates regarding immigration, healthcare, Social Security, economic policy, and treatment <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> detainees. Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings steadily declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.|$|E
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks, the road was {{closed to the public}} in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E
5|$|In the {{anticipation}} <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks, particularly from militants, security measures are intensified, especially {{in major cities}} such as Delhi and Mumbai and in troubled states such as Jammu and Kashmir.

5|$|In {{assessing}} peacefulness, the GPI {{investigates the}} extent to which countries are involved in ongoing domestic and international conflicts. It also seeks to evaluate the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as a safety and security in society. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|Like much of Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli remains {{prone to}} {{communal}} tensions based {{on religion and}} ethnicity. There have been occasional outbreaks of violence against Sri Lankans. In 2009, the offices of a Sri Lankan airline were attacked in the city. In September 2012, two groups of Sri Lankan pilgrims who had visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni and the Poondi Madha Basilica had their buses attacked in Tiruchirappalli {{by a group of}} Tamil activists. Owing to a series <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks in Indian cities since 2000, security has been increased at sites such as Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.|$|E
5|$|Operation Labrador was a false flag {{operation}} {{carried out}} by the Yugoslav Air Force's Counterintelligence Service (KOS) in the Croatian capital city of Zagreb during {{the early stages of the}} Croatian War of Independence. It was devised as a series <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks intended to create an image of Croatia as a pro-fascist state. Two bombings were carried out on 19 August 1991, with one at the Jewish Community Centre and a second near Jewish graves at the Mirogoj Cemetery; there were no casualties. Additional attacks targeted the national railway network and were designed to implicate the Croatian President. Operation Labrador was complemented by Operation Opera — a propaganda campaign devised by the KOS to feed disinformation to the media.|$|E

5|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} been a number <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks, {{including}} explosions in a landmark holy place, a court and a temple. The 2006 Varanasi bombings were a series of bombings that occurred across the Hindu holy city of Varanasi on 7 March 2006. At least 28 people were killed and as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 in the crowded Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near the waiting area next to the travel office. Initially, another blast was reported in the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The Greater London Council was {{abolished}} in 1986, {{which left}} London without a central administration until 2000 when London-wide government was restored, {{with the creation}} of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, making London the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times. On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{government}} did not raise the Homeland Security Advisory System terrorist threat level, orange at the time (high risk <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks), following the attack.

The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.|$|E

5|$|From 1990 to 2010, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in violence in the hitherto largely peaceful city. Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the city was rocked by the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992–93 in which more than 1,000people were killed. On 12 March 1993, a series of 13 co-ordinated bombings at several city landmarks by Islamic extremists and the Bombay underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries. In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains. In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels. The blasts that occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar on 13 July 2011 were the latest in the series <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks in Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the Australian {{government}} decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it {{saw as the}} risk <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million. Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers. The first {{was transferred to the}} RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No.37 Squadron. They were formed into No.33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2February 1981. The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, a task that had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.|$|E
5|$|Opeth was {{scheduled}} to perform in Jordan without a crew due to the fear <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks in the Middle East. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having an anxiety attack and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show. In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour. Opeth decided against cancelling {{the remainder of the}} tour, with Lopez's drum technician filling in for two concerts. Lopez promised that he would return to the tour as soon as he could, but two shows later Opeth asked Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan to fill in. Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the Deliverance and Damnation tour. Per Wiberg also joined the band on tour to perform keyboards, {{after more than a year}} on tour.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the ship date back to 4 March 2005, in a {{proposal}} drafted by then-Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (which is now a nonexistent entity), Björn Bjarnason, regarding {{the purchase of a}} new vessel, in order to replace the aging ICGV Óðinn, and aircraft for the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Althing decided that this was an exigent matter, and so a high priority was placed upon the proposal. A needs analysis pertaining to the acquisition of a multi-purpose vessel and aircraft for the ICG was initiated on 31 September 2005. The main demands were that the vessel should be designed for rescue work and patrolling, pollution prevention, fuelling search and rescue helicopters in flight, and meeting civil defence requirements anywhere around the country. In addition, it was to be equipped for response to, and prevention <b>of,</b> <b>terrorist</b> threats and be suitable for operations involving the police or customs authorities, and for all types of rescue and salvage work. The bollard pull of the vessel was to take account of the greatly increased volume of passenger and cargo shipping in Iceland’s economic zone and coastal waters.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} Rainbow Program's deactivation, {{there is a}} {{resurgence}} <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> activities, with the White Mask being the most prominent. The terrorists' goals are unknown, yet they are causing chaos across the world. To counter this rising threat, the program is reactivated by a new leader who is simply known as Six (voiced by Angela Bassett). Six assembles a group of special forces operatives from different countries to face and combat the White Masks. Recruits go through multiple exercises {{to prepare them for}} future encounters with the White Masks, training to perform hostage rescue and bomb disposal. Eventually, the White Masks launch a chemical attack on a university (called Bartlett University), and the recruits are sent to disarm the bombs and eliminate the enemy presence. The operation is a massive success, though there are casualties. The story ends with Six affirming that the reactivation of Team Rainbow is the best and only choice in a time filled with risks and uncertainties. Team Rainbow is ready for their next mission – to hunt down the leader of their enemy – and they stand prepared to protect and defend their nation from terrorists.|$|E

40|$|This paper deals {{dynamically}} {{with the}} question of how recruitment to terror organizations is influenced by counter-terror operations. This is done within a optimal control model, where the key state is the (relative) number <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> and the key controls are two types of counter-terror tactics, one (“water”) that does not one (“fire”) that does provoke re-cruitment <b>of</b> new <b>terrorists.</b> The model is nonlinear and does not admit analytical solutions, but an efficient numerical implementation of Pontrya-gin’s Minimum Principle allows for solution with base case parameters and considerable sensitivity analysis. Generally this model yields two different steady states, one where the terror-organization is nearly eradicated and one with a high number <b>of</b> <b>terrorists.</b> Whereas water strategies are used at almost any time, it can be optimal not to use fire strategies if the number <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> is below a certain threshold. ...|$|R
