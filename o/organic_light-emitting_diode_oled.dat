25|$|An <b>organic</b> <b>{{light-emitting}}</b> <b>diode</b> (<b>OLED)</b> is a {{light-emitting diode}} (LED) {{in which the}} emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light {{in response to an}} electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, {{at least one of these}} electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.|$|E

25|$|The Army Research Laboratory {{extended}} {{funding for}} the Arizona State University Flexible Display Center (FDC) in 2009 with a $50million grant. The university has partnered with the Pentagon on such endeavors since 2004 with an initial $43.7million grant. In 2012, researchers at the center created the world’s largest flexible full-color <b>organic</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (<b>OLED),</b> {{which at the time}} was 7.4 inches. The following year, the FEDC staff broke their own world record, producing a 14.7-inch version of the display. The technology delivers high-performance while remaining cost-effective during the manufacturing process. Vibrant colors, high switching speeds for video and reduced power consumption are some of the features the center has been able to successfully integrate into the technology. In 2012, ASU successfully eliminated the need for specialized equipment and processing, thereby reducing costs compared to competitive approaches.|$|E
