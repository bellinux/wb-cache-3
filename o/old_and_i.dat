5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty years <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E
500|$|On {{the last}} {{evening of the}} visit, as they lie in their {{respective}} beds, the chief protagonists muse on their personal histories in a surreal series of interwoven dialogues. Nixon and Pat recall the struggles of their youth; Nixon evokes wartime memories ("Sitting round the radio"). Mao and Chiang Ch'ing dance together, as the Chairman remembers [...] "the tasty little starlet" [...] who came to his headquarters {{in the early days}} of the revolution. As they reminisce, Chiang Ch'ing asserts that [...] "the revolution must not end". Chou meditates alone; the opera finishes on a thoughtful note with his aria [...] "I am <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> cannot sleep", asking: [...] "How much of what we did was good?" [...] The early morning birdcalls are summoning him to resume his work, while [...] "outside this room the chill of grace lies heavy on the morning grass".|$|E

500|$|Waxy first {{stood at}} Lewes {{for a fee}} of 10 guineas per mare and a groom fee of 10 shillings. In September 1803, Sir Ferdinando Poole offered to sell Waxy for 700 guineas to William Lightfoot, an agent sent to buy horses for Virginian turfman John Tayloe. Lightfoot refused to buy Waxy, writing to Tayloe, [...] "he has lost an eye, and is {{thirteen}} years <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think his health bad." [...] Instead Lightfoot purchased Waxy's half-sister Keren Happuch who was covered by Waxy that year. It is unclear how Waxy lost his eye, its loss occurring sometime between 1797 and 1803. Sir Ferdinando Poole died on 8 June 1804, and Waxy was then acquired by the Duke of Grafton and relocated to the Euston Hall stud near Newmarket. Under the Duke's ownership, his fee increased to 25 guineas per mare and he covered 40 mares per season.|$|E
500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of my {{grandfather}} Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died when my mother was nine years <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E
500|$|Van Leer's only {{comment to}} the media came on Saturday, December 3, 1955: [...] "I am 60 years <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have never broken a contract. I {{do not intend to}} start now". At a tense meeting of the Board of Regents on Monday, it was decided that Georgia Tech would be allowed to play in the Sugar Bowl. The new policy was that [...] "all laws, customs and traditions of host states would be {{respected}} but all games played in Georgia would be segregated", a policy that would remain until 1963. The regents, with the exception of Tech alumnus David Rice, condemned the [...] "riotous" [...] behavior of Tech students. Rice instead criticized Marvin Griffin, and was lauded by The Technique as the [...] "only man with the moral conviction to stand up against Griffin,... and co". Ironically, Tech defeated Pittsburgh 7–0 because of a pass interference call on the black player. Van Leer died six weeks after this incident, on January 23, 1956; the stress of the controversy was believed to have shortened his life.|$|E

500|$|... "Hannah Banana" [...] {{was written}} by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can." [...] The song in the episode sung by Cyrus {{was written by}} Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy.|$|E

[...] "School was far from my house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn't afford a bicycle. Because our family life was hard, only my mother was working to support the whole family <b>and</b> she became <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>older</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to pay the tuition for the painting school." [...] Later, the school allowed Vann Nath to work there {{in exchange for the}} tuition fee. After two years, he was able to profit from his own painting work.|$|R

2500|$|Starting on August 3, 1948, during further HUAC hearings, Bentley {{received}} corroboration from Whittaker Chambers, who, under subpoena by HUAC, {{testified that}} he knew at lest two of Bentley contacts, Victor Perlo and Charles Kramer as communists and members of his earlier Ware Group. He also supported her charge that Harry Dexter White, a prominent economist who {{had worked in the}} Treasury Department, was a Communist sympathizer. [...] Of his testimony compared to hers, Chambers wrote in his memoir: [...] I knew that I was simply back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the current testimony. [...] The things that I had to tell were ten years <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had only to let the shadows, dust and cobwebs conspicuously drape them to leave the stand unscathed.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, she {{appeared}} {{at a dinner}} in London to accept the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal. She gave an interview to The Guardian in which she lamented the lack of technique in young opera singers and the dearth of good teachers. By this time {{she was no longer}} giving master classes herself; when asked by Italian journalists in May 2007 why this was, she replied: [...] "Because I'm 80 years <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really don't {{want to have anything to}} do with opera any more, although I do sit on the juries of singing competitions." [...] The Cardiff Singer of the World competition was the one that Sutherland was most closely associated with after her retirement. She began her regular involvement with the event in 1993, serving on the jury five consecutive times and later, in 2003, becoming its patron.|$|E
2500|$|The 16 year–old actress Lacey Turner {{was cast}} in the role. Turner had {{originally}} gone to audition for {{a part in the}} Miller family, but was given the part of Stacey instead. Commenting on her role, Turner said [...] "I was speechless when I found out that I had been cast as Stacey Slater especially as I knew I would be working with Jessie Wallace who is my favourite actress. I've watched the show since I was about four years <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to live in a house that backed onto the EastEnders set so I used to watch them filming all the time. I always dreamt of being on the show and so I can't believe that I've fulfilled my greatest ambition!" [...] She added, [...] "I'm not like Stacey at all although I love playing her! She's a real challenge [...] I {{think people are going to}} love to hate her like they did with [...] Janine Butcher." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Santos took on {{the lead}} role in Joel Lamangan's drama Sabel. Based in part on Joanne Woodward's The Three Faces of Eve, the film, under the {{manuscript}} of Ricky Lee, stars Santos as the titular lead who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) formerly known as multiple personality disorder—eventually charged with murder. Gigi Javier-Alfonso of The Philippine Daily Tribune noted, [...] "Santos is superior in her performance in this brave new film [...] quite sympathetic and certainly not painted as villain", whilst Lito B. Zulueta of The Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked [...] "It [...] is absorbing to watch because of its assay at the riddle of sexuality {{as well as the}} performance of Santos". Asked about her significant career milestone, Santos stated [...] " [...] I feel that this is my transition film because {{this is the first time}} I did a film like this. I'm already 26 years <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it is hightime that I do films like this." [...] She won several awards for her performance, including the Gawad Urian Award, the Entertainment Press Society's Golden Screen Award and the Film Academy of the Philippines Award for Best Actress in a Lead Role.|$|E

Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on [...] on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that [...] "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do you think you have a tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke [...] "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people something to think about when they went to the polls.|$|E
