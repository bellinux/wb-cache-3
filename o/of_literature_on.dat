He attacked the poetry of T. S. Eliot, and the talk was praised by Arthur Quiller-Couch and Augustus John.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{do not see}} {{the case}} as setting a precedent because the unique circumstances surrounding the Trail smelter have been articulated and discussed multiple times, therefore the arguments that arise for transboundary international law are divorced from the context they are derived from; this distorts the decisions made in cases like the Trail Arbitration.

25|$|Measuring {{innovation}} is inherently {{difficult as it}} implies commensurability so that comparisons {{can be made in}} quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service. Nevertheless, Edison et al. in their review <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> innovation management found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.|$|E
25|$|Radiating pain is {{slightly}} different from referred pain; for example, the pain {{related to a}} myocardial infarction could either be referred or radiating pain from the chest. Referred pain is when the pain is located away from or adjacent to the organ involved; for instance, when a person has pain only in their jaw or left arm, {{but not in the}} chest. Referred pain has been described since the late 1880s. Despite an increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> the subject, the biological mechanism of referred pain is unknown, although there are several hypotheses.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the {{bureaucracy}} was dominated by El Temür, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the empire, the actual impact of the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star <b>of</b> <b>Literature</b> <b>on</b> the government as a whole was limited. El Temür eventually seized control of the academy in early 1332, just six months before the death of Tugh Temür. The academy had come to an end after Tugh Temür's death. Although El Tegüs was still alive, on his deathbed Tugh Temür expressed remorse for what he had done to his elder brother, Kusala, and his intention to pass the throne to Toghon Temür. After Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür died on 2 September 1332, Kuśala's second son Rinchinbal was installed by El Temür only at the age of six because Toghon Temür was far away from the central government.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{publication}} of his Webster, scholars turned to him for editorial advice: he helped in the preparation of Hayward's Nonesuch Donne (1929), Housman's More Poems (1936), and Theodore Redpath's Songs and Sonets of John Donne (1956). He also performed an editorial and advisory role for Christopher Sandford at the Golden Cockerel Press, where he introduced Victor Scholderer's New Hellenic typeface (1937). A number of his verse translations from Greek and Latin, with engravings by John Buckland Wright, were published in collectors' editions by the Golden Cockerel Press and Folio Society. In the middle years of his career he was in demand as an invitation lecturer, giving seven BBC wireless talks in 1930, on Dorothy Osborne and on the Victorian Poets, delivering the 1933 Warton Lecture on English Poetry to the British Academy, lecturing at the Royal Institution on Classicism and Romanticism (1935) and at the Royal Society <b>of</b> <b>Literature</b> <b>on</b> travel writing (1937), and, as part of a British Council drive to counter Soviet propaganda, lecturing in German on European literature to packed halls at the British Information Centre in West Berlin in October 1948 during the Berlin Blockade.|$|E

A former professor noted that she [...] "stood out from the empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece <b>of</b> <b>literature</b> <b>on</b> a shelf of cheap paperbacks." [...] She held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in Bullock's-Wilshire department store, and taught touch typing and shorthand at a high school. She also supplemented her income by working as an extra and bit player in the film industry, for which she took several screen tests. In this capacity she made brief appearances in the films Becky Sharp (1935), The Great Ziegfeld (1936), and Small Town Girl (1936). (People have spotted her in the 1936 Dancing Pirate as well.) In some cases she ended up on the cutting room floor, such as with her spoken lines in Becky Sharp.
