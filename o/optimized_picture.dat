40|$|Abstract — Picture {{quality and}} {{statistical}} undetectability {{are two main}} issues related to steganography techniques. In this paper, a closed-loop computing framework is proposed that iteratively searches proper modifications of pixels/coefficients to enhance a base steganographic scheme with <b>optimized</b> <b>picture</b> quality and higher anti-steganalysis capability. To achieve this goal, an anti-steganalysis tester and an embedding controller based on the optimization algorithm with a cost function are incorporated into the processing loop to conduct the convergence of searches. The cost function integrates several performance indices, namely, the mean square error, the human visual system (HVS) deviation, and the differences in statistical features, and guides a proper direction during optimization.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} error-resilient Internet video {{transmission}} using path diversity and ratedistortion <b>optimized</b> reference <b>picture</b> selection. Under this scheme, the optimal packet dependency is determined adapting to network characteristics and video content, {{to achieve a}} better trade-off between coding efficiency and forming independent streams to increase error-resilience. The optimization is achieved within a rate-distortion framework, so that the expected end-to-end distortion is minimized under the given rate constraint. The expected distortion {{is calculated based on}} an accurate binary tree modeling with the effects of channel loss and error concealment taken into account. With the aid of active probing, packets are sent across multiple available paths according to a transmission policy which takes advantage of path diversity and seeks to minimize the loss rate. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides significant diversity gain, as well as gains over video redundancy coding and the NACK mode of conventional reference picture selection...|$|R
40|$|Research into haptic object {{recognition}} suggests that matching stimulus input {{to a system}} of geon-like structural descriptions may {{play an important role in}} this perceptual modality, as it does in vision. The recognition of objects from tactile pictures or diagrams is an important skill for blind people, yet relatively little research has been conducted in attempts to <b>optimize</b> tactile <b>picture</b> design. This paper explains a novel, theoretically-motivated design for constructing tactile pictures (the TexyForm system). In a single experiment contrasting blindfolded sighted, early blind, and late blind participants, we demonstrate that TexyForm pictures were identified significantly more frequently than standard, visually realistic, tactile pictures. In particular, early blind participants improved their identification from 12. 5 % with visually realistic pictures to 50 % with TexyForm pictures. All participants rated the TexyForm pictures as preferable to visually realistic pictures. We argue that using current theoretical knowledge and experimental data to drive tactile picture design is likely to lead to improvements in the usability of materials for blind people...|$|R

In particular, we exploit the advanced bit stream switching capabilities using SP/SI pictures defined in the H. 264 /MPEG- 4 AVC standard. For both types of switching <b>pictures,</b> <b>optimized</b> encoders are developed. We introduce a framework for dynamic switching and frame scheduling. For this purpose we define an appropriate abstract representation for media encoded for video streaming, {{as well as for}} the characteristics of wireless variable bit rate channels. The achievable performance gains over H. 264 /MPEG- 4 AVC with constant bit rate (CBR) encoding are shown for wireless video streaming over enhanced GPRS (EGPRS).|$|R
500|$|The venue cost NOK83.6 million, and {{was inaugurated}} on 28November 1992 with an {{international}} biathlon competition. [...] In December 1992, the LOOC stated {{that they wanted to}} upgrade the stadium spectator capacity, but that the transport systems would not allow more people. In 1993, the stadium had World Cup tournaments in biathlon and cross-country skiing as a trial before the Olympics. During several events, the computer system controlling the scoreboard and television scores collapsed. President Johan Baumann of the Norwegian Ski Federation criticized the venue and demanded that a new stadium be built. He stated that the stadium had been built to <b>optimize</b> television <b>pictures,</b> and that it had insufficient facilities for the spectators. In particular, he criticized the fact that the spectators were too far away from the skiers and the lack of a television screen and more scoreboards. In May, the LOOC announced that the stadium would be expanded for another 6,000 people before the Olympics. On 7September, the ownership of the venue was transferred from the LOOC to Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiavekst, which later changed its name to Lillehammer Olympiapark. In October, the forest along the tracks were partially cleared to allow spectators without tickets to watch the events.|$|R
40|$|Significant perceptual {{improvements}} can {{be gained}} in the coding of stereoscopic videos, as is illustrated here by modifying the adaptive quantization of an MPEG- 2 codec. Applying human visual properties to MPEG- 2 's temporal scalability framework, a perceptual adaptive quantization approach to stereoscopic video coding is presented. To <b>optimize</b> the perceived <b>picture</b> {{quality of the}} reconstructed stereo images, binocular visibility of stereo coding artifacts is investigated, including image fusion and visual masking. Four normalized indicators are introduced to account for 3 D visual artifacts, and are incorporated to determine the quantization parameters. They are (1) prediction accuracy, (2) prediction correlation, (3) fusion indicator, and (4) texture intensity. Simulations indicate the importance of perceptual stereo coding, with improvements in overall stereo quality and reductions in binocular artifacts. 1.

40|$|Antibiotics are a {{therapeutic}} class widely found inenvironmental matrices and extensively studied {{due to its}} persistence and implications for multi-resistant bacteria development. Degradation of four fluoroquinolone antibiotics, namely Ofloxacin (OFL), Norfloxacin (NOR), Ciprofloxacin (CPF) and Moxifloxacin (MOX), at 10 mg L- 1 using a mixed bacterial culture, was assessed for 60 days. The assays were followed by a developed and validated analytical method of HPLC with Fluorescence Detection using a Luna PFP (2) 3 µm column.

40|$|International audienceAndroid code smells are bad {{implementation}} practices within Android applications (or apps) {{that may}} lead to poor software quality. These code smells are known to degrade the performance of apps and {{to have an impact on}} energy consumption. However, few studies have assessed the positive impact on energy consumption when correcting code smells. In this paper, we therefore propose a tooled and reproducible approach, called Hot-Pepper, to correct automatically code smells and evaluate their impact on energy consumption. Currently, Hot-Pepper is able to correct automatically three types of Android specific code smells (Internal Getter/Setter, Member Ignoring Method, and HashMap Usage). Hot-Pepper derives four versions of the apps by correcting each detected smell independently, and all of them. Hot-Pepper is able to report on the energy consumption of each app version with a single user scenario test. Our empirical study on five open-source Android apps shows that correcting the three aforementioned Android code smells effectively reduce significantly the energy consumption of apps. In particular, we observed a global reduction of the energy consumption of 4, 83 % on one app when the three code smells are corrected. We also take advantage of the flexibility of Hot-Pepper to investigate the impact of three pictures code smells (bad picture format, compression, and bitmap format) in sample apps. We observed that the usage of <b>optimized</b> JPG <b>pictures</b> with the Android default bitmap format is the most energy efficient combination in Android apps. We believe that developers can benefit from our approach and results to guide their refactoring, and thus improve the energy consumption of their mobile apps...|$|R
40|$|Finding out {{the better}} {{parameter}} set (OffsetA and OffsetB) for conducting the de-blocking process of H. 264 /AVC, {{is capable of}} improving visual quality, said eliminating the resultant blocking artifact. Identifying which edges belong to blocking regions relies on the perceptual judging process of human beings. In fact, this subjective assessment may not exactly match existing objective assessing measurements, {{and the meaning of}} high PSNR does not always stand for less blocking artifacts. In this paper, we first introduce a new criterion for measuring the block boundary distortion by comparing the source video and the reconstructed video prior to the deblocking process. By jointly <b>optimizing</b> the objective <b>picture</b> quality and the blocky energy, the deblocking parameters decision process can find out a good balance between signal matching and blocky elimination, and therefore, maximize the effect of the built-in deblocking process. In our experiments, the proposed method can efficiently pick a better deblocking parameter set from all 169 possibilities for each coded frame and result in a better visual quality.

40|$|Compression {{artifacts}} in low-quality videos strongly influence {{the performance of}} feature matching algorithms. In order to achieve rea-sonable feature matching performance even for low bit rate video, we propose to allocate the bit budget during compression such that the important features are preserved. Specifically, we present two bit allocation approaches to preserve the strongest SIFT features for H. 264 encoded videos. For both approaches, we first categorize the Macroblocks in a Group of Pictures into several groups according to the scale specific characteristics of SIFT features. In our first ap-proach a novel R-D model based on the matching score is applied to allocate the bit budget to these groups. In our second approach, in or-der to reduce the computational complexity, we analyze the detector characteristics of correctly matched pairs and propose a R-D opti-mization method based on the repeatability metric. Our experiments show that both approaches achieve better feature preservation when compared to standard video encoding which is <b>optimized</b> for max-imum <b>picture</b> quality. The proposed approaches are fully standard compatible and the encoded videos can be decoded by any H. 264 decoder. Index Terms — SIFT features, H. 264, R-D optimization 1...|$|R
40|$|This report {{concerns}} the calibration of a visual-light camera. In order to calibrate the camera, a pin-hole camera model is used. This {{model can be}} used for conversion between real coordinates and image coordinates, and between image coordinates and sight lines in real space. The calibration is needed for a camera which is used on TCV, specifically in the OFIT algorithm. The purpose of this research is to find an optimization process for the fourteen camera parameters of the pin-hole camera model. This is realized in two steps. First, the eight intrinsic camera parameters are <b>optimized</b> using a <b>picture</b> of a sheet of paper taken from an approximately known distance. On this paper, various lines and concentric circles are printed, all with a known distance {{from the center of the}} paper. Using the known real coordinates of the various intersection points between the lines and circles, and the known image coordinates of these points, the intrinsic parameters are successfully optimized. The second step is to make a picture with the camera in its final position. In this case, the final position of the camera is on one of the tangential ports of TCV. Since the intrinsic parameters are known, now solely the extrinsic parameters are <b>optimized.</b> Using a <b>picture</b> of the interior of TCV and the known real-space coordinates of various points in the interior of the tokamak, also the extrinsic parameters are successfully optimized. In both situations, the real coordinates are transformed to image coordinates using an initial guess of parameters. The computed image coordinates are compared to the real image coordinates and the difference gives a quadratic error. By automatically changing the camera parameters, this error decreases until a (sometimes local) minimum is reached, giving the best set of parameters. Since the error minimum can be local, a good initial guess is necessary. A last step in this project is to implement this method for OFIT purposes. The optimization process described above is successfully executed. An additional step is, however, necessary for practical implementation. The resolution of the images and the coordinate system has changed from calibration to implementation, requiring a transformation from the optimized set of parameters to the new system. The optimized set of parameters fit the real time process pretty well, concluding that this transformation is also successful. A last remark is that some parameters might change during operation on TCV or any other tokamak, due to the effect of magnetic fields. This causes change in mainly the angles and sometimes the optical center. In order to compensate this effect either dynamic calibration or a better magnetic shielding can be used. That is, however, not part of this project...|$|R
30|$|A scanned {{picture of}} the {{hydrolysis}} spots on polymer film was obtained by placing the petri dish facing upwards on a CanoScan LiDE 20 paper scanner. For the quantification of hydrolysis spot intensity, the dish was scanned by placing a piece of black cardboard {{at the back of}} it with the lid of the scanner left open to obtain a JPEG image (2480 × 3507 pixels) with a completely dark background. The contrast of the <b>picture</b> was <b>optimized</b> by using <b>picture</b> editing software. 90 × 90 pixels square images beneath an enzyme droplet or a control droplet were then cropped from the picture. The square images were pasted on an empty slide of Microsoft Office PowerPoint and arranged in a row with the control spot image positioned at leftmost. The arranged images were then selected and saved as a new picture (JPEG file). The picture was then color-inverted and subjected to densitometry analysis by using the ImageJ densitometry software (Version 1.44, NIH). An area of w (width)[*]=[*] 40 and h (height)[*]=[*] 40 was selected on the control square by using the ‘rectangular’ tool in the software. The control image was selected as ‘first lane’ and subsequent sample images were selected as ‘next lane’. Finally, ‘plot lanes’ command was selected to obtain density plots for each square image.|$|R
