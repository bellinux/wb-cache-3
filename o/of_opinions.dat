Risk, uncertainty, and {{divergence}} <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> Journal <b>of</b> Finance 32, 1151 - 1168] hypothesizes {{that prices}} of stocks subject to high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and short-sales constraints are biased upward. We expect earnings announcements to reduce differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{we find that}} high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks. In addition, the returns on high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts' forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements.

We use this measure to test two competing hypotheses: the sidelined investors hypothesis and the uncertainty/asymmetric information hypothesis. We find evidence that supports the sidelined-investors hypothesis.

Moreover, dispersion <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> aggregates across many stocks and generates factors that have a market-wide effect, affecting the stock equilibrium rate of return and providing additional explanatory power in a standard asset-pricing model. This supports the interpretation <b>of</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> as a risk factor.

40|$|We study {{costs and}} {{benefits}} <b>of</b> differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> between an adviser and a decision maker. Even when they share the same underlying preferences over decisions, a difference <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> about payoff-relevant information leads to strategic information acquisition and transmission. A decision maker faces a fundamental trade-off: a greater difference <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> increases an adviser's incentives to acquire information but exacerbates the strategic disclosure of any information that is acquired. Nevertheless, when choosing from a rich pool <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> types, it is optimal for a decision maker to select an adviser with some difference <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> Centralization <b>of</b> authority is essential to harness these incentive gains since delegation to the adviser can discourage effort.

The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range <b>of</b> <b>opinions</b> on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E

Since 2010, the issue has gained increasing prominence in the disputing countries.

After years of inactivity the inter-governmental commission established to identify and determine the border between Croatia and Serbia met in Zagreb in April 2010, only to conclude that there was a difference <b>of</b> <b>opinions</b> on the matter. Later that month, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) proposed a National Assembly resolution which would require that Serbian officials resolve the dispute in compliance with the Serbian claim. Months later, Radoslav Stojanović, a former legal representative of Serbia and Montenegro in the Bosnian Genocide Case and former ambassador to the Netherlands, likened the dispute to the Croatia–Slovenia border dispute in the Gulf of Piran. Stojanović said that the position held by Croatia in its dispute with Slovenia was favourable for Serbia and warned that Serbia might be in a disadvantageous position if Croatia joined the European Union (EU) before Serbia—which would allow it to impose its conditions to the process of accession of Serbia to the EU.|$|E
40|$|Opinions are valuable, {{and with}} the advent of social media, plentiful. Opinions are not always intelligible, however. Therefore, many of the views of social media users are ignored. This {{dissertation}} seeks to confront the challenges associated with opinion mining and sentiment analysis by investigating three aspects <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> expression and consumption in social media. The universality <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> itself is explored through an innovative application of social science research in survey construction, semantic distance analysis, and corpus linguistics. Results include a universal taxonomy of 18 sentiment types shown to be portable across 15 languages. The universality <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> processing is explored through a qualitative meta-synthesis (QMS) analysis <b>of</b> social psychology, <b>opinion</b> mining and sentiment analysis, and voting systems scholarship. Results include a comprehensive theoretical model <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> processing: the States, Processes, Effects, and Quality (SPEQ) model for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. SPEQ defines seven states <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> six processes which govern the transitions between those states and five quality and integrity measures for the evaluation of those processes. Lastly, the concept <b>of</b> a structured <b>opinion</b> syntax is explored. Despite strong resentment to symbolic representations of meaning by subjects, learning and priming effects for both the encoding and decoding <b>of</b> structured <b>opinion</b> support the contention that such a syntax could be developed and used.
