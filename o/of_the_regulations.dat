5|$|The {{impact of}} the Senate's {{committees}} varies and {{has been the subject}} of debate. The work of the committees is frequently more consensual and less partisan than activity in the parliamentary chambers, and unanimous committee reports that agree recommendations across party lines are not uncommon. As a result, these recommendations may contribute to subsequent government policy announcements and occasionally to changes in government actions. The work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulations</b> and ordinances committee has led to revisions of subordinate legislation in significant respects. Committee scrutiny of bills has contributed to them being amended or withdrawn. The impact of committees on legislation overall has however been described as 'rather limited', particularly as the committees that review bills are controlled by a government majority.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> subject <b>of</b> {{my thesis}} is <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} trade in endangered species. An excessive trade in endangered species is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main causes <b>of</b> biodiversity loss on the Earth. The biodiversity loss constitutes a serious worldwide problem and threatens <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> ecosystems. It is becoming more urgent {{by the fact that}} <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> species extinction or at least their inclusion in <b>the</b> lists <b>of</b> endangered species is getting faster. Especially an illegal trade in endangered species is considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest and the most profitable. I have chosen this topic with the aim to show legal methods and ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excessive exploitation <b>of</b> wildlife. <b>The</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international trade is examined from the international perspective, <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Union law and as well from the czech law perspective. A considerable stress is put on the description and explanation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international trade <b>regulation</b> system regarding that an effective slowdown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biodiversity loss phenomenon or its stop can be only possible by <b>the</b> international cooperation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countries. <b>The</b> remaining levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> must be in compliance with <b>the</b> international level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulation.</b> <b>The</b> thesis is consisted of six [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Defence date: 30 August 2004 Examining board: Prof. Christian Joerges (supervisor), European University Institute; Prof. Ian F. Fletcher, University College London; Prof. Marie-Ange Moreau, European University Institute; Prof. Peter von Wilmowsky, University of ErfurtThis {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} comprehensive analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> cross-border insolvencies in Europe. Council Regulation 1346 / 2000 on Insolvency Proceedings forms the natural {{focal point of}} such a study. However, while this book explores in detail the background, legal basis as well as <b>the</b> substance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation,</b> it also contains an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> from two wider perspectives: that of international cross-border insolvency regulation and Community law. The approach adopted by <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> to <b>the</b> problems raised by cross-border insolvency forms part of a paradigmatic shift at the global level. The ‘struggle over jurisdiction’ - <b>the</b> natural state <b>of</b> affairs under <b>the</b> old principles <b>of</b> ‘universality & territoriality’ – is increasingly being replaced by co-operation between the jurisdictions involved. <b>The</b> <b>Regulation</b> must be understood against <b>the</b> backdrop <b>of</b> these new cooperative approaches, including the UNCITRAL Model Law and ancillary proceedings. Doing so, this dissertation argues that <b>the</b> co-operative framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> is limited and may ultimately not suffice to realise the efficient and effective cross-border proceedings it is aiming for. Although <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> is an exponent of this global shift towards cooperation, the legal context in which it operates is nevertheless very different. Community law, as an autonomous legal order, has limited the private international law autonomy of Member States and generated a comitas Europaea. This dissertation argues that Community law and its comitas must be taken seriously. They are {{an important source of}} principles to guide courts in the interpretation and application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> and may reinforce and expand <b>the</b> co-operative mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The essay {{analyzes}} <b>the</b> EC <b>Regulation</b> no. 861 / 2007 on the European Small Claims Procedure. After having outlined genesis, {{purpose and}} scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation,</b> <b>the</b> essay focuses on {{the relationships between the}} uniform rules laid down by it and the national procedural rules to be applied within the procedure so as to determine what is the space left to national law both to integrate <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> and to achieve the correct carrying out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure before the national courts. Hence, the analysis touches upon <b>the</b> enforcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judgment as the most innovative feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> with respect to <b>the</b> other <b>Regulations</b> adopted in <b>the</b> civil and commercial matter. Some of these Regulations come up for filling <b>the</b> gaps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Regulation</b> no. 861 / 2007, especially as to the jurisdiction and to <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acts.
