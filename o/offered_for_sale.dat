5|$|Americium {{has been}} {{produced}} in small quantities in nuclear reactors for decades, and kilograms of its 241Am and 243Am isotopes have been accumulated by now. Nevertheless, {{since it was}} first <b>offered</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> in 1962, its price, about 1,500 USD per gram of 241Am, remains almost unchanged owing to the very complex separation procedure. The heavier isotope 243Am is produced in much smaller amounts; it is thus more difficult to separate, resulting in a higher cost of the order 100,000–160,000 USD/g.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{popularity}} of the film's cars with customizers and hot rodders in the years since its release, their fate immediately after the film is ironic.

The yellow Deuce and the white T-bird went unsold, despite being priced as low as US$3,000. The registration plate on Milner's yellow deuce coupe is THX138 on a yellow, California license plate, slightly altered, reflecting Lucas's earlier science fiction film.|$|E

5|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45cm) driver to provide servo control {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was <b>offered</b> <b>for</b> <b>sale</b> at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from High Fidelity magazine.|$|E

UEFA allocated another 3,000 tickets to their officials and VIP members.

5|$|Money Can't Buy was a one-off concert show held on 15 November 2003 at {{entertainment}} venue Carling Apollo, London, {{to promote}} Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue's ninth studio album Body Language.

William Baker and Alan MacDonald served as creative and art directors, respectively, while Michael Rooney and Steve Anderson {{worked on the}} choreography and musical arrangements. Display hardware manufacturer Barco provided LED displays for showing graphics as backdrops to the performances.
