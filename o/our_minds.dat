5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

5000|$|We imagine {{things in}} <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> we create things in <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> we destroy things in <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> says Gaudapada; yet {{all these things}} are not {{different}} from It, the Atman (gender neutral). All such constructions create dualities in our imagination, are Maya. The true reality, state Karikas 33-36, is nondual and it is Atman. Those who have mastered and grown past all attachments, past all fear and past all anger, they are past all dualities, know their Self, have secured the nonduality within. According to Karika 36-38, such wise individuals, do not care about praise from anyone, are beyond all rituals, are homeless wanderers, for they have realized the true inside them and outside; they, translates Potter, [...] "remain steadfastly true to nature".|$|R

25|$|Dianetics postulates {{that there}} is a part of our psyche called the {{reactive}} mind, and that most of our mental and physical problems are psychosomatic, thus they can be solved by eliminating this portion of <b>our</b> <b>minds.</b> This mental state of self-mastery is called Clear.|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from <b>our</b> <b>minds,</b> thus ordering and providing the criterion for those things that we can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E

25|$|Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) — Austrian {{psychologist}} and philosopher, who wrote Gegenstandstheorie ("The theory of objects"), where he wrote {{at length about}} the notion of objects that exist only in <b>our</b> <b>minds.</b> He is referred to by his surname in the story; his theories are alluded to by way of explaining the languages of the Northern Hemisphere of Tlön. Presumably, Borges is acknowledging where he {{got the idea for}} this imaginary family of languages.|$|E
25|$|The Rosary is a devotion for the {{meditation}} of {{the mysteries}} of Jesus and Mary.“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation. It gives {{us an opportunity to}} open ourselves to God’s word, to refine our interior gaze by turning <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> to the life of Christ. The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.|$|E

At the close Barry Knight and I were still there with 100 needed. Benaud had made it practically impossible for us to win, or for them.|$|E

25|$|Other constructivist {{scholars}} {{agree with}} this and emphasize that individuals make meanings through the interactions {{with each other and}} with the environment they live in. Knowledge is thus a product of humans and is socially and culturally constructed (Ernest 1991; Prawat and Floden 1994). McMahon (1997) agrees that learning is a social process. He further states that learning is not a process that only takes place inside <b>our</b> <b>minds,</b> nor is it a passive development of our behaviors that is shaped by external forces and that meaningful learning occurs when individuals are engaged in social activities.|$|E
25|$|Previously, genetic {{personality}} studies {{focused on}} specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today's {{view of the}} gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms {{part of what is}} referred to as behavioural genetics. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of <b>our</b> <b>minds</b> and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of <b>our</b> <b>minds.</b> In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that our experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E

500|$|In Chapter 2 of the Proslogion, Anselm defined God as a [...] "being than {{which no}} greater can be conceived". He {{suggested}} that even [...] "the fool" [...] can understand this concept, and this understanding itself {{means that the}} being must exist in the mind. The concept must exist either only in <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> or in both <b>our</b> <b>mind</b> and in reality. If such a being exists only in <b>our</b> <b>mind,</b> then a greater being—that which exists in the mind and in reality—can be conceived (this argument is generally regarded as a reductio ad absurdum because {{the view of the}} fool is proven to be inconsistent). Therefore, if we can conceive of a being than which nothing greater can be conceived, it must exist in reality. Thus, a being than which nothing greater could be conceived, which Anselm defined as God, must exist in reality.|$|R
