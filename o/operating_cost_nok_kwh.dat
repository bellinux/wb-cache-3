50|$|Construction of {{an airport}} is {{estimated}} to <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 530 million and have an annual <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> of <b>NOK</b> 28 million. An economic analysis showed that the airport would have a negative net present value for society of NOK 1014 million, excluding operating subsidies for the airline. There is little time gain from the project as travelers to Oslo would have to fly via Sørkjosen to Tromsø and there change aircraft, instead of taking direct flights from Alta. Only passengers having Tromsø as travel target would have a gain from an airport. Avinor has recommended not upgrading the Kautokeino Airport.|$|R
50|$|The hall <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 134.6 million, {{of which}} NOK 88.5 million was {{grants from the}} government. The hall opened on 6 May 1993, with a show {{televised}} on national television and with 5,000 guests. It was the 29th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway, and the world's largest cavern hall for public use. At the time of opening, the venue was estimated to incur an <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> of <b>NOK</b> 3 to 4 four million, and an operating deficit of NOK 1.7 million. To finance this, the state established a fund similar to other Olympic venues, but the fund only received NOK 1 million, {{and the rest of}} the <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> would have to be taken by the municipality. The venue is owned through Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg, originally owned 70% by Gjøvik Municipality and 30% by Lillehammer Olympiapark, but later taken entirely over by the municipality.|$|R
30|$|The {{regional}} {{airports in}} the region had, in 2008, operating expenses amounting to NOK 75 million. Annual <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> at the new joint airport are estimated to amount to about NOK 62 million. Hence, the annual reduction in <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> is approximately <b>NOK</b> 13 million with a discounted value of NOK 200 million. Higher traffic figures will increase revenues by a discounted value amounting to about NOK 50 million. In sum, this will provide Avinor with {{a net gain of}} NOK 250 million. The airport will still be run with a deficit and will require cross-subsidisation from other profitable airports in the network.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the inaugural}} {{calibration}} flights started, the CAA had awarded {{the operation and}} maintenance contracts to FOF without tenders. By 1993 the annual costs were 15 million Norwegian krone (NOK). In September 1993 the CAA {{announced that it would}} retire the Hawker Siddeley and that it was considering procuring a Dornier 328, de Havilland Canada Dash 8 or ATR 42. A deal was struck in February 1994, where Fred. Olsen, through its controlling post in Widerøe, was able to secure that the CAA could purchase a Dash 8 at a discounted price of NOK 78 million by utilizing one of Widerøe's options. In exchange the CAA signed the maintenance contract with FOF. The introduction of the Dash 8 reduced the hourly <b>operating</b> <b>cost</b> from <b>NOK</b> 23,000 to 14,000, and was introduced in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The railway saw {{significantly}} less transport than estimated. There {{was very little}} lumber transport from Messel, in part because a timber slide had been built at Rykene in 1902. The factory at Rykene also chose to build an aerial tramway to transport its wood pulp instead of sending it via the railway. Passenger traffic was limited on the inner parts of the line; particularly the detour via Rorevann was a disadvantage, as people from Fjære were 3 km from the center via the road, but 8 km by rail. From 1 July 1910 to 31 June 1911, the line transport 40,077 people, of which 152 traveled on second class and the rest in third class. The line carried 9305 t of general cargo and 45 t of dispatch goods. It had income of <b>NOK</b> 22,531, but <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of <b>NOK</b> 32,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{chief of}} {{administration}} made {{a proposal to}} close line 2. The overlapping traffic could {{be taken over by}} the trams, and the traffic to Elgeseter could be taken over by southbound buses. This would force the main depot, located at Dalsenget, to be closed. The depot at Munkvoll was suggested rebuilt for NOK 34 million, including NOK 11 for machines. Dalsenget was valuated at NOK 15 million, and proposed sold. Ulseth's proposal would require five trams in route, demanding ten in total. This would also require NOK 6.5 million upgrade to the Elgeseter Line, plus new trams for line 2 around 1990. The new trams would increase the annual capital costs with 1.6 million, but reduce <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> with <b>NOK</b> 1.2 million. One line would <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 2.9 million per year, with investments of NOK 19.3 million. Two lines would cost 5.7 million to operate, and require investments of NOK 22 million. The labor union supported two lines, noting that expansion southwards and eastwards would be impossible with the lines abandoned, and {{that there would be no}} excess capacity in the new depot at Dalsenget. They also claimed operation could be rationalized by NOK 4.4 million at Dalsenget, and that old trams could be operated beyond 1990.|$|R
50|$|Norsk Vinterturistforening {{was founded}} in 1899 to work towards {{encouraging}} English tourists to visit Oslo, specifically by building tobogganing tracks. A committee was established in 1904 to look into building a new tobogganing track in the Holmenkollen area. It proposed that two new tracks be built, one from Voksenkollveien to Peisestuen, and one from Peisestuen to Midtstuen, and that Korketrekkeren be upgraded to allow for safer tobogganing. The investments cost 7,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) and the annual <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> estimated at <b>NOK</b> 2,000. The investments were financed with NOK 2,000 by Christiania Brænnevinssamlag and NOK 5,000 by Akeforeningen. The latter was established in 1905 and was also responsible to operating the track.|$|R
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1998, {{it became}} clear that Braathens had {{increased}} capacity by 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several large cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load. Accumulated cabin load for Color Air was 32%, with 116,176 passengers. In {{the course of the last}} quarter of 1998, Color Air lost NOK 91 million, or NOK 1 million each day. For the whole year, Color Air had an average ticket price of NOK 453, giving a revenue of NOK 57 million. NOK 45 million was used on taxes, giving NOK 12 million to cover <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of <b>NOK</b> 209 million. The company lost NOK 197 million in 1998.|$|R
50|$|On 20 October 1993, the {{municipal}} council {{voted in favor}} of purchasing the stadium. The proposal was supported by the Labour Party and Centre Party, who had 28 of 49 councilors, but opposed {{by the rest of the}} council. Along with two banks, {{the municipal}}ity established a limited company which would own the venue. The municipality and banks would pay for the club's debt of NOK 5.4 million, and take over the stadium's <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> of roughly <b>NOK</b> 1 million per year. Ham-Kam would have to pay rent on the stadium. The transaction took place on 26 January 1994, and included a clause granting Ham-Kam the right to buy back the stadium at a later date. The municipality issued a loan of NOK 4 million to Ham-Kam in 2003 to allow them to install floodlighting at Briskeby.|$|R
50|$|The second {{report was}} {{initiated}} {{by a committee}} in January 1978. When presented in nine volumes in March 1979, it recommended two new tramways: Lade-Midtbyen-NTH-Risvollan-Heimdalsbyen and Lian-Midtbyen-NTH-Nardo-Moholt-Stokkan. By 1990, this would capture 90% of the public transport in the municipality. Investments would be NOK 340 million and annual <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> would be <b>NOK</b> 103-106 million. A diesel bus system would cost 81 million annually, while a trolleybus network would cost 87 million annually. The report recommended the diesel bus alternative. An information office was established by the city in Hornemannsgården in the city square. The information brochure made by the city announced that the investment costs were equal to five new schools, ten new kindergartens, two swimming halls, a library and 1,000 new housing lots. The report was considered by the city council on 29 March. After a long debate, the council decided to keep the existing network, and upgrade the rolling stock and tracks. This was again stated in a new vote on 24 August.|$|R
50|$|The station <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 27,300. The largest amount {{was for the}} depot, which <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 5,000. Other major posts were NOK 3,000 for {{the freight}} house and NOK 2,000 each for the station {{building}} and wagon shed. Signaling systems and inventory <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 2,000. HVB was officially opened on 2 October 1902. The shed at Gausen quickly proved to be too small and was expanded in 1906 with additional space for rolling stock and a carpenter's workshop, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 1153.65. It was expanded further the following year for NOK 322.60. The final expansion took place in 1910, when a shed for storing and drying wood was built. At first the station only had three tracks, increasing to four in 1907, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 347.46. That year the station handled 68 tonnes of express cargo and 8,884 tonnes of regular cargo, in addition to 24 live animals. Later the station also received two additional spurs which each had a small turnstiles.|$|R
50|$|In August 2007, {{the stadium}} was {{planned to be}} built in three stages, with a {{combined}} budget of NOK 156.6 million. The first stage would involve the northern and western sides and <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 78.4 million, the second stage would involve the eastern side and <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 43.0 million, while the third stage would involve the southern side and <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 35.1 million. After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest rooms from the basement to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof. Both of these gave increased construction costs and alteration of the architectural design plans.|$|R
50|$|The Singsaker trams {{would operate}} {{into the city}} center. The chief of operations, Fredrik Kleven, {{suggested}} that they should operate to Trondheim Central Station. Ideally {{he wanted them to}} operate to Voldsminde, but {{he did not want to}} mix trams with and without conductors on the Lade Line. Director Jon Garstad instead wanted the trams to terminate at Torvet, thus saving NOK 20,000 annually in <b>operating</b> <b>costs.</b> The board suggested that the trams run in a loop down Prinsens gate, and along Dronningens gate to Munkegata where they would connect to the existing track. This would <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 52,000 to build. Alternatively, a new stop could be built at Church of Our Lady, <b>costing</b> an additional <b>NOK</b> 30,000. No-one on the board voted for the railway station alternative.|$|R
5000|$|Single, day, monthly and yearly {{tickets are}} available. Ruter {{operates}} on a proof-of-payment basis, {{and there is}} a fine of either [...] or [...] for traveling without a valid ticket, depending on whether or not the fine is paid on location. Payment is based on a zone fare schematic, and Oslo remains a single zone with free transfer. A single-zone ticket <b>costs</b> <b>NOK</b> 33 if bought in advance, and NOK 50 if bought on a bus or tram. Day passes <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 90 while a month pass <b>costs</b> <b>NOK</b> 708. Children and seniors pay half price. Prices increase if multiple zones are traveled. The Flexus ticket system is in 2011 almost completely introduced.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, {{the city}} council decided to order a report to {{consider}} {{the future of the}} tram. The work was done by the Norwegian Institute of Technology and Arne R. Reinertsen. In particular, it look at how a new line could be built to Valentinlyst and onwards to the University of Trondheim campus at Dragvoll. Alternative 1 followed an at-grade route, along Innherredsveien to Strindheim, and along Bromstadveien, Kong Øysteins veg and Jonsvannsveien, and would <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 68 million. The second alternative involved a 1.7 km tunnel from Bakkegate to Valentinlyst; this would <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 209 million. Alternative 3 ran along Høyskoleveien from Studentersamfundet to Klæbuveien, and into a tunnel to Valentinlyst; this would <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 116. All the sections were dimensioned for 70 km/h, and were inspired by the new rapid transit in Oslo. Alternative 1 was recommended, but would give an annual increase in operation <b>costs</b> of <b>NOK</b> 6.8 million.|$|R
50|$|Plans for {{a further}} {{extension}} of the runway to 1200 m were made in 2001, at the time estimated to <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 3 million. From 2003 support and some funding was issued by the municipalities of Arendal and Froland. This resulted in extension of the runway to 1120 by 30 m in 2006, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 10 million. By then about NOK 20 million had been invested in the airport, mostly funded by the municipalities of Arendal and Froland.|$|R
50|$|The {{first section}} opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 590 million. With the opening, line 4 was {{extended}} from Ullevål stadion to Storo. Nydalen {{had grown up}} as an urban redevelopment area after the local industry had been abandoned in the 1980s, where 14,800 jobs had been located by 2004. On 20 August 2006, the final section opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass, with the whole project <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 1,348 million.|$|R
50|$|The company {{approved}} a five-year investment plan in 1980, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 500 million. Both PM4 and PM5 {{were to be}} modernized and received computer-based controlling systems. Low prices caused the plans to be postponed after PM5 was completed in 1981. The conglomerate Kosmos bought Saugbrugsforeningen in 1983, paying about NOK 100 million for the company. Both prior and afterwards there was discussion of Saugbrugsforeningen joining a major paper production group. PM4 was upgraded in 1986 and 1987, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 296 million.|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of biometric passports to Norway began in 2005 and supplied by Setec, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 450 for adults, or c. €50, NOK 270 for children.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} located in a wide, flat terrain, so getting {{sufficient}} pressure to supply water for the steam locomotives would be very expensive. Instead, a water tower was built at the station, with water pumped from the river Rauma. The pump is located 140 m from the tower, with the water intake being another 50 m from the pump. The water tower was built in natural stone brick and is square. After the steam locomotive services ended, was used as a storage facility. The tower <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 103,795 to build. The station also received a turntable, which <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 101,236, which had a 20 m diameter. Although it was planned completed on 1 August 1921, construction was delayed and it was taken into use one month after the station opened. Bjorli had a temporary roundhouse while the station was the terminus. Built out of wood, the building <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 30,373.|$|R
5|$|The bridge project <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 910 million, {{of which}} NOK 513 {{was for the}} pontoon bridge, NOK 81 million was for the {{cable-stayed}} bridge, NOK 25 million {{was used for the}} waterway, NOK 115 million was used on planning, and NOK 176 million was used on auxiliary roads and the tunnel. The bridge was financed with NOK 41 million in state grants, NOK 139 million from tolls paid in advance, and NOK 730 million in debt which would be repaid by the tolls. Interest during construction <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 138 million. The construction involved 1,150,000 man-hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{power station}} was {{completed}} in 1907, and the following year the sulfite process chemical pulp mill was completed the following year. All the upgrades were finalized in 1910, having <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 4.1 million—twice the budget. A particular contributor was the pulp mill, which had <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 3 million. Conservatism within management and owners led the company to not even discuss if a loan would be an appropriate way of funding the investments. Instead, 250 km2 of productive forest in Sweden was sold to Borregaard for NOK 4.7 million.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel was budgeted to <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 496 million, {{but ended}} up <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 487 million. It opened along with the Stord Bridge on 27 December 2000. Six hours before the opening, {{the bottom of the}} tunnel was used for a wedding. The toll company held a course for people with fear of tunnels to master their fears, with 60 people participating. The {{official}} opening took place on 30 April 2001. When it opened, it was the longest and second-deepest subsea tunnel in Europe and Norway, after the Hitra Tunnel.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, {{the airport}} started {{the process to}} install a doppler very high {{frequency}} omnidirectional range (DVOR) to aid navigation, which would <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 800,000 used, plus NOK 400,000 for installation and construction of a road. The DVOR was operational from October 1998. The Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority instructed the airport company to improve the facilities for both employees and passengers, and in February 1997, the airport company decided {{to build a new}} passenger terminal and a new operations building for a combined <b>cost</b> of <b>NOK</b> 12 million. The new passenger terminal would be 754 m in two stories, with the tower in four. Instead the airport chose a larger proposal, also designed by Svein Halleraker, which <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 25 million.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{stations}} were {{built for the}} line, including a major upgrade to Myrdal and port facilities at Flåm. Myrdal Station was given side tracks and additional buildings to serve transferring passengers, with the upgrades <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 0.5 million. Breikvam {{was the only place}} on-route which received a passing loop. Flåm Station <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 0.8 million and was designed in the 1930s NSB simple wooden functionalist style, similar to what is found on the Nordland Line and the Sørland Line. Other stations received small, wooden buildings with a waiting room, as well as a room for cargo at Vatnahalsen, Håreina and Dalsbotn.|$|R
50|$|By 1874, Swedish {{authorities}} {{had decided that}} all railways should be built in standard gauge, and the Parliament of Norway chose to change their configuration to the same gauge in 1874, increasing estimated <b>costs</b> from <b>NOK</b> 4.7 to 8.9 million. In Trondheim, the existing Trondhjem-Støren Line terminated at a station at Kalvskinnet. This was a cul-de-sac station, and to allow the two lines to interconnect, a new station was built at Brattøra, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 1.4 million.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{started in}} October 1999, <b>costing</b> <b>NOK</b> 140 million. A new south stand was built with a roof, offices and change rooms, while a smaller stand without a roof {{was built to}} the east. The project <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 40 million less than the {{original}} plans, in part because no stands were built on the west end. The two new stands had 4,350 seats and the venue was approved for UEFA matches. However, the venue {{was not allowed to}} use the old grandstand seating or the terraces for UEFA matches. The two new stands gave the stadium seating for 6,100 and standing room for 2,000 spectators. The first match at the upgraded venue was played on 22 April 2001.|$|R
50|$|Color Line Stadion is a {{association}} {{football stadium}} in Ålesund, Norway, {{and the home}} of Norwegian Premier League side Aalesunds FK. It was inaugurated in April 2005 and <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 160 million to build. It is referred to as Aalesund Stadion by UEFA.|$|R
50|$|Estimates for {{the project}} <b>costs</b> were <b>NOK</b> 4.3 billion, ±20%, but by {{completion}} they had ended at NOK 7.7 billion, of which NOK 1.3 billion {{were related to the}} leakages. The rest of the line had a <b>cost</b> exceedings of <b>NOK</b> 0.4 billion. The company had acquired financial <b>costs</b> of <b>NOK</b> 0.9 billion, so the company owed NOK 10.0 billion by 1999, including money spent on the new trains.|$|R
30|$|The {{discounted}} {{value of}} reduced airport <b>operating</b> <b>costs</b> {{and the end}} of the need for PSO-operations are in sum estimated to amount to NOK 1, 750 million. Parts of this amount could be spent for road infrastructure investments in the Helgeland region. There is, for example, a need to upgrade the European highway (E 6) with an estimated <b>cost</b> of <b>NOK</b> 500 million [28]. Additional positive consequences of completing this road project accrue in the form of reduced transport and accident costs for users amounting to NOK 26 million and NOK 13 million, respectively.|$|R
500|$|In 1992, {{the tram}} {{division}} of Oslo Sporveier launched an alternative Ring Line {{that would have}} been built as a light rail, using in part the existing tramway. In the west, it would follow the Sinsen Line via Sinsen to Storo. A new line would have to be built from Storo to Tåsen. The line would then use the existing Sognsvann Line to Majorstuen, where it would connect to the tramway and follow the Frogner Line into the city, via a new Vika Line through Aker Brygge. This alternative would <b>cost</b> <b>NOK</b> 61 million to build, compared to NOK 470 million estimated for the rapid transit solution.
