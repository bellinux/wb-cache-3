5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade has {{put it all together}} as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by one of <b>our</b> <b>best</b> science journalists.|$|E
5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects of beliefs and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, <b>our</b> <b>best</b> explanation of mental processes.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by <b>our</b> <b>best</b> science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in the speech has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, it is our most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one of <b>our</b> <b>best</b> sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E
5|$|The Brothers {{took part}} in the {{gauntlet}} match at Glory By Honor 2, which was held to fill the tag team championship left vacant by Red suffering a serious knee injury. They defeated and eliminated the Special K team of Hydro and Angeldust as well as The Ring Crew Express, before being eliminated by the other Special K team in the match, Izzy and Dixie, due to outside interference from Angeldust. After Izzy and Dixie later won the tag team title, the Brothers were granted a shot at it, at Main Event Spectacles. The reason given in the storyline was they were given the shot since they only lost in the gauntlet match because Special K cheated. In the opening segment of that event, they were aligned with Jim Cornette, because, in the storyline, Cornette wanted to create new champions. They attacked his former client, Samoa Joe, who Cornette abandoned since he already was a champion. They {{went on to win the}} belts later in the show. At The Conclusion, The Battle Lines Are Drawn, and The Last Stand, which was by stipulation Joe's last shot at the tag team title for as long as the Briscoe Brothers held it, they retained the belts over Joe and a different partner each time, A.J. Styles, Bryan Danielson, and Jerry Lynn respectively. Since Joe took pinfalls at The Conclusion (to Mark) and The Last Stand (to Jay), both brothers subsequently earned shots at his world title. Both fell; Mark at Final Battle 2003 and Jay at At <b>Our</b> <b>Best</b> in a memorable and bloody steel cage match.|$|E

5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of <b>our</b> <b>best</b> naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

25|$|Men's sexual {{interest}} in youths {{was reflected in}} prostitution, with young male sex workers fetching higher prices than their female counterparts {{as recently as the}} beginning of the 20th century. In Tianjin there were thirty-five male brothels, housing 800 boys. Although the superintendent of trade at Guangzhou issued an annual warning to the population against permitting westerners access to boy prostitutes ("do not indulge the Western barbarian with all <b>our</b> <b>best</b> favors"), Europeans were increasingly welcomed in the boy brothels.|$|E

25|$|If {{we allow}} for the {{possibility}} that K1a9 and N1b2 might have a Near Eastern source, then we can estimate the overall fraction of European maternal ancestry at ~65%. Given the strength of the case for even these founders having a European source, however, <b>our</b> <b>best</b> estimate is to assign ~81% of Ashkenazi lineages to a European source, ~8% to the Near East and ~1% further to the east in Asia, with ~10% remaining ambiguous... Thus at least two-thirds and most likely more than four-fifths of Ashkenazi maternal lineages have a European ancestry.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Paulus wrote, there was notable {{intellectual}} consolidation {{taking place in}} astrology. Forty years earlier, Julius Firmicus Maternus had written Mathesis, a long and very detailed summary of the astrological technique of his time, which has come down to us intact. Contemporaneous with Paulus, an anonymous writer had produced a Treatise on the Fixed Stars in 379 AD, which is <b>our</b> <b>best</b> record of how practical astrologers of the Roman period after Ptolemy dealt with stars {{in the context of}} the astrological chart; a few decades later came three books (Apotelesmatika) by the Egyptian Hephaistio of Thebes (415 AD) integrating Ptolemy with earlier traditions.|$|E

He attended Harvard Divinity School from 1857 to 1860, and upon graduation, toured Europe. In the spring of 1861, he returned to a nation in the throes of the Civil War. Exempted from military service for health reasons in July 1863, he wrote in support of the Union cause and associated with New England intellectuals. He was elected an officer in the New England Historic Genealogical Society in 1863.|$|E

25|$|After {{his reign}} as ROH Tag Team Champion, Styles took Jimmy Rave as his protégé and {{attempted}} to become the ROH World Champion, defeating Bryan Danielson at Main Event Spectacles to become the number one contender. At War of the Wire, Styles unsuccessfully challenged Samoa Joe for the title. He then defeated CM Punk, Jimmy Rave, and Matt Stryker in a one night tournament at the Second Anniversary Show {{to become the first}} ROH Pure Wrestling Champion. Styles defeated Punk in a rematch with Ricky Steamboat as the guest referee at At <b>Our</b> <b>Best</b> for his final match for ROH in 2004, as TNA withdrew all of its contracted wrestlers from all ROH events and ROH vacated the title.|$|E
25|$|There {{will be a}} lot {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas do not agree with the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. <b>Our</b> <b>best</b> spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E
25|$|Hence, {{from the}} sixth year of {{schooling}} onwards, instruction {{should be in}} European learning, with English as the medium of instruction. This would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians; the creation of such a class was necessary before any reform of vernacular education:I feel... {{that it is impossible}} for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body of the people. We must at present do <b>our</b> <b>best</b> to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, – a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.|$|E
