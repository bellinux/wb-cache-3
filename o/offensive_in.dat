5|$|Following General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's {{dismissal}} as Commander-in-Chief of UN {{forces in}} Korea, he {{was replaced by}} General Matthew B. Ridgway. Consequently, on 14 April 1951, General James Van Fleet replaced Ridgway as commander of the US Eighth Army and the United Nations forces in Korea. The Chinese Spring Offensive during April and May 1951 ended in its defeat, while following two months of sporadic operations in mid-June and August, the war entered a new phase, with Van Fleet returning to the <b>offensive.</b> <b>In</b> July the Kansas and Wyoming Lines were strengthened, while a limited <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> the east-central sector in mid-August seized the high ground around the Punchbowl and Bloody Ridge during the Battle of Bloody Ridge. In September the <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> this sector continued, targeting the next hill complex north of Bloody Ridge, known as Heartbreak Ridge.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{that the}} Japanese were {{beginning}} a major <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> the southern Solomons aimed at Henderson Field, Halsey responded by sending, beginning on 29 January, a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal supported {{by most of}} his warship forces, separated into five task forces. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.|$|E
5|$|Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied {{shipping}} off the American Atlantic coast. By November 1941, Commonwealth {{forces had}} launched a counter-offensive, Operation Crusader, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made. In North Africa, the Germans launched an <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> January, pushing the British back to {{positions at the}} Gazala Line by early February, followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives. Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942. An Axis <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein. On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid, demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the initial stages in their campaign, the Viet Cong forces were ordered to regroup and prepare for the next <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> the Long Khánh region. Viet Cong soldiers from the two regiments were assembled in War Zone D, where they were trained to attack well-fortified enemy strongholds. On November 20, 1964, the Viet Cong reached the Long Khánh battlefield, having completed a 200 kilometres march from War Zone D. On the battlefield the Viet Cong 186th Battalion (from Military Region 5), the 500th and 800th Battalions (from Military Region 7), and the 445th Company also joined the offensive. To kick-start their <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> the Baria-Long Khánh region, the Viet Cong selected Bình Giã as their next target. Bình Giã was a small village located in Phước Tuy Province, about 67 kilometres away from Saigon.|$|E

5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims {{were just}} a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius {{prepared}} for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what {{was meant to be}} a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government—and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, FATA's provincial {{government}} officially declared Islamic law in Swat {{to achieve a}} ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes. Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure, Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted. By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> the neighbouring Dir district.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of December, under bad weather conditions, the Nazis {{launched}} an <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> the Ardennes. The Luftwaffe caught many squadrons off guard.

5|$|Near {{the end of}} April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, {{the newest}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the German High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.

5|$|On 22 June, the Soviets {{launched}} a strategic <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> Belarus ("Operation Bagration") that destroyed the German Army Group Centre almost completely. Soon after that another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviet advance prompted resistance forces in Poland to initiate several uprisings against the German occupation. However, {{the largest of}} these in Warsaw, where German soldiers massacred 200,000 civilians, and a national uprising in Slovakia, did not receive Soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the Germans. The Red Army's strategic <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable German troops there and triggered a successful coup d'état in Romania and in Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.|$|E

5|$|Planning for Operation Trio and the {{associated}} Operation West-Bosnien in the Bosanska Krajina occurred during two Axis conferences in March 1942. During the initial conference at Opatija on 2–3 March, the NDH Chief of the General Staff Vladimir Laxa objected to an Italian proposal to involve the Bosnian and Herzegovinian Chetniks in the planned operations, and {{with the support of}} the Germans, this idea was initially shelved. Operation Trio was to be one of a series of counter-insurgency operations planned for eastern Bosnia, Herzegovina, Sandžak, Montenegro, western Bosnia and Lika. Despite this, the only operations that were actually conducted between March and June 1942 were Operation Trio, and a combined Italian-Montenegrin Chetnik <b>offensive</b> <b>in</b> Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina which is also associated with the Third Enemy <b>Offensive</b> <b>in</b> Yugoslav historiography.|$|E
