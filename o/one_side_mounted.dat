40|$|Abstract: An {{instrumented}} subsoiler shank {{was designed}} and built to measure the soil resistance while moving through the soil and for automatic control of the depth of several standard subsoiler shanks mounted on the same frame. Three load cells measure the resultant magnitude {{and direction of the}} soil reactions on the shank. Two load cells measure forces perpendicular to the straight shank with a constant distance between them and another load cell measures the force along the shank. The two perpendicular load cells are cantilevers with <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> {{to the center of the}} shank’s width and the other side connected to wheels running inside a hollow beam. The wheels enable the shank to be moved up and down for different depths with the aid of a hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic cylinder is connected to the upper edge of the shank by the lengthwise load cell. The resultant force on the shank is calculated by using the three measured forces, their directions and locations. The instrumented shank was calibrated and tested in the field. While preliminary in nature, the results indicate that when the shank tip is above a soil hardpan, the soil force on the tip acts upward, and becomes negative when the shank tip is below the hardpan. These results indicate that it may be possible to determine the depth of the hardpan by observing when the vertical force on the shank tip passes through zero as the shan...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{different}} types of reusable first stages designed for a near term application with heavy lift launchers. The attached reference expendable space transportation system is a future Ariane 5 with cryogenic core and upper stage, but skipped solid rocket boosters. The design of the so called liquid fly-back boosters (LFBB) is restricted here to the incorporation of rocket motors already under development or in operation. LOX/RPI and LOX/LH 2 combustion in different cycles is looked upon. The analyzed lay-out-variants of the reusable vehicle include attached single as well as dual LFBB-configurations. Catamaran type double fuselage stages are regarded to evaluate the potential in reducing the unsymmetrical thrust load of <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>mounted</b> boosters. Beside their primary use to boost heavy lift GTO missions, a second task may {{be covered by the}} same vehicle to accelerate the upper stages of small and medium launchers. The additional requirements in designing the same reusable launch vehicle for a least two different missions are studied. The investigation includes trajectory simulations and optimizations for ascent. Return to the launch site by the LFBB is regarded, concerning the propellant requirements and the loads on the vehicle. Different booster geometries are generated by CAD for a preliminary aerodynamic sizing, dimensioning, and mass estimation. Critical flight stability aspects are assessed by static and dynamic simulations. The paper includes a comparison of size and mass, as well as performance data of the different liquid fly-back booster configurations. The relevant rocket engine figures of performance, mass, reusability, and throttling capability are presented...|$|E

25|$|Initially {{power was}} {{supplied}} through a unique {{system in which}} a pickup shoe rode in a channel above and to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> of the track.

When the Howard Street track was made into a gantlet to allow higher clearances, the pickup contacts on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> were <b>mounted</b> on swinging arms to accommodate the varying distance to the third rail. The electrification was finally discontinued in 1952 when dieselization made it unnecessary.|$|R
5000|$|A {{horse is}} best mounted using a {{mounting}} block {{because it is}} easier for the rider to mount the horse, it puts less strain on the stirrup leathers when mounting and it decreases the chances of the saddle slipping to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> when <b>mounting,</b> thereby reducing the chances of a fall and possible injury to the rider.

2500|$|As the rider's whole weight must {{be carried}} at <b>one</b> <b>side</b> when <b>mounting,</b> on an English saddle, one stirrup leather often becomes {{stretched}} {{longer than the}} other, usually the left one, because most mounting occurs on that side. [...] While a simple adjustment of the leather can even up the stirrups, to preserve the integrity and longevity of the leathers, they should be switched to the opposite sides from time to time. [...] On a western saddle, with a heavier, permanently installed fender and stirrup leather that cannot be switched, stretching is slower and less extreme, though it also occurs {{in this type of}} saddle. [...] Any unevenness in the leathers can be managed by adjusting the stirrup length, and if necessary, by adding extra holes in the leathers to allow them to be buckled at an intermediate point between the existing prepunched holes provided by the saddle manufacturer.|$|R

60|$|So {{they marched}} till they came within {{less than a}} league of the town; there they lay till the first four captains came thither to acquaint them with matters. Then they took their journey {{to go to the}} town of Mansoul, and unto Mansoul they came; but when the old {{soldiers}} that were in the camp saw that they had new forces to join with, they again gave such a shout before the walls of the town of Mansoul, that it put Diabolus into another fright. So they sat down before the town, not now as the other four captains did, to wit, against the gates of Mansoul only; but they environed it round on every side, and beset it behind and before; so that now, let Mansoul look which way it will, it saw force and power lie in siege against it. Besides, there were mounts cast up against it. The Mount Gracious was on the <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> and <b>Mount</b> Justice was on the other. Further, there were several small banks and advance- grounds, as Plain-Truth Hill and No-Sin Banks, where many of the slings were placed against the town.
