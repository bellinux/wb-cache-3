Sets of five bronze gong-chimes and a gong making up the totobuang ensembles of Buru island in Central Maluku have also come to disuse. Kolintang sets of bossed kettle gongs were <b>once</b> <b>played</b> in Gorontalo, North Sulawesi long ago but that has all but disappeared, replaced by what locals are presently familiar with—a slab-key instrument known as a kolintang.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{successful}} collegiate and professional football players <b>once</b> <b>played</b> for Tech. The school has 48first-team All-Americans and over 150alumni who {{have played in}} the NFL. Among the most lauded and most notable players the school has produced are Calvin Johnson, Demaryius Thomas, Keith Brooking, Joe Hamilton, Joe Guyon, and Billy Shaw. In addition to its players, Tech's football program has been noted for its coaches and its, in many cases bizarre traditions and game finishes. Among the team's former coaches are John Heisman, for whom the Heisman Trophy is named, and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award and the school's stadium are named. Heisman led the team to the highest-scoring game in American football history, and both Heisman and Dodd led Tech's football team to national championships. Dodd also led the Jackets on their longest winning streak (8 games) against the University of Georgia, Tech's most time-endured rival.|$|E

5|$|Dates {{are also}} {{relevant}} to this autobiographical reading. According to the text, Pym arrives at the island of Tsalal on January 19 — Poe's birthday. Scholars, including Burton R. Pollin and Richard Wilbur, suggest that the character of Augustus was based on Poe's childhood friend Ebenezer Burling or on Poe's brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who served in South America and elsewhere as a sailor aboard the USS Macedonian. In the novel, the date of Augustus's death corresponds {{to that of the}} death of Poe's brother. The first chapter features Pym's sloop named the Ariel, the name of a character <b>once</b> <b>played</b> by Poe's mother Eliza Poe, and also the name of Percy Bysshe Shelley's boat, on which he died, originally named Don Juan in honor of Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|Barry John {{was born}} in Cefneithin, Carmarthenshire in Wales. He was educated at Gwendraeth Grammar School in the Gwendraeth Valley, north of Llanelli. He {{attended}} Cefenithin Primary, {{and there he was}} fortunate to receive skilled rugby teaching. The headmaster, William John Jones, and teacher Ray Williams, were both former Wales international rugby players. Despite his natural talents, he never played at schoolboy level for Wales, but represented both his school and his local village team, Cefneithin RFC. He <b>once</b> <b>played</b> a game for rival team Pontyberem while still a schoolboy, but John recalls in his autobiography that the local resentment at making such a sporting faux pas ensured he never did so again. While still a teenager attending grammar school, he made his first top-flight rugby appearance for Llanelli, on 4 January 1964 in an encounter with Moseley. Although Llanelli lost the encounter, John scored a try and converted it, and played in four more matches for the Llanelli senior team {{towards the end of the}} season. He continued to represent Llanelli while at Trinity College, Carmarthen, and gained a reputation as a kicking fly-half with a penchant for putting over dropped goals. During the 1964/65 season, John began to make an impact on the Welsh club scene. His dropped goal against Aberavon on 26 October 1964, only 17games in, was his 11th of the season.|$|E

5|$|During Kratos' {{ten years}} {{of service to the}} Olympian Gods, he is sent to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. After {{successfully}} killing the Persian King, decimating his army and slaying their pet basilisk, Kratos observes the Sun fall from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. As he fights his way through the city of Marathon, the Spartan witnesses the black fog of the Olympian Morpheus cover the land. He hears a haunting flute melody, which he recognizes as a melody <b>once</b> <b>played</b> by his deceased daughter Calliope. Finding the Temple of Helios, Kratos is tasked by Athena to find the missing Sun God, as Morpheus has caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber in the absence of light. The Spartan eventually locates Helios' sister, Eos, who tells Kratos that the Titan Atlas has abducted her brother. Eos advises Kratos to seek the Primordial Fires, which he uses to awaken the fire steeds of Helios. The steeds take the Spartan to the Underworld, where he has two encounters with Charon at the River Styx. Although Charon initially defeats Kratos and banishes him to Tartarus, the Spartan returns and destroys the ferryman.|$|E
