50|$|Following the {{commercial}} {{introduction of the}} Kandahar binding in 1933, cable binding alpine racers were able to fasten the heel of the boot solidly {{to the top of}} the ski. They asked for heavier, stiffer boots to improve edge control. By the 1950s boots had grown stiff enough that lacing was an onerous chore. In 1955, the Swiss firm Henke introduced the Speedfit boot, closed with <b>overcenter</b> buckles invented by the pilot Hans Martin. In 1971 Henke introduced several three-piece plastic designs which suffered structural failures due to the choice of an insufficiently strong plastic material.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Journal of Aircraft and the definitive published version is available at [URL] method of investigating quasi-static mechanisms is presented and applied to an <b>overcenter</b> mechanism and to a nose landing gear mechanism. The method uses static equilibrium equations along with equations describing the geometric constraints in the mechanism. In the spirit of bifurcation analysis, solutions to these steady-state equations are then continued numerically in parameters of interest. Results obtained from the bifurcation method agree with the equivalent results obtained from two <b>overcenter</b> mechanism dynamic models (one state-space and one multibody dynamic model), while a considerable computation time reduction is demonstrated with the <b>overcenter</b> mechanism. The analysis performed with the nose landing gear model demonstrates {{the flexibility of the}} continuation approach, allowing conventional model states to be used as continuation parameters without a need to reformulate the equations within the model. This flexibility, coupled with the computation time reductions, suggests that the bifurcation approach has potential for analyzing complex landing gear mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Aerial lifts {{are used}} to elevate people and {{material}} to high heights. There are {{many different types of}} aerial lifts which have vastly different dynamics characteristics. Thus, a new categorization for aerial lifts was created and organizes them by their kinematics. Many accidents occur while using aerial lifts. Hazards of aerial lifts and current solutions to those hazards were reviewed to understand the causes of the accidents. Some major accidents are due to the complex dynamics and flexibility of aerial lifts, such as oscillations and tip-overs. Oscillations of full-size aerial lifts were experimentally tested to determine frequencies in different configurations. Machine-motion induced oscillations of an articulating aerial lift were simulated and analyzed for both non-overcenter and <b>overcenter</b> configurations. Input shaping was used to achieve reduction in machine-motion induced oscillations. Tip-over stability margin was used to simulate and analyze the stability of both non-overcenter and <b>overcenter</b> configurations. The effect of increased platform mass on tip-over stability margin was also analyzed. The results in this thesis are a categorization of aerial lifts including their hazards and methods of reducing those hazards, an experimental verification of the dynamic response of full-size aerial lifts, a fully dynamic tip-over prediction model of double-boom articulating aerial lift by applying flexibility in the joints and realistic velocity profiles, and a detailed study of the dynamics of a double-boom articulating aerial lift.

40|$|A {{device for}} {{attaching}} an experiment carrier to {{a space station}} handrail is provided. The device has two major components, a clamping mechanism for attachment to a space station handrail, and a pointing carrier on which an experiment package can be mounted and oriented. The handrail clamp uses an <b>overcenter</b> mechanism and the carrier mechanism uses an adjustable preload ball and socket for carrier positioning. The handrail clamp uses a stack of disk springs to provide a spring loaded button. This configuration provides consistent clamping force over a range of possible handrail thicknesses. Three load points are incorporated in the clamping mechanism thereby spreading the clamping load onto three separate points on the handrail. A four bar linkage is used to provide for a single actuation lever for all three load points. For additional safety, a secondary lock consisting of a capture plate and push lock keeps the clamp attached to the handrail {{in the event of}} main clamp failure. For the carrier positioning mechanism, a ball in a spring loaded socket uses friction to provide locking torque; however. the ball and socket are torque limited so that the ball ran slip under kick loads (125 pounds or greater). A lead screw attached to disk spring stacks is used to provide an adjustable spring force on the socket. A locking knob is attached to the lead screw to allow for hand manipulation of the lead screw...|$|E
