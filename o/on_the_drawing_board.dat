5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nansen was now {{considered}} an oracle by all would-be explorers {{of the north}} and south polar regions. Abruzzi had consulted him, as had the Belgian Adrien de Gerlache, each of whom took expeditions to the Antarctic. Although Nansen refused to meet his own countryman and fellow-explorer Carsten Borchgrevink (whom he considered a fraud), he gave advice to Robert Falcon Scott on polar equipment and transport, prior to the 1901–04 Discovery Expedition. At one point Nansen seriously considered leading a South Pole expedition himself, and asked Colin Archer to design two ships. However, these plans remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once the Stuka {{became too}} {{vulnerable}} to fighter opposition on all fronts, {{work was done}} to develop a replacement. None of the dedicated close-support designs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> progressed far due {{to the impact of}} the war and technological difficulties. So the Luftwaffe settled on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft, with the Fw 190F becoming the ground-attack version. The Fw 190F started to replace the Ju 87 for day missions in 1943, but the Ju 87 continued {{to be used as a}} night nuisance-raider until the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E
25|$|A northward {{extension}} to Killingworth and Cramlington has been planned since the Metro was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board,</b> but would require widening of the busy East Coast Main Line to four tracks, {{which would be}} expensive, and a new alignment involving street running.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to tell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> how this will play out. Nor is it possible using a dummy pit of U-238 and high-speed x-ray cameras, although such tests are helpful. For final determination, a test needs to be made with real fissile material. Consequently, starting in 1957, a year after Swan, both labs began one-point safety tests.|$|E
50|$|Gordon was {{involved}} in the controversy over naming the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, after its founding in Montreal.

In AWPD-42, the B-29 was shifted to attacks on Japan, and the B-36 development at Consolidated-Vultee was slowed in favor of manufacturing more B-24 Liberators. The extra long range of the B-36 would not be needed now that the United Kingdom appeared secure from attack.|$|E

25|$|A {{meeting with}} the DNC was convened to discuss the results. The Fleming craft had few friends in the DNC, though their criticisms were not specific. They {{introduced}} representatives of three shipbuilding firms. The ISTDC were only interested in the Fleming design submitted already, and in trying the craft at a landing {{on the east coast}} of England in a matter of months. The DNC accepted this, but asked ISTDC to give their specifications to the firms present so that they could also submit designs. Two of the firms were unable to tender, the third, Messrs Thornycroft, had a proposal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> in forty-eight hours and ISTDC and the DNC agreed that construction of a prototype should be paid for. The craft might be constructed for experimental purposes on the understanding that the DNC held no responsibility.|$|E

50|$|The {{air station}} was {{deactivated}} in October 1946, {{the land was}} reverted to caretaker status, and the land and buildings leased jointly to the University of Maine and Bowdoin College. When the station’s facilities were no longer required, the University of Maine and Bowdoin College terminated their leases and in 1949, operations at NAS Brunswick were {{taken over by the}} Brunswick Flying Service. This commercial deviation was short-lived however, when the Navy selected the station as a potential center for development of “Services to the Fleet”.

25|$|The traffic {{problems}} that had blighted Potsdamer Platz for decades {{continued to be}} a big headache, despite the new lights, and these led to a strong desire to solve them once and for all. By now Berlin was a major centre of innovation in many different fields including architecture. In addition, the city’s colossal pace of change (compared by some to that of Chicago), had caused its chief planner, Martin Wagner (1885–1957), to foresee the entire centre being made over totally as often as every 25 years. These factors combined to produce some far more radical and futuristic plans for Potsdamer Platz in the late 1920s and early 1930s, especially around 1928-9, when the creative fervour was at its peak. On the cards was an almost total redevelopment of the area. One design submitted by Wagner himself comprised an array of gleaming new buildings arranged around a vast multi-level system of fly-overs and underpasses, with a huge glass-roofed circular car-park in the middle. Unfortunately the worldwide Great Depression of the time, triggered by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, meant that most of the plans remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board.</b> However, in Germany this depression was virtually a continuation of an economic morass that had blighted the country since the end of World War I, partly the result of the war reparations the country had been made to pay, and this morass had brought about the closure and demolition of the Grand Hotel Belle Vue, on the corner of Bellevuestraße and Königgrätzer Straße, thus enabling one revolutionary new building to struggle through to reality despite considerable financial odds.|$|E
500|$|Ed Boon {{recalled}} that for {{six out of}} the eight months {{while they were in}} production of the original Mortal Kombat, [...] "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate". Some of the names suggested included [...] "Kumite", [...] "Dragon Attack", [...] "Death Blow" [...] and just [...] "Fatality". Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> for the names in Boon's office and then someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just to be kind of weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck". Since then, the series uses the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for various words containing the hard C sound.

500|$|The {{construction}} of battleships armed with 16-inch guns was {{envisioned by the}} United States Navy General Board and Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) as early as 1913, as the upgrade in gun caliber promised twice the kinetic energy of the 12-inch gun then in service and half again {{as much as the}} 14-inch gun then being introduced. This weapon dominated the design of battleships between 1913 and 1916, just as the 14-inch gun had dictated designs from 1908 to 1910. However, while the General Board approved the 16-inch gun as early as 1911, the secretary of the navy felt that a move to a new gun caliber might make capital ships still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>board</b> obsolete. For this reason, he restricted the Bureau of Ordnance to proceed no further than blueprints for the new gun as a hedge against foreign developments. He finally approved {{construction of}} this gun in October 1912 and the weapon was test fired successfully in August 1914. This success, along with the unofficial news in several naval publications of 15- and 16-inch weapons being adopted by Britain, Italy, Germany and Japan, the Board considered abandoning construction of the [...] in favor of an up-gunned design. Such a move meant an increase of 8,000 tons per ship, twice as much as the jump from the s to the Pennsylvanias. Debate continued for the next three years. Each year, President Woodrow Wilson's secretary of the navy, Josephus Daniels, balked at the potential increase in cost and ordered instead that the design features of Standard Class be upheld. Daniels finally compromised with the 1917 design battleships by allowing their armament to be upgraded. This, however, was to be the only substantial change to be allowed.|$|E
