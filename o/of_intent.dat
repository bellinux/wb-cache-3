5|$|John Koller {{explains}} the role <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> in Jainism with {{the example of}} a monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence <b>of</b> <b>intent</b> does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E

5|$|Numerous colleges showed {{interest}} and recruited Heyward, including UCLA, which offered a full-ride scholarship {{due in part}} to the family connection. Heyward was also especially interested in Clemson and Georgia Tech. Concurrently, the hometown Atlanta Braves had followed and scouted him for years, while attempting to conceal their excitement. They made him the 14th overall selection in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. Despite signing a National Letter <b>of</b> <b>Intent</b> with UCLA, Heyward chose professional baseball over college and signed a contract with them worth $1.7 million – $170,000 more than MLB's slot recommendation of $1.53 million on the following August 12.

This paper reviews the current understanding <b>of</b> design <b>intent</b> {{and its relationship to}} design rationale and builds on the idea that communication <b>of</b> design <b>intent</b> conveyed via CAD models can be satisfied at three levels provided that specialized instruction is used to instruct users in selection of the most suitable level for each intent...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} dialog {{frameworks}} which allow manual specification <b>of</b> <b>intents</b> and rule based dialog flow.

In this paper we propose an approach to find these frequent user utterances (which serve as examples for intents) and corresponding agent responses. We propose a novel SimCluster algorithm that extends standard K-means algorithm to simultaneously cluster user utterances and agent utterances by taking their adjacency information into account. The method also aligns these clusters to provide pairs <b>of</b> <b>intents</b> and response groups. We compare our results with those produced by using simple Kmeans clustering on a real dataset and observe upto 10 % absolute improvement in F 1 -scores. Through our experiments on synthetic dataset, we show that our algorithm gains more advantage over K-means algorithm when the data has large variance...|$|R
