5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and kisses her back.|$|E
5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reading the}} flash, Cronkite took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> {{so he could}} consult the studio clock, which {{established}} the lapse in time since Kennedy had died. He paused briefly and replaced his eyeglasses, visibly moved for a moment. Cronkite continued: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's enough," [...] said McGinty, {{draining}} <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] "I {{came down}} {{to give you a}} word in season, and you've had it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will give}} the charming Miss Winthrop," [...] said Rupert, without a moment's hesitation, tossing <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> with an air that said, [...] "how do you like that?" ...|$|R
60|$|Brown {{sat down}} on the parapet, and, taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> gold-rimmed <b>glasses,</b> held them in his hand.|$|R
2500|$|At 2:38 pm EST, while {{filling in}} time with some {{observations}} about the security presence in Dallas, which had been increased due to a disastrous visit by United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson to the city earlier in 1963, Cronkite was handed a new bulletin. After looking it over for a moment, he took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> and made the official announcement: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "H'm, may be," [...] said Swann, taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> {{and looking}} at him. [...] "But you don't think Captain Nugent is in London, do you?" ...|$|E
60|$|The tenant of {{the room}} nodded. He had taken <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and their absence {{revealed}} a face of strong individuality. He spoke quietly but distinctly.|$|E
6000|$|Dear Jack, {{this white}} mug that with Guinness I fill, [...] And drink {{to the health}} of sweet Nan of the Hill, [...] Was once Tommy Tosspot's, as jovial a sot [...] As e'er drew a spigot, or drain'd a full pot-- [...] In {{drinking}} all round 'twas his joy to surpass, [...] And with all merry tipplers he swigg'd <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Dobbin went up {{and whispered}} {{something}} to him, at which George, giving a start and a wild hurray, tossed <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass,</b> clapped it on the table, and walked away speedily on his friend's arm. [...] "The enemy has passed the Sambre," [...] William said, [...] "and our left is already engaged. Come away. We are to march in three hours." ...|$|R

60|$|Brown took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> {{and held}} them in one hand, which, as Austin knew, was a trick of his when he had {{anything}} on his mind.|$|E
6000|$|Silas took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> again--finding himself too {{intensely}} {{disgusted by}} the sprightly appearance {{of his friend}} and partner to bear a magnified view of him and made the inquiry: ...|$|E
60|$|Old Bryson {{was calm}} and forty and sequestered. He {{was in a}} corner reading a book, {{and when he saw}} Gillian {{approaching}} he sighed, laid down his book and took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Wussing your health, sirs," [...] {{said the}} shepherd; and having taken <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass,</b> and {{observed}} the whisky {{was the right}} thing, he continued, [...] "It's no for the like o' us to be judging, to be sure; {{but it was a}} bonny knowe that broomy knowe, and an unco braw shelter for the lambs in a severe morning like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|But, though Jin Vin tossed <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> without scruple, {{while the}} lady sippped hers more moderately, {{it did not}} appear to produce the {{expected}} amendment upon his humour. On the contrary, as he threw himself into the great leathern chair, in which Dame Ursley was wont to solace herself of an evening, he declared himself [...] "the most miserable dog within the sound of Bow-bell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I {{will end}} my sermon, and wish you both health and {{happiness}} and fulness of days," [...] and he drank <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> of champagne, and looked so pleasant and kindly that Augusta longed {{to kiss him}} on the spot, and as for Eustace, he shook hands with him warmly, and then and there a friendship began between the two which endures till now.|$|R
60|$|We {{took up a}} {{telegram}} that was lying {{on his desk and}} opened it. His face became a livid yellow. He put the flimsy paper down with a slow, reluctant movement and took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|E
60|$|Rose had {{perception}} {{enough at}} command {{to feel the}} powerful personalities grouped about her. She sat near Dr. Sanborn, with whom she was at ease at once, he was so awkward and so kindly. He took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and polished them carefully as if anxious to see her better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ahem! Why, Mr. Hodder," [...] he exclaimed, squinting <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> [...] "that was a {{magnificent}} effort. I {{was saying to}} Mr. Parr that it isn't often one hears a sermon nowadays as able as that, and as sound. Many clergymen refrain from preaching them, I sometimes think, because they are afraid people won't like them." ...|$|E
60|$|Daggett tossed <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> to this toast, {{and the two}} {{then went}} on deck. Roswell Gardiner thought that a kinder ship's company never sailed {{together}} than this of the Sea Lion of Holmes' Hole; for, notwithstanding the interest of every man on board depended on the returns of their own voyage, each and all appeared willing to stick by him and his craft {{so long as there}} was a possibility of being of any service.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, we won't {{argue about}} that," [...] said {{the police officer}} good-humouredly. [...] "I expect we all do our duty same as we see it; but we can't all see it the same." [...] He had drunk <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> and had turned to go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was scowling at his elbow. [...] "Hullo! Hullo!" [...] he cried, looking him up and down. [...] "Here's an old acquaintance!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe in}} waiting," [...] said Jasper, wiping the dust <b>off</b> <b>his</b> {{photographic}} <b>glasses.</b> [...] "Why, {{he has a}} lovely moor of his own, and {{does not know how}} to use it!" ...|$|R
60|$|I was not shocked, but I was silent, uncomfortable, {{wishing that}} it were {{time to take}} the train back to the city. Cousin Robert's face was more worn than I had thought, and I contrasted him inevitably with the {{forceful}} person who used to stand, in his worn alpaca coat, on the pavement in front of his store, greeting with clear-eyed content his fellow merchants of the city. Willie Breck, too, was silent, and Walter Kinley took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and wiped them. In the meanwhile Helen had left the group in which my mother sat, and, approaching us, laid her hands on her father's shoulders.|$|E
60|$|When alone, {{the bold}} man put <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> made a careful {{inspection}} of the ground, came to a conclusion--founded on scientific data no doubt--as to the probable spot whence the tiger would issue from the jungle when about to seize the goat, and, just opposite that spot, {{on the face of}} a slope about ten yards from the goat, he dug a hole deep enough to contain his own person. The soil was sandy easy to dig, and quite dry. It was growing dusk when the professor crept into this rifle-pit, drew his weapons and the spade in after him, and closed the mouth of the pit with moist earth, leaving only a very small eye-hole through which he could see the goat standing innocently by the brink of the pool.|$|E
60|$|The road {{he was on}} led {{directly}} north, and it was joined {{about a quarter of}} a mile above by the road which ran through the woods to the Green Sulphur Springs. On this road, at a point nearly opposite to him, he could see, through the foliage, a horseman riding toward the point of junction. Something about this person attracted his attention, and Mr Brandon took out a pair of eye-glasses and put them on. As soon as he had obtained another good view of the horseman he recognized him as Mr Croft. The old gentleman took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and returned them to his vest pocket, and his face began to flush. In his early acquaintance with Mr Croft he had not objected to him, because he wished his niece to have company, and he had a firm belief in the enduring quality of her affection for Junius. But, latterly, his ideas in regard to the New York gentleman had changed. He had thought him somewhat too assiduous, and when he had unexpectedly returned from the North, Mr Brandon had not been at all pleased, although he had been careful not to show his displeasure. This condition of things made him feel uneasy, and had prompted his visit to the widow Keswick. And now that everything looked so fair and promising, here was that man, whom he had supposed to have left this part of the country, riding toward his house.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Edmonstone was resentful now, really displeased, {{and wounded}} to the quick. The point {{on which he}} was {{especially}} sensitive was his reputation for sense and judgment; and that Guy, who had shown him so much respect and affection, whom he had treated with invariable kindness, and received into his family like a son, that he should thus speak of him shocked him extremely. He was too much overcome even to break out into exclamations at first, he only drank <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> of wine hastily, and said, 'I would never have thought it!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sergeant}} tossed <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> {{again and}} seemed quite {{ready for another}} glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget {{that he had made}} a present of the wine, but took the bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the same liberality, when the first was gone.|$|R
60|$|Freddie broke <b>off</b> {{and drained}} <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b> The {{recollection}} of that painful moment {{had made him}} feverish. Social difficulties always did.|$|R
50|$|Corbucci lets Clay {{reach the}} horizon, then cuts to a medium shot of Clay taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> {{throwing}} {{them in the}} air, and shooting holes in both lenses. His sight, miraculously, has been completely restored.|$|E
50|$|Rick {{goes home}} and discovers {{his parents are}} not there. He then pulls out a box from a drawer, opens it, and finds his father's hand gun. He takes <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> shakes, and intently stares at it.|$|E
50|$|When {{he changes}} to his psycho form, {{he has taken}} <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and begins acting crazy, {{spinning}} around, making faces and jumping about. The video starts and ends {{with the impression that}} a television is being switched on and off.|$|E
6000|$|The Margrave of Rudesheimer was {{a slender}} man of elegant appearance. As Vivian watched the glance of his {{speaking}} eye, and the half-satirical and half-jovial smile which played upon his features, he hardly expected {{that he would}} be as silent as his predecessors. But the Margrave spoke no word. He gave a kind of shout of savage exultation as he smacked his lips after dashing <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> of Rudesheimer; and scarcely noticing the salutations of those who drank his health, he threw himself back in his chair, and listened seemingly with a smile of derision, while the Grand Duke of Johannisberger again spoke: ...|$|R
5000|$|The short {{begins with}} Donald wiping the fog <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> door, {{excited to see}} the snow. Donald {{says that he is}} excited about snow. He opens his door and soon gets his bill frozen from the cold. He gets a fur {{overcoat}} and pulls a sled, while singing Jingle Bells. When Donald reaches the top of the hill, he notices his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, at the bottom, building a snowman, while singing For He's a Jolly Good Fellow. Tempted, Donald crashes his sled into their snowman and thus his nephews, resulting each of them to [...] "wear" [...] a part of their snowman. While Donald is laughing himself silly, Huey, Dewey, and Louie plot revenge.|$|R
6000|$|The archdeacon drank <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> of claret and {{prepared}} {{himself to be}} energetic. [...] "I do hope," [...] said he, [...] "that {{you are not going}} to be so weak as to allow such a man as Mr. Slope to deter you from doing what you know it is your duty to do. You know it is your duty to resume your place at the hospital now that parliament has so settled the stipend as to remove those difficulties which induced you to resign it. You cannot deny this, and should your timidity now prevent you from doing so, your conscience will hereafter never forgive you," [...] and as he finished this clause of his speech, he pushed over the bottle to his companion.|$|R
