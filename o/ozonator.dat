According to EU Regulation EC 1774 / 2002, food waste should be pasteurized/sterilized before or after anaerobic digestion. With respect to this regulation and also considering the slow kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process, thermal and chemical pretreatments of food waste prior to mesophilic anaerobic digestion were studied. A series of batch experiments to determine the biomethane potential of untreated as well as pretreated food waste was carried out. All tested conditions of both thermal and ozonation pretreatments resulted in an enhanced biomethane production. The kinetics of the anaerobic digestion process were, however, accelerated by thermal pretreatment at lower temperatures (< 120 C) only.

Computer simulations, bench-scale and pilot plant tests have proved {{that the system is}} capable of removing substantially all of the NOx from natural gas fired equipment exhaust streams. Originally designated as the Cannon NOx Digester, it has recently been renamed the Low Temperature Oxidation (LTO) System for NOx and SOx Reduction. The principal elements in the system are a fan, heat exchanger, oxidation chamber, spray chamber acting as a gas/liquid absorber, demister, an ozone generator, liquid oxygen storage or dry air supply system for the <b>ozonator,</b> chemical storage and metering system for the caustic neutralizer, and a data acquisition and control system. Most of the ozone is consumed in converting NOx to N{sub 2 }O{sub 5 } which hydrates to nitric acid which is then scrubbed out of the gas as it passes through the absorber. CO also reacts with ozone to form CO{sub 2 } which is subsequently scrubbed out with NaOH.

40|$|The {{removal of}} 4 -nitrophenol (4 NP) from aqueous {{solution}} by ozone combined with nano-ZnO {{was investigated in}} a laboratory-scale reactor in which pH of solution, ZnO dosage and initial 4 -nitrophenol concentration were considered as variables. The degradation of 4 -nitrophenol was determined using UV-Vis and HPLC methods. Interestingly, the degradation of 4 -nitrophenol was high under acidic condition where the degradation was about 93 % at initial phenol solution pH= 3. It was due to aggregation of nano-ZnO particles above pH= 6. 5. This result {{was different from the}} case of ozonation alone, in which higher pH had positive effect on the degradation of 4 -nitrophenol due to the formation of hydroxyl radical. As expected, degradation efficiency increased by increasing the nano ZnO dosage and initial 4 -nitrophenol concentration. It was found that the nanosized ZnO enhanced the degradation of ozone and the catalytic ozonation enhanced the degradation of 4 -nitrophenol {{on the surface of the}} nanosized ZnO. In addition, the degree of degradation was also determined indirectly through Total Organic Carbon (TOC) of the samples. Carbon mineralization of 4 -nitrophenol was obtained as 13. 68 % and 60. 34 % during ozonation and nano-ZnO catalytic ozonation, respectively, after 30 min reaction, proving that combined <b>ozonator</b> and nano-ZnO for reduction of TOC is more efficient.

The concentration of ozone was measured in the solutions on a NF 254 / 1 spectrophotometer. Experiments were carried out on 200 non-inbred albino male rats in 4 series of experiments. After simulating fecal peritonitis by the procedure developed by S. S. Remennik, the animals were intraperitoneally injected ozonized perfluorane (Series 1), ozonized saline solution (Series 2), perfluorane (Series 3), and saline solution (Series 4) on the basis of 1. 5 ml per 100 g of weight. Nine intact rats were used as a control. Results. The congenital immunity parameters (phagocytic block, intracellular and serum bactericidal activities) were studied. An association was found between the clinical course and the degree of nonspecific immunity suppression. The ozonized perfluorane was ascertained to have a more significant protective action on nonspecific immunity factors than perfluorane or the ozonized saline solution. The factors under study were significantly decreased when saline solution was administered, and with this there was a mass mortality of Series 4 rats on days 2 — 14 of the experiment. Conclusion. The therapeutic effect of the ozonized perfluorane is due to the activation of phagocytic mononuclear leukocytes and their increased count, to the antibacterial activity of ozone and the protective action on the nonspecific link of the body’s immunological resistance...|$|E

40|$|Il est admis aujourd'hui que la génotoxicité identifiée dans les extraits d'eau potable provient principalement de l'action du chlore sur la matière organique naturelle qui donne naissance à des dérivés organohalogénés. Dans le présent travail, nous avons comparé la sensibilité de trois essais de génotoxicité (SOS chromotest, test d'Ames-fluctuation et test micronoyau triton) lors de l'étude de composés organohalogénés, d'acides fulviques chlorés et d'échantillons d'eau (non concentrés) en cours de {{traitement}} de potabilisation. Les composés organohalogénés étudiés sont 4 trihalométhanes, 5 acétonitriles et 5 chloropropanones identifiés dans l'eau potable ou dans des solutions de substances humiques chlorées. Les résultats obtenus révèlent que le SOS chromotest est globalement le moins sensible des trois essais et que le test d'Ames-fluctuation et le test micronoyau triton permettent généralement de détecter les plus faibles concentrations de composés génotoxiques. Les essais ont également permis de démontrer que {{la nature}} des substituants halogénés (brome ou chlore), le nombre et la position des atomes de chlore influencent notablement la génotoxicité des composés organohalogénés. Toutefois, les résultats obtenus indiquent qu'aucun des trois tests réalisés n'est suffisant à lui seul pour détecter l'ensemble des produits génotoxiques. Ces observations confirment la nécessité de réaliser une batterie de tests qui mette en oeuvre divers types cellulaires et différents systèmes de métabolisation, et détecte divers évènements de génotoxicité. Les travaux portant sur les solutions concentrées d'acides fulviques chlorés montrent l'intérêt des essais sur bactéries (particulièrement le test d'Ames-fluctuation) pour la détection rapide de l'activité génotoxique de ces solutions. L'étude concemant les échantillons d'eau prélevés à différents niveaux d'une station de potabilisation, et analysés sans concentration préalable, indique que le test d'Ames- fluctuation est le seul capable de détecter une activité génotoxique dans les échantillons non concentrés étudiés. On montre, conformément à la littérature, que l'activité mutagène observée résulte de la chloration de l'eau. Since {{the identification of}} organohalides in drinking water in 1974, several investigators have detected genotoxic activity in drinking water concentrates. It is now widely admitted that the observed genotoxicity originates mainly from the reaction of chlorine on natural organic matter contained in the raw water, {{which leads to the}} formation of organohalogenated compounds. The aim {{of this study is to}} show the benefit of three short-term assays for the evaluation of the genotoxic potency of organohalogenated compounds and of complex mixtures. In a wider context, the purpose is to identify a test or a battery of tests that can contribute to the control of natural and drinking water genotoxicity. The three genotoxicity assays carried out during this work were:- the SOS chromotest, a primary DNA damage in vitro assay on Escherichia coli; - the Ames- fluctuation test, a point mutation in vitro assay on Salmonella typhimurium; - and the newt micronucleus test, a chromosomal aberration in vivo assay on the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl. These assays display a valuable advantage: the water samples under study can be analyzed without concentration prior to testing. Thus, the different concentration procedures, which may modify the original genotoxicity of the water samples, are avoided. A previous study on seven reference genotoxic chemicals had indicated that the SOS chromotest was never the most sensitive of the three tests (for a given chemical, the most sensitive assay is defined as the test which detects the lowest concentration inducing a significant genotoxic effect). On the contrary, the Ames-fluctuation test proved to be the most sensitive for compounds showing direct genotoxic activity, and the newt micronucleus test the most sensitive for chemicals with indirect genotoxic effects. None of the assays was the most sensitive for every substance analyzed. These observations suggested the need to implement a battery of tests using several cell types, different metabolization systems and detecting several genotoxicity events. This earlier study also showed, in accord with several results in the literature, that the Ames-fluctuation test (in liquid medium) demonstrated a better sensitivity than the Ames test (in agar solid medium). The first part of the present study involved testing the genotoxicity of 14 organo- halogenated compounds identified in drinking water samples or in chlorinated humic matter samples. The chemicals studied were four chlorinated and/or brominated trihalomethanes (trichloro-, bromodichloro-, chlorodibromo- and tribromomethane), five chlorinated or brominated acetonitriles with one, two or three halogens (monochloro-, dichloro-, trichloro-, monobromo- and dibromoacetonitrile) and five chlorinated propanones with one, two or three substitutions on one or two carbon atoms (monochloro-, 1, 1 -dichloro-, 1, 3 -dichloro-, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- and 1, 1, 3 - trichloropropanone). Although the SOS chromotest was the most sensitive for 3 of the 14 substances analyzed, the results confirmed that this test was globally the least sensitive; the Ames-fluctuation test and the newt micronucleus test remained the most efficient assays. It is interesting to note that the Ames-fluctuation test appeared the most sensitive for all the chloropropanones tested and the newt micronucleus test, for all the haloacetonitriles analyzed. Moreover, several structure-activity relationships were demonstrated: the nature of the halogenated substituents (bromine or chlorine), the number and, above all, the position of chlorine atoms strongly influenced the genotoxicity of the organohalides studied. In the second part of the work we analyzed the effects of complex mixtures containing several organohalogenated compounds: the three tests were performed on two chlorinated fulvic acids of different origin. Pornic fulvic acid was extracted from a surface water reservoir used to produce drinking water in Vendée (France) and Pinail fulvic acid came from a forest pond near Poitiers (France). The total organic carbon was about 1 g/l in the solution subjected to chlorination and the molar chlorination ratio was 1. 5 Cl 2 /C. The results showed the advantage of tests using bacteria: the Ames fluctuation test was the only assay able to detect the genotoxicity of both chlorinated fulvic acids; the SOS chromotest detected the genotoxic effect of only one of the chlorinated fulvic acids (Pinail). In contrast, the newt micronucleus test did not show any genotoxicity of the chlorinated fulvic acids. However, it must be pointed out that, as insufficient fulvic acid was available, the genotoxic potency of these solutions on the newt was not tested under adequate conditions (e. g., subchronic concentrations were not studied). Nevertheless, the concentrations of fulvic acid analyzed were very close to those found in the aquatic environment. The last part of the study attempted to approximate environmental and human exposure conditions: the three tests were performed on four water samples taken at several stages of a drinking water treatment plant. These samples were analyzed for genotoxicity in the three test systems without preconcentration. The plant studied is characterized by the following treatment steps: - coagulation-flocculation; - chlorination at 6 g Cl 2 /m 3; - sand filtration; - ozonation at 1. 9 g O 3 /m 3; - final chlorination at 1. 4 g Cl 2 /m 3 before sending the treated water into the distribution system. The four samples were taken: 1. before any treatment (raw water, 10 to 13 mg total organic carbon per liter), 2. between the sand layer filter and the <b>ozonator</b> (chlorinated water), 3. after the <b>ozonator</b> (ozonated water), 4. and at the end of the treatment process (treated water). The results obtained confirmed the advantage of the Ames fluctuation test, which was the only assay able to detect a genotoxic activity in the unconcentrated water samples studied. Regarding the influence of the different chemical treatments on the mutagenicity observed, it was demonstrated that the first chlorination step led to the formation of direct-acting mutagens. The treatment with ozone, at the rate used, did not significantly modify the mutagenicity of the samples that had previously been chlorinated. Similarly, the second chlorination step did not significantly increase the direct mutagenicity detected. Practically, our study indicated that the Ames-fluctuation test is the only assay, among the three performed that is able to contribute efficiently to the control of drinking water genotoxicity. In this context, the benefit of the SOS chromotest appears only in case of accidental pollution: indeed, it is the only test able to yield results within 24 hours. The implementation of the newt micronucleus test could be useful for the control of natural or drinking water genotoxicity in case of extensive pollution...|$|E
