She took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> water and foundered the following morning after her crew was evacuated.

Achilles was assigned blockade duties in the North Sea after the battle and sank the German raider Leopard in early 1917. Both of the surviving ships were briefly transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in late 1917 for convoy escort duties before returning home in early 1918. Achilles began a lengthy refit in February 1918 while Cochrane was based in Murmansk in mid-1918 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She became stranded in the Mersey on 14 November 1918 and broke in two. The wreck was broken up in place by June 1919.

25|$|When organised, the {{defending}} team will offer no resistance until the attacking team has advanced {{to a certain}} height on the pitch. The pressure height, or at which depth the midfielders should start acting as first and second defenders, depends <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> factors. For example, as higher pressure is more tiring, it demands players with good stamina. In general, a defensive-minded team will tend to stay lower, thus diminishing defensive risks as opponents get less space. This however, also gives them a longer way to the goal {{in the event of}} a break and counter-attack, making the long through ball a typical alternative.|$|E

The club had no regular first baseman, no regular third baseman, and the primary left fielder hit [...]239/.302/.342 against right-handers.

Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E

The latter had a strong influence on the album with Rhys stating: [...] "when we found the harpsichord everything started to go 1960s... and we kind of followed that feeling..." [...] Although Gruff Rhys had initially told fans to expect a [...] "speaker-blowing" [...] LP the addition of instruments such as the harpsichord meant {{this was not the}} case; the album instead highlights the band's [...] "musical sweet tooth".|$|E

In Gruff Rhys's words Hey Venus! is [...] "a straight up album of songs... with key changes and a live band playing them" [...] with more emphasis [...] "on songs than the arrangement". According to Rhys [...] "nobody brought samplers into the studio, so there's far less electronics than <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> our records... a lot of electronic music is quite a solitary pursuit.
