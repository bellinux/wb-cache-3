25|$|In 2009, {{a simple}} {{electronic}} circuit consisting of an LC network and a memristor {{was used to}} model experiments on adaptive behavior of unicellular organisms. It was shown that subjected to a train of periodic pulses, the circuit learns and anticipates the next pulse similar to the behavior of slime molds Physarum polycephalum where the viscosity of channels in the cytoplasm responds to periodic environment changes. Applications of such circuits may include, e.g., pattern recognition. The DARPA SyNAPSE project funded HP Labs, {{in collaboration with the}} Boston University Neuromorphics Lab, has been developing neuromorphic architectures which may be based on memristive systems. In 2010, Versace and Chandler described the MoNETA (Modular Neural Exploring Traveling Agent) model. MoNETA is the first large-scale neural network model to implement whole-brain circuits to power a virtual and robotic agent using memristive hardware. Application of the memristor crossbar structure in the construction of an analog soft computing system was demonstrated by Merrikh-Bayat and Shouraki. In 2011 they showed how memristor crossbars can be combined with fuzzy logic to create an analog memristive neuro-fuzzy computing system with fuzzy input and <b>output</b> <b>terminals.</b> Learning is based on the creation of fuzzy relations inspired from Hebbian learning rule.|$|E
500|$|However, if the {{generator}} is left open circuit, a voltage of [...] appears at {{the generator}} <b>output</b> <b>terminals</b> as in figure3.

2500|$|A {{principal}} idealization {{behind the}} formulation of the Introduction is the network's division into two autonomous blocks (that is, with their own individually determined transfer functions), a simple example of what often is called [...] "circuit partitioning", which refers in this instance to the division into a forward amplification block and a feedback block. In practical amplifiers, the information flow is not unidirectional as shown here. Frequently these blocks are taken to be two-port networks to allow inclusion of bilateral information transfer. Casting an amplifier into this form is a non-trivial task, however, especially when the feedback involved is not global (that is directly from the output to the input) but local (that is, feedback within the network, involving nodes that do not coincide with input and/or <b>output</b> <b>terminals).</b>|$|E
2500|$|If {{predictable}} {{operation is}} desired, negative feedback is used, by applying {{a portion of}} the output voltage to the inverting input. The closed-loop feedback greatly reduces the gain of the circuit. [...] When negative feedback is used, the circuit's overall gain and response becomes determined mostly by the feedback network, rather than by the op-amp characteristics. If the feedback network is made of components with values small relative to the op amp's input impedance, the value of the op-amp's open-loop response AOL does not seriously affect the circuit's performance. The response of the op-amp circuit with its input, output, and feedback circuits to an input is characterized mathematically by a transfer function; designing an op-amp circuit to have a desired transfer function is in the realm of electrical engineering. [...] The transfer functions are important in most applications of op-amps, such as in analog computers. High input impedance at the input terminals and low output impedance at the <b>output</b> <b>terminal(s)</b> are particularly useful features of an op-amp.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{high-voltage}} enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils {{similar to}} some of Tesla's [...] "later" [...] 2-coil air-core designs. These typically consist of a primary tank circuit, a series LC (inductance-capacitance) circuit composed of a high-voltage capacitor, spark gap and primary coil, and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the secondary coil plus a terminal capacitance or [...] "top load". In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving {{the bottom of a}} separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a capacitor, the other 'plate' being the earth (or [...] "ground"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit. The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air. Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped <b>output</b> <b>terminals.</b> These are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical field {{near the top of the}} secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.|$|E

50|$|Two {{types of}} sense are used, {{depending}} on where the power supply output is measured.
