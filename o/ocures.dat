The regional unit {{is located in the}} South-Eastern part of the Transylvanian Basin (large basin within the Carpathian Mountains). In this paper, we analyzed the distribution of the landslides through spatial statistics techniques and GIS. In order to analyze the distribution of the landslides we took into consideration 5 criteria: geology, height, slope, exposition and the territorial administrative units. This type of study is necessary to find out {{the way in which the}} actual landslides are distributed and on the other hand, the research will collect information on the susceptible fields which are favored by these geomorphological processes. After the visual analysis of the area using the 1 : 5000 aerial photography and topographic maps, 835 landslides were identified and vectorized. At the level of administrative-territorial units, these cover mostly agricultural areas. Given the lithological conditions (the presence of friable rocks of marl, clay and poorly cemented sands) and the land use (mostly agricultural) it can be said that in the future new landslides will <b>ocure</b> in similar conditions of slope, exposition and geological characteristic etc. The identification of areas that are susceptible to landslides is beneficial for the future territorial planning actions and also to avoid building on areas which are prone to landslides...|$|R

40|$|The species {{diversity}} of trees maintained in tropical rain forests {{is much higher}} than in temperate, boreal, or seasonally dry tropical forests. In this paper, we analyze a mathematical model of tree-by-tree replacement. Withe gap formation <b>ocuring</b> throughout the year, a season unfavorable for growth causes a peak of regeneration opportunity {{in the beginning of the}} growing season. The resulting synchronization of regeneration opportunityjeopardizes the coexistence of many similar species. 1. Introduciton An important unsolved quesfion in ecology iS what controls ffie richness of species of asimil life form living in the same habitat. The problem is illustrated most clearly by the latitudinal gradient of tree {{species diversity}}, as tropical rain forests include by far more tree species than temperate forests of the same area. For example, within a research area of 2 ha of the tropical forest at Pasoh, Malaysia (I), there are 1169 individual trees with the DBH (diameter at breast height) larger than $ 10 cm$, and they constitute 276 species. Even the commonest species has no more than 5 percent of the total, only 8 species have more than 18 individuals, and 114 species are represented by a single individual. This makes sharp contrast with many temperate and boreal forests, in which one or a few dominant species occupy a large fraction of area. Among tropical forests where the temperature is constantly high throughout the year, the species diversity clearly decreases with the length of the dry season (1). The species diversity of trees is the highest for tropical rain forests in Borneo, where monthly precipitation exceeds 100 mm throughout the year. The diversity is lower for Amazonian or African tropics, whic...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies {{its mind}} to the evaluation of five selected localities caused by slate mining {{in the area of}} the Low Jeseník, namely at point-blank range the Kružberk water reservoir and is based on the lichenological research and on the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute data. Two lacalities, 1 and 2 are located in the west side of the dam, the locality 3 is in the east side and the localities 4 and 5 are located to the south from the dam. From 2015 to 2016, during the ongoing research, there were determined 23 the most commonly <b>ocuring</b> tereristic lichen species. To the found vulnerable species belong, for example, Cladonia glauca or Cladonia ciliata. In the locality 3 the most occuring family Cladoniceae is mainly represented by Cladonia ciliata, Cladonia rangiferina and Cladonia arbuscula. Based on the results it was discovered that lichen species coming from the Cladoniceae family are the most frequently spread on the upper part of the localities, on the top of the slate slag heaps; but the slopes are prefered by sessile species. The slope posts are too extreme because of their enormous inclination and exposition. The tree storey was determined too together with frequency of woody plants incidence on the grounds of localities shielding. Full-grown trees expanded from the surrounding forest were especially found at the slag heap bases. Larix decidua was mostly observed, Betula pendula colonized slopes. On the bases of The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute data was the Kružberk dam area assessed relatively clear because it is the area protected against pollution and and is considered to be a fresh water resource. Air pollution made by NO 2, SO 2 and MP 10 showed good results with low improving level from 2014 to 2015. 	There is made a suggestion to have the minimal management because there was not seen any negative human or animal influence to the lichen diversity and natural evolution of association has been going on. Large frequency of Cladoniceae was monitored in the locality 3 and so this locality is suggested for long-term monitoring of environment with chemical-physical methods and monitoring lichen diversity.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} we {{examined}} the impact of economic crises in the years 2008 / 2009 on the logistics industry in old member states EU- 15 and the new EU member states. The emergence of the economic crisis in 2008 / 2009 when {{the states of the}} old members of EU- 15 and new EU member states were the first time subjected to the effects of the crisis inside the single entity-the European Union. Research question: The basic research question is: Were implications of economic crises in the years 2008 / 2009 in logistics industry in heterogenic states of European Union; old member states EU- 15 and the new EU member states different? Purpose:We wanted to determine how the logistics companys in old member States EU (15) and in the new EU member states adapt to the new circumstances caused by economic crises in the years 2008 / 2009. Method: Economic crises are complex multifunctional phenomenon. Analysing complexity of the changes of the state of economic system need to supplement the pure scientific approach with other types of research work, more holistic approach, which is commonly used in Comparative economics. In {{this article we}} combine both. In empirical part we used appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests of differences between old and new member states of the European Union. We used Pearson's chi-squared test (Pearson, 1900, p. 157 - 175). Results: In the article we studied changes <b>ocured</b> by economic crises in the years 2008 / 2009 in the European logistics industry. We found that the logistics companies in the old EU member states EU- 15 and in the new EU member states differently adapt to the implications of economic crises in the years 2008 / 2009. EU hasn’t adopted and implemented the harmonised economic policy, which will solve the »North-South« problem in logistics industry {{and find a way to}} operate systemically in global environment. Organization: The findings can be used to support undestanding of changed bussines envirnment of the logistics companies and contribute for better strategic planning and design of the entire supply chain. Society: The findings can contribute to better understanding of economic crises 2008 / 2009 in the European logistics industry and integrative processes in the European Union. Originality: We examined the implications of crises in the years 2008 / 2009, relating to the determination of changed values of certain economic parameters in the segment of road freight transport in National Economies of EU Member States, from the perspective that so far nobody has yet addressed. Limitations/Future research: The complexity of the problem as economic crises is complex multifunctional phenomenon and the dynamic changes in the functioning of the european logistics market requires in-depth studiying of changes in the micro and macro environment of logistics companies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis consists {{of research on the}} spring barley and chemical composition of its grains. Attention is paid to the stress factors which has inpact on plants such as heavy metals and in particular cadmium and its influence on the plants. The last part deals with the importance of selected trace elements such as copper, iron, manganese and zinc. The experimental part of the work is devoted to the influence of cadmium contamination on content of selected elements which are copper, iron, manganese and zinc in plants of spring barley. Two experiments were performed. In both experiments, plants were hydroponically cultivated in Knop nutrient solution. Plants were divided into two parts in each experiment, the first part was cultivated without contamination and served as a control samples, the second part was contaminated. The third day of cultivation was added CdCl 2. 2, 5 H 2 O at a concentration of 10 - 5 mol/l to the nutrient solution of the second part. In the first experiment the plants were harvested on the 10 th day of cultivation and divided into roots, hypocotyls and shoots. In the second experiment were plants harvested on the 13 th day of cultivation and separated into roots, hypocotyls, stem base, 1 st (oldest), 2 nd and 3 th (youngest) leaf. From each part of the plant were prepared samples, which were mineralized and consequentely was measured using the ICP-OES method the content of the above mentioned metals in the contaminated and control-sample plants and the content of cadmium in the contaminated plants. The content of cadmium in the control-sample plants was measured by the ETA-AAS. The measured datae were analyzed and described in to the taps and graphs. Highest concentration of cadmiu was discovered in roots of the control sample plants, in case of the first experiment the roots contained 91 %, in the second 95, 5 % from the entire amount of cadmium contained in the plant. As a result of the contamination changes in contents of the selected elements <b>ocured.</b> In both of the experimentes the amount of Cu in roots increased, in {{the upper part of the}} plants (shoots) the amount was lower comparing non-contaminated plants. The iron content in the first experiment increased in roots and hypocotyl, in the upper part of the plants (shoots) the content decreased in comparison with control variant. In the second experiment, was the iron content lower in all plant parts. The manganese content was lower in the contaminated plants in almost all parts, only in the first experiment was found minimal increase of manganese content in roots. In both experimentes was found minimal change in content of zinc in roots, in the first experimente increased zinc content in hypocotyls and decreased in the upper part of the plants (shoots), while in the second experiment there was little change of content in hypocotyls but zinc increased in the upper part of the plants (shoots).

40|$|Patients {{who needed}} a {{treatment}} with opioids of WHO level 3 due to increasing pain were included in this study. We compared oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTCF) with immediate release morphine (IRM) for the dose finding of a transdermal fentanyl (TF) treatment. Up to now commonly morphine either orally, subcutaneously or via Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) intravenously was used for dose titration. However, conversion ratio tables were necessary to calculate the ratio of morphine to TF. OTFC represents an alternative to morphine for the dose finding titration procedure. Using the same drug OTFC is basically the ideal top-up medication for patients treated with TF and might also present the ideal medication for dose titration. As well as the confirmation of the chosen conversion rate of 1 : 1 of OTFC on TF another objective was to define {{the time needed to}} obtain sufficient pain relief. The previous opioid therapy was stopped after inclusion of the patients and a randomised assignment was carried out into one of the two treatment groups. The dose titration was carried out in this group with OTFC 200 µg and in the other group with IRM 10 mg. On day 1 the dose for TF could be determined from the amount of on-demand-medication the patients had taken within the first 24 hours. The conversion was carried out with the factor 100 : 1 of oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl and with the factor 1 : 1 of transmucosal to transdermal fentanyl. Of altogether 60 patients {{in the course of the}} study 25 completed the titration phase in the IRM group and 19 patients in the OTFC group. Eighty-four percent completed titration with a good result in the IRM group and 89. 4 % in the OTFC group. Four patients of the IRM group needed further dose corrections and in comparison with 2 patients in the OTFC group. Fiftyseven percent achieved an optimal titration result with a stable dose from the beginning in the OTFC group and 52 % in the IRM group. The faster onset time which was shown at OTFC in many studies could be confirmed considerably also in our collective. The average pain intensity was significantly lower in both groups at the end of the study in comparison with the beginning. The average pain in the beginning was 6. 19 ± 1. 83 points in the OTFC group on a numeric rating scale (NRS) and 4. 19, ± 2. 25 (p = 0. 003) at the end of the study (IRM group: 6. 00 ± 1. 73 versus 3. 26, ± 1. 99 (p = 0. 000). Adverse events (AE) were documented in 45 % of all 60 patients during the titration phase. AE were mainly nausea, tiredness and dizziness in both groups and corresponded to typical side effects of the study medication. The chosen conversion rate of 1 : 1 of OTFC on transdermal fentanyl has been confirmed and can be recommended. No severe adverse events (SAE) could be observed in the titration phase. The higher number of drop-outs <b>ocured</b> in the OTFC group. While there was only on drop-out in the IRM group because of side effects of the titration medication, in the OTFC group there were drop-outs because of side effects, a lack of effect or disgust in 8 patients. The application of IRM is easier. At least, by the correct application of OTFC side effects like lesions of the oral mucosa can be avoided. Dose titration can be performed both with OTFC and IRM successfully within 24 hours...|$|R
40|$|Following article {{serves the}} purpose of {{executing}} a specialized analysis and evaluation of an urban project from theory of citizens participation point of view. It is a field of science, balancing between sociology, urbanism, economy and even politics. Urban project I chose as an example has been conducted within borders of Łódź, third biggest city in Poland. In june 2014 municipal council office on a single block of 6 th Sierpnia street has finished first woonerf in Poland creating an unprecedential kind of public space in the country. Original word woonerven comes from a dutch language {{and it has been}} adapted by english language and became a woonerf. Polish language does not allow to translate it easily and the English version is officialy in use, but also commonly used is a non formal transcription, urban courtyard. According to definition from an Oxford Living Dictionary woonerf is „a road in which devices for reducing or slowing the flow of traffic have been installed”. Quoted definition explains only technically what a woonerf is, but for full picture we need to identify the question woonerf is trying to answer. In the begining of XIXth century, street was a different space than we can see nowadays according to Charles Montgomery in his recent book titled „Happy city: Transforming our lives through urban design”. He recalled a memory of the street from before age of cars, Through most of history, cities streets were available for everyone. Road was equally a marketplace, a playgroung, a park and yes also a thoroughfare, but without street lights, lanes painted on the ground or designated pedestrian crossings. Till 1903 no city even had a traffic code. Street was open for everyone, so everyone was using it. Street was quite a chaotic environment, covered with horse manure and cutted from time to time by speeding carriages, but as it goes with disorder, reigned on her some sort of liberty and freedom. I would like to add this feeling to the definition, the idea to bring the street back to basics and return this lost space in the hands of citizens. Woonerf creates a new form of urban space in which everyone, cars, pedestrians, trams and cyclists move together in harmony. With priority for walking users, before forced to slow down motorized ones. Woonerf is the final product of reinventing small streets in downtowns all over the western World. The idea to take the street to the origins, when it was a space for citizens and for the city, and Technical Oxford Living Dictonary definition just states a tools to create it. Case of the Polish woonerf became good experimental ground for different models of citizen participation. This article confronts participants of described process with each other in selective relations on all phases of the creation, allowing us to see advantages and disadvantages in all of the relations. As a basis for analysis I chose models from two existing publications, Sherry R. Armstein paper titled „A Ladder of Citizen Participation” from 1969 and „Public Participation in Planning: New Strategies for the 21 st Century” by Judith E. Innes and David E. Booher from Institute of Urban and regional Development UC Berkeley published in 2000. Process of rebuilding the 6 th Sierpnia street started almost two years before the actual construction work began. Many stakeholders {{have been involved in the}} proces, as they have their rights and duties as well as goals and priorities. Each investment in changing public space using public funds requires conducting, defined by acts of law, tenders or consultations. This required order was revised in the analized example, in our case study consultation with citizens were not obligatory at this stage of the process. The need of organizing them <b>ocure</b> when initiators realized how strong might be the argument of support of the closest inhabitants in negotiations with Municipal Office. At the end many participants were involved in the proces of creation of the first woonerf in Lodz. By studying the relations between stakeholders we can gather the knowledge about science of social participation, communication planning, in the regional and local startegy of development planning processes...|$|R

O delineamento {{experimental}} adotado foi de blocos casualizados no esquema fatorial 3 x 2, sendo que no primeiro fator ficaram alocados os tipos de melÃo (amarelo, rendilhado e pele de sapo) e no segundo fator o nÃmero de frutos (um e dois frutos por planta), com seis repetiÃÃes. Foram utilizados trÃs cultivares de melÃo para o tipo amarelo (AF 4945, Gold Mine e Goldex), rendilhado (Acclain, Louis e Olimpic Express) e pele de sapo (Medellin, Grand Prix e Sancho). Foram avaliadas a massa mÃdia do fruto, diÃmetro mÃdio transversal e longitudinal do fruto, diÃmetro mÃdio transversal e longitudinal do lÃculo, espessura da polpa, Ãndice de formato do fruto, Ãndice de formato do lÃculo, sÃlidos solÃveis, pH, acidez titulÃvel, firmeza do fruto, ratio e foi estimada a produtividade. TambÃm foram realizadas medidas de trocas gasosas (fotossÃntese, transpiraÃÃo foliar, condutÃncia estomÃtica e concentraÃÃo interna de CO 2). A partir dessas medidas obtidas foi calculada a eficiÃncia do uso da Ãgua. Para as caracterÃsticas avaliadas pode-se concluir que entre os tipos de melÃo, o pele de sapo Ã o mais produtivo. A maior produtividade ocorreu em plantas com dois frutos por planta. Independentemente do sistema de conduÃÃo e do tipo de melÃo o teor de sÃlidos solÃveis foi superior ao mÃnimo recomendado para comercializaÃÃo. Em relaÃÃo Ãs cultivares de melÃo do tipo pele de sapo nÃo ocorreram diferenÃas significativas para a maioria das variÃveis avaliadas, podendo recomendar o cultivo das trÃs cultivares. Em relaÃÃo Ãs cultivares do tipo rendilhado recomenda-se a cultivar Louis, por ter apresentado maior ÂBrix e firmeza sem diferir dos demais em relaÃÃo Ã produtividade. E para o tipo amarelo, recomenda-se a cultivar Goldex. Independente das cultivares o sistema de conduÃÃo com dois frutos por planta Ã o mais produtivo. Em relaÃÃo Ãs trocas gasosas pode-se concluir que as diferenÃas nos Ãndices de trocas gasosas para as cultivares de melÃo do tipo pele de sapo nÃo influenciaram na produtividade e no teor de sÃlidos solÃveis. Para as cultivares de melÃo do tipo amarelo e rendilhado recomenda-se as cultivares Goldex e Louis respectivamente. Os Ãndices de trocas gasosas, independente da cultivar nÃo apresentaram expressivas diferenÃas em relaÃÃo ao nÃmero de frutos, desta forma recomenda-se o cultivo de melÃo com dois frutos por planta por ser mais produtivo, sem drÃsticas reduÃÃes no teor de sÃlidos solÃveisWith {{the objective}} {{to evaluate the}} quality, yield characteristics and gas exchange of three types and cultivars of melon in greenhouse according {{to the number of}} fruits per plant three experiments were carried out simultaneously in the greenhouse sector, belongs to Unioeste Campus Marechal CÃndido Rondon - PR, from September 2013 to December 2013. The experimental design was randomized blocks in factorial scheme 3 x 2, with six replications. In the first factor were allocated types of melon (canary melon, net melon and frog skin melon) and the second factor was the condution of plants with different number of fruit (one and two fruits per plant). Three cultivars of melon were used for the canary melon type (AF 4945, Gold Mine and Goldex), net melon type (Acclain, Louis, and Olimpic Express) and frog skin melon type (Medellin, Grand Prix and Sancho). The characteristics evaluated were fruit mass, transversal and longitudinal diameter of the fruit, transversal and longitudinal diameter of the locule, thickness of endocarp, fruit shape index, locule shape index, soluble solids, pH, titratable acidity, firmness fruit, ratio and was estimated the productivity. Measures of gas exchange (photosynthesis, leaf transpiration, stomatal conductance, internal CO 2 concentration) were also performed. From these measurements the efficiency of water use was calculated. For the characteristics evaluated, it can be concluded that among the types of melon, frog skin melon type is the most productive. The highest yield occurred in plants with two fruits per plant. Regardless of the number of fruits and the type of melon total soluble solids was higher than the minimum recommended for marketing. Regarding of cultivars of frog skin melon type no significant differences <b>ocured</b> for most variables assessed leading to recommend the cultivation of three cultivars. Regarding of cultivars of net melon type is recommended to cultivate Louis cultivar, by having larger ÂBrix and firmness without differ from others in relation to productivity. And for the canary melon type, it is recommended to cultivate Goldex. In relation to gas exchange can be concluded that differences in gas exchange indexes to cultivars of melon frog skin melon no influence on productivity and soluble solids content. For melon cultivars of canary melon and net melon type recommended the Goldex and Louis respectively cultivars. The gas exchange indexes, independent of cultivar showed no significant differences regarding the number of fruits, so it is recommended cultivation with two fruits per plant by being more productive without drastic reductions in soluble solid...|$|R
