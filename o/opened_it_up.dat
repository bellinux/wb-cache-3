5|$|Musically, glam metal {{combines}} a traditional heavy metal sound with elements of hard rock and punk rock, adding pop-influenced catchy hooks and guitar riffs. Like other heavy metal {{songs of the}} 1980s, they often feature shred guitar solos. They also include extensive use of harmonies, particularly in the characteristic power balladsslow, emotional songs that gradually build to a strong finale. These {{were among the most}} commercially successful singles in the genre and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to a wider audience {{that would not have been}} attracted to traditional heavy metal. Lyrical themes often deal with love and lust, with songs often directed at a particular woman.|$|E
25|$|By 1958, {{demand for}} land by ex-servicemen had declined, but the scheme had been so {{successful}} {{that the government was}} reluctant to end it, so it instead <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to all civilians. This continued until 1969, when a wheat glut forced the government to impose quotas on wheat planting.|$|E
25|$|For a decade, colleges had {{required}} {{science and}} engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base who knew about computers. In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like Pong introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as digital voltmeters and frequency counters. The Altair had enough power to be actually useful, and was designed as an expandable system that <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{to all sorts of}} applications.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} {{group is}} the “afromexicanos” or Afro-Mexicans who are concentrated in the Costa Chica region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated {{from the rest of}} Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day, there are many who have no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been discriminated against and marginalized. Even among these people today, the concept of being “negro” is considered bad and a number take to skin-lightening methods. The musical style associated with the group is “chilena ” which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, “Soy negro de la Costa…,” has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico’s cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting Acapulco with Pinotepa Nacional and Puerto Escondido, which <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people. The increase in people and contacts led to the building of schools.|$|E
500|$|O'Neill saw great {{potential}} in the United States space program, especially the Apollo missions. He applied to the Astronaut Corps after NASA <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to civilian scientists in 1966. Later, when asked why {{he wanted to go}} on the Moon missions, he said, [...] "to be alive now and not take part in it seemed terribly myopic". He was put through NASA's rigorous mental and physical examinations. During this time he met Brian O'Leary, also a scientist-astronaut candidate, who became his good friend. O'Leary was selected for Astronaut Group 6 but O'Neill was not.|$|E
500|$|Duhem's {{view has}} been {{extremely}} influential in the historiography of medieval science, and <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> as a serious academic discipline. [...] "Duhem believed that Tempier, with his insistence of God's absolute power, had liberated Christian thought from the dogmatic acceptance of Aristotelianism, {{and in this way}} marked the birth of modern science." [...] The condemnations certainly had a positive effect on science, but scholars disagree over their relative influence. Historians in the field no longer fully endorse his view that modern science started in 1277. Edward Grant is probably the contemporary historian of science who comes closest to Duhem's vision. What historians do agree upon is that the condemnations allowed science [...] "to consider possibilities that the great philosopher never envisioned." [...] According to the historian of science Richard Dales, they [...] "seem definitely to have promoted a freer and more imaginative way of doing science." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1984, Bannon's {{books were}} {{featured}} in the documentary Before Stonewall about how {{gay men and lesbians}} lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: [...] "I picked up this paperback and I <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up...</b> and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I had never felt before." [...] She was {{featured in the}} Canadian documentary [...] in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E

6000|$|New or old, {{the enemy}} had done her best. She had {{completely}} demolished Eblis's bridge and searchlight platform, {{brought down the}} mast and the fore-funnel, ruined the whaler and the dinghy, split the foc'sle open above water from the stem to the galley which is abaft the bridge, and below water had <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> from the stem to the second bulkhead. She had further ripped off Eblis's skin-plating for an amazing number of yards {{on one side of}} her, and had fired a couple of large-calibre shells into Eblis at point-blank range, narrowly missing her vitals. Even so, Eblis is as impartial as a prize-court. She reports that the second shot, a trifle of eight inches, [...] "may have been fired at a different time or just after colliding." [...] But the night was yet young, and [...] "just after getting clear of this cruiser an enemy battle-cruiser grazed past our stern at high speed" [...] and again the judgmatic mind--"I think she must have intended to ram us." [...] She was a large three-funnelled thing, her centre funnel shot away and [...] "lights were flickering under her foc'sle as if she was on fire forward." [...] Fancy the vision of her, hurtling out of the dark, red-lighted from within, and fleeing on like a man with his throat cut! ...|$|E
