Samples can be downloaded from both Clavia's and other third party websites, and installed using a software application running <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>PC</b> or a Mac.

Users can also create their own samples, and load them into the Stage 2 using the tools supplied.|$|E
5|$|A fan disc {{entitled}} Ef: First Fan Disc {{was initially}} released during Comiket 72 between August 11 and August 13, 2007; the disc, playable <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>PC</b> was later sold in retail stores starting on August 25, 2007. The disc, unlike the normal visual novels in the series, {{did not contain}} adult content, and offered {{a glimpse into the}} world of Ef, though only touched on points from Ef: The First Tale, the first game in the series. Ef: The First Tale was released as an adult game for the PC on December 22, 2006. The second game in the series, Ef: The Latter Tale was released on May 30, 2008. MangaGamer released both games in English: Ef: The First Tale was released on July 27, 2012 and Ef: The Latter Tale was released on December 20, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented to satisfy a wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>PC</b> or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E

5|$|The high-definition upgrade {{was not as}} {{difficult}} as it might have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed to be set as there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate editing software that ran <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>PC.</b> In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E

However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013. The Windows port has been updated for higher resolutions of modern computers, and includes both DLC packs released for consoles. The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, they will look at adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally scoped out for the console version.

500|$|A {{new game}} trailer was {{released}} on December 19, 2007, the first teaser in more than six years. The video was made by 3D Realms employees as part of holiday festivities. While Broussard maintained the release date would be [...] "when it's done", he added that [...] "you can expect more frequent media releases [...] we have considerable work behind us". While the Dallas Business Journal [...] "confirmed" [...] a 2008 release date for the game, Broussard later reported that this {{was based on a}} misunderstanding of [...] "off the record" [...] information. In-game footage of the game appeared in 2008 premiere episode of The Jace Hall Show. Filmed entirely on hand-held cameras but not originally expected to be publicly released, the video showed host Jason Hall playing through parts of a single level <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>PC</b> at 3D Realms' offices. The footage was confirmed to have been shot six months prior to the episode air date and according to Broussard, contained outdated particle and combat effects that had since been replaced. The game did not make an appearance at E3 2008, an event which Miller described as [...] "irrelevant".|$|E
500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{artist was}} Tetsuya Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated {{rather than simply}} typed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>PC,</b> Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper". Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as [...] "kakkoii", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair in addition to saving polygons. Nomura feared, however, that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, and therefore he changed Cloud's design to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair. Vincent changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past.|$|E
