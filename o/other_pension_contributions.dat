Using a sample of all FTSE 350 UK listed firms with at least one defined benefit pension scheme from 2001 to 2004, we find a strong and negative relation between <b>pension</b> <b>contributions</b> and corporate dividend payments even after controlling for the correlation between funding status and unobserved investment opportunities. We find a weaker result using investment equations, where investment is negatively related to <b>pension</b> <b>contributions</b> but the relation is not statistically significant. Our results suggest a preference of financial rather than real channels for firms making balance sheet adjustments. We also examine whether the new funding requirements under the Pensions Act 2004 have had any effects on firms’ <b>pension</b> <b>contributions</b> and accordingly their corporate expenditure decisions.

40|$|With asset values falling {{sharply in}} recent years, many {{companies}} {{around the world}} are under pressure to restore the solvency of their defined-benefit pension plans. Will this lead to higher contributions? Will higher contributions increase labor costs and reduce employment? Does this mechanism exacerbate economic downturns? What are the economic effects of pension fund regulation? This paper develops a theoretical model to address these questions. Although its scope is more general, the model captures the main institutional features of the pension system in the Netherlands, a country where the economic effects of the pension shock are widely debated.

40|$|Inter-temporal {{optimization}} and deterministic lifestyle {{asset allocation}} strategies for defined-contribution pension plans are investigated and compared both analytically and numerically. The pension plan {{is assumed to}} invest in two types of asset, risk free assets and equities, or bonds and equities, and the plan members‟ terminal utility a power function of pension wealth at retirement with their final wages as numeraire. The optimal asset allocation strategy using two assets is derived analytically for fully hedgeable wage incomes and compared numerically with that for non-hedgeable wage income and deterministic lifestyle strategy. The deterministic lifestyle strategy is shown to be replicable by a static allocation strategy with same expected returns and lower variances. The inter-temporal optimization strategy outperforms the lifestyle strategy in numerical simulations both {{when there is no}} further <b>pension</b> <b>contribution</b> or non-hedgeable wage risk and when the wage income is not fully hedgeable.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} unions on both the magnitude and distribution of pension benefits. Our empirical results show that beneficiaries in collectively bargained plans receive larger benefits when they retire, receive larger increases in their benefits after they retire, and retire {{at an earlier age}} than beneficiaries in <b>other</b> <b>pension</b> plans. As a result, the pension wealth of union beneficiaries is 50 to 109 percent greater than that of nonunion beneficiaries. Just as wage differentials within and across establishments are smaller among union workers, benefit differentials within and across cohorts of retirees are smaller among union beneficiaries. This results from the smaller weight given to salary average in determining initial benefits and the larger percentage increases given to those who have been retired the longest under post-retirement increases. The more compressed benefit structure under unionism causes the union-nonunion compensation (wages plus <b>pension</b> <b>contributions)</b> differential to decline more quickly than the union-nonunion wage differential over the life cycle. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{that the nature of}} the funding of defined benefit pension plans may be an important reason why personal saving has not responded positively to the high real interest rites and tax incentives to encourage saving and investment of the last few years. From a firm's standpoint, funding the promised pension is a target, and higher rates of return permit reaching that target with lower contributions. According to the Flow of Funds Accounts of the Federal Reserve System between 1982 and 1984, net <b>pension</b> <b>contributions</b> declined from 6. 02 percent of disposable personal income to 4. 02 percent. The paper presents empirical information regarding <b>pension</b> <b>contributions,</b> unfunded liabilities, interest rates, and recent developments in pension funding. It specifies the target saving model of pension funding and derives the theoretical elasticity of <b>pension</b> <b>contributions</b> to changes in interestrates. It then investigates this elasticity with aggregate time series econometrics. In general, the estimated elasticities are consistent with the theory and indicate that one percentage point rise in real interest rates would, in the long run, reduce <b>pension</b> <b>contributions</b> between 20 and 30 percent. Such a large negative elasticity for such an important source of loanable funds in the economy {{suggests that}} the pensions funding mechanism should be taken into account in designing policies to increase the economy's saving and investment. ...|$|R
