50|$|The {{frame is}} a full steel duplex {{swingarm}} design, with Ceriani rear suspension, and Marzocchi front forks. The early models had a twin leading shoe drum brake up front (Strada: 200 mm drum, Sport: 230 mm drum) that was notoriously grabby on the Borrani spoked wheels, but these were replaced with a single chromed 260 mm Grimeca disc in 1976, and later optional double discs. The rear drum brake was replaced in the early 1980s with a Grimeca disc. Switchgear, tail and brake lights were the standard CEV model used on many Italian motorcycles of the 1970s. The month and year of manufacture is embossed in small figures {{on the side of}} each cast wheel, near where one of the seven cast spokes meets the rim. The helical gear transmission was a six-speed, with a top gear ratio of 1:0.954, making it akin to an overdrive. The transmission was engaged with a six-plate dry clutch, making a characteristic rattle similar to Ducatis when disengaged. Secondary drive was by a 5/8 x 3/8-inch chain to a rear sprocket with cush drive. Gear change is by right foot and the rear brake operated by left foot. Engine lubrication was by oil pump to the crankshaft but no force lubrication went to the rocker gear. Instead, crankcase pressure forced oil mist up the short pushrod tunnels to the rocker covers, where two 'crow's feet' allowed mist to condense and drip onto the rocker gear.

50|$|Black tea {{contains}} {{compounds that}} have low solubilities, {{which tend to}} bind together. The solution becomes cloudy and changes color to pale brown. This phenomenon is known as tea creaming. Research {{has shown that the}} cream is a colloidal substance that contains many of the compounds that contribute to color and flavor of black tea, and can contain up to 30% of the total solids. The driving force behind cream formation is the insolubility of theaflavin and polyphenols, which associate together through galloyl group interactions. The theaflavins have acidic properties which cause them to have a negative charge at the pH of black tea, which is roughly 4.9. Normally this would lead to electrostatic repulsions between the molecules, stabilizing the colloid. However, the presence of calcium ions (Ca2+) can neutralize these charges, promoting aggregation. Other charged metal ions, such as magnesium and aluminum, are also present in high concentrations in tea, but neither ions partition as well into tea as those of calcium. Glycosylation of the solution is also found to increase solubility of polyphenols while weakening self association. The proposed explanation is that the sheer size of the sugar makes it hard for other molecules to interact with each other. In the American market, instant tea is expected by the consumer to be clear when reconstituted, which makes the cream an unacceptable part of the solution. Industrially, a variety of methods have been patented to deal with the issue, such as the utilization of tannase to solubilize the cream. Another method developed was based on the identification of two classes in cream: low molecular weight compounds such as the polyphenols that contribute to flavor, and higher molecular weight compounds such as polysaccharides, polypeptides, and proteins. This process removes the high molecular weight compounds through ultrafiltration, absorption chromatography or <b>oil</b> <b>filtration.</b> The flavor compounds remain and do not cream.|$|E

The influence of the filtration system on the phenolic and water content of virgin olive oil that differed in the year of production, production system and the olive variety was measured. Samples were filtered in the laboratory using two different systems (cotton or filter paper plus sodium sulphate anhydrous). Qualitative and quantitative variation of the phenolic fraction of virgin olive oils was evaluated by HPLC-DAD-MS and correlated with their water content (by Karl Fischer titration) and oxidative stability under forced conditions (by OSI). Colorimetric assays were also carried out in order to calculate the effect of filtration on the visual characteristics of virgin olive <b>oil.</b> After <b>filtration</b> the oxidative stability index decreased and in particular, filtration with cotton showed a significant loss of hydroxytyrosol, a phenol endowed with high antioxidant activity. One interesting behaviour was highlighted: Filtration with either cotton or paper plus anhydrous sodium sulphate led to an apparent increase in the phenolic content. These apparently contradictory data can be explained by considering that the reduction of the water content permits a higher availability of phenolic compounds that remain in oil and are extracted with the methanol-water mixture. Lastly, the filtration of virgin olive oil produced a loss in the intensity of green color and an increase in its lightness...|$|R
