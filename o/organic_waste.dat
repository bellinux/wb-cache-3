5|$|Skara Brae {{consists}} of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 31002500 BC {{the houses are}} similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and <b>organic</b> <b>waste.</b> Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.|$|E
5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with septic systems in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E

Apart from abatement of environmental pollution, such reuse of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> in agriculture helps in the improvement of various physical, chemical and biological properties of the soils and, thus, helps in sustaining the soil health. While recycling different <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> in agriculture, it is essential to process the materials through an adequate period of composting for improving their usability in the soils. However, due to some short comings of traditional composting systems, the technology of recycling of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> has not been widely accepted so far.

25|$|Because of {{fertilizer}} and <b>organic</b> <b>waste</b> that urban runoff often carries, eutrophication often occurs in waterways {{affected by this}} type of runoff.

Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as stream pools and the pools behind dams, weirs, and some drop structures. Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the levels of}} <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> released along the Newfoundland coastline From four different sources during the period 1992 - 1996. These sources include offal from fish plants, domestic sewage, aquaculture wastes (wasted feed and faeces) and sawmill wastes (bark, shavings, wood chips, slabs, sawdust). The total amount of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> entering coastal waters had never been quantified before this study, and hence, comparisons of levels of wastes from different sources had not previously been made. The scattered information on sources of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> was assembled {{in order to determine}} and compare the four major sources in Newfoundland. This study also determined whether spatial scale is a factor in determining the greatest and smallest sources of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> released. The level of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> released were quantified and compared at four scales along the Newfoundland coastline. Three hypotheses were addressed concern concerning the relative importance of the sources of the wastes: i) The level of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> released from coastal sawmills is lower than that released from the other three sources. ii) At the spatial scale of the entire island the largest levels of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> are from sewage, followed by fish plant offal, and finfish aquaculture. iii) The relative level of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> released from sewage, aquaculture, and offal differs according to spatial scale. As the scale studied becomes smaller (from the entire island, to coastal regions, to fisheries statistical areas, to fisheries statistical sections) either of the three sources could be the major contributor of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes.</b> [...] At the largest spatial scale examined, the entire island, offal was the largest contributor of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes,</b> followed by sewage and sawmill wastes, with aquaculture as the smallest contributor of wastes. The region of the island with the greatest amount released into the coastal waters was the Avalon Peninsula, while the Northern Peninsula had the least amount of wastes being released. Two interesting trends were found in this investigation. First, aquaculture wastes are increasing at a high, steady rate in Newfoundland at a very localized coastal scale. This was not evident for the other sources of wastes studied. Secondly, although the offal levels for the entire island only increased slightly over the period studied, the form of the released offal changed greatly since the moratorium on Atlantic cod in 1992. Currently, there is a predominance of inorganic shells being released, which are more resistant to degradation than the flesh and viscera of fish. [...] The next smallest spatial scale, coastal region (the coastline was divided into five regions) showed the same results as the scale of the entire island. Offal was the largest contributor of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> and aquaculture the smallest contributor. The two smallest spatial scales studied, fisheries statistical area (the coastline was divided into 14 areas) and fisheries statistical section (the areas were divided into 49 sections), showed variation within the two larger coastal scales. The results for the area and section scales corresponded with those for the region scale in that the places with the greatest levels of release (St John’s, Southern Shore, Conception Bay) were on the Avalon Peninsula, and the places with the lowest levels of release were on, or very near, the Northern Peninsula (Bonne Bay, Gros Morne Park area, Strait of Belle Isle area). Overall, most areas had offal as the greatest contributor and aquaculture as the smallest. However, the importance of spatial scale was evident from the increased variability in type and level of <b>organic</b> <b>wastes</b> released as the coastal scale examined became smaller. This was due to variation in the population and in level and type of industry between places along the coas...|$|R
