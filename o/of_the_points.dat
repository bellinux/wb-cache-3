5|$|In stage nine, Warren Barguil, who {{was second}} in the young rider classification, wore the white jersey, because Peter Sagan wore the green jersey as leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification.|$|E

50|$|If the {{function}} {{is a function}} of more than one <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> process, <b>the</b> moment measures or factorial moment measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> process are needed, which can be compared to moments and factorial <b>of</b> random variables. <b>The</b> type <b>of</b> measure needed depends on whether <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> process in <b>the</b> random sum are need to be distinct or may repeat.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the design was modified, {{and the one}} flue harpoon was created. By {{removing}} half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> chance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> cutting its way back out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whale was greatly reduced.|$|R
5|$|Thanks to {{the time}} bonus he won for coming second, Sagan moved up into second place overall, on {{the same time as}} Malori. Debusschere, meanwhile, moved into the lead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification. Riders won points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 on each stage. Flat stages award more points that mountainous stages, meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters. In addition, points can be won in intermediate sprints. The winner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification won the red jersey.|$|E
5|$|At {{the back}} of the race, Bourdais began a slow climb back up the field. The Toro Rosso driver passed Sutil (who later spun out and retired with a gearbox problem), Nakajima and Coulthard, to sit in 15th by lap30. Rosberg fought Glock for 12th, until he passed the Toyota at the turn14 hairpin on lap12. Rosberg's pit stop relegated him to 18th, {{dropping}} six places. Kubica pitted late, on lap25, dropping from third to ninth, one position outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a notion of}} regularity (or irregularity) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity for the unbounded open subset of ^N concerning second order uniformly elliptic equations with bounded and measurable coefficients, according as whether <b>the</b> A-harmonic measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity is zero (or positive). A necessary and sufficient condition for <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a unique bounded solution to the Dirichlet problem in an arbitrary open set of ^N, N> 3 is established in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wiener test for <b>the</b> regularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity. It coincides with the Wiener test for <b>the</b> regularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Laplace equation. From <b>the</b> topological <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> Wiener test at infinity presents thinness criteria of sets near infinity in fine topology. Precisely, the open set is a deleted neigborhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> at infinity in fine topology {{if and only if}} infinity is irregular. Comment: 20 page...|$|R
5|$|Convolve the {{locations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> with a Gaussian function with small standard deviation, in effect replacing each point's location with a weighted average of {{the locations}} of nearby points along the curve, with Gaussian weights. The standard deviation of the Gaussian should be chosen to be small enough that, after this step, the sample points still have nearly-uniform spacing.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 10-second time {{bonus for}} winning the stage, Kristoff took over the overall lead of the race, one second ahead of Boonen, who moved into the lead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> competition. Several riders who had been contenders for the overall victory, {{including}} Wiggins and Cancellara, finished over nine minutes behind Kristoff, eliminating them from contention for overall victory.|$|E
5|$|France won the gold, beating Great Britain 27 {{points to}} 8 and {{defeating}} Germany 27 points to 17.

30|$|At present, the CT image {{reconstruction}} algorithm {{based on}} CS often {{does not consider}} <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> spread function. However, this assumption is unreasonable. Because the CT image is often affected by <b>the</b> <b>point</b> spread function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, it will cause the image degradation [25]. Some literatures use an image blind restoration method to eliminate <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> spread function [26, 27]. Therefore, under the CS framework, the existing CT image reconstruction algorithms have <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> ignoring <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> spread function.|$|R

5|$|In stage sixteen, Tom Dumoulin, who {{was third}} in the {{combination}} classification, wore the white jersey because first-placed Joaquim Rodríguez wore the green jersey as leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification, and second-placed Fabio Aru wore the red jersey {{as leader of the}} general classification.|$|E
5|$|In stage ten, Nairo Quintana, who {{was second}} in the young rider classification, wore the white jersey, because Peter Sagan wore the green jersey as leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification.

40|$|We {{investigate}} what computational tasks can {{be performed}} on a point set in ^d, if we are only given black-box access to it via nearest-neighbor search. This is a reasonable assumption if <b>the</b> underlying <b>point</b> set is either provided implicitly, or it is stored in a data structure that can answer such queries. In particular, we show the following: (A) One can compute an approximate bi-criteria k-center clustering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> set, and more generally compute a greedy permutation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> set. (B) One can decide if a query point is (approximately) inside <b>the</b> convex-hull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> set. We also investigate <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> clustering <b>the</b> given <b>point</b> set, such that meaningful proximity queries {{can be carried out}} on <b>the</b> centers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clusters, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>point</b> set...|$|R

5|$|In stages three–five, Romain Bardet, who {{was second}} in the young rider classification, wore the white jersey, because Peter Sagan (in first place) wore the green jersey as leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> classification.

5|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has important parts constructed in several different centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic).
