50|$|In 1987, the 1958 optic {{had to be}} {{replaced}} {{to comply with the}} recommendations of the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities for automation. <b>Optic</b> <b>replacement</b> and automation where completed in March of that year. The station was then converted to solar power on the 20 September 2000.|$|E
40|$|In an X-ray {{receiver}} {{having a}} scintillator (10) for converting incident X-rays into {{light and a}} fibre optic (12) for conducting the generated light to a light collector (14), a heater (18) is provided for heating at least {{a section of the}} fibre optic (12) to a predetermined temperature during X-ray reception. Preferably, the predetermined temperature corresponds to a temperature at which the decay rate of colour centres generated in the fibre optic is equal to or greater than the creation rate and is especially 100 - 150 deg. C. Also claimed is an X-ray reception method employing the above receiver. USE - Used especially as a fibre optical X-ray camera for industrial and medical radioscopy. ADVANTAGE - Colour centre generation is avoided when the camera is used under high radiation intensities, the need for fibre <b>optic</b> <b>replacement</b> or interrupting operation for fibre optic heating is eliminated or at least delayed and the camera has an extended service life {{so that it can be}} used under in dustrial conditions...|$|E
