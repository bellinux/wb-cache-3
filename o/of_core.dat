40|$|International audienceSince 2004, {{the trend}} in the {{semiconductor}} industry {{is to increase the}} number <b>of</b> <b>cores.</b> Circuits with tens or even hundreds <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> are currently available on the market, and circuits with thousands <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> are foreseen within the next few years. Virtual platforms are key tools for the design and validation of these circuits and to develop the software. To simulate processors in virtual platforms, interpretive instruction set simulation is the most widespread technique but it does not scale well with the increasing number <b>of</b> <b>cores.</b> In this paper, we extend a native simulation technique to handle of ad-hoc architectural speciﬁcities and study its scalability with respect to the number <b>of</b> <b>cores...</b>|$|R

30|$|In 2004, the {{evolution}} of processor architecture shifted from a progressive increment of clock frequency to a {{growth in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>cores.</b> Thus, although current processors still feature a moderate number <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> (between 4 and 16), the trend indicates that next generations will include a larger number <b>of</b> <b>cores.</b> On the other hand, as-of-today it is possible to build a commodity shared-memory multiprocessor with four sockets that can accommodate 16 -core processors each, for a total <b>of</b> 64 <b>cores</b> in a single desktop platform.|$|R

5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process <b>of</b> <b>core</b> collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond {{is a common}} {{functional}} group that forms part <b>of</b> <b>core</b> organic chemistry. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic. Chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: chlorocarbons are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group.|$|E
30|$|The ideal {{behavior}} for the CPU-only codes {{would be to}} scale as 1 /x with the number <b>of</b> CPU <b>cores</b> utilized such that doubling the number <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> also approximately doubles the calculation speed. Provided {{that the number of}} CPU threads spawned is not greater than the number <b>of</b> <b>cores,</b> the number <b>of</b> CPU threads can effectively be considered the number <b>of</b> CPU <b>cores</b> utilized, and this benchmark indicates that both CPU-only PRISM and multislice possess close to ideal scaling behavior with number <b>of</b> CPU <b>cores</b> available.|$|R
30|$|From the {{analysis}} of the performance and the energy-delay product metrics, {{it can be argued that}} the optimal point varies for different metrics. By considering performance-only metrics such as IPS and ED^ 2 P, the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> lies between higher and lower pipeline stage unification degree. When considering power-performance metrics such as E and EDP, the optimal number <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> lies between low-medium number <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> with low-moderate number of pipeline stages. Thus, it can be concluded that when both power and performance are taken into account, a medium number <b>of</b> <b>cores</b> with moderate number of pipeline stages will be the optimal configuration.|$|R

5|$|Mass loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} intensively studied aspects of massive star research. Put simply, using {{observed}} mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution does not reproduce the observed properties of evolved massive stars such as Wolf–Rayets, the number and types <b>of</b> <b>core</b> collapse supernovae, or their progenitors. To match those observations, the models require much higher mass loss rates. Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates, currently around /year, and is an obvious candidate for study.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely.

5|$|Both {{free and}} paid DLC was {{announced}} as being planned {{as early as}} April 2016, with paid DLC being described as a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while the main game was completed. The main aim was to make players feel they had made a good purchase. Full production began after the main game was completed. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing the main game, while Sawatari created the DLC with a group <b>of</b> <b>core</b> developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine the main appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that the breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group.

5|$|Each of {{the many}} ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set of beliefs, {{practices}} and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, {{there are a number}} <b>of</b> <b>core</b> cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core groups, within the community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations <b>of</b> <b>core</b> groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
