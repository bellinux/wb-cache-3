50|$|The main use for <b>oxidopamine</b> in {{scientific}} {{research is to}} induce Parkinsonism in laboratory animals such as mice, rats and monkeys, {{in order to develop}} and test new medicines and treatments for Parkinson's disease. In order to induce this condition in animals, around 70% of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain must be destroyed, and this is achieved either with <b>oxidopamine</b> or MPTP. Both these agents likely destroy neurons by generating reactive oxygen species such as superoxide radical. <b>Oxidopamine</b> toxicity in neonatal rodents is also used as an animal model for the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oxidopamine,</b> {{also known}} as 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenethylamine, is a {{neurotoxic}} synthetic organic compound used by researchers to selectively destroy dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons in the brain. 6-OHDA is thought to enter the neurons via the dopamine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake transporters. <b>Oxidopamine</b> is often {{used in conjunction with}} a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (such as desipramine) to selectively destroy dopaminergic neurons.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Argonaute {{proteins}} are {{the core}} {{components of the}} microRNP/RISC. The biogenesis and function of microRNAs and endoand exo- siRNAs are regulated by Ago 2, an Argonaute protein with RNA binding and nuclease activities. Currently, there are no in vitro assays suitable for large-scale screening of microRNP/RISC loading modulators. We describe a novel in vitro assay {{that is based on}} fluorescence polarization of TAMRA-labeled RNAs loaded to human Ago 2. Using this assay, we identified potent small-molecule inhibitors of RISC loading, including aurintricarboxylic acid (IC 50 = 0. 47 μM), suramin (IC 50 = 0. 69 μM), and <b>oxidopamine</b> HCL (IC 50 = 1. 61 μM). Small molecules identified by this biochemical screening assay also inhibited siRNA loading to endogenous Ago 2 in cultured cells. RNA interference (RNAi) depends on double-stranded RNA and induces sequence-specific gene silencing. 1 − 3 The endogenous RNAi pathway intersects with the microRNA (miRNA) machinery, which in mammals regulates gen...|$|E
40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is a gene {{regulatory and}} host defense mechanism whereby small RNA molecules are engaged by Argonaute (AGO) proteins, which facilitate gene knockdown of complementary mRNA targets. Small molecule inhibitors of AGO represent a convenient method for reversing this effect and have applications in human therapy and biotechnology. Viral suppressors of RNA silencing, such as p 19, {{can also be}} used to suppress the pathway. Here we assess the compatibility of these two approaches, by examining whether synthetic inhibitors of AGO would inhibit p 19 -siRNA interactions. We observe that aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) is a potent inhibitor of p 19 's ability to bind siRNA (IC 50 = 0. 433 ̆bcM), <b>oxidopamine</b> does not inhibit p 19 :siRNA interactions, and suramin is a mild inhibitor of p 19 :siRNA interactions (IC 50 = 4303 ̆bcM). We observe that p 19 and suramin are compatible inhibitors of RNA silencing in human hepatoma cells. Our data suggests that at least some inhibitors of AGO may be used in combination with p 19 to inhibit RNA silencing at different points in the pathway. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
