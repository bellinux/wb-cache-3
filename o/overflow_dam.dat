25|$|A weir (also {{sometimes}} called an <b>overflow</b> <b>dam)</b> {{is a type}} of small <b>overflow</b> <b>dam</b> that is often used within a river channel to create an impoundment lake for water abstraction purposes and which can also be used for flow measurement or retardation.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{of the dam}} {{started in}} 1898. When {{completed}} in 1902 it was {{claimed to be the}} highest <b>overflow</b> <b>dam</b> in the world.|$|E
25|$|The largest bridge dam was the Band-e Kaisar {{which was}} erected by a Roman {{workforce}} on Sassanid {{territory in the}} 3rdcenturyAD. The approximately 500m long structure, a novel combination of <b>overflow</b> <b>dam</b> and arcaded bridge, crossed Iran's most effluent river on more than forty arches. The most eastern Roman civil engineering structure ever built, its dual-purpose design exerted a profound influence on Iranian dam building.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{characterize}} the geomorphic (channel-changing) effects of <b>overflow</b> <b>dams</b> on the lower Neosho River channel in southeastern Kansas.

25|$|The {{approximately}} 500m long <b>overflow</b> <b>dam</b> {{over the}} Karun, Iran's most affluent river, was the core {{structure of the}} Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System (سازه‌های آبی شوشتر) from which the city derived its agricultural productivity, and which has been designated by the UNESCO as Iran's 10th World Heritage Site in 2009. The arched superstructure carried across the important road between Pasargadae and the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon. Many times repaired in the Islamic period, the dam bridge remained in use until the late 19thcentury.|$|E
25|$|Because Black Eagle Dam is an <b>overflow</b> <b>dam,</b> it {{is common}} for debris to jam against the dam or obstruct the {{penstock}} intakes. Driftwood and logs are the most common forms of debris, but unusual objects such as boat docks, bowling balls, canoes, hot tubs, and small wooden and steel sheds and buildings also sometimes become lodged against the dam. Removing hollow items can be dangerous, because the water pressure against them can cause them to implode. In addition to large amounts of driftwood, about 100 animal carcasses (cattle, deer, dogs, and various small animals) become lodged against the dam or the penstock intake screens each year. Floating screens {{at the entrance to the}} forebay catch many items, as do the penstock intake screens. Workers use a crane to remove items from these screens, and bury the items retrieved at a landfill. Dam operators also use a yellow civilian version of the Alvis Stalwart amphibious vehicle to remove objects, and to maintain the dam. (This vehicle caused a stir in Great Falls in June 2006, when local residents driving on a nearby road mistook the vehicle for a sport utility vehicle which had fallen into the water.) Ice is another form of dangerous debris for the dam. In December 2010, blocks of floating ice overwhelmed the top of the dam, tearing the handrails off the maintenance walkway.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} Black Eagle Dam in 1890. GFWPTC {{engineers}} designed a rock-and-timber crib weir <b>overflow</b> <b>dam,</b> in which dressed and shaped heavy timbers formed a closed structure filled with rock or rubble. The dam {{was not a}} large one. The goal was to merely create a pond behind the dam, which would create enough water pressure (or [...] "head") to turn turbines and generate electricity. The dam was built {{at a cost of}} about $515,000 (roughly $12,335,000 in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars) on the upstream brink of the falls (to create the deepest reservoir possible). Construction bids were opened on February 5, 1890, with the request for bids specifying that all work must be finished by December 1, 1890. All the bids were rejected, and mechanical engineer Maurice Parker was employed to design and construct the dam. Coffer dams were constructed in April 1890 to divert the river from the work areas. Work on the dam itself began on April 15. A shanty town named [...] "River Bank" [...] was constructed just upstream of the construction site on the north bank for the river to house the Croat, Scandinavian, Slovak, and Welsh workers who helped construct the dam. (Most of these workers helped found the town of Black Eagle, and earthen foundations for the shanty town can still be seen.) The red sandstone riverbed was leveled as much as possible, and large timbers bolted and cemented (perpendicular to the river's flow) to the rock. Each timber was [...] from the next one downstream, and six cribs were built to form a dam [...] deep at its base. The dam's downstream face had a pitch of 1.05:1. From the crest of the dam, a face (at a pitch of 1:08:1) extended for about [...] before it became vertical. A [...] masonry wall was built on the south end of the dam to form the foundation of and to protect the powerhouse, and the construction worked inward from either end of the dam. Every [...] across the face of the dam, a [...] floodwater spillway made of concrete was created (for a total of eight spillways). Flashboards [...] in height were installed along the entire top of the dam to add water storage capacity. The dam was [...] high and [...] long.|$|E

50|$|Prior to European colonialization {{along the}} Passaic {{in the late}} 17th century, the valley was the {{territory}} of the Lenape groups now known as the Acquackanonk and Hackensack, who used the river for fishing. To that end they built weirs, or <b>overflow</b> <b>dams,</b> to create pools and where the fish could be trapped. Many of these archeological sites are still present and, in some cases, in good condition.|$|R
50|$|The outer rainbands of the typhoon brought unseasonably {{heavy rains}} to Thailand. There, four people were {{reported}} missing and ten were injured after water from an <b>overflowing</b> <b>dam</b> tipped over a bus. Two {{people were killed}} and three were rendered missing due to flash flooding in Bangkok. Elsewhere, the outer extremities of Ike produced light rainfall and light breezes on Okinawa, peaking at 3.8 mm, including 3.3 mm in 24 hours and 2.2 mm in an hour in Ibaruma.|$|R

40|$|In the {{stabilization}} of gullies, small <b>overflow</b> <b>dams</b> {{are used to}} retain silt and to control the stream grade. These dams are simple drop structures {{similar to those used}} in irrigation canals. In this paper the development of rules for the proportioning of such dams is described in terms of the hydraulic requirements for structure performance. The formulas included in the design rules are presented graphically for convenience in application. These rules are based on the accumulated experience of engineers in irrigation and soil conservation work and on the results of a series of laboratory test programs...|$|R
50|$|In 1985 the <b>dam</b> <b>overflowed</b> {{reservoir}} {{forcing the}} evacuation of 20,000 people. Water then flowed towards the Pacific coast cut off the international highway and isolated several small towns. A highway was cut north of Navojoa, 240 miles from the U.S. border. Troops were deployed to help the evacuees, who left their homes after the Mocuzari <b>Dam</b> <b>overflowed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Immediately to the south, {{where the}} artificially {{constructed}} conduit {{of the river}} Hase flows into the Alfsee lakes, {{there is a small}} auxiliary basin (Absetzbecken) in front of the actual reservoir, from which water flows into the lake via a roughly 330 m long <b>overflow</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} {{includes the}} powerhouse, an earth embankment, a concrete non-overflow dam, and a 700-foot-long concrete gravity <b>overflow</b> <b>dam.</b> They {{were built in}} 1897-1898 by the Hudson River Power Transmission Company and span the western channel of the Hudson River between the Saratoga County shore and Bluff Island.|$|E

5000|$|According to the Bureau of Meteorology's 2011 Australian Climate Statement, Australia {{had lower}} than average {{temperatures}} in 2011 {{as a consequence}} of a La Niña weather pattern; however, [...] "the country's 10-year average continues to demonstrate the rising trend in temperatures, with 2002-2011 likely to rank in the top two warmest 10-year periods on record for Australia, at [...] above the long-term average". Furthermore, 2014 was Australia's third warmest year since national temperature observations commenced in 1910. Water restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought. Throughout much of the continent, major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought, flushing out inland river systems, <b>overflowing</b> <b>dams</b> and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in 2010, 2011 and 2012 after the 2000s Australian drought.|$|R

The arched superstructure carried across the important road between Pasargadae and the Sassanid capital Ctesiphon. Many times repaired in the Islamic period, the dam bridge fell out of use in the late 19th century, leading to the degeneration of the complex system of irrigation.|$|E
50|$|To the {{disappointment}} {{of the residents}} of Port Elmsley, the second route was chosen. In 1883, a Federal government order-in-council authorized a contract with A.H. Manning & Macdonald Company for the construction of the Tay Canal. The proposal included deepening the entire system to the required 1.7 m depth; cutting a 18 m wide, 2 km long canal to Beveridge Bay; building two locks near {{the south end of the}} canal cut, each with a lift of 4.0 m; and building a flat <b>overflow</b> <b>dam</b> across the former channel of the Tay near the entrance to the new canal cut.|$|E
