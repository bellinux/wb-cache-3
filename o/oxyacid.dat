This is indeed {{the case of the}} complexes formed by oxyacids such as acetic, benzoic and phosphinic acids with BeCl 2, which yield much stronger HBs with different bases than the isolated oxyacids due to a significant acidity enhancement, triggered by the charge transfer from the <b>oxyacid</b> to BeCl 2. More importantly, depending on the intrinsic basicity of the base acting as proton acceptor, a spontaneous proton transfer from the <b>oxyacid</b> to the base may occur, leading to the formation of an ion pair in the gas phase. This is indeed the case in complexes involving ammonia. For slightly weaker bases, such as trimethylphosphine, two local minima are stable: one in which the proton remains attached to the <b>oxyacid</b> and one in which this proton has been transferred to the trimethylphosphine, the latter being always the most stable. When a compound is able to act simultaneously as a proton donor and as a proton acceptor, its participation in a beryllium bond necessarily leads to an enhancement and a dampening of both properties, respectively.

However, the average As-O distance for the H nAsO 4 (3 -n) - species (0 ≤n≤ 3) remains the same. These average values are slightly shorter, ca. 0. 02 Å, than {{in aqueous solution}} due to the hydration as determined by EXAFS and LAXS.

In addition to arsenous acid, we have used orthotelluric acid, Te(OH) 6, for comparison with arsenous acid and for detailed studies of the hydration of covalently bound hydroxo groups. Arsenous acid cannot be studied with the same accuracy as orthotelluric acid, due to a relatively low solubility of As 2 O 3 (s) in neutral to acidic aqueous solution.
