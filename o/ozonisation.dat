After the sand filtered the river water, it was pumped up and purified for human consumption. This Dutch process is unique in the world.Since 1975 the water is purified before infiltration. By using <b>ozonisation</b> and charcoal the Dutch purify their water without using chlorine.

One system uses ionisation and special filter devices (manufacturer's specifications). In the case of ozone production the perceived intensity and the PD value will increase to inacceptable values. The chemical analyses shows that the increase aldehyde concentration is probably caused by surface reactions between material and ozone.

For these reasons a series of changes had to be made when this new edition was prepared. In order not to increase the bulk of the book these objects have been attained by sacrificing examples (e. g. lino-lenic acid, crystal violet, Gattermann-Koch aldehyde synthesis) with which, from this point of view, it seemed possible to dispense.

30|$|Tolyfluanid The {{authorisation}} of PPPs containing this fungicidal {{active substance}} was withdrawn in 2007. The {{reason for this}} was the “delayed” discovery that a metabolite (N,N-dimethylsulfamide) which can {{find its way into}} groundwater, though previously classified as toxicologically harmless, can be transformed into a genotoxic and carcinogenic substance (N-nitrosodimethylamine) during the preparation of drinking water by <b>ozonisation.</b> The use of the active substance was prohibited as a precautionary measure for the protection of drinking water [24]. However, residues of other active substances such as atrazine, which has long been banned in Germany, are still found in groundwater and other currently authorised active substances (e.g., bentazon, isoproturon, and chloridazon), and their metabolites are frequently found in groundwater at concentrations above the limit levels [25]. There have recently been intensive debates in Germany about the pollution of groundwater and the problems faced by water utilities endeavouring to maintain the high quality of German drinking water. The position of the water utilities is “that the active substances in plant protection products and their metabolites should be kept away from the water cycle at the first opportunity for the sake of precaution” [26].|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{the prevalence of}} Acanthamoeba in drinking water treatment plants {{during the course of}} the purification processes. Methods Samples were taken from two drinking water purification plants and monitored for the presence of Acanthamoeba in order to estimate the removal capacity of treatment methods employed. Water samples were collected at each step in the purification, during the one year survey, and analysed for the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. by plating on bacterial-seeded plates. Results : The results showed that amoebae were present in surface raw waters in 100 % of the samples tested. Acanthamoeba spp. were isolated from 71 % and 57 % of the water samples collected from post flat-bottom clarifier 1 and post-sedimentation plant respectively. Considering the outflow drinking waters, the removal capacity was 100 % in both purification plants monitored. The occurrence of Acanthamoeba was not associated with seasonality. Conclusion : These findings confirm that water purification plants employing methods of flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration in combination with activated charcoal filtration, <b>ozonisation</b> and chlorination exhibited sufficient Acanthamoeba removal capacity and the presence of amoebae in the tap water may be due to older plumbing, water storage tanks, tap water hygiene, and/or environmental settings...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} five samples of bottled {{drinking}} water belonging to 30 different brands, collected from six different states of India have been analysed for total heterotrophic bacterial (THB) load and coliforms. Almost all bottlers used multiple treatment procedures such as microfiltration, reverse osmosis and <b>ozonisation</b> {{to treat the}} water. Around 40 % of the samples exceeded the limit of 100 cfu/ml set {{by the department of}} health as well as Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), Government of India. Fourteen percent and 44 % of the samples with THB loads between 100 and 1000 cfu/ml or 1000 cfu/ml tested positive for coliforms indicating a linear relationship between THB and coliform bacteria. Gram-positive genera such as Kurthia and Corynebacterium were found to be dominant genera, while members of the family enterobacteriaceae contributed to 7 %. Risk assessment of the heterotrophic bacteria revealed {{that the majority of the}} strains acquired resistance against ampicillin, nalidixic acid, novobiocin and oxytetracycline. As bottled drinking water is a ready to drink commodity, the high load of heterotrophic bacteria with multiple drug resistance poses significant health hazards to the consumers, especially to immunocompromised individuals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPresqualenyl-pyrophosphate (PSPP) was {{synthesized}} from farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP). The purified product {{could be}} transformed into a squalene in 90 % yield. The structure of PSPP was established by the following experiments: 1. 1) PSPP displays a remarkably acid-labile phosphate—ester bond. Analogous to FPP it was possible to stabilize this bond by the addition of bromine. This indicates a structure of the allylester type. 2. 2) On acid hydrolysis PSPP splits off not only the pyrophosphate but also water. This may be best explained by the presence of a tertiary hydroxyl group in PSPP. 3. 3) The pyrophosphate group of PSPP could be split by prostatic phosphatase. In gas-liquid-chromatography the trimethyl-silylated product gave a single peak. From the mass spectra of this compound and of the corresponding alcohol the expected molecular weight of 426 could be verified for the latter. 4. 4) Determining the 3 H/ 14 C ratio in 1 - 3 H 2 - 414 C-FPP and in PSPP and squalene, synthesized from it, only three 3 H-atoms could be detected in PSPP and in squalene. 5. 5) <b>Ozonisation</b> of PSPP, synthesized from 1 - 14 C-FPP, gave radioactive malondialdehyde, which was characterised as azobenzene-malondialdehyde and 4 -azobenzene- 1 -phenyl-pyrazole.

40|$|Hundreds {{of active}} {{substances}} {{are used in}} human and veterinary drug formulas. Because pharmaceuticals are broadly applied, their residues can reach the environment via several pathways. Since pharmaceutical compounds are not completely eliminated in the sewage treatment plants, variable amounts reach surface water and groundwater. The last few years has seen a growing interest {{in the assessment of}} the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment. This report records results of the analysis to gain information on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in surface water, groundwater, drinking water and waste water in the Netherlands. The aim is to use this information for risk assessment and risk management. All 13 pharmaceuticals in this study were analysed using a single method (LC-MS/MS). Pharmaceuticals such as acetylsalicylic acid (analgesic), carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), clofibric acid (cardiovascular agent) and sulphamethoxazol (antibiotic) are found incidentally in very low concentrations (several tens of nanograms) in drinking water. Concentrations come to a factor of 1000 lower than the (provisional) toxicological limit values. Based on the results of the survey and the current toxicological information, the risk for the drinking-water consumer is negligible. The results of samples taken after different treatment steps during drinking-water production indicate that <b>ozonisation</b> in combination with activated carbon filtration promotes better removal of the pharmaceuticals than chlorination followed by activated carbon filtration. To realise the aim of risk management pharmaceuticals should not be present in drinking water. Therefore taking measures to prevent the discharge of persistent pharmaceuticals into the environment is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Soilless {{cultures}} {{were originally}} developed to control soilborne diseases. Soilless cultures provide several advantages for growers such as greater production of crops, reduced energy consumption, better control {{of growth and}} independence of soil quality. However, diseases specific to hydroponics have been reported. For instance, zoospore-producing microorganisms such as Pythium and Phytophthora spp. are particularly well adapted to aquatic environments. Their growth in soilless substrates is favoured by the recirculation of the nutrient solution. These pathogenic microorganisms are usually controlled by disinfection methods but such methods are only effective as a preventive measure. Contrary to biofiltration, active treatments such as UV, heat and <b>ozonisation</b> have the disadvantage of eliminating not only the harmful microorganisms but also the beneficial indigenous microorganisms. Here, we review microbial populations that colonise ecological niches of hydroponic greenhouse systems. Three topics are discussed: (1) the general microflora; (2) the pathogenic microflora that are typical to hydroponic systems; and (3) the non-pathogenic and possibly beneficial microflora, and their use in the control of plant diseases in soilless greenhouse systems. Technical, economic and environmental concerns are forcing the adoption of new sustainable methods {{such as the use}} of microbial antagonists. Thus, increased attention is now focused on the role of natural microflora in suppressing certain diseases. Managing disease suppression in hydroponics represents a promising way of controlling pathogens. Three main strategies can be used: (1) increasing the level of suppressiveness by the addition of antagonistic microorganisms; (2) using a mix of microorganisms with complementary ecological traits and antagonistic abilities, combined with disinfection techniques; and (3) amending substrates to favour the development of a suppressive microflora. Increasing our knowledge on beneficial microflora, their ecology and treatments that influence their composition will help to commercialise new, ready-to-use substrates microbiologically optimised to protect plants in sustainable management systems...|$|E
30|$|Several {{industries}} extensively use synthetic dyes {{and generate}} a {{large volume of}} dye effluent. This dye effluent contains enormous salt and organic content and they are less biodegradable. Discharge of these dyes into natural water system without the treatment results in ecological imbalance [1, 2, 3, 4]. Synthetic dyes are resistance to the physicochemical reaction and have thermal and optical stability due to the complex aromatic structure [5, 6]. By conventional methods, {{it is challenging to}} treat the wastewater which contains dyes [7, 8]. Azo dyes account for 60 – 70 % of total dye consumption in many industries [7]. Congo red (CR) is the synthetic anionic azo dye [9] and the effluent had to be adequately treated and discharged into the environment, otherwise it can metabolize into benzidine, which is a human carcinogen [10]. CR dye contains complex aromatic structure which complicates the treatment process. It has thermal and optical stability, and resistance to biodegradation and photodegradation [11]. CR dye is used for staining purpose and as a pH indicator in the laboratory. It is also used for detecting bacteria, amyloidosis diagnosis and to treat protein folding disorders, dermatological disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. However, CR dye causes allergic reactions and it is a cytotoxic, genotoxic, hematotoxic, neurotoxic, as well as mutagenic substance [12, 13]. Generally, chemical oxidation, <b>ozonisation,</b> membrane filtration, ion exchange or electrochemical techniques are the different methods used to treat dye-contaminated wastewater. Adsorption is proved to be the best method compared to all other technologies due to its less capital outlay. Detailed literature review shows that various adsorbents were used for Congo red dye removal from wastewater, which includes polypyrrole–polyaniline nanofibers [14], modified zeolites [2], sugarcane bagasse [15], aniline propyl silica xerogel [16], tamarind fruit shell [17], acrylamide–sodium dodecyl sulfate layered double hydroxides [18], mesoporous ZrO 2 fibers [19], ammonium aluminum carbonate hydroxide-nickel hydroxide composite [20], zinc oxide–alumina composite [21], nickel cobaltite [22] and Funalia trogii [23]. However, some of these are not effective for the anionic dye. The biosorbent (Chrysanthemum indicum) belongs to Asteraceae family and are known as Indian chrysanthemum which are widely used for decoration purposes [24, 25]. Further, the literature review indicates that Chrysanthemum indicum flowers (CIF) which are used in this study as an adsorbent for CR dye removal have not yet been studied previously. In India, CIF is generally used for the ornamental purpose and the regular return of CIF is 16.7 tons/hectare that is reported in our previous study [26]. The main aim deals with CIF ability as an adsorbent to treat synthetic CR dye wastewater. CCD is widely adapted to observe the effect of individual process factors and their interactive effects.|$|E
30|$|The most {{reliable}} source {{of drinking water}} is bottled water which is of good bacteriological quality (Obiri et al. 2003), but it is expensive and thus only within {{the means of the}} affluent in the society. While some employ sophisticated techniques such as <b>ozonisation</b> and reverse osmosis, most use ordinary boiling of well water sources and exclusion of particles by waterborne diseases constitutes one of the major public health hazards in developing countries. Worldwide, in 1995, contaminated water and food caused more than 3 millions deaths, of which more than 80  % were among children under age 5 (WHO 1996). From microbiological point of view, the safety of water depends on various aspects from its production to final consumption in such a way so that either any microbial contamination can be prevented or it will be reduced to levels not harmful to health. Water can support the growth of many types of microorganisms. This can be advantageous, for example, the chemical activities of certain strains of yeasts provide us with beer and bread. Many microorganisms are found naturally in fresh and saltwater. These include bacteria, cyanobacteria, protozoa, algae, and tiny animals such as rotifers. These can be important in the food chain that forms the basis of life in the water. For example, the microbes called cyanobacteria can convert the energy of the sun into the energy it needs to live. The plentiful numbers of these organisms in turn are used as food for other life. As well, the growth of some bacteria in contaminated water can help digest the poisons from the water. However, the presence of other disease-causing microbes in water is unhealthy and even life threatening. For example, bacteria that live in the intestinal tracts of humans and other warm-blooded animals, such as E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio, can contaminate water if feces enter the water. Contamination of drinking water with a type of E. coli known as O 157 :H 7 can be fatal. The intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals also contains viruses such as rotavirus, enteroviruses, and coxsackievirus that can contaminate water and cause disease. Protozoans are the other group of microbes of concern in water microbiology. The two protozoa of the most concern are Giardia and Cryptosporidium. They live normally in the intestinal tract of animals such as beaver and deer. Giardia and Cryptosporidium form dormant and hardy forms called cysts during their life cycles. The cyst forms are resistant to chlorine, which is the most popular form of drinking water disinfection, and can pass through the filters used in many water treatment plants. If ingested in drinking water they can cause debilitating and prolonged diarrhea in humans, and can be life threatening to those people with impaired immune systems. Besides the conventional pathogens, which are transmitted by water, several emerging waterborne pathogens have become increasingly important during the last decade or so. Several waterborne diseases are commonly reported from metropolitan cities of India, most likely due to unsatisfactory disinfection of municipal water (Singh 2000). These include Vibrio cholera 0139, toxin producing E. coli especially enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (Szewzyk et al. 2000; Sharma et al. 2003), Salmonella typhi the organisms causing typhoid fever (Madigan et al. 1997). Ideally drinking water should not contain any microorganisms known to be pathogenic or any bacteria indicative of fecal pollution (Prasai et al. 2007). Detection of fecal indicator bacteria in drinking water provides a very sensitive method of quality assessment and {{it is not possible to}} examine water for every possible pathogen that might be present (WHO 1993). The greatest microbial risks are associated with ingestion of water that is contaminated with human or animal feces (George et al. 2001). An important aspect of water microbiology, particularly for drinking water, is the testing of the water to ensure that it is safe to drink.|$|E
40|$|Phosphororganic {{flame retardants}} and {{plasticisers}} are important contaminants in the aquatic environment. Whereas the non-chlorinated alkylphosphates were partly eliminated in {{wastewater treatment plants}} the amounts of the chlorinated flame retardants were hardly reduced. Thus these compounds are discharged into the aquatic environment by STP-effluents. The elimination efficiency of wastewater treatment depends {{on the one hand}} on the dimension of the respective STP {{and on the other hand}} on the treatment technique that is applied. The elimination was higher in larger STP (inhabitant equivalent values (IEV) 300, 000 - 1, 000, 000) than in smaller ones (IEV below 100, 000). Lower elimination rates were observed for the trickling filter plant that was sampled in comparison to the activated sludge plants. In degradation experiments of the selected organophosphates with activated sludge in batch reactors, bis-(2 -chlorethyl) phosphate was identified as metabolite of tris-(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate under aerobic conditions. The selected organophosphate esters were detected in surface water that is used for drinking water purification. Thus it was studied if the drinking water quality is affected by these compounds. For this purpose samples from different waterworks in the Ruhr catchment area were analysed. Moreover the elimination efficiency of diverse treatment processes such as slow sand filtration, <b>ozonisation</b> and activated carbon filtration was studied. In the finished water the concentrations of the organophosphates were below the respective limit of quantification (LOQ). The chlorinated alkylphosphates are very persistent in the aquatic environment as they have been detected and quantified in pristine waterbodies such as the German Bight and Lake Ontario. A reduction of these compounds in the German Bight was traced back to dilution effects only. The concentrations of the phosphororganic flame retardants in marine samples were one order of magnitude higher than for other contaminants such as herbicides and by-products of pesticide production. The non-chlorinated alkylphosphates have only been detected in the river Elbe plume. Similar results were obtained for samples of Lake Ontario. As expected from the respective log KOW values of the selected organophosphate esters the bioaccumulation of these substances in fish is low. The concentrations of tri-n-butylphosphate (TnBP), tri-iso-butylphosphate (TiBP), triphenylphosphate (TPP) and tris-(chloroisopropyl) phosphate TCPP in bream muscle from different sampling locations in Germany were in the lower ng/g range (dry weight). Tris-(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris-(dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCP), tris-(butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) and ethylhexyldiphenylphosphate (EHDPP) were not detected in any fish sample. Moreover a temporal trend in the concentrations was observed. The sampling location seems to be an important factor that influences the detected levels of these substances in fish muscle as in the conurbation area higher amounts were detected than in riverine ecosystems. For the extraction of the selected organophosphate esters from water samples liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) has been applied. Fish samples were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) in combination with different clean up steps (SPE on silica gel and size exclusion chromatography (SEC)). The different compounds were detected by gas chromatography mass spectrometry with electron impact ionization (GC-EI-MS). For quantification purposes the isotopic labelled internal standards tri-n-butylphosphate d 27 (TnBP d 27) and triphenylphosphate d 15 (TPP d 15) were used. TPP d 15 was synthesized from phenol d 6 and phosphorus oxytrichloride. The empiric formula of the product was confirmed by electrospray high resolution time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-HR-TOF-MS). The metabolites bis-(2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP), bis-(methyl, 2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (BCPP) and bis-(butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBEP) were synthesized from phosphorus oxytrichloride and the respective alcohols chloroethanol, 1 -chloro- 2 -propanol and butoxyethanol. For the control of the reaction the respective products were measured after derivatisation with trimethylsulphoniumhydroxide (TMSH) by GC-EI-MS and gas chromatography positive chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (GC-PCI-MS) ...|$|E
40|$|Polyester, polyacetate and {{polyamide}} fibres are {{the kinds}} most frequently used at present to produce synthetic textiles. The dyeing of these fibre types is predominantly carried out with disperse dyes. Despite {{the high degree of}} absorption (95 - 98 %) of the water-insoluble dyes, relatively large quantities remain in solution and must be disposed of with the waste water. This work examined the degradation of the disperse dyes by chemical and electro-chemical reduction. To this end, three representative disperse dyes (Disperse Blue 79 : 1, Disperse Orange 62, Disperse Red 60) were selected in agreement with the company DyStar. For analysis of the degradation products, LC-MS and GCxGC-(TOF) MS were used along with UV-VIS methods. In some cases solid-phase extraction proved unsuitable for concentrating the dye solutions because the dispersing agents contained in the solutions prevented the degradation products from being adsorbed on the stationary phase. Liquid/liquid extraction procedures were therefore developed, which made the concentration of relatively nonpolar products possible. By such extraction, followed by GCxGC-(TOF) MS, the degradation product 2, 6 -dichloro- 4 -aminoaniline was identified, which is formed during the chemical and electro-chemical reduction of the azodye Disperse Orange 62. Further degradation products could be identified by precision mass measurements. As expected, the reductive treatment of azodyes yielded aromatic amines as main degradation products. Aromatic amines also resulted from reduction of nitro or amide groups. It was shown in addition that the use of larger quantities of reducing agents and/or longer electrolysis times did not lead to increased degradation of the aromatic amines to harmless compounds. Since many of these amines are suspected of being genotoxic, it is urged that past practice be reconsidered, for it includes reductive degradation for decolourisation, either as a component of the dyeing method (reductive after-clearing) or as an anaerobic step during the waste water purification. The goal must be largely eliminating and destroying aromatic amines, as is possible by oxidative procedures. To investigate the chemical reduction of the disperse dyes, sodium dithionite, sodium borohydride and zinc/hydrochloric acid were used. The degradation products were analysed {{as a function of the}} quantity of reducing agent, so that the course of the reaction could be examined more closely. The chemical reduction clearly ran faster than the electro-chemical reduction. The disperse dyes in the form of the commercial products in water could be converted electro-chemically only with the assistance of a mediator system. If the dye press-cake (containing no dispersing agents) was dispersed with cationic tensides, then degradation could also be observed. Neither of these procedures, however, is suitable for a technical application. The conversion of the dye into a truly dissolved condition gave the best turnover rates in the electro-chemical treatment. Nevertheless, even at a relatively low dye concentration (0. 1 g/L), it was necessary to add about 50 percent by volume of an organic solvent. The resulting secondary burden of pollutants also eliminates this method as a treatment procedure. From the relatively low conversion rate of the electro-chemical reduction in purely aqueous systems, it can be concluded that the particle character of the incompletely dissolved disperse dye and the negatively charged dispersing agents, which coat and/or shield the dye, are unfavourable for the transmission of electrons at the cathode surface. The electro-chemical treatment of real waste water led likewise to insufficient decolourisation, although the measured particle sizes were clearly smaller (factor 30) than those in the freshly dispersed solution before the dyeing process. This suggests that the dispersing agent, which is not consumed during the dyeing process and is thus present in the real waste water in a large excess over the dye, probably has a substantial effect on the conversion rate. On the whole, the electro-chemical reduction as primary step of the degradation of water-insoluble dyes and pigments does not have the desired efficiency. Surprisingly, the concentrations of both the disperse dyes and the vat dyes, to the extent that these were present in the waste water from the dyeing plant, could be lowered by <b>ozonisation.</b> The ozone consumption here was greater than what is necessary to degrade water-soluble dyes; this can be explained by the presence of ozone-degradable dispersing agents. While the fineness of the disperse after the dyeing, when the relationship of dye to dispersing agent is approximately 1 : 100 (before the dyeing this relationship is 50 : 50), makes electro-chemical reduction rather difficult, this relationship seems on the contrary even to be favourable for an oxidative treatment. It is thus conceivable that this established procedure for water-soluble dyes can also be used economically in disperse and vat dyeing...|$|E
