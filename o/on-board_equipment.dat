30|$|As a {{component}} of technical equipment which ensures safe, punctual, fast, convenient, high-density, ceaseless operation of the train, signaling system {{plays an important role}} in rail transit system [1, 2, 3]. The signaling system consists of four subsystems: automatic train supervision system (ATS), automatic train protection subsystem (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO), and computer-based interlocking subsystem (CI). The four subsystems form a closed-loop system via message switching network—automatic train control (ATC) that manages to combine ground-control and train-control, local control, and central control together. In order to facilitate safety in operation, an ATC system which integrates the functions of traffic control, operating adjustment, and automatic driving is constructed. The signaling system operates in modes of distributed management and centralized control. Distinguished from the distribution of section, the centralized signaling system is made up of controlling equipments in the center, station equipments, vehicle-based equipments, trackside <b>equipments,</b> and <b>on-board</b> <b>equipments.</b>|$|R
