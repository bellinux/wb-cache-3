40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{reproductive}} behaviour of the <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> Symphodus ocellatus (Forsskål 1775) were investigated in wild conditions along a pCO 2 gradient. Our results show no differences {{in the number of}} females, sneakers and satellite males involved in the spawning phase under two pCO 2 conditions. However, the spawning rate of nesting males was negatively affected in high pCO 2, whilst exerted a normal reproductive pattern in ambient pCO 2...|$|E
40|$|Volcanic CO 2 seeps provide {{opportunities}} {{to investigate the}} effects of ocean acidification on organisms in the wild. To understand the influence of increasing CO 2 concentrations on the metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) {{and the development of}} <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> early life stages, we ran two field experiments, collecting embryos from nesting sites with different partial pressures of CO 2 [pCO 2; ambient (~ 400 μatm) and high (800 - 1000 μatm) ] and reciprocally transplanting embryos from ambient- to high-CO 2 sites for 30 h. <b>Ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> offspring brooded in different CO 2 conditions had similar responses, but after transplanting portions of nests to the high-CO 2 site, embryos from parents that spawned in ambient conditions had higher metabolic rates. Although metabolic phenotypic plasticity may show a positive response to high CO 2, it often comes at a cost, in this case as a smaller size at hatching. This can have adverse effects because smaller larvae often exhibit a lower survival in the wild. However, the adverse effects of increased CO 2 on metabolism and development did not occur when embryos from the high-CO 2 nesting site were exposed to ambient conditions, suggesting that offspring from the high-CO 2 nesting site could be resilient to a wider range of pCO 2 values than those belonging to the site with present-day pCO 2 levels. Our study identifies a crucial need {{to increase the number of}} studies dealing with these processes under global change trajectories and to expand these to naturally high-CO 2 environments, in order to assess further the adaptive plasticity mechanism that encompasses nongenetic inheritance (epigenetics) through parental exposure and other downstream consequences, such as survival of larvae...|$|E
40|$|Fish exhibit {{impaired}} sensory {{function and}} altered behaviour at levels of ocean acidification expected to occur owing to anthropogenic {{carbon dioxide emissions}} during this century. We provide the first evidence {{of the effects of}} ocean acidification on reproductive behaviour of fish in the wild. Satellite and sneaker male <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Symphodus ocellatus) compete to fertilize eggs guarded by dominant nesting males. Key mating behaviours such as dominant male courtship and nest defence did not differ between sites with ambient versus elevated CO 2 concentrations. Dominant males did, however, experience significantly lower rates of pair spawning at elevated CO 2 levels. Despite the higher risk of sperm competition found at elevated CO 2, we also found a trend of lower satellite and sneaker male paternity at elevated CO 2. Given the importance of fish for food security and ecosystem stability, this study highlights the need for targeted research into the effects of rising CO 2 levels on patterns of reproduction in wild fish...|$|E
40|$|Although theory {{generally}} {{predicts that}} males should reduce paternal care {{in response to}} cues that predict increased sperm competition and decreased paternity, empirical patterns are equivocal. Some studies have found the predicted decrease in male care with increased sperm competition, while even more studies report no effect of paternity or sperm competition on male care. Here, we report the first example, to our knowledge, of paternal care increasing with the risk and intensity of sperm competition, in the <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Symphodus ocellatus). Theory also predicts that if paternal care varies and is important to female fitness, female choice among males and male indicators traits of expected paternal care should evolve. Despite a non-random distribution of mating success among nests, we found no evidence for female choice among parental males. Finally, we document the highest published levels of extra-pair paternity for a species with exclusive and obligate male care: genetic paternity analyses revealed cuckoldry at 100 per cent of nests and 28 per cent of all offspring were not sired by the male caring for them. While not predicted by any existing theory, these unexpected reproductive patterns become understandable if we consider how male and female mating and parental care interact simultaneously in this and probably many other species...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{expression}} {{differences between}} males and females often underlie sexually dimorphic phenotypes, and the expression levels of genes that are differentially expressed between the sexes are thought to respond to sexual selection. Most studies on the transcriptomic response to sexual selection treat sexual selection as a single force, but postmating sexual selection in particular is expected to specifically target gonadal tissue. The three male morphs of the <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Symphodus ocellatus) make it possible to test the role of postmating sexual selection in shaping the gonadal transcriptome. Nesting males hold territories and have the highest reproductive success, yet we detected feminization of their gonadal gene expression compared to satellite males. Satellite males are less brightly coloured and experience more intense sperm competition than nesting males. In line with postmating sexual selection affecting gonadal gene expression, we detected a more masculinized expression profile in satellites. Sneakers are the lowest quality males and showed both de-masculinization and de-feminization of gene expression. We also detected higher rates of gene sequence evolution of male-biased genes compared to unbiased genes, which could at least in part be explained by positive selection. Together, these results reveal the potential for postmating sexual selection to drive higher rates of gene sequence evolution and shape the gonadal transcriptome profile...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} their reproductive success, fish species have evolved various strategies, including both simple processes {{and more complex}} mechanisms that involve parental care by nest-building. In Symphodus ocellatus, a species that lives in rocky infralittoral zones of the Mediterranean Sea, during the reproductive period, the male builds a nest within a hole or crevice using fragments of algae and/or sand particles. Data on the nesting activity of wrasses are rare, and previous descriptions regarding the algal composition of nests have provided conflicting results. In this regard, {{it is unclear whether}} territorial males actively select algal species for nest construction or algal choice is random and depends exclusively on the algal species available in the surrounding habitat. To clarify this, several S. ocellatus nests and the algal community near the nests were sampled. The specific algal composition of the nest, the Strauss selectivity index of the used algae, the mechanical strength and the ability of the algae to accommodate eggs were investigated to examine overall nest performance. Our findings show that the dominant male <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> deliberately selects algae when building the nest. The mechanical strength and ability of the algae to accommodate eggs is of particular importance. Among the species commonly used for nest-building, Jania rubens performed the best. Our results show that J. rubens provides resistance to biochemical decomposition and wave action...|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{concentration}} in the atmosphere is increasing at unprecedented rate since the last 800, 000 years due to rising fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes and land use by humans. By absorbing part of this gas from the atmosphere, Oceans contribute to the mitigation of climatic changes, but {{at the cost of}} greater modifications of their physical and chemical characteristics. CO 2 dissolved in the seawater leads to increased bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) and hydrogen ions (H+) concentrations with a consequent pH drop, a phenomenon known as Ocean Acidification (OA). If global policy will not put in force mitigation measures to reduce CO 2 emissions, it is projected that partial pressure of dissolved CO 2 (pCO 2) will increase up to 600 - 700 μatm by 2050 and up to 1000 μatm by 2100. At the same time, ocean surface pH is predicted to further drop by 0. 3 - 0. 4 units {{by the end of this}} century. OA is considered one of the most serious threat for marine organisms and ecosystems, and this topic was the most studied field of investigation between 2000 and 2013. Several quantitative reviews based on meta-analytic approaches allowed some generalizations on the sensitivity of marine species to elevated pCO 2 levels and lowered pH showing that OA expected for next decades would negatively affect survival, calcification, growth and development of a wide variety of taxa. Calcifying organisms are considered the most threatened group, as increase of hydrogen ions concentration may also determine the decrease of saturation states with respect to aragonite and calcite, two forms of calcium carbonate forms commonly used for building up organisms’ shells and skeletons. However, expected CO 2 levels in the ocean may also affect several biological processes of non-calcifying organisms. In the last decade, a growing number of studies focused on the impact of elevated CO 2 concentration on fish. The vast majority of these studies was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions and showed highly variable sensitivities among species, making difficult to reach some generalization on the possible future impact of this environmental change. The general aim of this thesis was to assess how elevated CO 2 may affect different biological processes of marine teleost fish through field-based and laboratory experiments. For this purpose, I investigated the response of tropical and temperate species during different life stages (from embryos to adults) and at different organization level (from individuals to community). The first aim of my thesis was to depict the state of the art on ocean acidification effects on fish worldwide. This goal was achieved through a quantitative review of papers published until June 2016 (chapter 2). Specifically, through a mixed-effects meta-analytic approach, I provide the first comprehensive global analysis of eco-physiological, developmental, and behavioural responses of fish to expected CO 2 levels in the near-future ocean. To assess if such responses may be mediated by fish characteristics, I evaluated the role of different life history traits (e. g. climatic zone, life stage, physiology, and habitat) in modifying fish sensitivity to OA. Results showed that, if anthropogenic CO 2 emissions continue to rise, significant effects of elevated CO 2 levels on fish mortality, calcification, and behavioural performances are expected to occur in the next decades, particularly for larvae. Some effects may be more subtle than expected, as mortality rates per se may be enhanced by observed decreasing growth of larvae and higher predation riskunder elevated CO 2. Despite some specific fish traits might mediate the responses of fish to OA (e. g. I found differences in behavioural impairments levels between tropical and temperate species), my analyses failed to find a single life history characteristic potentially confering fish tolerance to elevated CO 2. A strong need to expand the number of OA studies to multi-generational, multi-stressor and species interactions experiments is also discussed. The following three chapters dealt with the effects of OA on embryos, juveniles and adults of a temperate wrasse species (Symphodus ocellatus) living off a volcanic CO 2 seep site (Vulcano island, Italy). It has been widely demonstrated that fish reared at elevated CO 2 concentrations display severe behavioural disruptions, such as altered lateralization, increased activity rates, unability to recognize olfactory cues. These effects have been mainly investigated in laboratory conditions and only two studies evaluated the impact of OA on behaviour of fish chronically exposed to elevated CO 2 in the wild. Moreover, no previous studies focused on the possible effects of OA on fish reproductive behaviour. Chapter 3 provided the first evidence of the effects of ocean acidification on reproduction of fish in the wild. Specifically, I assessed how different CO 2 concentrations may alter key mating behaviours and spawning ability in a species with different typologies of breeding males (dominant nesting, satellite and sneaker S. ocellatus males). Results showed that dominant male mating behaviour was unaffected, as courtship and nest defence did not differ between sites under ambient and elevated CO 2 concentrations. However, dominant males experienced significantly lower rates of pair spawning at elevated CO 2 levels, despite maintaining a trend of higher paternity than sneaker and satellite males. The chapter 4 assessed the influence of increasing CO 2 concentrations on the metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) and the development of <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> early life stages. For this purpose, I ran translocational experiments in the field, by collecting embryos from nesting sites with different pCO 2 levels and transplanting embryos from ambient- to high-CO 2 sites for 30 h. Results showed that <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> offspring brooded in different CO 2 conditions had similar metabolic responses, but embryos from parents that spawned in ambient conditions had higher metabolic rates and a smaller size at hatching when transplanted in the high-CO 2 site. However, the adverse effects of increased CO 2 on metabolism and development did not occur when embryos from the high-CO 2 nesting site were exposed to ambient conditions, suggesting potential parental effects as offspring from the high-CO 2 nesting site could be resilient to a wider range of pCO 2 values than those belonging to the site with present-day pCO 2 levels. The chapter 5 focused on the ability of S. ocellatus recruits to recognize their predator under elevated CO 2. Several studies showed that fish exposed to CO 2 concentrations expected for the next decades are potentially more sensitive to predation, as they show bolder behaviour and appear to be attracted from cues they normally avoid. However, treatment with gabazine - a neuroreceptor GABA antagonist – restore the normal behaviour. These evidences have been described mostly through short-term laboratory trials on tropical fish species, whilst experiments on temperate fish from populations chronically exposed to elevated CO 2 in the field have been seldom carried out. I investigated whether recruits (i. e. settled larvae) of the <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> S. ocellatus from high CO 2 recruitment sites off a volcanic seep lost their ability to recognize the odour of a common predator. Results showed that fish, treated or untreated with gabazine, both from ambient and high CO 2 sites, displayed a similar avoidance of predator odour, suggesting that <b>ocellated</b> <b>wrasse</b> recruits could be tolerant to rising CO 2. This study adds on previous evidence that temperate fish species might exhibit higher resilience to OA than tropical species. The chapter 6 evaluated how short-term exposure to high CO 2 concentrations may influence the escape response and the shelter use under predation risk of juveniles of the tropical damselfish Chromis viridis. For this purpose, I ran two different experiments in aquaria, by measuring the escape response kinematic and the use of shelter of groups of damselfishes reared for 5 days under different CO 2 conditions (ambient and high CO 2 concentrations) in presence/absence of their predator, the black tip grouper Epinephelus fasciatus. Whereas high CO 2 had no effect on the escape performance of C. viridis, their use of shelter was significantly impaired, as juveniles reared at acidified conditions spent more time outside and ventured farther from the refuge than those reared at control conditions. The chapter 7 documented how OA may indirectly affect the composition and structure of fish communities via biogenic habitat shifts in CO 2 seeps off Japan. Many recent studies suggested that elevated CO 2 may affect the structural complexity of biogenic habitats, altering the species composition of the associated fauna and amplifying the indirect negative effects of OA on the biodiversity they support. By now, only two studies empirically estimated the indirect effects (via biogenic habitat change) of ocean acidification on fish assemblages, showing contrasting results. Long-term elevated CO 2 did not lead to changes in reef fish community composition and structure in Papua New Guinea, whereas community effects were recorded on temperate coastal fish assemblages in CO 2 seeps off Italy and New Zealand. Here, I coupled fish and benthic community surveys (complexity, canopy,...|$|E
