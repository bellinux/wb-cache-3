Packed volume measurements showed that mitochondrial volume was irreversibly increased by methomyl and BmT toxin indicating that mitochondria no longer functioned as differentially permeable <b>osmometers.</b> The decreased resistance of inner mitochondrial membranes to protons and the loss of osmotic volume regulation suggests that methomyl and BmT toxin induced the formation of hydrophilic pores in T mitochondrial inner membranes...|$|R
5000|$|A Clifton nanolitre <b>osmometer</b> is {{a device}} that allows the {{determination}} of the melting and freezing point of an aqueous solution using a sample size of only nanolitres. The device consists of a controller box, a cooling stage, and a sample holder. Additionally, various micrometer syringes, immersion oils and microscopes are required for its use.|$|E
50|$|The Clifton nanolitre <b>osmometer</b> is {{especially}} {{well suited for}} determining the antifreeze activity or thermal hysteresis of a solution, which is {{a difference in the}} melting and freezing point of a solution. This phenomenon arises when biological antifreeze proteins are present in a solution. Solutions that do not contain antifreeze proteins generally have identical freezing and melting points.|$|E

40|$|Jerry Nolfi, Barbara Caffery Toronto Eye Care Optometric Clinic, Toronto, ON, Canada Purpose: To {{compare the}} in vivo {{precision}} of two commercially available point-of-care <b>osmometers</b> among normal subjects with no dry eye disease. Methods: Twenty healthy adults with healthy ocular surfaces {{were evaluated by}} licensed eye care practitioners. All subjects had low Ocular Surface Disease Index score ( 10 seconds), and no evidence of corneal fluorescein staining. Five consecutive measurements of tear osmolarity were measured on each eye using {{each of the two}} osmo­meters: the TearLab Osmolarity System (TearLab) and the I-Med i-Pen (i-Pen), for a total of 200 measurements per device. Performance of the <b>osmometers</b> was determined by specificity, estimated by the percentage of osmolarity data at or below the clinical cutoff (308 mOsm/L) and precision, and represented by the standard deviation per subject. In addition, to assess analytical performance, on each day of patient testing, standardized osmolarity quality control solutions (338 mOsm/L) were tested on the TearLab per manufacturer instructions. i-Pen manufacturer instructions do not neither provide for, nor recommend quality control procedures. Results: The mean age of the 20 subjects was 27 ± 8 years (range: 19 – 48 years, 16 females, four males). Over 2 months of testing, the TearLab reported analytical performance on quality control solutions of 335. 8 ± 4. 2 mOsm/L with a coefficient of variation of 1. 3 %. In the subject cohort, 90. 9 % of TearLab measurements were in the normal range ≤ 308 mOsm/L. The i-Pen reported 37. 5 % of all measurements in the normal range. The average intra-subject osmolarity of the TearLab was 295. 4 ± 8. 6 mOsm/L, which was significantly lower and less variable than the i-Pen, which reported an average of 319. 4 ± 20. 3 mOsm/L (P< 0. 001). When the measurements were grouped by subject, the TearLab accurately identified 100 % of subjects as normal while the i-Pen accurately identified only 15 % of subjects as normal. Conclusion: In this randomized comparative study of two point-of-care <b>osmometers</b> among normal, healthy non-dry eye subjects, the TearLab Osmolarity System demonstrated accuracy, precision, and agreement with clinical interpretation in line with the manufacturer claims. The i-Pen lacked sufficient performance to delineate subjects with and without dry eye disease. Keywords: tear osmolarity, TearLab osmolarity system, i-Pen osmolarity, precisio...|$|R
40|$|Measurement of intrathylakoid aqueous volumes by {{electron}} spin resonance spectroscopy was used to study ionic permeability properties of thylakoid membranes isolated from Beta vulgaris L. and Avicennia germinans L. The thylakoids behaved as perfect <b>osmometers</b> {{in the presence of}} sorbitol and betaine. Thylakoids exposed to hypertonic solutions of NaCl and KCl shrank and subsequently swelled, requiring 10 minutes to regain their original volume. The initial influx rate calculated from the kinetics of changes in intrathylakoid volume in response to 450 millimolar gradients of NaCl and KCl was 2. 3 × 10 − 13 moles per square centimeter per second. These data show that the passive permeability to NaCl and KCl was low...|$|R

50|$|A typical {{vapor phase}} <b>osmometer</b> {{consists}} of: (1) two thermistors, {{one with a}} polymer-solvent solution droplet adhered to it and another with a pure solvent droplet adhered to it; (2) a thermostatted chamber with an interior saturated with solvent vapor; (3) a liquid solvent vessel in the chamber; and (4) an electric circuit to measure the bridge output imbalance {{difference between the two}} thermistors. The voltage difference is an accurate way of measuring the temperature difference between the two thermistors, which is a consequence of solvent vapor condensing on the solution droplet (the solution droplet has a lower vapor pressure than the solvent).|$|E
50|$|It is {{necessary}} to calibrate a vapor phase <b>osmometer</b> {{and it is important}} to note that K is found for a particular solvent, operational temperature, and type of commercial apparatus. A calibration can be carried out using a standard of known molecular weight. Some possible solvents for VPO include toluene, tetrahydrofuran, or chloroform. Once the experiment is performed, concentration and output voltage data can be graphed on a plot of (ΔV/c) versus c. The plot can be extrapolated to the y-axis in order to obtain the limit of (ΔV/c) as c approaches zero. The equation above can then be used to calculate K.|$|E
50|$|In {{a dynamic}} <b>osmometer</b> flow of solvent is {{measured}} and a counteracting pressure is created {{to stop the}} flow. Flow rate of the solvent {{is measured by the}} movement of an air bubble in a capillary tube of the solvent. The pressure of the solvent compartment is directly changed by raising or lowering a reservoir of solvent connected to the solvent compartment. The pressure difference between the two compartments is the osmotic pressure. This can be calculate by measuring the change in height or measured directly with a flexible diaphragm. Since the pressure is directly changed, an accurate measurement of osmotic pressure can be achieved in 10 - 30 minutes.|$|E
40|$|Human {{erythrocytes}} {{have been}} regarded as perfect <b>osmometers,</b> which swell or shrink as dictated by their osmotic environment. In contrast, in most other cells, swelling elicits a regulatory volume decrease (RVD) modulated by the activation of purinic and pyrimidinic receptors (P receptors). For human erythrocytes this modulation has not been tested, and we thus investigated whether P receptor activation can induce RVD in these cells. Further, because ectonucleotidases may scavenge ATP or ADP or act {{as a source for}} extracellular adenosine and therefore modulate P receptor activation and RVD, we also determined their activity in intact erythrocytes. We found relatively low ectoATPase but significant ectoADPase and ectoAMPase activities. When erythrocytes were exposed to hypotonic medium alone, they swelled as expected for an osmometric response and showed no RVD. Activation of P 2 receptors by exogenous ATP or ADP did not trigger RVD, whereas P 1 agonists adenosine and adenosine- 5 ′-N-ethylcarboxamide induced significant RVD. The effect of adenosine- 5 ′-N-ethylcarboxamide was dose-dependent (maximal RVD of 27 %; apparent K½ of 1. 6 ± 1. 7 μm). The RVD induced by adenosine was blocked 80 % with the non-selective P 1 antagonist 8 -(p-sulfophenyl theophylline) or the P 1 -A 2 B inhibitor MRS 1754, but not by inhibitors of P 1 subtypes A 1, A 2 A, and A 3. In addition, forskolin (an inducer of intracellular cAMP formation) could mimic the effect of adenosine, supporting the idea of P 1 -A 2 B receptor activation. In conclusion, we report a novel P 1 -A 2 B receptor-mediated RVD activation in mature human erythrocytes and thus indicate that these long held perfect <b>osmometers</b> are not so perfect after all...|$|R
40|$|The volume changes {{undergone}} by corn (Zea mays L.) mitochondria {{suspended in}} solutions of constant or varying osmolarity were studied.

The final equilibrium volume of mitochondria swollen in solutions containing both ribose and sucrose were shown to depend upon the concentration of impermeable solute (sucrose) present and not upon the concentration of ribose present. Osmotic reversibility was found for mitochondria swollen in isotonic solutions of KCI or ribose.

50|$|Thermal {{hysteresis}} {{is easily}} {{measured in the}} lab with a nanolitre <b>osmometer.</b> Organisms differ in their values of thermal hysteresis. The maximum level of thermal hysteresis shown by fish AFP is approximately -1.5 °C (29.3 °F). However, insect antifreeze proteins are 10-30 times more active than fish proteins. This difference probably reflects the lower temperatures encountered by insects on land. In contrast, aquatic organisms are exposed only to -1 to -2 °C below freezing. During the extreme winter months, the spruce budworm resists freezing at temperatures approaching -30 °C. The Alaskan beetle Upis ceramboides can survive in a temperature of -60 °C by using antifreeze agents that are not proteins.|$|E

Changes in cell volume induced by small step changes in external osmolality were followed photometrically {{and the time}} constant for the exponential approach of cell volume to its new equilibrium value was determined. Hydraulic conductivity (LP) was calculated from the time constant and was 1. 41 X 10 (- 6) cm atm- 1 s- 1 under isotonic conditions at 37 degrees C.

40|$|Using unfertilized eggs of Arbacia punctulata {{as natural}} <b>osmometers</b> an attempt {{has been made}} to account for the course of {{swelling}} and shrinking of these cells in anisotonic solutions by means of the laws governing osmosis and diffusion. The method employed has been to compute permeability of the cell to water, as measured by the rate of volume change per unit of cell surface per unit of osmotic pressure outstanding between the cell and its medium. Permeability to water as here defined and as somewhat differently defined by Northrop is approximately constant during swelling and shrinking, at least for the first several minutes of these processes. Permeability is found to be independent of the osmotic pressure of the solution in which cells are swelling. Water is found to leave cells more readily than it enters, that is, permeability is greater during exosmosis than during endosmosis...|$|R
