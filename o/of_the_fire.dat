50|$|From the 4-6 March, {{favourable}} conditions including cooler {{temperatures and}} rain, enabled fire crews to contain and control many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fires,</b> including <b>the</b> major <b>fires</b> that started on 7 February.

5|$|At {{the peak}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> nearly 2,000 firefighters were {{assigned}} to the incident. Approximately 19 residents lost power as Southern California Edison was forced to shut down transmission lines that passed through the fire ground.|$|E
5000|$|The finish is {{determined}} by how the potter controls <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> takes place in traditional climbing kilns with various chambers called noborigama, or in a tunnel kiln called an anagama. The vessels are stacked and the flames flow through the stacks and around the individual vessels. During <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing,</b> <b>the</b> vessels can change colour from black to grey.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>firing</b> time {{results from}} the message {{staggering}} delay and corresponds to the interval where the transceiver is enabled and the nodes are allowed to transmit their synchronization messages. In our test application, this interval is also called part 1 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> time and equals <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> 50 [*] milliseconds. The consumed current during this time is about 20 [*]mA. Note that there exists an interval between <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> time and <b>the</b> period end which acts as a safety margin in the case a node starts a transmission exactly at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> time. If so, the transceiver must be enabled {{as long as the}} transmission continuous. This safety margin is further named part 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> time and consumes a current of 24 [*]mA.|$|R

5|$|Diodorus Siculus (c.a. 90 BC–c.a. 30 BC), another Greek writer, {{wrote in}} Book IV of his Bibliotheca Historica that the Campanian plain was called fiery (Phlegrean) {{because of the}} peak, Vesuvius, which had spouted flames like Etna and showed signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> that had burnt in ancient history.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> {{was determined to be}} electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E

5000|$|In some cases, all but {{one member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> squad may be issued a weapon {{containing}} a blank cartridge. Sometimes {{all but one}} member have live rounds. No member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> squad is told beforehand if he is using live ammunition. This is believed to reinforce <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> diffusion <b>of</b> responsibility among <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> squad members. This diffusion <b>of</b> responsibility makes <b>the</b> execution process more reliable because the members {{are more likely to}} aim to kill if they are not entirely blamed for it, or if there is a chance they did not <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> lethal shot. It also allows each member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> squad to believe afterwards that he did not personally fire a fatal shot—for this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the [...] "conscience round".|$|R
5|$|Seattle {{achieved}} sufficient {{economic success}} {{that when the}} Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district, a far grander city-center rapidly emerged in its place.

5|$|The {{intensity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> fed by pure oxygen {{caused the}} pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fire).</b> Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E
