40|$|Using {{a unique}} and {{comprehensive}} data set on the two largest economies of the Eurozone - France and Germany - this paper first proceeds to a computation of the Gordy formula relaxing the ad hoc sizedependent constraints of the Basel formulas. Our study contributes to Article 501 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requesting analysis of the consistency of <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> <b>requirements</b> with the riskiness of SME. In both the French and the German sample, {{results suggest that the}} relative differences between the capital requirements for large corporates and those for SME (in other words the capital relief for SME) are lower in the Basel III framework than implied by empirically estimated asset correlations. Results show that the SME Supporting Factor in the CRR/CRD IV is able to compensate the difference between estimated and CRR/CRD IV capital requirements for loans in the corporate portfolio. However, no empirical evidence is found supporting the 2 ̆ 0 ac 1. 5 mln SME threshold currently included in Article 501 (CRR) ...|$|E

50|$|There is a {{challenge}} regarding both Pillar I and Pillar II. Significant changes are underway {{with the introduction of}} Solvency II. Both for pillar I, quantitative requirements, and pillar II, internal control requirements, a real revolution is taking place at the European level and this will have considerable repercussions on the French market. Certain specialised French mutual insurance companies could find themselves facing an <b>own</b> <b>funds</b> <b>requirement</b> that is often five to ten times higher than the current requirement. The introduction and effective follow-up of a well-structured internal control system will pose problems for all small structures (in terms of cost and internal expertise). ROAM, which has been involved in this process since the project’s inception, defends its members position by contributing to the consultation process on an on-going basis and also by directly lobbying the European authorities.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of household mutual fund assets was held through professional financial advisers. At year-end 2007, 56 percent of household mutual fund assets were held through professional financial advisers. Twenty-four percent of household mutual fund assets were held through defined contribution (DC) plans, and 14 percent directly with mutual fund companies. The remaining 6 percent were held through discount brokers and mutual fund supermarkets. Most households that <b>owned</b> mutual <b>funds</b> outside DC retirement plans held funds through a professional financial adviser. More {{than three-quarters of}} mutual fund–owning households <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> outside DC retirement plans. Eighty percent of those households <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> purchased through a professional financial adviser.

Fifty-five percent of households that <b>owned</b> mutual <b>funds</b> outside DC plans <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> purchased through a full-service broker, and nearly half <b>owned</b> <b>funds</b> purchased through an independent financial planner.
