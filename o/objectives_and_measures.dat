40|$|Crowding {{in public}} {{transport}} {{is becoming a}} growing concern as demand grows {{at a rate that}} is outstripping available capacity. To capture the user benefits associated with reduced crowding from improved public transport, it is necessary to identify the relevant dimensions of crowding that are meaning ful measures of what crowding means to travelers. There are a number of <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> of crowding promoted in the literature, with some objective measures being used as the basis of a standard of acceptable levels of practice.

40|$|Objective {{measures}} of performance are seldom perfect. In response, incentive contracts often include important subjective components that mitigate incentive distortions caused by imperfect objective measures. This paper explores the combined use of subjective <b>and</b> <b>objective</b> performance <b>measures</b> in (respectively) implicit and explicit incentive contracts. Naturally, <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> often are substitutes, sometimes strikingly so: {{we show that}} if objective measures are sufficiently close to perfect then no implicit contracts are feasible (because the firm's fallback position after reneging on an implicit contact is too attractive). We also show, however, that <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> can reinforce each other: if objective measures become more accurate then in some circumstances the optimal contract puts more weight on subjective measures (because the improved objective measures increase {{the value of the}} ongoing relationship, and so reduce the firm's incentive to renege). We also analyze the use of subjective weights on <b>objective</b> performance <b>measures,</b> <b>and</b> provide case-study evidence consistent with our analyses. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{intent of}} the paper is to {{identify}} the main <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> that will contribute to build a model of performance measurement system using balanced scorecard (BSC) for private (for-profit) hospitals in Shanghai. Design/methodology/approach: The design and methodology {{of this paper is}} based on an extensive literature review on the applications of balanced scorecard in various healthcare organizations. The primary research was carried out in three private hospitals in Shanghai. The research and data collection was done by interviews/discussions/surveys with the Senior Executives, doctors & staff of these hospitals and the residents of Shanghai. Based on the findings an adaptation of Balanced score card is suggested for the private hospitals in Shanghai. Findings: The literature review reveals that balanced scorecard was found effective for performance improvement in healthcare sector. The secondary research and the primary research conducted in Chinese private hospitals explore various performance <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> used by these hospitals. The outcome of the research identifies the need for adopting a Balanced scorecard system in the private hospitals of Shanghai and reveals the need for aligning the vision of the hospitals to their operational strategies.

40|$|Conclusions. A {{paradoxical}} {{relationship between}} <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> of nasal obstruction exists in participants {{not exposed to}} any treatment. The sensation of nasal obstruction {{may be due to}} the amalgamation of many different nasal sensations. Improved methods for measuring nasal sensations are required to further investigate the relationship between <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> of nasal obstruction. Objectives. In a recent study it was shown that the subjective sensation of nasal patency increased as the nasal passages became objectively more obstructed in patients who received a placebo compared to those who received an oral decongestant. This paradoxical response may be explained as a placebo effect, i. e. patients who received a placebo may have expected to feel less obstructed. The aim of the present study was to investigate this interesting paradox by determining <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> of nasal obstruction over time in participants not exposed to any treatment. Material and methods. A total of 60 healthy participants with common cold were recruited. <b>Objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> of nasal obstruction were recorded at baseline and at 1 and 2 h using posterior rhinomanometry and a visual analogue scale. Results. Objective measures demonstrated an increase in nasal obstruction over time for both nasal passages considered together and for individual nasal passages. Subjective measures demonstrated a sensation of decreased nasal obstruction over time for both nasal passages considered together and for individual nasal passages...|$|R

40|$|The use of accelerometers to objectively measure {{physical}} activity (PA) volume {{does not account}} for inter-individual differences in body mass or cardiorespiratory fitness among adults, which may contribute to the commonly observed discrepancies between <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>measures</b> of PA.

The second study demonstrated that current accelerometer threshold values used to measure durations of PA may not correspond to the appropriate respective relative intensity of PA after accounting for maximal oxygen consumption by sex and body mass index categories in 828 adults.
