30|$|Human skin has {{an ability}} to stretch greatly with body movements. Generally, a wearer also expects {{to see the same}} {{attitude}} from their clothing (Ozdil 2008). However, the denim fabric is wrinkled since it does not have stretchable fiber component. It is a heavy weight fabric compared to <b>other</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Instead of using the unbleached weft roll, one way to give successful stretchability to the denim fabric as a way to prevent wrinkles, is by the use of cotton yarn and spandex yarn by turns or, a second way, is by using a cotton/polyester blended spun yarn. However, even though the denim fabric that used cotton yarn and spandex yarn by turns has a relatively good stretchability, there have been issues due to the denim fabric’s uneven surface because the spandex yarn is of a fine sized yarn compared to the cotton yarn. In addition, {{in the case of the}} cotton/polyester blended spun yarn, it has been found that stretch and fabric lightweight improvement is needed to meet consumers’ needs. Recently, a core spun yarn is used as the weft yarn in order to give the denim fabric stretch (Ozdil 2008). The core spun yarn has stretchability with a feel of cotton because it has spandex as its core yarn and it is wrapped by cotton yarn.|$|E
30|$|The {{backrest}} or whip roller {{is one of}} {{the most}} important parts of a weaving machine, and lengthwise yarn of the fabric known as warp yarn passes over the backrest. One of the main functions of the backrest oscillation is to compensate variation in warp tension as they are unwound from the weaver’s beam during each weaving cycle of the loom. This tension can not be kept constant during the process and also during each weaving cycle of the loom. But due to have a very negligible difference among the tensions of each loom cycle, an average value of tension is maintained throughout the weaving process in factory. If this tension is kept at a constant then the fabrics will be woven with minimum number of warp breakages yielding a better loom efficiency and higher quality. The correct selection of the backrest of a loom is vital in producing high quality woven fabric. Adjustments to the positioning of the backrest, its type are inevitable when the performance of the weaving machine can no longer be tolerated with standard settings for low weft density, high weft density, and extra heavy fabrics. Vary in fabric density is a crucial especially in technical textiles and smart textiles (Fernando 2014). Denim fabrics have developed into a part of the garment fashion since the ninetieth century. Most consumers around the world prefer cotton apparel; in particular, they enjoy wearing denim. The success of denim is due to its ability to change with every social and cultural evolution (Card et al. 2006). According to Textile terms and definition published by Textile Institute Denim is traditionally a 3 / 1 warp faced twill fabric made from yarn dyed warp and undyed weft yarn. As denim is one type of woven fabric so it is obvious that like <b>other</b> <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics,</b> properties of denim is also affected by position of whip roller.|$|E

Thus, connected deformations are closely related to the stretch potential and influence multilayer <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> draping and fitting of the garment.
