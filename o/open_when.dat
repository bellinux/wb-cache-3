5|$|Footage of the {{exterior}} {{steps of the}} library was filmed several months after production had been completed.

5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} stem length of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only <b>open</b> <b>when</b> they reach the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E

5|$|In March, Lee {{lost in the}} All England <b>Open</b> <b>when</b> {{he bowed}} out {{in the second game}} after {{receiving}} medical help on three occasions. This also dashed Lee's hopes of becoming the first man to win three successive All England Open titles. In April, he was defeated by South Korean Shon Wan-ho in the final of the India Open, but retained his Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title for the fourth time in a row in May. Lee was out for three to four weeks after suffering an ankle injury during the Thomas Cup Group C tie against Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is open year-round, {{although}} snow sometimes {{blocks the}} road to the park, and the visitor center is <b>open</b> <b>when</b> the cave is open for tours. Cave tours are usually offered from mid-April to early November, but the schedule depends in spring and fall on weather conditions. The Illinois Valley Visitor Center in Cave Junction, managed by the IVCDO under an NPS contract, also has information about the cave.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{are also}} {{released}} spontaneously {{in the absence}} of fire. The degree to which B.serrata trees exhibit bradyspory seems to depend {{on the nature of the}} site where they grow.

Follicles also <b>open</b> <b>when</b> part of the tree dies.|$|E

5|$|Swede Björn Borg won the {{majority}} of the tournaments {{in the early years of}} the Open era. He won consecutive titles in 1974 and 1975, before winning four successive titles from 1978 to 1981. Yannick Noah became the first Frenchman to win the event since 1946, when he won in 1983. Ivan Lendl won his first title in 1984, before losing the following year to Wilander in the final and won two consecutive titles in 1986 and 1987. Michael Chang became the youngest man to win the French <b>Open</b> <b>when</b> he beat Stefan Edberg in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In Pittsburgh, Leonard Betts (Paul McCrane), an EMT paramedic, is decapitated {{when his}} {{ambulance}} collides with a truck. Later, at the morgue, his headless body leaves its cold chamber, knocks out the attendant, steals his clothes, and escapes. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) visit the morgue, where they find Betts's {{head in a}} medical waste dumpster. Scully attempts a cranial examination, but the head's eyes and mouth both suddenly <b>open</b> <b>when</b> she begins the procedure. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to Betts's apartment, where he finds the attendant's discarded clothes. When Mulder leaves, Betts—who has regrown his head—rises out of his iodine-filled bathtub.|$|E
5|$|Springbok {{are mainly}} active around dawn and dusk. Activity is {{influenced}} by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest {{in the shade of}} trees or bushes, and often bed down in the <b>open</b> <b>when</b> weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok {{is similar to that of}} Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{closure of}} the border had a {{substantial}} economic and social impact on both halves of Germany. Cross-border transport links were largely severed; 10 main railway lines, 24secondary lines, 23autobahns or national roads, 140regional roads and thousands of smaller roads, paths and waterways were blocked or otherwise interrupted. The tightest level of closure came in 1966, by which time only six railway lines, three autobahns, one regional road and two waterways were left <b>open.</b> <b>When</b> {{relations between the two}} states eased in the 1970s, the GDR agreed to open more crossing points in exchange for economic assistance. Telephone and mail communications operated throughout the Cold War, although packages and letters were routinely opened and telephone calls were monitored by the East German secret police.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but <b>open</b> <b>when</b> she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic {{would then}} suffer his own {{thrashing}} {{at the hands}} of Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals of the French <b>Open,</b> <b>when</b> he lost in straight sets, including losing the third set 6-0, his first bagel at a grand slam tournament since 2005. This further emphasised that Djokovic was still very far from his best form. Following this loss, he fell to world No.4, his lowest ranking since October 2009 and his first time outside the top two of the rankings since March 2011. In contrast, Nadal breezed through to the French Open final without dropping a set, including a third round match where he only lost one game. Murray, meanwhile, bounced back from his recent poor form by reaching the semi-finals, but lost to Stan Wawrinka in a five-set epic. Nadal then defeated Wawrinka in the final to become the first player in the Open Era to win ten titles at a single slam. This win also ended a three-year drought of slam titles for the Spaniard, his last title coming at the French Open in 2014. Following the win, Nadal returned to world No. 2, his highest ranking since October 2014.|$|E

Tamwar feels he {{is not good enough}} for Afia in Yusef's eyes as he is from a poor background, but Yusef says that does not matter and approves of Tamwar. After Tamwar mentions his mother Zainab Masood's name, Yusef visits the Masood home and finds the door <b>open.</b> <b>When</b> Zainab sees him, she screams and orders him out. It is revealed they were husband and wife from an arranged marriage when Yusef was 17, and Yusef's family had poured oil on her and set her on fire. Yusef says it was his family, not him, and he attempted to save her, revealing bad scarring on his body. Tamwar's father Masood Ahmed, Tamwar and Afia return home, and Masood attacks Yusef, punching him twice. After Yusef returns, Tamwar asks Masood to speak to Yusef, and when he visits, he finds out Tamwar and Afia are still seeing each other. He gives his blessing for them to be married.|$|E
