25|$|The little theatre {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of interest among local playwrights inasmuch as Glaum had received some 15 plays by January 27. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> was Eulalia Andreas's A Friendly Divorce, which went into rehearsal with Johnstone White directing. Noted stars were lured to perform. In March 1935, Glaum and Betty Blythe, another star of the silent screen, starred in Angel Cake, which was written by Ansella Hunter, who had three plays staged by the Shuberts.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} ancient city itself, archaeologists have been {{interested}} in a vast necropolis, which spreads on three sides around Phanagoria. There are thousands of burials, many with cypress or marble sarcophagi — an indication of the well-being of the ancient Phanagorians. Excavations conducted in the 19th century were for the most part amateurish; as many as twelve kurgans would be razed each season. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> finds were unearthed in the 1860s at the Bolshaya Bliznitsa tumulus, classed by Michael Rostovtzeff as a feminine necropolis with three vaults.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> {{properties}} of azobenzene (and derivatives) is the photoisomerization of trans and cis isomers. The two isomers can be switched with particular wavelengths of light: ultraviolet light, which {{corresponds to the}} energy gap of the π-π* (S2 state) transition, for trans-to-cis conversion, and blue light, which is equivalent {{to that of the}} n-π* (S1 state) transition, for cis-to-trans isomerization. For a variety of reasons, the cis isomer is less stable than the trans (for instance, it has a distorted configuration and is less delocalized than the trans configuration). The trans isomer is more stable by approximately 50 kJ/mol, and the barrier to isomerization in the ground state is approximately 100 kJ/mol.|$|E
25|$|The first Serb {{authors who}} {{appeared}} after World War II were Mihailo Lalić and Dobrica Ćosić. Other famous post-war Yugoslav authors were Ivo Andrić and Meša Selimović, {{both of whom}} identified as Serbs. Andrić {{went on to win}} the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1961. Danilo Kiš, another popular Serbian writer, was known for writing A Tomb for Boris Davidovich, as well as several acclaimed novels. Amongst contemporary Serbian writers, Milorad Pavić stands out as being the most critically acclaimed, with his novels Dictionary of the Khazars, Landscape Painted with Tea and The Inner Side of the Wind bringing him international recognition. Highly revered in Europe and in South America, Pavić is considered one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> writers from the beginning of the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Although the Eskayan lexicon bears {{a marked}} Spanish influence, the loan-patterns {{are hard to}} map. Some Spanish words {{appear to have been}} {{directly}} borrowed into Eskayan with virtually no semantic or phonetic alterations. E.g., the Eskayan word merido, meaning ‘husband’, is evidently loaned from the Spanish marido, also meaning ‘husband’. Others retain {{only a few of the}} semantic properties of the original. E.g., the word astro means ‘sun’ in Eskayan but ‘star’ in Spanish. In some interesting cases Eskayan lexical items appear to be borrowed but are assigned new meanings entirely. E.g., the Eskayan memorya (‘sky’) does not coincide semantically with the Spanish memoria (‘memory’). One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> examples of such an ‘interrupted loan’ is that of the Eskayan tre (‘two’) seemingly derived from the Spanish tres (‘three’). Here the semantic property of ‘number’ was retained but the actual quantity it represented was reassigned.|$|E

25|$|In medieval China, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> naturalists was Shen Kuo (1031–1095), a polymath {{personality}} who {{dabbled in}} many {{fields of study}} in his age. In terms of geology, Shen Kuo {{is one of the}} first naturalists to have formulated a theory of geomorphology. This was based on his observations of sedimentary uplift, soil erosion, deposition of silt, and marine fossils found in the Taihang Mountains, located hundreds of miles from the Pacific Ocean. He also formulated a theory of gradual climate change, after his observation of ancient petrified bamboos found in a preserved state underground near Yanzhou (modern Yan'an), in the dry northern climate of Shaanxi province. He formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> {{evidence}} of early domestication {{comes from the}} Botai culture, found in northern Kazakhstan. The Botai culture was a culture of foragers {{who seem to have}} adopted horseback riding in order to hunt the abundant wild horses of northern Kazakhstan between 3500–3000 BCE. Botai sites had no cattle or sheep bones; the only domesticated animals, in addition to horses, were dogs. Botai settlements in this period contained between 50–150 pit houses. Garbage deposits contained tens to hundreds of thousands of discarded animal bones, 65% to 99% of which had come from horses. Also, there has been evidence found of horse milking at these sites, with horse milk fats soaked into pottery shards dating to 3500 BCE. Earlier hunter-gatherers who lived in the same region had not hunted wild horses with such success, and lived for millennia in smaller, more shifting settlements, often containing less than 200 wild animal bones.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by {{the real-life}} {{case of the}} Gainesville Ripper, Scream was {{influenced}} by Williamson's passion for horror films, especially Halloween (1978). The script, originally titled Scary Movie, was bought by Dimension Films and was retitled by the Weinstein Brothers just before filming was complete. The production faced censorship issues with the Motion Picture Association of America and obstacles from locals while filming on location. The film went on to financial and critical acclaim, earning $173million worldwide, and became the highest-grossing slasher film in the US in unadjusted dollars. It received several awards and award nominations. The soundtrack by Marco Beltrami was also acclaimed, and was cited as [...] " [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> horror scores composed in years".

Scream marked {{a change in the}} genre as it cast already-established and successful actors, which was considered to have helped it find a wider audience, including a significant female viewership.|$|E
500|$|The precise {{nature of}} Hanoi's {{strategic}} goal at Khe Sanh {{is regarded as}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>intriguing</b> unanswered questions of the Vietnam War. According to Gordon Rottman, even the North Vietnamese official history, Victory in Vietnam, is largely silent on the issue. This question, known among American historians as the [...] "riddle of Khe Sanh" [...] has been summed up by John Prados and Ray Stubbe: [...] "Either the Tet Offensive was a diversion intended to facilitate NVA/NLF preparations for a war-winning battle at Khe Sanh, or Khe Sanh was a diversion to mesmerize Westmoreland {{in the days before}} Tet." [...] In assessing North Vietnamese intentions, Peter Brush cites the Vietnamese theater commander, Vo Nguyen Giap's claim [...] "that Khe Sanh itself was not of importance, but only a diversion to draw U.S. forces away from the populated areas of South Vietnam". This has led other observers to conclude that the siege served a wider NVA strategy; it diverted 30,000 US troops away from the cities that were the main targets of the Tet Offensive.|$|E
