5|$|A 2017 {{study by}} Thomas D. Carr, David J. Varricchio et al found that tyrannosaurs had large, flat scales on their snouts. At {{the center of}} these scales were small, keratinised patches. In crocodilians, such patches cover dense bundles of nerve fibers that pick-up {{vibrations}} and pressure changes. They proposed that tyrannosaurs probably also possessed such bundles <b>of</b> <b>sensitive</b> nerve fibers and may have used them to identify objects, measure the temperature of their nests and to pick-up eggs and hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|At the Jock River, {{southwest}} of Barrhaven, deposits <b>of</b> <b>sensitive</b> leda clay presented {{a challenge in}} designing the crossing for the freeway {{as well as the}} Canadian National Railway overpass to the north. It was feared that the weight of these structures could destabilize the clay deposits beneath and lead to landslides. In place of the standard heavier aggregate, lighter blast furnace slag, at half the weight, was substituted.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory {{agents had}} only {{managed to find}} {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>sensitive</b> documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E

It {{is important to note}} here that healthcare data consist of lots <b>of</b> patient <b>sensitive</b> data, so privacy and protection <b>of</b> individual’s <b>sensitive</b> data are essential; otherwise, personal data can be misused without permission.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} to the incident, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and USAF conducted an investigation, the results of which were released on 19 October 2007. The investigation concluded that nuclear weapons handling standards and procedures had not been followed by numerous USAF personnel involved in the incident. As a result, four USAF commanders were relieved of their commands, numerous other USAF personnel were disciplined or decertified to perform certain types <b>of</b> <b>sensitive</b> duties, and further cruise missile transport missions from—and nuclear weapons operations at—Minot Air Force Base were suspended. In addition, the USAF issued new nuclear weapons handling instructions and procedures.|$|E

The identity of titanium species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack <b>of</b> <b>sensitive</b> spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of titanium.|$|E

Device Guard is designed to protect against zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself.|$|E

Although Watts' faith in the group is shaken when he discovers their responsibility for a deadly viral outbreak, he is reluctant to leave and fights Black's attempts to sabotage and expose the group's work. He convinces Emma Hollis to join the group, using a potential cure for her father's illness as leverage. After Watts leaks a folder <b>of</b> <b>sensitive</b> group documents to Black to aid his crusade, he is attacked in his home by an assassin from the group and presumed dead.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} issue of fair {{allocation}} of excess network bandwidth between congestion sensitive and insensitive flows in an Assured Forwarding traffic class. In {{the absence of any}} mechanism to distinguish between out-ofprofile traffic <b>of</b> congestion <b>sensitive</b> and insensitive flows, congestion insensitive flows will get most of the excess network bandwidth. However, if out-of-profile packets <b>of</b> congestion <b>sensitive</b> and insensitive flows are 'colored' differently, network can be configured so as to give better treatment to excess packets <b>of</b> congestion <b>sensitive</b> flows and achieve fair allocation of excess network bandwidth. With a view to clearly distinguish between out-of-profile packets <b>of</b> congestion <b>sensitive</b> and insensitive flows, three levels of drop precedence are required. However, if the network operates close to its capacity, three levels of drop precedence are redundant as there is not much excess bandwidth to be shared...|$|R
5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the computer can view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion <b>of</b> <b>sensitive</b> information.|$|E
