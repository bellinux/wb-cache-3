5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the war was}} {{entering}} its final stages, the squadron still had to watch for anti-aircraft artillery. The fighter squadrons continued to make advances until February, {{while waiting for the}} Canadian push through the Reichwald. Although there was some aerial fighting, the major conflict with the Luftwaffe <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Canadians started to cross the Rhine on 24 March 1945.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{transplant}} rejection <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> host rejects <b>the</b> graft, GvHD <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> graft {{rejects the}} host. The underlying principle (alloimmunity) is the same, but {{the details and}} course may differ.|$|R
50|$|Under {{excess load}} conditions, {{the system can}} be {{designed}} to fail gracefully rather than all at once. Brownouts <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> supply power drops below <b>the</b> demand. Blackouts <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> supply fails completely.|$|R
50|$|Bernard Weiner {{proposed}} {{a detailed account}} of the attributional approach to learned helplessness. His attribution theory includes the dimensions of globality/specificity, stability/instability, and internality/externality. A global attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual believes that the cause of negative events is consistent across different contexts. A specific attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual believes that the cause of a negative event is unique to a particular situation. A stable attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual believes the cause to be consistent across time. Unstable attribution <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> individual thinks that the cause is specific to one point in time. An external attribution assigns causality to situational or external factors, while an internal attribution assigns causality to factors within the person.|$|R
5|$|Another major {{infusion}} of Arabian horses into Europe <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Turks sent 300,000 horsemen into Hungary in 1522, {{many of whom}} were mounted on pure-blooded Arabians, captured during raids into Arabia. By 1529, the Ottomans reached Vienna, where they were stopped by the Polish and Hungarian armies, who captured these horses from the defeated Ottoman cavalry. Some of these animals provided foundation bloodstock for the major studs of eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} years, the Centre Democrats {{received}} extensive media attention on two occasions. The first <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Centre Democrats and Centre Party met on 29 March 1986 in Kedichem. A group of anti-fascist activists {{believed that the}} two parties were planning to merge, and firebombed the hotel where the meeting was held. The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape the conflagration.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{their name}} {{was changed to}} the Special Boat Squadron and in 1980 the SBS relinquished North Sea oil rig {{protection}} to Comacchio Company. In 1982, after the Argentinian invasion of the Falkland Islands, they deployed to South Georgia. The only losses to the SBS during the Falklands War <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> SBS and SAS were operating behind the lines and {{two members of the}} SBS were shot by an SAS patrol, who had mistaken them for Argentinians.|$|E
25|$|As {{observed}} {{from the}} Earth, a solar eclipse <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon passes {{in front of}} the Sun. The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Earth intersects the umbra portion of <b>the</b> Moon's shadow. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> viewer is inside the penumbra.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Comparison of {{minimum and}} maximum {{apparent}} sizes of the Sun and Moon (and planets). An annular eclipse can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun has a larger apparent size than the Moon, whereas a total eclipse can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon has a larger apparent size.|$|R
50|$|Dosage-mediated {{suppression}} <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{suppression of}} the mutant phenotype is mediated by the over expression of a second suppressor gene. This can <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> initial mutations destabilise a protein-protein interaction and over expression of the interacting protein bypass the negative effect of the initial mutation.|$|R
5|$|In early 1920, {{the first}} Jewish-Arab {{dispute over the}} Wall <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Muslim {{authorities}} were carrying out minor repair works to the Wallâ€™s upper courses. The Jews, while agreeing that the works were necessary, appealed to the British that they be made under supervision of the newly formed Department of Antiquities, because the Wall was an ancient relic.|$|E
5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E
5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.|$|E
30|$|Accidents {{frequently}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{weather is}} clear.|$|R
50|$|In Slavic, Baltic, and Hungarian folklore, it is {{said that}} hiccups <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> person {{experiencing}} them is being talked about by someone not present. In Indian, Nepalese, and Arabic folklore, they are similarly said to <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> person experiencing them is being thought of by somebody close.|$|R
50|$|An {{aspect of}} VP-ellipsis {{that has been}} the subject of much {{theoretical}} analysis <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ellipsis appears to be contained inside its antecedent. The phenomenon is called antecedent-contained ellipsis or antecedent-contained deletion. Canonical cases of antecedent-contained ellipsis <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ellipsis appears inside a quantified object NP, e.g.|$|R
5|$|Mycena nargan {{has a very}} {{distinct}} appearance, and {{is unlikely}} to be mistaken for other Mycenas. However, one noted unintentional misidentification <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> M.nargan on the cover photograph of Bruce A. Fuhrer's 2005 book A Field Guide to Australian Fungi was labelled as Mycena nivalis, a species with a white cap.|$|E
5|$|The first naval {{operation}} {{of the war was}} in support of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force during the occupation of German New Guinea. The naval portion of the force included the Australia, Melbourne, Sydney, Warrego, Encounter, and submarine AE1. The only loss during the New Guinea Campaign <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> AE1 disappeared on 14 September 1914, taking three officers and 32 men with it.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{start of}} the expedition <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> crew docked to the station on 2 November 2000, aboard the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-31, which had launched two days earlier. During their mission, the Expedition 1 crew activated various systems on board the station, unpacked equipment that had been delivered, and hosted three visiting Space Shuttle crews and two unmanned Russian Progress resupply vehicles. The crew was very busy throughout the mission, which was declared a success.|$|E
5000|$|In words, <b>the</b> {{convergent}} case <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{demand curve}} is more elastic than the supply curve, at the equilibrium point. <b>The</b> divergent case <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> supply curve is more elastic than the demand curve, at the equilibrium point (see Kaldor, 1934, page 135, propositions (i) and (ii).) ...|$|R
30|$|Complete {{failures}} <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{developers are}} unable to identify any design problem with Organic and do not try again. Partial failures <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> developer gives up from using Organicâ€™s functionalities before identifying any design problem and tries to achieve this in another way. Finally, temporary failures <b>occur</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> developer temporarily interrupts the identification of design problems with Organic due to some communicability issue. According to the CEM, there are three types of temporary failures: (1) trying to communicate, (2) trying to fix an error, and (3) {{trying to understand the}} rules.|$|R

5|$|After the {{evacuation}} signal was given, the buses began {{to pick up}} passengers and head to the DAO Compound. The system worked so efficiently that the buses {{were able to make}} three return journeys rather than the expected one. The biggest problem <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ARVN guarding the main gate at Tan Son Nhut refused to allow the last convoy of buses into the DAO Compound at about 17:45. As this was happening, a firefight between two ARVN units broke out and caught the rearmost buses in the crossfire, disabling two of the vehicles. Eventually the ARVN commander controlling the gates agreed to permit the remaining buses to enter the compound. General Carey's threat to use the AH-1J SeaCobra helicopter gunships flying overhead may {{have played a role in}} the ARVN commander's decision.|$|E
5|$|An early {{triumph for}} the Bristol Old Vic <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> 1954 premiÃ¨re {{production}} of Salad Days {{transferred to the}} West End and became the longest-running musical on the London stage at that time. The Arts Council remained involved until 1963 when their role {{was taken over by}} the City Council. In the same year the London Old Vic was disbanded and the Bristol company became fully independent. The Bristol Old Vic also put plays on in the council-owned Little Theatre from then until 1980.|$|E
5|$|As in most Mario series games, {{the main}} protagonist is Mario, whose initial {{goal is to}} rescue Princess Peach (Toadstool) from Bowser. However, the story takes on an unusual and very {{important}} twist. Soon {{after the start of}} his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Smithy Gang arrived. The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy, a robotic blacksmith from an alternate dimension with aspirations of world domination.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145Â° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon crossed it.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at Bangui, diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Many navvies {{had been}} farm labourers from the Yorkshire Dales, North East England and the Fens, or {{had come for}} work from Scotland and Ireland. Drunkenness and {{fighting}} was such that Jos Midgeley, a railway police inspector, was hired for Â£1.25 per week to keep order. At one time he was attacked {{by a group of}} men, and at Wescoe Hill, two miles away {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wharfe, a riot <b>occurred</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> contractors tried to cut off the beer supply to keep the men sober enough to work.|$|E
50|$|ATN may be {{classified}} as either toxic or ischemic. Toxic ATN <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tubular cells are exposed to a toxic substance (nephrotoxic ATN). Ischemic ATN <b>occurs</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tubular cells do not get enough oxygen, a condition that they are highly sensitive and susceptible to, due to their very high metabolism.|$|R
