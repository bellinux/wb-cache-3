40|$|The {{traditional}} substantive {{framework of}} the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law has been challenged by recent developments involving non-state actors. This dissertation considers {{the legality of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against non-state actors, specifically terrorists, where the terrorist acts are not attributable to the territorial state. The United States' air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria is examined to determine whether the United States' conduct constitutes a lawful exercise of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law. The substantive {{framework of the}} use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law is first analysed, which includes an explanation of the scope of the prohibition of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law and the various exceptions to this prohibition. This is followed by a description of the focus of this paper, terrorism and counterterrorism, and of the development of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists in international law. The current status of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists in international law is elucidated. The United States' use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against the Islamic State in Syria is contextualised through the provision of a brief history of the conflict in Syria and the emergence of the Islamic State as a terrorist threat. Possible legal justifications regarding United States' use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in Syria are examined to conclude whether the air strikes are lawful in terms of international law on the use <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the growing debate about the legality of the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> against terrorists and eventually, to a clearer framework on the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in international law...|$|R

Not only in Turkey, but also in all the world, excessive use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> is considered as a violent act independent from its having a legal basis.

40|$|The United Nations Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{paradigm}} prohibits all uses <b>of</b> <b>force</b> {{by states}} except {{in respect of}} self-defence or when authorised by the Security Council. However, in 1999, NATO, without express authorisation from the Security Council, undertook non-defensive military action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, {{in response to the}} ongoing crisis in Kosovo. Then, in March 2003, the United States led a coalition of states in a war against Iraq. This military action was also not expressly authorised by the Security Council. Both of these uses <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are ~neral 1 y considered to constitute primafacie breaches of the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm. These breaches of the Charter have led some observers to claim that the [...] :f Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm is now 'dead'. It is argued that the invasion of Iraq by the United States-led coalition represents a fmal assault on the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> rules. These spectacular breaches of the Charter demonstrate that states no longer consider the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm to be authoritative and controlling. Thereby, the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm is no longer valid. Through the prism ofKosovo and Iraq, this thesis examines the question of :he impact of breaches of the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> paradigm upon its :ontinued validity. It is posited that although the Charter's use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> rules lave been breached, these breaches do not mean that the Charter's use of orce paradigm is repudiated by states and thereby no longer valid.

40|$|Stress {{of police}} {{officers}} {{is assumed to be}} one of the causes for an increased use <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> but to date, very few studies have tested this relationship empirically. This study examines influ-ences of perceived work-related stress, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and burnout on the use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> by police officers in Zurich, Switzerland (n = 422). A new approach is developed by including the officer’s routine activities (herein referred to as job profile) and victimization experiences as two situational controls and by capturing a contin-uum <b>of</b> self-reported <b>force</b> used in typical operational situations. Although bivariate results show significant relationships between use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> and work stress, job satisfaction, commit-ment, and burnout, multivariate analyses using structural equation models show no influence of stress-related factors on the amount <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> The job profile remains the only predictor of police use <b>of</b> <b>force,</b> whereas victimization is strongly correlated with use <b>of</b> <b>force...</b>|$|R

40|$|There is {{a volume}} of {{research}} that has analyzed the police use of force&mdash; particularly the use <b>of</b> deadly <b>force.</b> Past research has been limited by em-ploying only a dichotomous measurement <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> This paper explores predictors of the police use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> in Phoenix by analyzing 1, 220 arrests. In addition, the paper employs {{the concept of a}} continuum <b>of</b> <b>force.</b> Lo-gistic regression results show the strongest predictors of police use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> are length <b>of</b> time on the force, suspect race, chemical impairment, at-tempt to flee and possession of a weapon. Relevant literature and research implications are discussed. Numerous researchers have observed the relationships between police of-ficer use <b>of</b> <b>force</b> and officer traits, suspect traits and situational variables. Too often, such research has utilized dichotomous-level analyses <b>of</b> police <b>force,</b> including measurements <b>of</b> force/no <b>force</b> and deadly/nondeadly force. Based on the limitations of such studies, recent research (e. g., Garner et al. 1995) has suggested using a continuum <b>of</b> <b>force</b> to provide a more accurate understanding of the situations and to encourage development of more ad-vanced measurements of such complex events. Previous research suggests that a continuum <b>of</b> <b>force</b> exists in police-suspect encounters (e. g., Sykes and Brent 1980; Americans for Effective Law Enforcement 1988; Clede and Parsons 1987; Connor 1991; Desmedt 1984...|$|R
