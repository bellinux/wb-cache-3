500|$|Schumacher {{also set}} the fastest {{time in the}} second {{qualifying}} session with a lap of 1:20.382, {{but it was not}} good enough to beat Hill's fastest time <b>overall</b> <b>set</b> in the first session. Hill made a set-up change that he {{turned out not to be}} happy with, but maintained his pole position, his first since the 1994 British Grand Prix. The Williams and Benetton formation continued on the second row, as Coulthard was third, with Herbert qualifying fourth after a late flying lap, equalling his best-ever qualifying position, achieved at the 1994 Italian Grand Prix for the Lotus team. However, a hole was punched in the bottom of Herbert's monocoque chassis during the session as a result of damage, leading to a night of repairs in order for him to be able to take the start in his designated race car. The work required to repair both Benetton cars caused Schumacher's race engineer, Pat Symonds, to describe the weekend as [...] "one of the hardest [...] I can remember for many years". [...] It also meant that three British drivers started in the top four, leading Hill to joke that [...] "the English [...] have got Michael surrounded". Behind the leading four, the two Ferrari cars were fifth and sixth, Berger qualifying in front of Alesi. Both were optimistic on their race prospects, despite the fact that the former suffered an engine failure during the session. The two McLaren cars of Häkkinen and Blundell were seventh and ninth, the two split by Eddie Irvine in a Jordan car. Irvine set his time despite spinning off during the session; his teammate Barrichello suffered the season's first engine failure during a timed session on Friday and then gearbox problems on Saturday, before also spinning off during that day's qualifying session, restricting his to a disappointing 16thposition on the grid at his home race. Katayama and Salo proved evenly-matched for Tyrrell, qualifying in 11th and 12th respectively, behind Panis. The Minardi drivers were also close, with Pierluigi Martini and Luca Badoer taking 17th and 18thpositions on the grid respectively, separated from the Tyrrell drivers by Gianni Morbidelli (Footwork), Frentzen, Aguri Suzuki (Ligier) and Barrichello. Wendlinger took 19thposition, the Sauber cars handling particularly badly on the bumpy track, ahead of Bertrand Gachot and Montermini (both Pacific drivers), who sandwiched Inoue in the second Footwork. At the back of the grid, the two Forti and Simtek cars covered positions 23to26. Schiattarella, in a Simtek, was last out of the four positions, having caused one of the two red flags in qualifying, crashing on the exit of turnthree at the beginning of the second qualifying session. The Simtek team's testing time was limited on Friday as the mandatory onboard fire extinguishers for its cars failed to arrive in time; a similar problem with the late arrival of parts affecting Martini's Minardi. The times in the second session were generally quicker, with only Hill, Badoer and Wendlinger setting their quickest lap times during the first session.|$|E
2500|$|Oops!... I Did It Again {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of hundred to reviews from mainstream critics, Oops!... I Did It Again received an average score of seventy-two, based on twelve reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Giving the album {{four out of}} five stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that the album [...] "has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made 'One More Time'," [...] but remarked that, [...] "Fortunately, she and her production team not only have a stronger <b>overall</b> <b>set</b> of songs this time, but they also occasionally get carried away with the same bewildering magpie aesthetic, [...] giv the album character apart from the well-crafted dance-pop and ballads that serve as its heart. In the end, it's what makes this an entertaining, satisfying listen." [...] Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "'Oops!...' indicates that she's developing a soulful edge and emotional depth that can't be conjured with a glass-shattering note," [...] praising the album for consistently cast Spears as a young woman coming to terms with her inner power—and that's a darn good message to offer an impressionable audience." [...] Entertainment Weeklys David Browne gave the album a B-rating, writing that the album [...] "reminds us once again that the best new pop can be a blast of cool air in a stifling room." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{idea of the}} {{priority}} method for constructing a r.e. set X is to list a countable sequence of requirements that X must satisfy. For example, to construct a r.e. set X between 0 and 0prime& {{it is enough to}} satisfy the requirements Ae and Be for each natural number e, where Ae requires that the oracle machine with index e does not compute 0prime& from X and Be requires that the Turing machine with index e (and no oracle) does not compute X. [...] These requirements are put into a priority ordering, which is an explicit bijection of the requirements and the natural numbers. The proof proceeds inductively with one stage for each natural number; these stages {{can be thought of as}} steps of time during which the set X is enumerated. [...] At each stage, numbers may be put into X or forever prevented from entering X in an attempt to satisfy requirements (that is, force them to hold once all of X has been enumerated). [...] Sometimes, a number can be enumerated into X to satisfy one requirement but doing this would cause a previously satisfied requirement to become unsatisfied (that is, to be injured). [...] The priority order on requirements is used to determine which requirement to satisfy in this case. [...] The informal idea is that if a requirement is injured then it will eventually stop being injured after all higher priority requirements have stopped being injured, although not every priority argument has this property. [...] An argument must be made that the <b>overall</b> <b>set</b> X is r.e. and satisfies all the requirements. Priority arguments can be used to prove many facts about r.e. sets; the requirements used and the manner in which they are satisfied must be carefully chosen to produce the required result.|$|E
