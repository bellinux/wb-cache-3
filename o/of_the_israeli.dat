5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E

5|$|On 13 November 1966, Israel {{launched}} a major raid against the Jordanian administered West Bank town of as-Samu, {{in response to}} a Fatah-implemented roadside bomb attack which had killed three members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> security forces near the southern Green Line border. In the resulting skirmish, scores of Jordanian security forces were killed and 125 homes razed. This raid was one of several factors that led to the 1967 Six-Day War.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1972, {{during the}} Munich Summer Olympics, eight fighters of the Palestinian group Black September took hostage eleven members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Olympic team.

Three perpetrators (Adnan Al-Gashey, Jamal Al-Gashey, and Mohammed Safady) survived and were subsequently arrested and held in pre-trial custody.|$|E
40|$|Getting out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gaza Strip {{is an old}} dream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} in <b>Israeli</b> society.

50|$|During that period, several events {{worked in}} favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israelis.</b> In 1967, <b>the</b> seventh boat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelve boats ordered, INS Mivtach (Reliance), was {{completed}} and launched. A telecom from Israeli Navy command informed <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> in Cherbourg that the embargo {{was expected to}} escalate, and the boats would have to sail immediately to Haifa during sea trials, ignoring the French protocols for leaving port. This angered the French, and they ordered <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Navy and <b>the</b> other boats to leave the French harbour, and dock instead at the commercial port, which was unguarded.|$|R

5|$|The Sinai {{garrison}} numbered 18,000 men. The overall commander was Shmuel Gonen, {{who served}} as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Southern Command.

5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E
50|$|Having decisively {{beaten the}} Egyptian and Syrian navies, <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Navy had <b>the</b> run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastlines. <b>Israeli</b> missile boats {{utilized}} their 76mm cannons and other armaments to strike targets along the Egyptian and Syrian coastlines, including wharves, oil tank farms, coastal batteries, radar stations, airstrips, and other targets <b>of</b> military value. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> Navy even attacked some of Egypt's northernmost SAM batteries. <b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> Navy's attacks {{were carried out}} with minimal support from <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Air Force (only one Arab naval target was destroyed from the air during the entire war).|$|R

5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E
5|$|At around 13:00, a recon {{group from}} 2nd Division {{discovered}} around 75 tanks concentrating north {{east of the}} bridgehead. Ten minutes later the Egyptians intercepted a radio signal in Hebrew. Nir was informing his command that {{he was ready to}} attack within twenty minutes. With little time left, Abu Sa'ada decided to take a risky move. Estimating, correctly, that the attack would come be directed between his two forward brigades, the weakest point in his lines, Abu Sa'ada planned to draw Israeli forces into his bridgehead to within three kilometers of the canal before engaging them from all sides, committing all his anti-tank reserves. At 13:30, the attack was carried out by Amir and Nir's brigades. A lack of coordination and communication difficulties between both brigades hampered the attack. Nir's two battalions attacked {{at the same time in}} two echelons. The Egyptians allowed the Israelis to advance, then encircled them. When the attackers entered the prepared killing zone, Egyptian armor of the 24th Brigade opened fire on the advancing tanks, complemented by infantry anti-tank weapons on either flank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> forces, while tank hunting detachments attacked from the rear. Within just 13 minutes, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> force was destroyed—the Egyptians destroyed over 50 tanks and captured eight intact. Among the captured were Lieutenant Colonel Asaf Yaguri, a battalion commander, whose unit lost 32 killed. By the end of the attack Nir had just four operational tanks remaining, including his own. Gabi Amir's battalion, attacking to Nir's right, was forced to halt his advance after encountering stiff resistance. Amir requested air support several times, but did not receive any.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though in}} his 1955 book Egypt's Destiny, Naguib wrote that his brigade's {{successful}} stand was a glorious victory with few consequences, estimating 450 Israeli dead (out of a perceived 4,000 attackers), a logbook captured by Israel {{during the war}} revealed that he was extremely worried about the future fate of his forces. He requested immediate assistance, including air support to determine the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> cannons, a medevac unit, reinforcements, munitions and communication wires. It is also likely that {{he believed that the}} 53rd Battalion's force blocking the road from Majdal was still in place, and therefore thought that he was surrounded.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Chinese co-production of Sesame Street, Zhima Jie, was created.
