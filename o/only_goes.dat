25|$|Opposition {{politics}} {{found their}} way into film, too, with statesman Pridi Phanomyong producing King of the White Elephant, in 1940. With all the dialogue in English, Pridi hoped {{to send a message to}} the outside world that he was unhappy with the militaristic direction his country was taking.

25|$|In Africa, China may {{sell its}} own low quality or overproduced goods and inventory, a key outlet which helps {{maintain}} China's {{economic and social}} stability. Chinese shop-owners in Africa are able to sell Chinese-built, Chinese-shipped goods for a profit. A negative consequence of China's low-cost consumer goods trade is that it <b>only</b> <b>goes</b> one way. China does not purchase manufactured products from Africa, while cheap Chinese imports flood the local marketplace, {{making it difficult for}} local industries to compete.|$|E
25|$|The annual surveys Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) and Index of Economic Freedom (IEF) are two indices which {{attempt to}} measure the degree of {{economic}} freedom in the world's nations. The EFW index, originally developed by Gwartney, Lawson and Block at the Fraser Institute was likely the most used in empirical studies as of 2000. The other major index, which was developed by The Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal appears superior for data work, although as it <b>only</b> <b>goes</b> back to 1995, it is less useful for historical comparisons.|$|E

25|$|By 1995, {{research}} in the subject had advanced and hemispherical reconstructions of temperature were available, though only for the summer season (because tree rings are often most strongly influenced by summer temperatures). The 1995 IPCC report used a northern hemisphere summer temperature reconstruction (fig 3.20) from 1400 to 1979 by (Bradley and Jones 1993). This too shows no MWP (it <b>only</b> <b>goes</b> back to 1400) and colder temperatures otherwise before the 20th century, {{of the order of}} 0.5°C colder. Fig 3.21 shows 8 ice core records from 1200 to present, which display a mixed pattern.|$|E
25|$|The Sh'vut Ya'akov (1:17) {{rules that}} the above-cited custom {{of the father}} fasting for the child goes into effect {{as soon as the}} child is born, except where the child is born after chatzot ha'laila (halakhic midnight, which {{generally}} corresponds to solar midnight) on the 14th of Nisan of that year. (Since the child had not yet been born by the equivalent time that the Plague of the Firstborn had occurred in Egypt, the father need not fast for his child until the following year) The Korban N'tan'el (Pesachim 10:19:80) disagrees. He writes that the custom <b>only</b> <b>goes</b> into effect from the time the child is 30 days old. This relates, again, to the command to redeem the firstborn, which does not go into effect until the child is 30 days old.|$|E
25|$|All games {{made for}} the Xbox 360 are {{required}} to support at least Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The console works with over 256 audio channels and 320 independent decompression channels using 32-bit processing for audio, with support for 48kHz 16-bit sound. Sound files for games are encoded using Microsoft's XMA audio format. An MPEG-2 decoder is included for DVD video playback. VC-1 or WMV is used for streaming video and other video is compressed using VC-1 at non-HD NTSC and PAL resolutions or WMV HD. The Xbox 360 also supports H.263 and H.264 MPEG-4 videos. Unlike the original Xbox, voice communication is handled by the console, not by the game code, allowing for cross-game communication. There is no voice echo to game players on the same console; voice <b>only</b> <b>goes</b> to remote consoles.|$|E

25|$|On the {{philosophy}} behind {{the process of}} reservation itself, the people in favour of reservation feel that reservation is necessary to undo and counter the 'evils' of centuries of caste system that prevailed in the country. Reservation proponents also contend that merit as it is defined today {{is something that is}} achieved with the help of cramming, tutoring, constant guidance, quality schooling and knowledge of English and poor Dalits, poor MBC's lack most of these. This (the argument cnetering on cramming, tutoring, etc.) the anti-reservationists do not accept, pointing out that not all high-scorers at the exams can hope to eventually succeed in translating their knowledge into skills, but low-scorers especially in higher education will also score badly on the skill ladder proportionately much more than high-scorers. They also suggest that the examination-based approach to merit evaluation calls for a modification to better reflect meritorious performance in practical demonstration of skills, but casteist reservation does not have anything to offer as a solution in this regard. Which, they add, <b>only</b> <b>goes</b> to expose the foul game of the politicians of India many of whom have a record of strongly alleged offences and crimes of numerous types.|$|E
