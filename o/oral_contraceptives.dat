5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% {{of those}} who are married and able to have children use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method in the developed world is condoms and <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> while in Africa it is <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E
5|$|While all {{methods of}} birth control have some {{potential}} adverse effects, the risk is {{less than that of}} pregnancy. After stopping or removing many methods {{of birth control}}, including <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> IUDs, implants and injections, the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E
40|$|Higher AUC and Cmax {{values were}} {{obtained}} for metoprolol, oxprenolol and propranolol in groups receiving the low-dose oestrogen-ethinyl oestradiol <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive,</b> but statistical significance was reached only with metoprolol AUC. The <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> had the opposite effect on acebutolol AUC and Cmax {{but this was not}} significant. The <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> had no detectable effects on the tmax and t½ values of any of the β-adrenoceptor blockers...|$|R
40|$|Data {{regarding}} {{the effects of}} <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use on women's risk of melanoma {{have been difficult to}} resolve. We undertook a pooled analysis of all case–control studies of melanoma in women completed as of July 1994 for which electronic data were available on <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use along with other melanoma risk factors such as hair colour, sun sensitivity, family history of melanoma and sun exposure. Using the original data from each investigation (a total of 2391 cases and 3199 controls), we combined the study-specific odds ratios and standard errors to obtain a pooled estimate that incorporates inter-study heterogeneity. Overall, we observed no excess risk associated with <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use for 1 year or longer compared to never use or use for less than 1 year (pooled odds ratio (pOR) = 0. 86; 95 % CI= 0. 74 – 1. 01), and {{there was no evidence of}} heterogeneity between studies. We found no relation between melanoma incidence and duration of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use, age began, year of use, years since first use or last use, or specifically current <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use. In aggregate, our findings do not suggest a major role of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use on women's risk of melanoma...|$|R

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show no difference in incidence between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E

50|$|Well {{controlled}} {{studies on}} the effect of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> failure and antibiotics are very limited. The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with birth control pills, such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%). Situations that may increase the risk of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> failure include non-compliance (missing taking the pill), vomiting or diarrhea. Gastrointestinal disorders or interpatient variability in <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> absorption affecting ethinylestradiol serum levels in the blood. Women with menstrual irregularities may be at higher risk of failure and should be advised to use backup contraception during antibiotic treatment and for one week after its completion. If patient-specific risk factors for reduced <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> efficacy are suspected, backup contraception is recommended.|$|R

5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. <b>Oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E

50|$|Extended or {{continuous}} cycle combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pills are a packaging of combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pills (COCPs) {{that reduce}} or eliminate the withdrawal bleeding that would occur once every 28 days in traditionally packaged COCPs. Extended cycle use of COCPs may also be called menstrual suppression.|$|R
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{fluctuations}} {{that contribute}} to cyclical attacks in women have been treated with <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> and luteinizing hormones to shut down menstrual cycles. However, <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> have also triggered photosensitivity and withdrawal of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> has triggered attacks. Androgens and fertility hormones have also triggered attacks.|$|E
25|$|Long-term use of <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> is {{associated}} with increased risk of cervical cancer. Women who have used <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> for 5 to 9 years have about three times the incidence of invasive cancer, and those who used them for 10 years or longer have about four times the risk.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} {{association}} between <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use and the prevalence of genital warts in women. METHODS: Cross sectional case control study comparing <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> use in women with and without genital warts attending a city centre genitourinary medicine clinic controlling for recent sexual activity, {{the presence of other}} sexually transmitted infections, socio-economic class and history of pregnancy using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: After controlling for potential confounding variables women with genital warts {{were significantly more likely to}} be current users of the <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pill (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 2). CONCLUSION: The study suggests that women taking the <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> may be at increased risk of presenting with genital warts. Previously published papers provide some support for this hypothesis and potential biological mechanisms are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Suppression of ovulation, {{which would}} {{otherwise}} cause {{damage to the}} ovarian epithelium and, consequently, inflammation, is generally protective. This effect {{can be achieved by}} having children, taking combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives,</b> and breast feeding, all of which are protective factors. A longer period of breastfeeding correlates with a larger decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer. Each birth decreases risk of ovarian cancer more, and this effect is seen with up to five births. Combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by up to 50%, and the protective effect of combined <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> can last 25–30 years after they are discontinued. Regular use of aspirin or acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer; other NSAIDs do not seem to have a similar protective effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} {{could be a}} {{determinant}} risk factor {{in the frequency of}} Alveolar Osteitis. Studies have shown that because of hormonal changes, women in the middle of menstrual cycle and the ones taking <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (birth control pills) have a higher tendency of having Alveolar Osteitis after their tooth extraction surgery. It is recommended that elective surgeries be performed during the menstrual period in both <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> users and non users to eliminate the effect of cycle-related hormonal changes on the development of Alveolar Osteitis.|$|E
