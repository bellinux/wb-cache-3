5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} of The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Sea (1952), Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health for much of his remaining life. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, (1930s) and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he killed himself in mid-1961.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{or perhaps}} because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command of a military division in Marseille. By this time, he was an <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E

The three shared the unique status of each being both the <b>oldest</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>oldest</b> veteran of their {{respective}} countries. (France's then newly crowned <b>oldest</b> <b>man,</b> Aimé Avignon, who was born on 2 February 1897, thus making him almost 110 years old, did not serve in the war.)

5|$|In {{order to}} promote a {{national}} reading culture, since 2009, THSRC have organized the “Ride THSR and Join the Book Exhibition for Free” event. Since then, THSRC have offered more than 39,000 passengers free admission to the Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE), which is held in February of each year. In 2012, the “THSR Reading Train” was launched. This year’s TIBE spokesperson, singer Crowd Lu, read the classic novel “The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Sea” for children aboard the train, allowing these students from remote areas to experience both the joy of reading and the marvel of high-speed rail travel.|$|E
5|$|The Prank War series, which depicts Blumenfeld and Streeter Seidell as {{they play}} a series of {{escalating}} practical jokes on each other, became popular {{and led to the}} two appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2009. MTV later hired Seidell and Blumenfeld to host Pranked, a clip show featuring prank videos from the Internet. Outside of CollegeHumor, Blumenfeld has appeared in the short film The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>and</b> the Seymour, the television series Louie and I Just Want My Pants Back, and the 2011 film A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas. He also writes for ESPN The Magazine and Mental Floss.|$|E
5|$|Drawings {{scratched}} on slate {{have been}} found of dragon-prowed ships, portraits of an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> of a young, bearded man and of a four-legged animal. The drawings {{were found in the}} Viking levels but are Pictish in style and may either pre-date the arrival of the Norse or indicate a continuity of art and culture from one period to the next. Similarly, although the rectangular shape of the Norse-era buildings are quite unlike the earlier rounded Pictish style, the basement courses of the two periods are constructed in the same way. The Viking-style loom weights, spindle whorls and other vessels were found with stone discs and other objects of a Pictish design. A bronzegilt harness mounting made in Ireland in the 8th or 9th centuries has also been found and many items from this period are in the Shetland Museum. Jarlshof contains the most extensive remains of a Viking site visible anywhere in Britain.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the Canada/Quebec Pension Plan (C/QPP) disablity program on the labour force participation rates of <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women.

The results from these regressions indicate that, for the most part, the C/QPP disability program has had a large effect on the participation rates of <b>older</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> women. ...|$|R

5|$|Maria made an {{agreement}} with her sister, Bronisława, that she would give her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. In connection with this, Maria took a position as governess: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father. While working for the latter family, {{she fell in love}} with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician. His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them. Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University. Still, as an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute that she had founded in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now well out of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E
5|$|Todd {{purchases}} an SS uniform from {{a costume}} shop, and forces Dussander to wear it. When he {{spends more time}} with the old man, his grades suffer, he loses interest in his girlfriend, and he conceals his bad grades from his parents. In turn, the Nazi blackmails the young boy into studying to restore his grades, threatening to expose the boy's subterfuge and his dalliance with Nazism to his parents. Dussander even poses as Todd's grandfather and goes to an appointment with Todd's school counselor Edward French (David Schwimmer). Talking about the war crimes affects both the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> the young boy, and an intoxicated Dussander attempts to kill a cat in his gas oven but fails when it attacks him and escapes. Dussander also takes great pride in Todd's unbelievable turnaround, going from near dropout to straight A's in a matter of weeks.|$|E

5|$|Tracking Tito's {{family is}} a man known as Brown, a brusque and obstinate lead covert {{operative}} for a shadowy organization of unclear connection to the U.S. government. Of neoconservative orientation, Brown {{appears to have a}} background in law enforcement, but little training in tradecraft. Brown and his team attempt to track the activities of the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> Tito with the help of Brown's captive Milgrim, whom he has translate the volapuk-encoded Russian used by Tito's family to communicate. Milgrim is addicted to anti-anxiety drugs, and is kept docile and compliant by Brown, who controls his supply of Rize. Brown believes that Tito and the old man are in possession of information that would, if revealed, undermine public confidence in the U.S.'s participation in the Iraq War. In his attempts to capture them and their data, however, Brown is instead fed disinformation through the old man's intricate schemes.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} colors {{used in the}} film have symbolic meanings. Each of the three main storylines has its own unique hue that highlights their originality and unlikeness to each other. Color differentiation can be traced {{as far back as}} Nemo's childhood, where three girls sit on a bench. They are his possible future wives: Jeanne, Elise, and Anna; one in yellow, the other in blue, and the third in a red dress. In his life with Elise, Nemo experiences the consequences of depression and despair, themes associated with the color blue. Choosing Jeanne, Nemo seeks material well-being and independence: yellow – the color of life and wealth – emphasizes this. The true love and passionate relationship between Nemo and Anna is symbolized by the red color of Anna's dress. It is noteworthy that the unborn Nemo is shown living in a white world. White contains all colors of the visible spectrum; this supports the allegorical message of the film that all things are possible until a choice is made. By the end of his life, Nemo is a decrepit <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> lives in a white surrounding (room, clothes, doctor). This way we can see that the fate of the protagonist leads him back to the origins from where he started, the point at which everything is possible.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> requested that he become his student.|$|E
