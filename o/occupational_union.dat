This article {{shows that}} the answer to this {{question}} will depend on (i) who actually makes business decisions in credit unions (who is in control), and (ii) whether local deposit market competition is important. It is not obvious who controls <b>occupational</b> credit <b>unions.</b> If the sponsor (the employer) is in control, then loans and deposits are priced to maximize the surplus received by all of the credit union’s current and potential members (those eligible to join). If members are in control, then a group of members with a majority can maximize its own surplus. The group in control may include members whose primary purpose for joining the credit union is to borrow money or, alternatively, to lend money (make deposits). If local deposit-market competition is the dominant influence, then internal characteristics of the credit union won’t matter at all. This study tests the sponsor-> control, the member-control, and the market-control hypotheses against each other using a large sample of <b>occupational</b> credit <b>unions</b> observed in 1997.

The Australian Council of Trade Unions [ACTU] has pursued several strategies aimed at tackling this malaise. The central {{purpose of this paper is}} to chronicle two of these strategies: union restructuring and the move to an 'organising' model of trade unionism. These strategies were championed by the ACTU as key planks in encouraging union recruitment and retention. The union restructuring strategy was successful in reducing the number of federally registered trade unions from 326 to 142. However, according to one observer [Fairbrother 2000], the result of these mergers is the creation of large-multi-sector and <b>occupational</b> <b>unions,</b> beset by uneasy internal political alliances and class compromises. The move to an `organising' model of unionism has been met with successes on the one hand, and resistance on the other.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe thesis {{examines}} {{the implications of}} Public Sector Reform (PSR) for public sector unions in Zambia. Using the case study strategy, the research investigates the Civil Servants and Allied Workers Union of Zambia (CSAWUZ) in Lusaka district {{under the rubric of}} PSR. The research is qualitative in nature. Two types of data were collected, namely, secondary and primary data. A sample of 25 key informants was engaged in the research. These informants include five managers of public institutions and 20 leaders of the CSAWUZ. The methods of multistage, purposive and snowball sampling were used to select the informants. Secondary data were collected by reading documents on PSR and trade unions while primary data were collected by conducting semi-structured interviews with the sampled informants. The data are analysed using the method of content analysis. The findings reveal that Zambia is characterised by a young, unskilled and impoverished population. The government faces challenges to deliver services especially in rural areas and to the female population. There are three major categories of government institutions in Zambia. These are central government, local government and parastatals. There are also different types of trade unions organising employees in these institutions. They include sectoral <b>unions,</b> enterprise <b>unions,</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>unions,</b> industrial unions, and federations of trade unions. However, the operations of these unions have been challenged by the reform of the public sector. Two generations of PSR have been implemented in Zambia. These are New Public Management (NPM) and post-NPM reforms. On the one hand, NPM reforms emphasised the effectiveness of market forces and the weakness of government regulation. On the other hand, post-NPM reforms emphasise the interconnectedness of stakeholders in the processes of policy formulation and implementation. These stakeholders include government, business, civil society organisations, employers and trade unions. The implementation of PSR is influenced by the interplay of a number of factors. These include the recognition of problems in the public sector, {{the emergence of a new}} ideology, and the presence of actors spearheading the reform of the public sector. The findings show that PSR involves changing the role of the public sector in the process of providing goods and services. Instead of the public sector being the only provider, it is a partner. As a partner, its role is to create an environment that encourages the growth of the private sector. However, this kind of reform negatively affects trade unions in the public sector. The effects include reductions in union membership, income and power. Although public sector unions are negatively affected by PSR, they have agency and do not just wait to become victims of the reform process. They make strategies to adapt to the changing circumstances. These strategies include diversifying the membership, servicing the membership, decentralising the organisational structure of the union, coordinating union activities, and forming alliances with external organisations dealing with issues affecting workers. This implies that trade unions in the public sector have opportunities to deal with challenges facing them under the rubric of PSR...|$|R

40|$|In 1991 a new labour {{relations}} regime was introduced which overturned a 100 year old pattern of 'historic compromise' between capital and labour. In a labour market structured {{by gender and}} race, this major change in bargaining arrangements has already widened the pay gap between men's and women's average earnings and reduced union coverage, particularly among women workers in low paid clerical, sales and service work. This study, documenting recent feminist struggle {{in the area of}} {{labour relations}}, provides a first look at the collective organisation of women under two different labour relations regimes. In the 1980 s a particular conjunction of occupational unionism and feminism in New Zealand facilitated some significant improvements in the situation of women in paid employment. The thesis examines feminist strategies which led to a Working Women's Charter adopted by unions, an increase in women holding office in unions, complaints procedures for sexual harassment, standing committees to represent women and Maori in the union movement, and legislation to implement equal employment opportunity programmes and equal pay for work of equal value. It looks at how the institutionalisation of bargaining by occupation supported industrially weak workers and underpinned the unionisation of women, while <b>occupational</b> <b>unions</b> and women's own strategies of organisation provided the autonomous 'political space' to organise around issues specifically relevant to women. At the core of the thesis are three case studies of unions representing three of the occupations in which women are concentrated: clerical work, nursing and cleaning. It examines commonalities and contrasts in the industrial situations covered by these unions, and differences and similarities in the strategies they adopted. The focus of research, conducted between late 1990 and early 1993, was the views of officials of these unions in the context of radical change in the regulation of wage bargaining. Particular attention was given to the way issues relating to women workers were prioritised in unions led by women or by men. These case studies are contextualised in chapters examining the position of women in the labour market, feminist organisation within the union movement, and corporatist change in labour relations legislation. In tracing the development of feminist unionism in the 1980 s, the thesis considers the strategies of the NZ Council of Trade Unions and looks at what the radical change in bargaining structure will mean for collective organisation by women in paid employment...|$|R

40|$|In {{the history}} of {{vocational}} education and training, apprentices seldom feature as actors. They are also rarely mentioned among those affected by economic conditions and political measures. Studies of England and Scotland have shown that, {{over a period of}} decades, there was a widespread apprentice movement during the twentieth century.

The present article addresses this desideratum, investigating the form and content of how apprentices articulated their interests in Switzerland between 1880 and 1950. The main reason why Switzerland never experienced major sustained apprentice protests was because of its corporatist organisation of vocational education policy. This policy meant that there was no space available for independent forms of protest as charitable organisations, industrial and <b>occupational</b> associations, trade <b>unions</b> and state agencies assumed the task of articulating the interests of apprentices...|$|R
40|$|At {{the time}} of the {{founding}} of the industry superannuation funds, the Australian retirement-savings market was dominated by insurance mutuals. In the early 1980 s, less than half the workforce was covered by <b>occupational</b> superannuation and <b>unions</b> saw the insurance mutuals, created in the nineteenth century, as part of the problem in this widespread market failure. When establishing industry-wide schemes, union leaders largely eschewed the language associated with the "old" mutuals that had become key pillars of the established financial sector. In framing their appeal to members, the trustees and managers of the industry funds appealed instead to new expressions, such as "all profit to members. " Industry funds also developed a model of 50 / 50 employer/employee trusteeship or "equal representation" not as an ideological prescription, but as a pragmatic way of dealing with opposition to the schemes by employers. The trustees and managers of industry superannuation funds contrasted rather than associated themselves with the "old mutuals" which, at the time, were not seen as reflecting the unions&# 039; ideal of an industrial partnership. However, with the decline and demutualisation of the largest old insurance mutuals in the 1990 s, the industry funds began to appropriate the language of mutualism.

Few studies, however, {{have examined the}} relation between career and mortality in a historical U. S. population. This study explores the relation between occupational career and risk of mortality in old age among 7096 Union Army veterans who fought the American Civil War in the 1860 s. Occupational mobility was commonplace among the veterans in the postbellum period, with 54 % of them changing occupations {{from the time of}} enlistment to 1900. Among veterans who were farmers at enlistment, 46 % of them changed to a non-farming occupation by the time of 1900. Results from the Cox Proportional Hazard analysis suggest that relative to the average mortality risk of the sample, being a farmer at enlistment or circa 1900 are both associated with a lower risk of mortality in old age, although the effect is more salient for veterans who were farmers at enlistment. Occupational immobility for manual labors poses a serious threat to chance of survival in old age. These findings still hold after adjusting for the effects of selected variables characterizing risk exposures during early life, wartime, and old age. The robustness of the survival advantage associated with being a farmer at enlistment highlights the importance of socioeconomic conditions early in life in chance of survival at older ages.

40|$|During five wartime {{years and}} the {{following}} post-war decade, atomic energy was a subject shrouded in secrecy. Identified as a crucial element in military strategy, national status and export aspirations, {{the research and development}} of atomic piles (nuclear chain-reactors) were nurtured at isolated installations. Like monastic orders, new national laboratories provided occupational environments that were simultaneously cosseted and constrained, defining regional variants of a new State-managed discipline: reactor engineering. This paper discusses the significance of secrecy in defining the new subject in the USA, UK and Canada – the first three countries to dedicate sustained government funding to the field. The borders and content of the subject developed differently in each country, shaped under the umbrella of security by disparate clusters of expertise, industrial traditions and national goals. The emerging academic discipline was constricted by classified publications and State-sponsored specialist courses. The new experts were categorised largely according to existing <b>occupational</b> niches and <b>union</b> affiliations. And, the context of high security filtered their members and capped their professional aspirations. But these amply-funded and secluded environments traded intellectual segregation for unbounded opportunities. Like children in a toy factory (paraphrasing Alvin Weinberg), reactor engineers explored a new domain, sometimes with scarcely a sideways glance at social, economic or even strategic factors. The ambiguous and capricious goals of the new sites and their specialists gradually were tamed, though, as security measures diminished during the mid 1950 s and commercial nuclear power was identified as the primary goal...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to explore the}} <b>occupational</b> and trade <b>union</b> identity of clerks {{and to develop a}} theoretical perspective through which clerical workers' views of their situation can be examined. For this purpose the perspectives of action theory and reference group theory are revised and integrated. The central argument is that a logical extension to the focus upon actor definitions of reality lies in the investigation of key reference groups which actors themselves select. This is of particular importance in relation, to clerks, since their attitudes to work and to trade unionism have traditionally been explained in terms of their middle-class aspirations and their identification, with management. In this study of a hundred-and-sixty-five clerks drawn from six organizations in the North of England, representing mining, shipbuilding, engineering and civil air transport, a major finding is that clerical workers reject both management and manual workers as significant identification, referents. They perceive the clerical occupation as separate and distinct. They accept trade union membership as vital for the representation of their distinctive interests. However, within the broad acceptance of trade union membership, variations in trade union identity emerge. These are related to the specific concerns of clerks in different firms. Intra-occupational analysis demonstrates that trade union membership varies in meaning according to the degree to which clerks define management in oppositional terms and perceive their occupational, rewards as having fallen too far behind those of production workers. However, the clerks in this study, whatever their differences, do not strive to be better off than manual workers or aspire to the ranks of management, nor do they perceive their status concerns to be discordant with trade union membership,...|$|R

Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions The survey assesses member's prior knowledge of, and familiarity with, the work of Appeals Tribunals and method of choice of members (i. e. whether through personal application or through suggestion of individual or organisation). Respondents are asked for their opinion of reasons for their selection, and whether they were appointed as Minister's nominee or as Trades Council nominee. If the member has been promoted to Chairman since his appointment, the importance of remuneration is obtained. If he is an ordinary member, the importance of fee for service and any eventual financial loss to the member through service are ascertained. Respondent, opinion on frequency of sittings of tribunals, necessary experience, qualifications and personal qualities required of a good chairman and effective ordinary member, and own personal satisfaction or dissatisfaction in service are elicited. In a final section, comments are invited on methods of recruiting and selecting members, on changes needed in kinds of people appointed, and on the general work of Tribunals. Background Variables Age, highest formal education or professional qualifications, status of employment (i. e. whether self-employed, employed, retired or housewife), last paid occupation, husband's occupation (if housewife), judicial or semi-judicial or committee experience (with details and dates), membership of professional, <b>occupational</b> or trade <b>union</b> organisations and any voluntary work done during the period, 1962 - 72. A final detailed breakdown of income and salary from all sources completes the information...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} use {{of the concept of}} rent seeking to describe resource-wasting activities of individuals and groups seeking wealth transfers. 1 A wide range of activities are presumably of this type including agricultural price supports, <b>occupational</b> licensing, labor <b>unions,</b> import and export quotas, and education subsidies. The term rent seeking is used to describe attempts both to obtain and to maintain wealth transfers. Although the terminology of rent seeking is quite recent, the behavior that it describes "has been with us always " (Buchanan, 1980, p. 3). Moreover, rent-seeking behavior has become more important as institutional changes have created opportunities that did not exist when there was general agreement that the state should play a more limited role. Mancur Olson (1982) contends that the increase in specialized pressure groups is a key factor in the declining economic growth rate of nations—adding to the criticism of this widespread phenomenon in which organized groups use {{the power of the state}} to further their own economic ends. There is an implicit assumption in the literature that rent-seeking behavior can be objectively identified and that waste due to rent seeking can, at least in principle, be measured (Posner, 1975; Tullock, 1967). The problem of identifying rent-seeking activity under real world conditions is shown in this article to be similar to that of determining monopoly waste and other market inefficiencies. 2 It follows that rent-seeking waste can only be identified by substituting the observer's own standard of value. Moreover, if an activity is a legitimate function of the state, it is held that the lobbying associated with instituting and maintaining the activity is not necessarily wasteful. Consequently, since the appropriate role of the state is normative, identifying a particular activity as wasteful must necessarily be based on norms that lie outside of economic theory...|$|R
