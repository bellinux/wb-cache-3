40|$|International audienceA recent marine {{geophysical}} survey {{in the northern}} Molucca Sea revealed the structure {{to be that of}} a classical active convergent margin. We observe from west to east a volcanic arc (Sangihe), a forearc basin resting on an <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> (the Molucca ridge), which serves as a buttress for an accretionary wedge, and a composite downgoing plate (Snellius Ridge and Philippine Sea Basin). Gravity modeling indicates a strong negative anomaly above the wedge, which cannot be explained with reasonable density values. Modeling imposes a basement deepening and a rupture of the 700 -km-long subducting lithosphere. This process individualized the lithospheric slab from the Snellius Ridge, which in turn was separated recently from the south Philippine Basin by the incipient Philippine Trench. This induces a deformation of the forearc region with backthrusting of the <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> and forearc basin, visible on bathymetry and seismic data. We extrapolate the tectonic emplacement of such oceanic blocks to the Oligocene times in order to explain the origin of the Pujada Miangas <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> as a sliver previously incorporated to the margin, and we discuss the possibility of this deformation process being fabric for terrane accretion...|$|R

40|$|Natural gas {{hydrates}} are clathrates {{in which}} water molecules form a crystalline framework that includes and is stabilized by natural gas (mainly methane) at appropriate conditions of high pressures and low temperatures. The {{conditions for the}} formation of gas hydrates are met within continental margin sediments below water depths greater than about 500 m where the supply of methane is sufficient to stabilize the gas hydrate. Observations on DSDP Leg 11 suggested the presence of gas hydrates in sediments of the Blake <b>Outer</b> <b>Ridge.</b> Leg 76 coring and sampling confirms that, indeed, gas hydrates are present there. Geochemical evidence for gas hydrates in sediment of the Blake <b>Outer</b> <b>Ridge</b> includes (1) high concentrations of methane, (2) a sediment sample with thin, matlike layers of white crystals that released a volume of gas twenty times greater than its volume of pore fluid, (3) a molecular distribution of hydrocarbon gases that excluded hydrocarbons larger than isobutane, (4) results from pressure core barrel experiments, and (5) pore-fluid chemistry. The molecular composition of the hydrocarbons in these gas hydrates and the isotopic composition of the methane indicate that the gas is derived mainly from microbiological processes operating on the organic matter within the sediment. Although gas hydrates apparently are widespread on the Blake <b>Outer</b> <b>Ridge,</b> they probably are not of great economic significance as a potential, unconventional, energy resource or as an impermeable cap for trapping upwardly migrating gas at Site 533...|$|R

40|$|Marine seismic {{data from}} the Blake <b>Outer</b> <b>Ridge</b> {{offshore}} Florida show strong “bottom simulating reflections ” (BSR) associated with methane hydrate oc-curence in deep marine sediments. We use a detailed amplitude versus offset (AVO) analysis of these data to explore the validity of models which might ex-plain {{the origin of the}} bottom simulating reflector. After careful preprocessing steps, we determine a BSR model which can successfully reproduce the observed AVO responses. The P- and S-velocity behavior predicted by the forward mod-eling is further investigated by estimating the P- and S-impedance contrasts at all subsurface positions.

The color-derived parameters used in interpretation included predicted carbonate content, terrigenous fluxes, and hematite content. Abundance of Upper Carboniferous spores indicates that the hematite is probably derived from the Permo-Carboniferous red beds of the Canadian Maritimes. In the last 800 kyr sedimentation pattern changes on the Blake-Bahama <b>Outer</b> <b>Ridge</b> were determined by the sediment delivery to the deep basin as well as circulation changes. Sediment delivery increased during glacials (especially during the last 500 kyr and particularly since Stage 6).

Sedimentation related to WBUC had intensified at that time and had become more focused at depths below 3000 m.

They {{propagate}} as acoustic waves in the deep ocean sound channel at frequencies near 10 Hz. Arrival times of T waves, as recorded on widely spaced hydrophones in the sound channel off Eniwetok, Midway, Wake and Oahu Islands in the northern Pacific, are used to locate the T-phase source area. Sources thus located are correlated with published earthquake epicenters. The amplitude, onset rate, duration, frequency content and number of peaks of T-phase signals differs with earthquake magnitude as well as epicentral location. A study of T phases from earthquake epicenters in a localized source area, the western Aleutian Islands, was undertaken to investigate the cause of variation in T-phase signals. The earthquakes studied occurred {{in a series of}} aftershocks following the 7 3 / 4 magnitude earthquake south of the Rat Islands in the Aleutian Islands on February 4, 1965. The aftershocks occurred in a zone, about 300 miles long and 150 miles wide, roughly parallel to the WNW-ESE trend of the Aleutian arc. T-phase signals were different for earthquakes on the Aleutian arc, and behind the arc, from earthquakes on the Aleutian insular slope and Aleutian Trench. The T-phase strength, for earthquakes of a given magnitude, was greater for earthquakes on the arc, least for earthquakes in the Trench and <b>outer</b> <b>ridge,</b> and intermediate for earthquakes on the insular slope. The onset rate of T-phase signals varied with earthquake magnitude, but in general was most rapid for epicenters on the Aleutian arc, intermediate for epicenters on the Aleutian slope and gradual for epicenters in the Trench and <b>outer</b> <b>ridge.</b> Decay rates varied with earthquake magnitude because of reverberation and topographic reflections. Onset and decay rates were symmetrical for earthquakes in the Trench and on the <b>outer</b> <b>ridge.</b> Earthquakes on the Aleutian arc produced multiple peaked T phases due to radiation of T waves from more than one slope in the epicentral area. Earthquakes far out on the Aleutian slope. bench, Trench and <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> sometimes produced multiple peaked T phases because of both reflections from the slope behind the epicenter and radiation of T waves from that slope {{as well as from the}} epicenter. The accuracy of source location. as compared with epicentral location using the arrival times of earthquake body waves, was best for earthquakes on the Aleutian arc and in the Trench, and poorest for slope and bench earthquakes. Source solutions for signals from underwater explosions at known locations in the area indicate a source location accuracy of ± 10 miles. The accuracy of earthquake epicentral location by T phase is limited by the relatively broad signal peak of the T phase, and the fact that the point, or points, of radiation of the T phase is usually at an ocean bottom slope near the epicenter instead of at the epicenter itself...|$|R

The studied mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) from the <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> flank (VT area) and a near-ridge seamount (VM area) reveal that they are moderately phyric plagioclase basalts composed of plagioclase (phenocryst An(60 - 90) ] and groundmass An(35 - 79) ]), olivine (Fo(81 - 88)), diopside (Wo(45 - 51), En(25 - 37), Fs(14 - 24)), and titanomagnetite (FeO(t) similar to 63. 75 wt% and TiO(2) similar to 22. 69 wt%). The whole-rock composition of these basalts has similar Mg# mole Mg/mole(Mg+Fe 2 +) ] (VT basalt: similar to 0. 56 - 0. 58; VM basalt: similar to 0. 57), but differ in their total alkali content (VT basalt: similar to 2. 65; VM basalt: similar to 3. 24). The bulk composition of the magma was gradually depleted in MgO and enriched in FeO(t), TiO(2), P(2) O(5), and Na(2) O with progressive fractionation, the basalts were gradually enriched in Y and Zr and depleted in Ni and Cr.

30|$|Although the Philippine Sea Plate {{currently}} subducts obliquely {{beneath the}} accretionary prism in the Nankai Trough (Seno et al. 1993; Miyazaki and Heki 2001), it had subducted {{perpendicular to the}} trench until approximately 2 to 4 Ma (Kimura et al. 2005; Takahashi 2006; Ikeda et al. 2009). The change in plate motion reactivated some faults within the accretionary wedge as strike-slip faults that could accommodate trench-parallel shear strain due to the oblique plate subduction. The Median Tectonic Line (MTL), located approximately 250 km landward from the trough axis, is well known as a large strike-slip fault that releases trench-parallel shear strain (Figure 1; Ikeda et al. 2009). A few recent studies (Ashi et al. 2007; Martin et al. 2010) have demonstrated that the lineament at the seaward edge of the Kumano forearc basin (just landward of seafloor trace of the mega-splay fault, see Figures 1 and 2) is the surface expression of an active strike-slip fault, {{and it can be}} interpreted to have resulted from strain partitioning. In other words, a portion of the trench-parallel component of oblique convergence is accommodated by the active right-slip fault at the wedge-forearc boundary (i.e., the transition zone). Indeed, borehole breakout analysis has demonstrated that the stress state within the accretionary wedge is a strike-slip regime in the <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> region (Chang et al. 2010). Because the strike-slip fault is located at the transition zone between the inner and outer wedges from the region off Shionomisaki to the region off Kumano (Figure 2), we call the strike-slip fault at the wedge boundary the ‘wedge boundary strike-slip fault’ (WBSF) in this study. Moore et al. (2009) named this fault system in the Kumano basin area (eastern side of our survey area; Figure 1) the Kumano basin edge fault zone. At the Ryukyu margin, the southern continuation of the Nankai Trough, Dominguez et al. (1998) showed that a strike-slip fault is developed at the <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> and that it accommodates some of the lateral components of oblique plate convergence.|$|R

We find that the finer grains of the Bermuda Rise (relative to the Blake <b>Outer</b> <b>Ridge)</b> do not result from lower depositional energy (current speed) and so may reflect a difference in the nature of sediment being delivered to the site (i. e., distance from source) between the two locations...|$|R
50|$|On 28 November the French army {{advanced}} in three columns against the Prussian position. with Taponier leading the right, Hoche {{the center and}} Ambert the left. Taponier moved against the village of Vogelweh while Ambert aimed to cross the Lauter at Hirschhorn. Taponier's column {{was the first to}} encounter the Prussians and to open the battle, meeting moderate success. The initial attack carried his troops onto the <b>outer</b> <b>ridge</b> of the Hoheneck heights. Taponier also came up against the Galgenberg (Gallows Hill) which was defended by a Prussian redoubt. Alarmed at the march of Ambert's column, Brunswick reacted by sending Kalckreuth north to block it. Kalckreuth's force took a new position with his left flank on the Lauter, his center at Morlautern and his right near Erlenbach. Another division was placed on the Kaiserberg, while Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar was left to defend the western approaches to Kaiserslautern.|$|R
