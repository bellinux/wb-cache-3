5|$|Before their extinction, adapiform {{primates}} {{were primarily}} found across North America, Asia, and Europe, {{with a few}} species in Africa. They flourished during the Eocene when those regions were more tropical in nature, and they disappeared when the climate became cooler and drier. Today, the lemuriforms are confined in the tropics, ranging between 28°S to 26°N latitude. Lorises are found both in equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia, while the galagos are limited to the forests and woodlands <b>of</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> Africa. Lemurs are endemic to Madagascar, although much of their diversity and habitat has been lost due to recent human activity.|$|E

5|$|Educators face {{considerable}} challenges {{due to the}} nation's {{dispersed population}} and {{a certain degree of}} reluctance on the part of parents {{to send their children to}} school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the University of N'Djamena. At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates <b>of</b> <b>Sub-Saharan</b> Africa.|$|E
5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} {{has a large}} {{population}} ranging over much <b>of</b> <b>Sub-Saharan</b> Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of Least Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and {{to the destruction of}} nesting trees by logging.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} people who {{specified}} European ancestry in the 2005-2007 American Community Survey, the city was 26.4% German, 13.8% Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a visible community of people <b>of</b> <b>Sub-Saharan</b> African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who left their war-torn country. Soon after a settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came, and by 2000, the Saint Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States. Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul's West Side since the 1930s, and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005.|$|E

5000|$|Arnaiz-Villena et al. {{published}} five scientific articles, where, {{among other}} claims, {{they concluded that}} the Greek population originates from Sub-Saharan Africa and do not cluster with other Mediterraneans. The explanation they offered is {{that a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>Sub-Saharans</b> had migrated to Greece (but not to Crete) during Minoan times, i.e. predating both Classical and Mycenaean Greece. Those conclusions were related to the [...] "Black Athena" [...] debate and became embroiled in disputes between Greek and ethnic Macedonian nationalists.|$|R
5|$|The African crake (Crex egregia) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family that breeds in most <b>of</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> Africa away from the arid south and southwest. It is {{seasonally}} common in most of its range other than the rainforests and areas that have low annual rainfall. This crake is a partial migrant, {{moving away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow it to breed elsewhere. There have been a few records of vagrant birds reaching Atlantic islands. This species nests {{in a wide variety of}} grassland types, and agricultural land with tall crops may also be used.|$|E
5|$|The United States Cabinet has had 22 African-American {{appointed}} officers. The US Census Bureau defines African Americans {{as citizens}} or {{residents of the}} United States who have origins {{in any of the}} black populations of Africa. The term is generally used for Americans with at least partial ancestry in any of the original peoples <b>of</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> Africa. During the founding of the federal government, African Americans were consigned to a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved. No African American ever held a Cabinet position before the Civil Rights Movement or the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{widespread}} in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator. This includes much <b>of</b> <b>Sub-Saharan</b> Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2015, there were 296 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost ability to work, and negative effects on tourism.|$|E

50|$|The Paris {{metropolitan}} area has a community <b>of</b> origins from <b>Sub-Saharan</b> Africa. There were 54,000 persons of African nationalities, excluding Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, {{according to the}} 2009 French census. Countries <b>of</b> origin in <b>sub-Saharan</b> Africa include Burkina Faso, the Congo, Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} very common and is {{widespread}} through much <b>of</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> Africa and is found in western, eastern, central, and parts of southern Africa. It is absent from the rainforests of the Congo Basin. It has been recorded from Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (except in the center), Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Mauritania, Sudan, Tanzania, Somalia, Togo, Uganda, Zambia. Older records from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Mozambique, or most of Namibia refer to Naja mossambica or Naja nigricincta, which were formerly regarded as subspecies of N.nigricollis.|$|E
5|$|White Brazilians {{descended from}} the {{original}} Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although whites could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. Whites also comprised a significant proportion (40%) {{of the population in}} the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians <b>of</b> <b>Sub-Saharan</b> African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of whites in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown. The Indians, the indigenous peoples of Brazil, were found mainly in Piauí, Maranhão, Pará and Amazonas.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most <b>of</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted to a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
40|$|Selected {{socioeconomic}} barriers <b>of</b> {{education in}} <b>Sub-Saharan</b> Africa Abstract The aim of bachelor thesis {{is to describe}} and understand the process <b>of</b> education in <b>Sub-Saharan</b> Africa and analyze components that cause limited access to education.

The second main part focuses on the description and possible relations between selected socioeconomic barriers and literacy. Selected barriers include poverty, child labor and position of women in the society. The analysis revealed that existing relation between selected socioeconomic barriers and education has only low dependency rate and have to be understand more likely as a trend.

5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers. The prose {{has been called}} magnificent, lucid, eloquent, and passionate. Lewis' emotional appeal has been called remarkably candid, sincere, powerful, and moving. Connecting the diplomatic and policy-level work of the UN and World Bank with specific effects {{on the ground in}} Africa, and describing the problem of orphans, were among the strengths of the book. Lewis' criticisms are constructive and, since they come from such an ardent multilateralist employed by the United Nations, authoritative. One reviewer questioned several of Lewis' potential solutions as contributing to the same system that consistently fails to address its flaws. The same reviewer identified as the book's weakness its political slant, which ignores corrupt or inefficient African governments and the realities of asking corporations and western governments to take steps against their self-interest, like canceling agricultural subsidies in the case of governments and donating profits in the case of businesses. Several reviewers noted that the book could be used as an effective tool to educate about the HIV/AIDS crisis and the plight of the people <b>of</b> <b>sub-Saharan</b> Africa.|$|E
