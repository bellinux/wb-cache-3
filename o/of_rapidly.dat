5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in wound healing, and are capable <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E

5|$|In view <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> {{mounting}} British {{pressure and}} an ensuing armed conflict over {{the position of}} the Uitlanders and economic control over the Witwatersrand gold fields, foreign policy in the South African Republic was eventually determined by a triumvirate: State President Kruger, State Secretary Reitz, and State Attorney General J.C. Smuts. During 1899 they decided that an offensive attitude towards British demands was the only way forward, despite the risks this entailed. Reitz sought and received the support of the Orange Free State for this approach. On 9 October 1899 the South African Republic and the Orange Free State issued a joint ultimatum to the British government to retract their demands.|$|E
5|$|After several modifications, {{the first}} {{production}} variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most {{closely associated with}} the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A series <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800hp, and the very latest version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000hp. Lancasters were known to fly entire missions with their engines running at full power with no ill effects.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1927 {{economic}} indicators were signalling {{the onset of}} a recession in Australia. By 1929, the evidence was unavoidable that recession was becoming depression as a resulting <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> deteriorating international conditions. In that year, prices for Australian exports fell by nearly a third and GDP had fallen by 10%, with no attendant fall {{in the cost of}} living. Australia's debt now stood at £631 million the interest payments on which were equivalent to nearly half of Australia's export receipts, a situation difficult to sustain even in a positive economic climate. Investors and banks recognised the risk and Australia's credit access was rapidly drying up. Bruce's grand economic development plans had increased the national debt significantly yet had delivered only marginal economic expansion in the short term.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the second}} movement, {{there is a}} brief fourteen-bar {{transitional}} passage in E minor for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening {{is marked by a}} trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in G major. The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E Major. There is almost a small cadenza {{near the end of the}} movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.|$|E
5|$|One of the higher-level predators {{within its}} ecosystem, the Australian swellshark feeds on {{crustaceans}} (particularly crabs and rock lobsters), cephalopods (including squid and octopus), and small fishes. Even large-sized prey {{tends to be}} swallowed whole; the long periods of rest exhibited by some sharks may relate to digestion. Like {{the other members of}} its genus, this shark is capable <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> inflating its body by taking water or air into its stomach, as a defense against predators. These include larger fishes, such as the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and marine mammals. By inflating, the shark may be able to wedge itself inside crevices, make itself harder to swallow, or simply intimidate a would-be predator. Marine snails are known to prey upon this shark's eggs. The Australian swellshark serves as a host to a number of parasite species, but these are poorly documented.|$|E
5|$|Over time Surtseyan eruptions tend to form maars, broad low-relief {{volcanic}} craters {{dug into}} the ground, and tuff rings, circular structures built <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> quenched lava. These structures {{are associated with a}} single vent eruption, however if eruptions arise along fracture zones a rift zone may be dug out; these eruptions tend to be more violent then the ones forming a tuff ring or maars, an example being the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. Littoral cones are another hydrovolcanic feature, generated by the explosive deposition of basaltic tephra (although they are not truly volcanic vents). They form when lava accumulates within cracks in lava, superheats and explodes in a steam explosion, breaking the rock apart and depositing it on the volcano's flank. Consecutive explosions of this type eventually generate the cone.|$|E

5|$|Voracious and {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, the blotchy swellshark {{is known}} to consume numerous types of fishes and invertebrates, including an unusually high diversity of cartilaginous fishes. Like other Cephaloscyllium species, it is capable <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> inflating its body as a defense against predators. This species is oviparous, with females laying encapsulated eggs two at a time. There is no well-defined breeding season and reproduction occurs year-round. The eggs hatch after approximately one year. The blotchy swellshark is harmless and fares well in captivity. It is caught as bycatch in commercial bottom trawls, though its population {{does not seem to}} have suffered from fishing activity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess its conservation status.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle. As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E
5|$|With the RUF rapidly {{advancing}} on Freetown {{and controlling}} {{most of the}} interior of Sierra Leone, the only means <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> evacuating entitled persons or reinforcing UNAMSIL was by air via Lungi airport. Thus, the enhanced 1 PARA was flown to Dakar on 7 May, where C Company and the special forces squadron were almost immediately put aboard RAF Hercules C-130s with orders to secure the airport. They arrived at Lungi before sunset and were joined by the remaining elements of 1 PARA the next morning. The soldiers were able to deploy rapidly and with minimal equipment, knowing {{that they would not}} have to wait long for the ARG's reinforcements and supplies should they be needed. The soldiers immediately set about securing the areas that would be vital to an evacuation, including the Mamy Yoko hotel, which became the evacuation centre, and Lungi airport. Jones requested in the afternoon of 8 May that Richards commence the evacuation—codenamed Operation Palliser—which Richards did almost immediately. Entitled persons who wished to leave were instructed to assemble at the Mamy Yoko hotel. From there, they would be helicoptered to the airport by Chinooks and then flown to Dakar.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to combat with predators using horns, Triceratops are classically shown engaging {{each other in}} combat with horns locked. While studies show that such activity would be feasible, if unlike that of present-day horned animals, there is disagreement about whether they did so. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on Triceratops skulls (and the skulls of other ceratopsids) are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study finds no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, {{there is no evidence}} of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes. A newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions and periosteal reaction in Triceratops and Centrosaurus and showed that these were consistent with Triceratops using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in Centrosaurus may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head. The frequency of injury was found to be 14% in Triceratops. The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease. Histological examination reveals that the frill of Triceratops is composed of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that play a critical role in wound healing, and are capable <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> depositing bone during remodeling.|$|E
5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both pre-synaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins (dendrotoxins), cardiotoxins, calcicludine, and fasciculins. The average venom yield per bite is 80mg according to Engelmann and Obst (1981), while Minton (1974) gives it a range of 60–95mg (dry weight). The subcutaneous LD50 is 1.3mg/kg. The LD50 in mice through the IV route is 0.45mg/kg. Like all other mamba species, the toxicity of individual specimens within the same species can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Local swelling is variable and sometimes absent after mamba bites. However, patients bitten by the eastern green mamba develop swelling of the entire bitten limb and also show mild haemostatic disturbances (Warrell DA; MacKay et al. 1966). The rare cases of local tissue damage usually resulted from bites on the fingers {{or the use of}} a tight tourniquet. This species has caused bites to humans and many of the bites attributed to this species have often resulted in fatalities. The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be quite high. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness, and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat, convulsions, rapid progression to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal. Case reports <b>of</b> <b>rapidly</b> fatal outcomes, in as little as 30 minutes, have been recorded for this species.|$|E
