5|$|After Austerlitz, Napoleon {{established}} the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. A collection <b>of</b> <b>German</b> states intended {{to serve as}} a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization <b>of</b> <b>German</b> territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.|$|E

5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} within range <b>of</b> <b>German</b> surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed {{to provide an}} escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review <b>of</b> <b>German</b> war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E
