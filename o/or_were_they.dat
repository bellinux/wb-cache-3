5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, <b>or</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> rounded and spherical? Jing Fang {{wrote in the}} 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated by the Sun, and those parts not illuminated by the Sun would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated by the Sun was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
25|$|While Su Shi {{concentrated}} {{on making the}} lives of the local people in his charge better, and pursued his poetry which his position allowed time for, Wang Anshi's policies went awry. Were they bad policies, <b>or</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> badly implemented, or were climatic changes leading to drought and poor harvests to blame? These are all serious questions, important to historians of the time, and nowhere near to being definitively answered; but, they are rather subject of great scholarly debate. What is certain is that Su Shi was exiled until emperor Shenzong became somewhat disillusioned with Wang Anshi (and the powerful empress dowager had never been much of a fan of his). The Kaifeng merchants were becoming angry at the price inflation of wholesale goods together with additional tax increases and imposition of fees; and in north of the country a major drought followed by horrible famine occurred in 1074, displacing thousands of refugees (Murck, 37-38). In late 1075, this was followed by a spectacular comet, traditionally viewed as a sign of great changes on earth, even the fall of dynasties (Murck, 48) These events helped to lead Wang Anshi into a gentle but real exile, and to lead to the restoration of Su Shi and other banished officials to positions of power and respect, aided by empress dowager Cao. However, this was just the warm-up to a bitter and deadly political struggle between the two factions in the ensuing years: now both groups had had their ranks decimated, and all sorts of charges of criminal impropriety were our would be filed. Ouyang Xiu had even already been charged with incest, and placed in early retirement: the battle lines drawn, and Su Shi would soon be charged with treason to the state.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{surprise to}} emerge during the commission's inquiry {{did not come}} from one of the forty-six witnesses to testify, but from one who did not: A President Clarke moved back to the United States, and did not return for his scheduled testimony.

[...] As the Edmonton Journal put it, the only question left to answer was [...] "were the members of the government simple innocents whom Clarke worked through their credulity <b>or</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> in on it with him?" ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in Conflict Quarterly for The Journal of Conflict Studies, David Charters {{questioned}} why {{the book}} did not present {{more of an}} analysis on the aggregate impact {{of all of the}} disinformation campaigns, before noting such a task would be difficult to assess. The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including, [...] "Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target, and on U.S. relations with the country concerned, <b>or</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> merely of nuisance value?" [...] Conflict Quarterly criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency, writing, [...] "Without answers to questions such as these, it is difficult to accept, at face value, the authors' conclusions." [...] Charters concluded the book was [...] "a useful introduction to a field of knowledge which... is likely to continue to expand in importance for diplomats, the intelligence community, and scholars of international security affairs.|$|E

[...] Designer dog puppies sometimes bring higher prices than the purebreds from which they are bred.|$|E
