30|$|To {{execute a}} safety test for a route, the user needs {{to drive the}} {{tractor-trailer}} through a desired route, and can repeat this several times {{in order to test}} several possible driving conditions. After that, each unit <b>obstacle</b> <b>gains</b> a safety score, si, which integrates the three safety parameters (curvature score ci, narrow level ni, and safety range score li) according to the formula shown in Equation  6. We have adjusted these factors to be between 10 - 2 and 10 - 1 by multiplying them by a weight. In this case, the weight value for C was ten because the value of curvature lay mostly between 10 - 2 and 10 - 1 and would otherwise be too small to be of significance. For N and L, 1 / 4 and 1 / 3 were used respectively in order to diminish the value to between 10 - 2 and 10 - 1. The value of α, β and γ was determined by the relative importance of user cognition and the project type.|$|R

30|$|Additionally, {{nanomaterials}} are anticipated {{to cross}} biological <b>obstacles,</b> <b>gaining</b> {{entrance to the}} body and subsequently nano size may govern their kinetics, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion {{that would not be}} possible otherwise with the bulk material of akin composition [61, 66]. Well-defined gold and silver nanoparticles ranging within the 2 – 100  nm size and coated with antibodies have been reported to regulate the process of membrane receptor internalization leading to down regulate cellular expression level. This in turn alters the signalling processes and subsequently cellular responses, which are essential for basic cell functions. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that nanoparticles of 40 and 50  nm size have greater effects not only due to their passive interaction with biological entities or cells but also due to their active engagement in mediating the molecular processes that are essential for regulating cellular activities [67]. In another study, ferromagnetic nanomaterials of three different sizes (300, 150 and 30  nm) were investigated for their intrinsic peroxidase-like catalytic activity. Interestingly, these nanomaterials displayed different levels of activity towards studied substrate, wherein smaller sized ferromagnetic nanomaterial revealed higher catalytic activity in the order of 30  >  150  >  300 nm; since smaller particles have greater surface-to-volume ratio to interact with substrates [68].|$|R
