40|$|International audienceStructural and paleostress {{analyses}} {{provide new}} insights into the Quaternary kinematics of the outermost fold-and-thrust units of southwestern Taiwan Foothills. The frontal folds are interpreted as fault-related folds, and their tectonic evolution through space and time is tightly constrained. Fold development is correlated with reef building on top of the anticlines. Moreover, we provide field evidence that NW–SE fault zones <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> the structural <b>grain</b> of the belt probably acted as transfer fault zones during the the Quaternary fold-thrust emplacement. Two successive Quaternary stress regimes are evidenced in southwestern Taiwan: A NW–SE compression, followed by a recent nearly E–W compression. The latter shows an along-strike change from pure E–W contraction to the north to perpendicular N–S extension in the south. This southward decrease in N–S confinement probably represents the on-land signature of the incipient Quaternary tectonic escape predicted by analogue and numerical modelling and evidenced at present-day by Global Positioning System data...|$|R

The transition {{is the result of}} prograde metamorphism and takes place over 50 - 100 km without any structural or lithological breaks. Locally the orthopyroxene isograd is <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> the structural <b>grain</b> and transects greenstone belts, e. g., the Cross Lake belt. The greenstone belts in the granulite facies and adjacent lower grade domain consist mainly of mafic and (minor) ultramafic metavolcanics, and clastic and chemical metasedimentary rocks. Typical for the greenstone belts crossed by the orthopyroxene isograd are anorthositic gabbros and anorthosites, and plagiophyric mafic flows. The Pikwitonei granulite domain has been interpreted as to represent a lower crustal level which was uplifted to the present level of erosion. On the basis of gravimetric data this uplift has been modelled as an obduction onto the Churchill Province during the Hudsonian orogeny, similar to the Ivrea Zone. The fault between the Churchill and Superior Province is described...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} orogenic growth over-simplify the {{processes}} involved {{in the development of}} fold-and-thrust belts by failing to take into consideration along-strike irregularities of the collisional footwall. Inherited footwall geometries are fairly common and can drastically alter the shape of an advancing orogen during collision. In Taiwan, the geometry of the Chinese continental margin has been suggested to facilitate the development of several cross-structures, transverse structures that trend <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> the structural <b>grain</b> of the orogen, within the fold-and-thrust belt. These cross-structures are believed to accommodate deformation around a regional footwall promontory, the Peikang High. In total, six major tear fault zones have been identified in previous studies, though their interpretations are almost exclusively derived from surface deformation studies. For this study, a catalog of earthquake seismicity and earthquake focal mechanisms were used to evaluate and characterize the cross-structures at depth. Using the Gauss inversion method, best-fit stress tensors were derived for each study area and the associated preferred nodal planes of failure were extracted for spatial analyses. Results suggest that deformation patterns north and south of the crustal promontory are characterized by systems of conjugate faulting that facilitate brittle extrusion of foreland material as the orogen becomes caught up in collision with the irregular margin. The region around the promontory represents a narrow zone of southward propagating, en echelon tear faults that accommodate differential displacement of the advancing thrust sheets through time. Tear faulting is limited to the upper crustal layers and are necessary for the orogen to advance over the promontory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Quartz veins at the Mufferaw gold {{prospect}} and Komis gold deposit, northern Saskatchewan, {{are examples}} of oblique-extension veins that crystallized in shear and tensile frac-tures, which propagated and then opened <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> their walls during a single continuous deforma-tion event. The Mufferaw gold prospect consists of an interlinked mesh of conjugate shear fractures, tensile fractures, and veins. Oblique-extension veins crystallized in conjugate shear fractures, which opened during dilation of intersecting tensile fractures under the same far-field stress system. At the Komis gold mine, tensile and dextral shear fractures cut across granodiorite dikes. The tensile frac-tures formed perpendicular to the dike margins during stress transfer from the less-competent coun-try rocks to the more-competent dikes. During extension of the dikes <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> the bulk extension direction in the country rocks, the tensile fractures were reactivated as sinistral shear fractures. The reactivated tensile fractures and dextral shear fractures opened <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> their walls, parallel to the bulk extension direction, and were sealed by the deposition of oblique-extension veins during th...|$|R

30|$|According to DeMets et al. (1994), when a {{tectonic plate}} subducts {{at an angle}} that is <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> the trend of a trench, the trench {{parallel}} component decouples fore-arc slivers from the overlying plate and causes trench translation. India-Eurasia convergence is arc normal in the Central Himalaya, but to the west, it becomes <b>oblique</b> <b>to</b> the regional Himalayan structural trend (Malik and Nakata 2003; Kundu et al. 2014). This obliquity results in a shear component, which is manifested {{in the form of}} strike-slip faults. The identification of the KVF bears significant importance in corroborating the concept of oblique convergence and instituting it into northwest Himalaya (Malik et al. 2015).|$|R
