5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>energy</b> from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{tree with}} a perfect {{matching}} having degrees not greater than three {{is referred to as}} the Hückel tree. The ordering of Hückel trees according to <b>their</b> minimal <b>energies</b> is investigated by means of a quasi-ordering relation. Using a simpler method than that of Li [H. Li, On minimal energy ordering of acyclic conjugated molecules, J. Math.

25|$|Aneutronic fusion is {{any form}} of fusion power in which {{neutrons}} carry no more than 1% of the total released energy. The most-studied fusion reactions release up to 80% <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>energy</b> in neutrons.

25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} was producing enough energy in the resonators. As the electron passed the opening in the resonator they deposited some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>energy</b> as radio waves, but only a small amount. To generate useful amounts of radio energy, the electrons either had to pass the resonators multiple times to deposit more energy in total, or huge electron currents had to be used.

25|$|Aneutronic fusion loses much of {{its energy}} as light. This energy results from the {{acceleration}} and deceleration of charged particles.

The radiation can be estimated using the Larmor formula and comes in the X-ray, IR, UV and visible spectrum. Some of the energy radiated as X-rays may be converted directly to electricity. Because of the photoelectric effect, X-rays passing through an array of conducting foils transfer some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>energy</b> to electrons, which can then be captured electrostatically. Since X-rays can go through far greater material thickness than electrons, many hundreds or thousands of layers are needed to absorb the X-rays.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} as a {{child could}} result in physical inactivity as an adult.

Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as fat. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and fed them 50% more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>energy</b> required every day through fats and carbohydrates.

25|$|Once the {{nucleosynthesis}} process {{arrives at}} iron-56, {{the continuation of}} this process consumes energy (the addition of fragments to nuclei releases less energy than required to break them off the parent nuclei). If {{the mass of the}} core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, electron degeneracy pressure will be unable to support its weight against the force of gravity, and the core will undergo sudden, catastrophic collapse to form a neutron star or (in the case of cores that exceed the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), a black hole. Through a process that is not completely understood, some of the gravitational potential energy released by this core collapse is converted into a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II supernova. It is known that the core collapse produces a massive surge of neutrinos, as observed with supernova SN 1987A. The extremely energetic neutrinos fragment some nuclei; some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>energy</b> is consumed in releasing nucleons, including neutrons, and some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>energy</b> is transformed into heat and kinetic energy, thus augmenting the shock wave started by rebound of some of the infalling material from the collapse of the core. Electron capture in very dense parts of the infalling matter may produce additional neutrons. Because some of the rebounding matter is bombarded by the neutrons, some of its nuclei capture them, creating a spectrum of heavier-than-iron material including the radioactive elements up to (and likely beyond) uranium. Although non-exploding red giants can produce significant quantities of elements heavier than iron using neutrons released in side reactions of earlier nuclear reactions, the abundance of elements heavier than iron (and in particular, of certain isotopes of elements that have multiple stable or long-lived isotopes) produced in such reactions is quite different from that produced in a supernova. Neither abundance alone matches that found in the Solar System, so both supernovae and ejection of elements from red giants are required to explain the observed abundance of heavy elements and isotopes thereof.|$|E
