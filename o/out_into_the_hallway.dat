5|$|At a hotel, Borat, {{just out}} of the bath, sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the Baywatch booklet. An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real motive for {{traveling}} to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones, which spills <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed convention ballroom. The two are finally separated by security guards.|$|E
500|$|According to Darryl Dawkins' autobiography, Bavetta was officiating an NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Earl Strom as his partner for that game. Bavetta {{overruled}} Strom on a crucial last-second personal foul call against the Nets, {{which would have}} been a victory for the 76ers. When the game ended and players were walking to their respective locker rooms, the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was allegedly ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?" [...] Strom was fined for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Strom was officiating a NBA game {{during the}} mid-1970s between the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets with Dick Bavetta as his partner for that game. The game was close {{at the end}} and Earl made a last-second call against the Nets, ending the game with a win for Sixers. Suddenly Dick Bavetta ran across floor to the scorer's table, saying, [...] "No! No! I got a push off against McGinnis!" [...] Strom then {{challenged}} Bavetta, [...] "Are you overruling my call? I got pushing off right here!" [...] Bavetta insisted, which reversed Strom's call and the Nets wound up with the victory. With the game over, players were walking to their respective locker rooms when the door to the referees' locker room flew open and Dick Bavetta came staggering out. His uniform was ripped and he was wearing a big welt over his eye, running to get away from Strom. Strom stepped <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and hollered after Bavetta, [...] "You'll take another one of my fucking calls again, right, you motherfucker?"

5000|$|Spann {{was popular}} with students, {{not only for}} his lectures which would spill <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> at <b>the</b> University, but also for mid-summer festivals which he would hold in the woods where he would teach that [...] "the ability to intuit {{essences}} was nurtured by jumping over the fire..." [...] (Caldwell 2004, 138-9) ...|$|R

5000|$|While {{little is}} {{revealed}} about Haruhis origins or her family, she cites a revelatory incident in her childhood when she attended {{a baseball game}} with her family. Before the event, Haruhi tended to think of herself and her life as being special and interesting, but {{the sheer number of}} people packed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stadium (and her later calculations that this only represented {{a small fraction of the}} population of Japan) caused her to come to the conclusion that the events of her life likely fit <b>into</b> <b>the</b> normal, everyday occurrences and habits of Japanese citizens and humans in general. Her belief that there had to be at least one person in the world who lived a truly interesting and unique life, and her desire to be that person, led her to begin a search for the extraordinary. Throughout middle school she gained a reputation as an eccentric, for incidents including painting hieroglyphs on the school grounds, moving all of <b>the</b> schools desks <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallways,</b> and going <b>out</b> with and then dumping every boy who asked her out. (Her excuse for quick relationships is that they were boring; the longest lasted a week or so, with the shortest being about five minutes.) ...|$|R

500|$|Not all Capitol hauntings {{are related}} to people who worked there. The [...] "Demon Cat" [...] is alleged to prowl the halls of Congress, and make {{appearances}} just before a national tragedy or change in Presidential administration. It was first seen {{in the early part}} of the 19th century, and a night watchman shot at it in 1862. It has also been seen by other night watchmen and members of the Capitol Police. It appeared before the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the October 1929 stock market crash, and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The cat has not only been seen in the halls, but has repeatedly appeared in Washington's Tomb. The Tomb (two levels below the crypt beneath the Capitol Rotunda) was an original feature of the Capitol, planned as a resting place for George Washington and members of his family. The Washington family politely declined the offer. The Tomb stands empty, although from 1865 to 2009 (when it was moved to the United States Capitol Visitor Center) the Lincoln catafalque was stored there. The specters of at least two soldiers are also said to haunt the Capitol. A few eyewitnesses have claimed that whenever an individual lies in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a World War I doughboy momentarily appears, salutes, then disappears. A second apparition, which eyewitnesses say is the ghost of an American Revolutionary War soldier, has also appeared at the Washington Tomb. According to several stories, the soldier appears, moves around the Lincoln catafalque, and then passes <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> before disappearing.|$|R

5000|$|On 31 August 1918, {{commissioner}} Hillier and a {{detachment of}} Cheka [...] "scouts", the Bolsheviks secret police, {{went to the}} British embassy in Petrograd. On entering the building, shouting in Russian and crashing doors, which echoed up from the embassy ground floor where staff were working, Captain Cromie glanced out from his office first floor window, saw trucks and over on the neva river patrol boats facing the embassy building with weapons trained. Clearly expecting trouble, {{he pulled out his}} revolver, and leaving a meeting with three operatives in his office, had gone <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first floor <b>hallway</b> passage. Other accounts and sources, however, reveal Captain Cromie was having tea with the British Chaplain, Mr. Lombard, and he had stepped out of the room to return in a short moment. Some Cheka scouts were now also proceeding up onto the embassy first floor, panic and protests broke out, and they were met with gunfire, one Cheka scout was killed and another wounded. According to the Cheka scouts report of events and a dispatch received from Moscow quoting Russia's political newspaper Pravda; a fight had ensued in the corridor and the Cheka scouts were obliged to return gunfire. During the ferocious embassy shootout, naval attaché Captain Cromie, received a fatal gunshot or gunshots, and eventually died where he fell, on the grand embassy staircase. Cheka scouts continued searching the embassy building, and with their rifle butts repelled embassy staff from getting close to the corpse of Captain Cromie, which the Cheka's had looted and trampled. The police then entered the British embassy, and 40 embassy persons were arrested, mostly British subjects, including Prince Schaschowsky. It was alleged that weapons and compromising documents were found on the embassy premises.|$|R
