5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E
5|$|The book {{includes}} recipes still current, such as pancakes, haggis, {{and salad}} <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> flowers with vinaigrette sauce, {{as well as}} some not often made, such as mortis, a sweet chicken pâté. Some dishes have familiar names, such as trifle, but different ingredients from those used today.|$|E
5|$|Cacti show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genus Pereskia, the branches are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E

A forensic audit ordered by the school board established that Botha was allegedly paying herself unauthorised cash in lieu <b>of</b> <b>leave</b> with authorisation from Tirivavi without the school board's knowledge. Botha had received US$518,007 from the school as payment of cash in lieu <b>of</b> <b>leave</b> <b>and</b> overstated bonuses.

5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
5|$|The Danger Tree {{had been}} part of a clump of trees located about halfway into No Man's Land and had {{originally}} been used as a landmark by a Newfoundland Regiment trench raiding party {{in the days before the}} Battle of the Somme. British and German artillery bombardments eventually stripped the tree <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> left nothing more than a shattered tree trunk. During the Newfoundland Regiment's infantry assault, the tree was once again used as a landmark, where the troops were ordered to gather. The tree was however a highly visible landmark for the German artillery and the site proved to be a location where the German shrapnel was particularly deadly. As a result, the regiment suffered a large concentration of casualties around the tree. A replica representation of the twisted tree now stands at the spot.|$|E

5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy {{rhizomes}} of C.australis {{are high in}} natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a large type of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used to sweeten other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.|$|E
5|$|These ground rollers feed {{primarily}} on invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, and worms, which they find by searching through deep leaf litter or by remaining still and watching attentively. The ground roller primarily runs through its habitat on its strong legs, as its wings are relatively weak. It is a monogamous species, and it defends a territory during the breeding season of October to February. It digs a tunnel in the sand, {{at the end}} of which is a wider chamber where it makes its nest out <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> earthy pellets. Two to four eggs are laid. After the chicks fledge, the birds continue living in family groups until at least February before dispersing more widely across the scrubland.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man 2 is a {{platform}} and action game like its predecessor, Mega Man. The player controls Mega Man as he traverses eight stages {{to defeat the}} bosses, Dr. Wily's Robot Masters: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage related to their weapon's power. For example, Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky-themed level, while Wood Man can use a shield <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> is found in a forest-themed stage. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon becomes available to the player. The Robot Masters have weaknesses to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing {{the order in which}} the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay. After completing certain stages, Mega Man receives a special item. These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that he otherwise could not.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid (Aphis fabae) {{is a small}} black insect in the Aphis genus, with a broad, soft body, {{a member of the}} order Hemiptera. Other common names include blackfly, bean aphid and beet leaf aphid. In the warmer months of the year it is found in large numbers on the undersides <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> on the growing tips of host plants, {{including}} various agricultural crops and many wild and ornamental plants. Both winged and wingless forms exist and at this time of year, they are all females. They suck sap from stems and leaves and cause distortion of the shoots, stunted plants, reduced yield and spoiled crops. This aphid also acts as a vector for viruses that cause plant disease and the honeydew it secretes may encourage the growth of sooty mould. It breeds profusely by live birth but its numbers are kept in check, especially in the later part of the summer, by various predatory and parasitic insects. Ants feed on the honeydew it produces and take active steps to remove the aphid's enemies. It is a widely distributed pest of agricultural crops and can be controlled by chemical or biological means. In the autumn, winged forms move to different host plants where both males and females are produced. These mate and the females lay eggs which overwinter.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird {{visitors}} to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to damping off. Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in a cooler conditions (due either to latitude or altitude) can delay flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and has done well in cultivation in England. The Royal Horticultural Society gave it an Award of Merit in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on Mount Wellington.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae {{contains}} social species, primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; P. exigua attaches its nests on the underside <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like A. multipicta and V. germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions.|$|E

25|$|Some twentieth-century {{artists and}} architects, {{including}} Le Corbusier and Dalí, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially {{in the form}} of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing.
