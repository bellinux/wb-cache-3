He followed the traditions <b>of</b> <b>improvisation</b> of Ukrainian kobzars, who would interpret every new strophe differently.

5|$|German East Africa, {{acquired}} by Germany during the 1880s, covered roughly , and by 1914 {{was home to}} about 5,000 white settlers, {{most of whom were}} of German origin. German East African soldiery at the outbreak of war comprised 216 German officers and enlisted men, and 2,450 askaris (native soldiers); police numbered 45 whites and 2,154 askaris. Because of the British Royal Navy's domination of the Indian Ocean, German East Africa was largely isolated from outside help. It therefore fought a war <b>of</b> <b>improvisation,</b> judicious resource management and unorthodox strategy. During the conflict, its military strength grew to a peak of 3,300 whites and anywhere between 15,000 and 30,000 askaris, all commanded by Generalmajor Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.|$|E

The niraval is followed by kalpanaswarams.|$|E

The film (where her partner was Igor Kostolevsky) remained one of Vertinskaya's all time favorites. The officials, however, disliked it.|$|E

25|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to advance methods <b>of</b> <b>improvisation</b> and active listening, proposing live audio soundscapes that mesh canine sounds with electroacoustic practice. In the process of {{developing}} this performance, a custom built theremin, that incorporates a rug as an interface, was created to allow Tom to use scratch and digging gestures to create sound, accompanied by a diverse range of vocalization. These studio performances are audio recorded for use later in the live performance where they are remixed into a new experimental improvisational soundscape. Andreyev accompanies Tom's vocals and rhythms with her own live theremin and software performance.|$|E
25|$|But Bashir himself rarely {{spent his}} time in Baghdad and finally left the country after the First Gulf War in 1991. Guest {{performances}} mainly in Europe offered him a big open-minded audience, and therefore an excellent platform for the presentation of his meanwhile very original and mature style <b>of</b> <b>improvisation</b> and composition. Most of his records were also recorded in Europe. In his last years he aimed at making his son Omar his musical successor. A duo-recording of Bashir and Omar made in February 1994 {{is considered to be}} a classic of Bashir's Œuvre, because of its exemplary combination of traditional – mainly folk – material mixed with improvisation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} central qualities shared by African music and jazz, most {{prominently}} the importance <b>of</b> <b>improvisation.</b> Some instrumental qualities from African music {{that appear in}} jazz (especially its drumming) include using unpitched instruments to produce specific musical tones or tone-like qualities, using all instruments to imitate the human voice, superimposition of one rhythmic structure onto another (e.g., {{a group of three}} against a group of two), dividing a regular section of time (called a measure in musical terms) into groups of two and three, and the use of repetitive rhythms used throughout a musical piece, often called clave rhythms. This last quality is one of special importance, as there are several pronounced occurrences of this pattern and the aesthetics that accompany it in the world of jazz.|$|E

25|$|Since chance {{procedures}} {{were used by}} Cage to eliminate the composer's and the performer's likes and dislikes from music, Cage disliked the concept <b>of</b> <b>improvisation,</b> which is inevitably linked to the performer's preferences. In a number of works beginning in the 1970s, he found ways to incorporate improvisation. In Child of Tree (1975) and Branches (1976) the performers are asked to use certain species of plants as instruments, for example the cactus. The structure of the pieces is determined through the chance of their choices, as is the musical output; the performers {{had no knowledge of}} the instruments. In Inlets (1977) the performers play large water-filled conch shells – by carefully tipping the shell several times, it is possible to achieve a bubble forming inside, which produced sound. Yet, as it is impossible to predict when this would happen, the performers had to continue tipping the shells – as a result the performance was dictated by pure chance.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea was}} partly {{inspired}} by the portrayal of local politics on the HBO drama series The Wire, {{as well as the}} renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the 2008 United States presidential election. The staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of The Office. The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with The Office, particularly the mockumentary approach and the encouragement <b>of</b> <b>improvisation</b> among the cast, even though the episodes were scripted. The series was scheduled as a mid-season replacement, and was rushed into production to meet the premiere date of April 9, 2009. Before the title Parks and Recreation was chosen, the name Public Service was considered, but ultimately rejected because network officials {{did not want to be}} accused of mocking the idea.|$|E
25|$|Although jazz is {{considered}} highly difficult to define, {{at least in}} part because it contains so many varied subgenres, improvisation is consistently regarded as being one of its key elements. The centrality <b>of</b> <b>improvisation</b> in jazz is attributed to influential earlier forms of music: the early blues, a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of the African-American slaves on plantations. These were commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early blues was also highly improvisational. European classical music performance is evaluated by its fidelity to the musical score, with much less discretion over interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment: the classical performer's primary goal is to play a composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized as the product of group creativity, interaction, and collaboration, which places varying degrees of value on the contributions of the composer (if there is one) and performers. In jazz, the skilled performer will interpret a tune in very individual ways, never playing the same composition the same way twice; depending on the performer's mood and personal experience, interactions with other musicians, or even members of the audience, a jazz musician may alter melodies, harmonies or time signature at will.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the concept <b>of</b> collective <b>improvisation</b> and draws out its potentials {{for social and}} political theory. Translating the ideas <b>of</b> collective <b>improvisation</b> from their original context in the theatre into the field of political thought, I argue that they offer {{a new understanding of}} political action by reevaluating the concepts of dissensus (Rancière) and community (Nancy), as well as the ways in which politics as a system needs to produce collectively binding decisions (Luhmann). I conclude that the ideas inherent in the practice <b>of</b> collective <b>improvisation,</b> as it has been developed within the tradition <b>of</b> modern theatre <b>improvisation,</b> subvert our intuitive ways of thinking about politics and thereby offer an alternative model of being and acting together...|$|R
