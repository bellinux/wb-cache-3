40|$|ABSTRACT: Synostosis {{also known}} as <b>occipitalization</b> of the atlas is a rare {{congenital}} malformation at craniovertebral junction. Atlas, the first cervical vertebra forms the ellipsoidal synovial joints with the condyles of the occipital bone. Rarely it gets occipitalized where the condyles fuse with the lateral masses of the atlas. During the morphometric study of hundred skulls in Department of Anatomy, Sri Guru Ram Das Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Vallah, two skulls showed the incomplete <b>occipitalization</b> of the atlas vertebrae. The partial or complete assimilation of atlas may have resulted due to the disruption in the separation of caudal {{part of the first}} sclerotome from the cranial part of the first sclerotome.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{anatomic}} changes in a case of <b>occipitalization</b> of the atlas. METHODS: <b>Occipitalization</b> of the atlas was found accidentally in a 64 -year-old male cadaver. Anatomic dissection was carried out to examine the posterior aspect of the upper cervical region and craniocervical junction. The occipitalized atlas was then harvested and macerated to study the bony anomaly. RESULTS: In this case of <b>occipitalization,</b> fusion was observed at both lateral masses and at the left posterior hemiarch of the atlas. We found the following soft tissue changes: the rectus capitis posterior minor muscle was lacking on the left side and was atrophic on the right, the obliquus capitis superior muscle was present on both sides showing moderate atrophy and fatty changes. The posterior atlanto-axial membrane was thinner and asymmetric, had a free edge on the right side. Lateral to this edge the dura was lying free. We believe that these changes of the posterior atlanto-axial membrane together with the increased distance between the fused posterior arch of the atlas and the lamina of the axis could cause the observed "dura bulge" at this level. The vertebral artery was entering the skull through a canal on the left side. CONCLUSIONS: In our case, <b>occipitalization</b> considerably changed the anatomy of the upper cervical spine and craniocervical junction. Special care must be taken when using the posterior approach to avoid neurovascular injury in cases with <b>occipitalization...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the incidence of <b>occipitalization</b> of the atlas among Thai dried skulls, in order to contribute to baseline awareness of this condition. Materials and methods. The skulls of 633 adult Thais from the collection maintained in the Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand, were examined for evidence of <b>occipitalization</b> of the atlas.

40|$|Study Design. A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} 33 consecutive Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) patients {{at a single}} institution. Objectives. To assess in KFS patients the presence and degree of radiographic segmental motion at the atlanto-axial junction, factors contributing to such motion, and associated clinical manifestations. Summary of Background Data. Studies suggest that abnormal segmentation in KFS patients may result in cervical hypermobility, increasing {{the risk of developing}} neurologic compromise and the need for surgical intervention. The use of the anterior and posterior atlantodens interval (AADI/PADI) has gained interest as a method for assessing atlantoaxial instability and for space available for the cord. Although helpful for identifying instability after trauma, these measurements are not understood in KFS patients. In addition, the effects of the fusion process associated with KFS on atlantoaxial motion and associated clinical findings have not been properly addressed. Methods. Radiographs were analyzed for the presence of <b>occipitalization,</b> number/location of congenially fused segments, and the AADI and PADI. Results. There were 15 males and 18 females (mean age, 13. 9 years). <b>Occipitalization</b> occurred in 48. 5 % of patients. A fused C 2 -C 3 segment was noted in 72. 7 % of cases. More motion with respect to AADI was evident on O-C 1 and C 2 -C 3 fusion only patients, which were all asymptomatic. Overall, 24. 2 % of patients were symptomatic. Mean AADI and PADI difference was 2. 0 mm (symptomatic: mean, 1. 5 mm; asymptomatic: mean, 2. 1 mm) and - 1. 7 mm (symptomatic: mean, - 1. 0 mm; asymptomatic: mean, - 2. 0 mm), respectively (P > 0. 05). Conclusions. Hypermobility of the atlantoaxial junction, as indicated by increased AADI on flexion-extension radiographs, is not necessarily associated with an increased risk for the development of symptoms or neurologic signs in the KFS patient. <b>Occipitalization</b> plays an integral role in the degree of motion at the atlantoaxial region. Greatest AADI values were in patients with <b>occipitalization</b> and a fused C 2 -C 3 segment. The presence of symptoms was not related to the degree of AADI change. Evaluation of the PADI provides additional information for identifying patients at risk for developing symptoms. Nonetheless, KFS patients remain largely asymptomatic. © 2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN. A {{retrospective}} study. OBJECTIVES. To {{address the}} role of congenitally fused cervical segments, the degree of cervical scoliosis, and other risk factors {{on the presence of}} Sprengel's deformity (SD) in young patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Numerous abnormalities are associated with KFS, {{one of the most common}} being SD. It has been postulated that more severe forms of KFS may be more associated with extraspinal manifestations, such as SD. METHODS. Thirty KFS patients from a single institution were reviewed. Cervical neutral lateral/dynamic/ anteroposterior and thoracic anteroposterior plain radiographs were assessed. Radiographically, <b>occipitalization</b> (O-C 1), number of congenitally fused segments (C 1 -T 1), classification type (Types I-III), degree of cervical scoliosis, and the presence of SD was assessed. Clinical chart review entailed patient demographics and evidence of the clinical assessment of SD. The threshold for statistical significance was P 0. 05), classification type (P > 0. 05), and scoliosis (P = 0. 702). CONCLUSION. SD occurred in 16. 7 % of KFS patients. Sex type, number of congenitally fused segments, specific fused patterns, <b>occipitalization,</b> classification type, and the degree of cervical scoliosis did not seem to be significantly associated with the presence of SD in KFS patients in our series. Thorough examination for the presence and degree of SD in KFS is necessary, irrespective of the extent of cervical abnormalities. Alternatively, the treating physician should not dismiss a thorough cervical spine examination in patients with SD, evaluating factors that may predispose the KFS patient to an increased risk of neurologic injury. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{outline the}} {{development}} of the spine and skull, particularly of axis, atlas and occipital bone. As neuro-skeletal dysmorphisms, the occipito-cervical malformations belong to the neurodysplastic group. They are classified as skeletal anomalies, associated nervous malformations and meningeal reactions. Vertebralization of the occipital bone and <b>occipitalization</b> of atlas, subluxation of odontoid process, dysplasia of the occipital bone, dystrophia brevicollis and other anomalies are discussed. Special care is given to the study of basilar impression; its concept, history, incidence, clinical and neurological symptoms, radiological characterization (craniographic, perimyelographic and iodoventriculographic aspects) and surgical treatment are reviewed. The authors report five cases of occipito-cervical malformations, which are the first references in Brazilian literature. In case 1 the anomalies (manifestation of occipital vertebra and Arnold-Chiari deformity) were disclosed at an operation for cisticercosis of the posterior fossa. In the following four cases invagination of the basilar portion of the occipital bone (basilar impression) could be radiologically demonstrated; in case 2 a suboccipital craniectomy and a laminectomy of atlas and axis were performed but the patient died a week later and the necroscopic examination confirmed the neuro-skeletal anomalies. In all cases there were several associated malformations. In case 2 there were <b>occipitalization</b> of the atlas, fusion of the first and second cervical vertebrae, supernumerary rib of the seventh cervical vertebra, supernumerary lumbar vertebra, and Arnold-Chiari deformity; at necropsy it was found a syringomyelic cyst on the cervical cord and a fibrous dural ring over the foramen magnum. Case 3 showed the syndrome of Klippel-Feil, besides supernumerary ribs of the seventh cervical and first dorsal vertebrae, Arnold-Chiari malfotmation and probable aplasia of cell groups in the nuclei of oculomotor and facial nerves. In case 4 there were <b>occipitalization</b> of atlas and Chiari deformity. In case 5 vertebral reduction in the cervical region was evidenced but bony coalescence could not be proved. In the last four cases the constitutional morphologic type was determined. Electroencephalograms of cases 3, 4 and 5 showed no abnormalities; in case 1 slow bilateral occipital waves were recorded. The authors call attention to the importance of the diagnosis of these anomalies susceptible of successful surgical correction, which can simulate many nervous diseases of untoward course, like lateral amyotrophic sclerosis, syringomyelia (which can be actually associated to the bony anomaly, as in case 2), sclerosis of dorsal funiculi of the spinal cord, tabes, multiple sclerosis, heredocerebellar ataxia, etc. The authors also stress the clinico-radiological differences between basilar impression and platybasia, frequently taken as synonyms. Although both anomalies may coexist (as in cases 4 and 5) their association is not an absolute rule; on the contrary, in case 2 the basal angle was in the inferior limit of normality and in case 3 it was much lower. Emphasis is put on the value of the Chamberlain's line and chiefly in the McGregor basal line for the correct diagnosis of basilar invagination of the occipital bone...|$|E

Neurologic examination revealed increased deep tendon reflexes and positive pathologic reflexes. Radiographs showed <b>occipitalization</b> of the atlas, C 2 –C 3 congenital fusion and fixed atlantoaxial dislocation with an atlanto-dental interval of 10  mm. MRI demonstrated cervicomedullary junction (CMJ) compression from the odontoid, a Chiari type I malformation, and syringomyelia extending from the foramen magnum to C 5. The patient underwent transoral atlantoaxial release followed by posterior internal fixation from the occiput to the axis, which resulted in a significant improvement in motor function in all extremities.

40|$|Background: The {{chromosome}} abnormality, deletion of 22 q 11. 2, {{is one of}} {{the most}} common genetic syndromes. The 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome encompasses a wide spectrum of abnormalities including cardiac, palate, and im-munological anomalies. The purposes of the current study were (1) to define and determine the frequency of varia-tions of the occiput and cervical spine on plain radiographs in patients with the 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome and (2) to postulate the potential clinical importance of these variations. Methods: Seventy-nine consecutive patients with the 22 q 11. 2 deletion underwent clinical and radiographic evalua-tion of the occiput and cervical spine. Radiographic studies included lateral plain radiographs of the cervical spine in neutral, flexion, and extension; anteroposterior radiographs; and open-mouth odontoid radiographs. Results: At least one developmental variation of the occiput or cervical spine was observed in every patient. The oc-cipital variations were platybasia in fifty-two (91 %) of the fifty-seven patients for whom data were available and basilar impression in two (3 %) of the seventy-nine patients. The atlas variations were dysmorphic shape in fifty-nine (75 %) of the seventy-nine patients, open posterior arch in forty-seven (59 %) of the seventy-nine patients, and <b>occipitalization</b> in two (3 %) of the seventy-one patients with adequate radiographs.

40|$|Klippel–Feil {{syndrome}} (KFS) is {{an uncommon}} condition noted primarily as congenital fusion {{of two or}} more cervical vertebrae. Superior odontoid migration (SOM) has been noted in various skeletal deformities and entails an upward/vertical migration of the odontoid process into the foramen magnum with depression of the cranium. Excessive SOM could potentially threaten neurologic integrity. Risk factors associated with the amount of SOM in the KFS patient are based on conjecture and have not been addressed in the literature. Therefore, this study evaluated the presence and extent of SOM and the various risk factors and clinical manifestations associated therein in patients with KFS. Twenty-seven KFS patients with no prior history of surgical intervention of the cervical spine were included for a prospective radiographic and retrospective clinical review. Radiographically, McGregor’s line was utilized to evaluate the degree of SOM. Anterior and posterior atlantodens intervals (AADI/PADI), number of fused segments (C 1 –T 1), presence of <b>occipitalization,</b> classification-type, and lateral and coronal cervical alignments were also evaluated. Clinically, patient demographics and presence of cervical symptoms were assessed. Radiographic and clinical evaluations were conducted by two independent blinded observers. There were 8 males and 19 females {{with a mean age of}} 13. 5  years at the time of radiographic and clinical assessment. An overall mean SOM of 5. 0  mm (range = − 1. 0 to 19. 0  mm) was noted. C 2 –C 3 (74. 1 %) was the most commonly fused segment. A statistically significant difference was not found between the amount of SOM to age, sex-type, classification-type, AADI, PADI, and lateral cervical alignment (P >  0. 05). A statistically significant greater amount of SOM was found as the number of fused segments increased (r =  0. 589; P =  0. 001) and if such levels included <b>occipitalization</b> (r =  0. 616; P =  0. 001). A statistically significant greater amount of SOM was also found with an increase in coronal cervical alignment (r =  0. 413; P =  0. 036). Linear regression modeling further supported these findings as the strongest predictive variables contributing to an increase in SOM. A 7. 20 crude relative risk (RR) ratio [95 % confidence interval (CI)  =  1. 05 – 49. 18; risk differences (RD)  =  0. 52] was noted in contributing to a SOM greater than 4. 5  mm if four or more segments were fused. Adjusting for coronal cervical alignment greater than 10 °, five or more fused segments were found to significantly increase the RR of a SOM greater than 4. 5  mm (RR =  4. 54; 95 % CI =  1. 07 – 19. 50; RD =  0. 48). The RR of a SOM greater than 4. 5  mm was more pronounced in females (RR =  1. 68; 95 % CI =  0. 45 – 6. 25; RD =  0. 17) than in males. Eight patients (29. 6 %) were symptomatic, of which symptoms in two of these patients stemmed from a traumatic event. However, a statistically significant difference was not found between the presence of symptoms to the amount of SOM and other exploratory variables (P >  0. 05). A mean SOM of 5. 0  mm was found in our series of KFS patients. In such patients, increases in the number of congenitally fused segments and in the degree of coronal cervical alignment were strongly associated risk factors contributing to an increase in SOM. Patients with four or greater congenitally fused segments had an approximately sevenfold increase in the RR in developing SOM greater than 4. 5  mm. A higher RR of SOM more than 4. 5  mm may be associated with sex-type. However, 4. 5  mm or greater SOM is not synonymous with symptoms in this series. Furthermore, the presence of symptoms was not statistically correlated with the amount of SOM. The treating physician should be cognizant of such potential risk factors, which could also help to indicate the need for further advanced imaging studies in such patients. This study suggests that as motion segments diminish and coronal cervical alignment is altered, the odontoid orientation is located more superiorly, which may increase the risk of neurologic sequelae...|$|E
40|$|Study design. : A {{prospective}} radiographic and retrospective clinical chart review. Objective. : This study {{evaluated the}} role of congenitally fused cervical segments {{in relation to the}} space available for the cord (SAC) and associated cervical spine-related symptoms (CSS) in patients with Klippel-Feil Syndrome (KFS). Summary of background data. : KFS is a developmental disorder presenting with congenital fusion of at least 2 cervical vertebrae. The effects of congenitally fused cervical segments in relation to the SAC and associated symptoms in KFS patients remain speculative and have not been thoroughly addressed in the literature. Methods. : At a single institution, a prospective radiographic and clinical evaluation of 29 KFS patients was conducted. Based on plain radiographs, assessment of the SAC consisted of the posterior atlantodens interval, the midvertebral body SAC (C 2 -C 7), and the interbody SAC (C 2 -C 3 -C 7 -T 1). Vertebral body width (VBW) from C 2 to C 7 and the presence of <b>occipitalization</b> (O-C 1) were also noted. Torg ratios were obtained at each level. Demographics, medical history, and the presence of CSS were noted based on clinical chart review. Results. : Ten males and 19 females were reviewed (mean age, 13. 4 years). A significant correlation was noted between the overall VBWs to the number of fused segments, age, and skeletal maturity (P 0. 05). In the presence of a fused segment, individualized SAC levels tended to have greater canal dimensions and cephalad/caudal VBWs were less. Cephalad and caudal Torg ratios in relation to a segment were greater in all fused segments, and with 4 or greater fused segments (P 0. 05). Symptomatic patients had smaller VBWs than nonsymptomatic patients (P = 0. 027) and an overall decrease in SAC at the interbody disc level, primarily at C 6 -C 7 (P > 0. 05). Smaller Torg ratios were noted in symptomatic patients, specifically myelopathic patients. Conclusion. : Congenital fusion in KFS may arrest the normal vertebral development, which may affect appositional bone growth. Such effects on the VBW could potentially contribute to an increase in the SAC. Such a development may delay neurologic compromise stemming from the congenital fusion process and subsequent degenerative manifestations. © 2008, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Study Design. A case report. Objective. To {{report the}} {{occurrence}} of a herniated cervical disc following a high-impact activity in a pediatric Klippel-Feil patient who presented with spinal cord compression, myelopathy, and myelomalacia requiring posterior instrumented fusion followed by an anterior discectomy and fusion at the hypermobile nonfused segment. Summary of Background Data. The primary hallmark of Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS) {{is the presence of}} at least one congenially fused cervical segment. Studies have reported the potential risk of cervical injury from hypermobility associated with the nonfused cervical segment in KFS. The manifestation of a cervical disc herniation in the pediatric KFS patient is rare. To the authors' knowledge, the development of a symptomatic cervical herniated disc attributed to mechanical fatigue following a high-impact activity has not been addressed in the literature with respect to the pediatric KFS patient having extensive cervical fusion and a hypermobile segment. Methods. A 16. 8 -year-old KFS boy with <b>occipitalization</b> of C 1 and fusion of C 2 -C 3 and C 4 -T 1 presented with myelopathy, severe cord compression, and myelomalacia stemming from a left-sided herniated cervical disc at C 3 -C 4 with onset following an 8 -foot high rooftop jump. On radiographic evaluation, the patient's C 3 -C 4 segment was hypermobile. Results. The patient was operatively managed via a same-day combined posterior-anterior procedure. The posterior aspect of the procedure entailed a posterior lateral mass plate-screw fixation at C 3 -C 4 with autologous iliac crest bone fusion. Anteriorly, a discectomy was performed at C 3 -C 4 with application of an interbody tricortical autograft. After surgery, the patient wore a halo vest for 3 months, followed by a soft collar for an additional 3 months. On final follow-up at 39 months, the patient was asymptomatic with no instrumentation-related complications, fusion of the posterior graft-bed and anterior interbody graft was noted, and cervical alignment was maintained. Conclusions. A hypermobile segment in the pediatric KFS patient is a risk factor that may lead to cord compression. A symptomatic herniated cervical disc may develop from an excessive mechanical load stress in a pediatric KFS patient with multiple fused segments. In such a patient, a same-day combined posterior-anterior procedure provides cord decompression and stabilizes the spine with a favorable outcome. © 2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Morphological {{deviations}} of the cervical vertebral column {{have been described}} in relation to craniofacial aberrations and syndromes. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that abnormal morphology of upper cervical vertebrae is associated with malformation of the jaws and occlusion. Accordingly, it is relevant to focus on similar associations in patients with skeletal malocclusions. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study are}} to: Identify the anomalies of the cervical column in patients with skeletal malocclusionsDetermine the association between cervical vertebral anomalies and skeletal malocclusions. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 90 subjects at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Pakistan. The inclusion criteria were: (1) Pakistani origin; (2) standardized pretreatment profile radiograph with first six cervical vertebrae visible; and (3) accessibility of the second-profile radiograph (mid- or posttreatment). The exclusion criteria were: (1) A prior history of orthodontic treatment; (2) any craniofacial anomaly; and (3) systemic muscle or joint disorder. Lateral cephalograms of all subjects (n = 90) were traced by the principal investigator and sagittal jaw relationship was assessed. A total of 30 subjects each with skeletal Class I, Class II, and Class III malocclusions were selected and the cervical vertebral anomalies were observed on their cephalometric radiographs. The frequencies of cervical vertebral anomalies according to skeletal malocclusion categories and gender were analyzed with the Chi-square test, whereas association of cervical vertebral anomalies with skeletal malocclusions was assessed with logistic regression analysis. The level of significance (P ≤ 0. 05) was used for the statistical tests. Results: Most common anomaly observed in the three groups was fusion between C 2 and C 3 (P = 0. 006). This anomaly was found in 20 % of subjects with skeletal Class I, 50 % of subjects with skeletal Class II and 53. 3 % with skeletal Class III malocclusions. The highest frequencies of partial cleft at the level of C 1 and <b>occipitalization</b> were observed in subjects with skeletal Class II and III malocclusions, respectively. However, none of the subjects showed fusion between C 1 and C 2 or dehiscence. No statistically significant gender difference was found in the occurrence of morphological {{deviations of}} the cervical column. The association of cervical vertebral anomaly was found to be the highest with skeletal Class III and lowest with skeletal Class I malocclusions. Conclusion: Fusion between C 2 and C 3 seems to be the most commonly occurring anomaly. This anomaly seems to be more often associated with skeletal Class III than skeletal Class I or Class II malocclusions...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN. A case report. OBJECTIVE. To raise {{awareness}} {{of the development of}} atlantoaxial rotatory fixation (AARF) in the setting of congenital vertebral anomalies/malformations. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Klippel-Feil Syndrome (KFS) is a complex, heterogeneous condition noted as congenital fusion of 2 or more cervical vertebrae with or without spinal or extraspinal manifestations. Although believed to be a rare occurrence in the population, KFS may be underreported. Proper diagnosis of KFS and other congenital conditions affecting the spine is imperative to devise proper management protocols and avoid potential complications resulting from the altered biomechanics associated with such conditions and their abnormal vertebral morphology. Craniovertebral dislocation and AARF may cause severe cervicomedullary and spinal cord compression and could thereby be potentially fatal, especially in patients with KFS who present with congenitally-associated comorbidities. METHODS. A 13 -year-old boy with Chiari type I malformation, craniofacial abnormalities, and other irregularities underwent thoracolumbar spine surgery for his scoliosis curve correction at another institution, which immediately following surgery he became a quadriparetic. The initial preoperative assessment of his cervical spine was limited and the associated KFS was initially undiagnosed. At 14 years of age, he presented to our clinic with an ASIA-C spinal cord injury. Plain radiographs, normal and 3 -dimensional reformatted computed tomographs (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) noted assimilation of the patient's occiput to the atlas (<b>occipitalization)</b> with congenital fusion of C 2 -C 3, indicative of KFS, and the presence of anterior craniovertebral dislocation with a Fielding and Hawkins type II AARF. Closed reduction of the craniovertebral dislocation was noted, but his atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation was nonresponsive and fixed (AARF). As such, at the age of 14, the patient underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion from the occiput to C 4 to maintain reduction of thecraniovertebral dislocation and reduce his AARF. RESULTS. At 9 months postoperative follow-up of his craniovertebral surgery, the instrumentation remained intact, reduction of the atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation was maintained, and posterior bone fusion was noted. Neurologically, he remained an ASIA-C without any substantial return of function. CONCLUSION. This report raises awareness for the need of a thorough evaluation of the cervical spine to determine patients at high risk for craniovertebral dislocation and atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, primarily in the context of KFS or other congenital conditions. Three-dimensional CT and MR imaging are ideal radiographic methods to determine the presence and extent of craniovertebral dislocation, AARF, and of abnormal vertebral anatomy/malformations. In addition, the authors propose a modification to the Fielding and Hawkins classification of AARF to include variants and subtypes that account for abnormal anatomy and congenital anomalies/malformations. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
