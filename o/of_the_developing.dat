5|$|Sometimes {{during the}} tadpole stage, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> rear legs is eaten by a {{predator}} {{such as a}} dragonfly nymph. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic flatworm (Ribeiroia ondatrae) digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two.|$|E
5|$|TBR1 was {{identified}} in 1995 by the Nina Ireland Laboratory of Developmental Neurobiology Center at the University of California, San Francisco. The gene, initially named TES-56, {{was found to}} be largely expressed in the telencephalic vesicles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> forebrain of mice. The protein product of TES-56 was discovered to be homologous to the Brachyury protein, a T-box transcription factor, which plays a role in establishing symmetry during embryonic development. Thus, due to its relation to T-box genes (such as Tbx-1, Tbx-2, Tbx-3), TES-56 was renamed TBR1.|$|E

5|$|Tbr1 is {{expressed}} mainly in early-born postmitotic neurons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> cerebral cortex—in particular, the preplate and layer VI neurons. The preplate forms the architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate. Successive migrations of neurons divide the preplate such that its inner cells form the cortical plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone. The cortical plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers, {{known as the}} neocortex, present in the mature cerebral cortex. These layers are numbered I-VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first, while the remaining layers grow outward from it (from V to I). Layers II-VI develop from the cortical plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone. The subplate, intermediate zone, subventricular zone, and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers. High expression of Tbr1 {{is seen in the}} marginal zone, cortical plate, and subplate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> cortex whereas little expression is seen in the subventricular zone. No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} proper {{neuronal}} migration through the cortical plate (CP) is an inside-out arrangement of neurons, where the younger neurons migrate past the older neurons to their proper locations. Studies in reeler mutant mice show that knocking out the reeler gene results in aberrant migration {{as well as}} outside-in layering, in which younger neurons are unable to travel past the older ones. Such abnormal layering is also seen in VLDLR−apoER2− and dab1- mutants, indicating {{the importance of this}} entire pathway in cortical migration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> embryo.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Woolfield Mountfort (13 March 1825 – 15 March 1898) was an English {{emigrant}} to New Zealand, {{where he}} became one of that country's most prominent 19th-century architects. He was instrumental in shaping the city of Christchurch's unique architectural identity and culture, and was appointed the first official Provincial Architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> province of Canterbury. Heavily influenced by the Anglo-Catholic philosophy behind early Victorian architecture, he is credited with importing the Gothic revival style to New Zealand. His Gothic designs constructed in both wood and stone in the province are considered unique to New Zealand. Today, he is considered the founding architect of the province of Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> embryo, once depleted, is {{converted}} into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment.

5|$|Shortly {{after first}} developing, one oil company {{evacuated}} its oil rigs off of Texas and Louisiana by helicopter, {{with several other}} companies beginning to evacuate unneeded workers. Ultimately, 7,000 oil workers were removed from offshore oil platforms. The threat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> disturbance prompted officials to close a state park in southern Louisiana. The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along the northern Gulf Coast to remain at port. Initially, Anita was predicted to continue tracking west-northwestward and make landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border. As a result, schools in Cameron Parish, Louisiana were closed, and on August 30 a hurricane watch was issued for the southwestern Louisiana and northeastern Texas coastlines. After the track shifted further to the south, the watch was replaced with a hurricane warning between Brownsville and just south of Corpus Christi, Texas. An emergency shelter was opened in Brownwood, Texas, and Army trucks were prepared to assist in evacuations. An official from the National Weather Service recommended evacuation for all residents east of Galveston, Texas living in an area below 5 feet (1.5 m) above sea level; about 20,000 left Cameron, Louisiana. In all, about 58,000 people evacuated coastal locations in Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes ectopic SHH expression in the anterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to ectopic FGF4 expression in the AER, with ectopic SHH a secondary effect.|$|E

With fluctuations in the pressures, Alicia began to drift to west on August 16. This was short-lived, as Alicia turned to the northwest towards Texas. During the period of August 16 to August 18, an anticyclone had formed over Alicia and along with slow movement over warm waters, caused Alicia to intensify rapidly. The pressure in Alicia decreased one millibar {{an hour in the}} 40hours before landfall. Alicia peaked at 115mph (185km/h) in winds and 962millibars (28.39inHg) in pressure on August 18. Alicia made landfall near Galveston on August 18 as a Category3hurricane. Alicia weakened quickly over land and accelerated over the Midwest, before dissipating over Nebraska on August 21.|$|E
5|$|The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) were {{established}} by delegates at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 and became operational in 1946. The IBRD was established {{with the original}} mission of financing the reconstruction efforts of war-torn European nations following World War II, with goals shared by the later Marshall Plan. The Bank issued its inaugural loan of $250 million ($2.6 billion in 2012 dollars) to France in 1947 to finance infrastructure projects. The institution also established its first field offices in Paris, France, Copenhagen, Denmark, and Prague in the former Czechoslovakia. Throughout {{the remainder of the}} 1940s and 1950s, the Bank financed projects seeking to dam rivers, generate electricity, and improve access to water and sanitation. It also invested in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg's steel industry. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate has transitioned to eradicating poverty around the world. In 1960, the International Development Association (IDA) was established to serve as the Bank's concessional lending arm and provide low and no-cost finance and grants to the poorest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> countries as measured by gross national income per capita.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indications}} of a tropical cyclone developing were on August 17.

Around 0000 UTC the next day, the system was classified as a modern-day tropical depression with sustained winds estimated at 30 mph (45 km/h). Roughly 18 hours later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, {{the first of the}} season while located to the north-northeast of the Bahamas. Gradual intensification took place throughout most of the storm's life as it traveled towards the northeast until becoming a hurricane around 0600 UTC on August 20. About 30 minutes later, a ship recorded winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a pressure of 993.6 mbar (hPa), the lowest pressure recorded in relation to the small storm. Shortly after, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Increasing in forward motion, the storm became extratropical early on August 21 after turning towards the north.|$|E
