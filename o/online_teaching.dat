40|$|Abstract: Reflecting on the {{experience}} of <b>teaching</b> two fully <b>online</b> papers in Chinese at the Bachelor of Arts (Chinese) program at Auckland University of Technology (AUT) (delivered for a total of ten times since 2008), the object {{of this paper is to}} examine the problems along the way, and to address issues which arise. The problems are all pedagogical by nature, instead of being technical concerns upon which a large proportion of <b>online</b> language <b>teaching</b> research has been focused. The issues at stake are two very important assumptions: that there exists a Virtual Classroom, and that one can move the class to the cyberspace and build an Online Learning Community in <b>online</b> language <b>teaching.</b> Discussions are centred on the changing learner profile and the changed learner behaviours in online learning, and their far-reaching impacts on the way we traditionally teach. This author argues that both assumptions are mere myths, and urges a re-think of the online pedagogical approaches which still treat online courses as “classes ” and insist on building the online learning community to re-invent traditional classroom-learning in cyberspace. An urgent call is then made for a radical pedagogical shift in <b>online</b> language <b>teaching</b> from teacher-centred approaches towards a personalised, small-group orientated, multi-dimensional model of teaching. In this spirits, a proposal on <b>online</b> language <b>teaching</b> design is formulated with specific and practical suggestions for online language teachers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Most of {{the online}} courses {{nowadays}} are offered in asynchronous mode, enabling students with the freedom of time and distance. Nonetheless, the drop-out rate for online courses is high. With online synchronous instruction students have both freedom of distance and punctuality of regular progress and the drop-out rate {{is found to be}} greatly reduced. However, {{there is a lack of}} <b>online</b> synchronous <b>teaching</b> pedagogies in the literature for teachers. This study aims to identify major issues that need to be considered in online synchronous instruction environments using observations of real online synchronous instruction in a physical setup. This paper then recommends some pedagogical guidelines for effective <b>online</b> synchronous <b>teaching...</b>|$|R
