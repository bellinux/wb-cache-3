2500|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the {{doctrine}} of divine healing had become {{an important part of}} Sandford's teaching. Initially skeptical, Sandford had resolved to “preach that part of the Bible” after attending an 1887 meeting where A.B. Simpson had spoken on the subject. [...] In 1897 Sandford also witnessed and praised the miracles of contemporary faith healer John Alexander Dowie. Soon Tongues of Fire reported healings of pneumonia, cancer, diphtheria, catarrh, [...] "sick headache," [...] sprained wrist, dropsy, typhoid, mental derangement, broken bones, and [...] "utter exhaustion." [...] A local three-year-old girl who had been pronounced permanently blind by medical authorities suddenly regained her sight after prayer was offered for her at Shiloh. But the most spectacular case was the [...] "resurrection" [...] of Olive Mills, who had been seriously ill, perhaps with spinal meningitis. Told Mills was dead, Sandford found her without breath or pulse. In desperation he shouted, [...] "Olive Mills! Come back! In the name of Jesus of Nazareth, come back!" [...] Almost immediately, Mills <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and within a few hours she was out of bed and dressed.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Abraham was 100 {{years old when}} Isaac was born, and Sarah remarked that God had brought her {{laughter}} and everyone would laugh with her about her bearing Abraham a child in his old age. Abraham held a great feast {{on the day that}} Sarah weaned Isaac. Sarah saw Hagar's son Ishmael playing, and Sarah told Abraham to cast Hagar and Ishmael out, saying that Ishmael would not share in Abraham's inheritance with Isaac. Sarah's words greatly distressed Abraham, but God told Abraham not to be distressed but to do whatever Sarah told him, for Isaac would carry on Abraham's line, and God would make a nation of Ishmael, too. Early the next morning, Abraham placed some bread and water on Hagar's shoulder, together with Ishmael, and sent them away. Hagar and Ishmael wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba, and when the water ran out, she left the child under a bush, sat down about two bowshots away so as not to see the child die, and burst into tears. God heard the cry of the boy, and an angel called to Hagar, saying not to fear, for God had heeded the boy's cry, and would make of him a great nation. Then God <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to a well of water, and she and the boy drank. God was with Ishmael and he grew up in the wilderness and became a bowman. Ishmael lived in the wilderness of Paran, and Hagar got him an Egyptian wife. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here.|$|E
