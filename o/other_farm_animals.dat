25|$|Banbury {{used to be}} home to {{a cattle}} market, {{situated}} on Merton Street in Grimsbury. For many decades, cattle and <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> were driven there on the hoof from as far as Scotland {{to be sold to}} feed the growing population of London and other towns. Since its closure in June 1998 a new housing development has been built on its site which includes Dashwood Primary School. The estate, which lies between Banbury and Hanwell, was built in between 2005–06, {{on the grounds of the}} former Hanwell Farm.|$|E

5000|$|Antimicrobials (including {{antibiotics}} and antifungals) {{and other drugs}} can only be used by veterinarians and livestock owners in the U.S. for treatment, control, or prevention of diseases. [...] Some other countries outside Europe can use antimicrobials to increase the growth rates of livestock, poultry, and <b>other</b> <b>farmed</b> <b>animals,</b> although these pharmaceuticals do not {{always have to be}} administered by a veterinarian.|$|R
25|$|Humans {{can catch}} bTB, but public health control measures, {{including}} milk pasteurisation and the BCG vaccine, {{mean it is}} not a significant risk to human health. The disease affects cattle and <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> (including pigs, goats, deer, sheep, alpacas and llamas), and some species of wildlife including badgers, deer and a few domestic pets. Geographically, bTB has spread from isolated pockets in the late 1980s to cover large areas of the west and south-west of England and Wales in the 2010s. Some people believe this correlates with the lack of badger control.|$|E
2500|$|Virtually {{throughout}} the nation, over-harvest of firewood remains problematic. [...] Despite {{the availability of}} liquefied petroleum gas in towns and cities, firewood is sold more at energy-competitive prices because cutting and selling it is a fallback when better employment opportunities aren't forthcoming. [...] Firewood still supplies 80% of Nepal's energy for heating and cooking. [...] Harvesting construction timber and lopping branches for fodder for cattle and <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> are also deforestation/degradation drivers in all geographic zones.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} the number of animals hunted, kept as companions, used in laboratories, reared for the fur industry, raced, and used in zoos and circuses, is insignificant compared to farm animals, and therefore the [...] "animal welfare issue" [...] is numerically reducible to the [...] "farm animal welfare issue". [...] Similarly, it {{has been suggested}} by campaign groups that chickens, cows, pigs, and <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> are among the most numerous animals subjected to cruelty. For example, because male chickens do not lay eggs, newly hatched males are culled using macerators or grinders. Worldwide meat overconsumption is another factor that contributes to the miserable situation of farm animals.|$|E

50|$|Another {{concern about}} the welfare of <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> is the method of slaughter, {{especially}} ritual slaughter. While the killing of animals need not necessarily involve suffering, the general public considers that killing an animal reduces its welfare. This leads to further concerns about premature slaughtering such as chick culling by the laying hen industry, in which males are slaughtered immediately after hatching because they are superfluous; this policy occurs in <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> industries such as the production of goat and cattle milk, raising the same concerns.|$|R

2500|$|Amongst the {{earliest}} uses of biotechnology in pharmaceutical manufacturing {{is the use}} of recombinant DNA technology to modify Escherichia coli bacteria to produce human insulin, which was performed at Genentech in 1978. [...] Prior to the development of this technique, insulin was extracted from the pancreas glands of cattle, pigs, and <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animals.</b> [...] While generally efficacious in the treatment of diabetes, animal-derived insulin is not indistinguishable from human insulin, and may therefore produce allergic reactions. Genentech researchers produced artificial genes for each of the two protein chains that comprise the insulin molecule. [...] The artificial genes were [...] "then inserted... into plasmids... among a group of genes that" [...] are activated by lactose. [...] Thus, the insulin-producing genes were also activated by lactose. [...] The recombinant plasmids were inserted into Escherichia coli bacteria, which were [...] "induced to produce 100,000 molecules of either chain A or chain B human insulin." [...] The two protein chains were then combined to produce insulin molecules.|$|E

40|$|In {{partnership}} with AREN Agribusiness Research and Education Network. This study explores {{the nature and}} performance of the New Zealand venison industry from 1980 to 2007. A number of critical success factors that have enabled the venison industry to develop were identified. These include: Intrinsic attributes of venison as a game product and New Zealand as the origin; Existing market {{in the early stages}} of the industry’s development; Early pioneers recognising the opportunity and responding in kind, including securing legislative support for deer farming; Comparative production advantages; Economies of scope and scale in the processing/exporting sector to allow ready diversification of markets when supply increased rapidly; Communication along the value chain, especially with customers and chefs; and Industry co-operation involving a collective strategy and alignment of promotional funding. Scientific knowledge and expertise from researching <b>other</b> <b>farmed</b> <b>animals</b> was used to determine how deer could successfully become a <b>farmed</b> <b>animal.</b> Key areas included deer handling, reproduction, yarding and feed requirements. Further research will be necessary to better match venison supply with demand...|$|R
40|$|Background The goat (Capra hircus) {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> species. It is reared in all continents with an estimated world population of about 800 million of animals. Despite its importance, studies on the goat genome are still in their infancy compared to those in <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> species. Comparative mapping between cattle and goat showed only a few rearrangements in agreement with the similarity of chromosome banding. We carried out a cross species cattle-goat array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) experiment in order to identify copy number variations (CNVs) in the goat genome analysing animals of different breeds (Saanen, Camosciata delle Alpi, Girgentana, and Murciano-Granadina) using a tiling oligonucleotide array with 385, 000 probes designed on the bovine genome. Results We identified a total of 161 CNVs (an average of 17. 9 CNVs per goat), with the largest number in the Saanen breed and the lowest in the Camosciata delle Alpi goat. By aggregating overlapping CNVs identified in different animals we determined CNV regions (CNVRs) : on the whole, we identified 127 CNVRs covering about 11. 47 Mb of the virtual goat genome referred to the bovine genome (0. 435...|$|R
40|$|This review brings {{together}} and consolidates {{the large amount}} of research on acute phase proteins (APPs) that has been undertaken in chickens. Acute phase proteins are secreted from the liver as a result of inflammation or infection that can be measured in plasma. They have been well-characterised in <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> species and have been measured {{in a wide variety of}} poultry research areas. The acceleration in chicken APP research is in response to increased interest in ways the immune responses of the chicken can be measured and compared during infection or environmental or nutritional changes. All APPs that have been identified and characterised in chickens are described in the following review and their responses during infection discussed. The APPs are tabulated with basal values and classification to provide a comparative and useful reference. The ways APPs can be measured in chickens and the assays available are also described.

40|$|Unlike several <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> species, {{the broiler}} chicken remains {{unprotected}} by species-specific legislation. The densities at which broilers {{should be kept}} is a highly contentious issue-some studies have demonstrated increased welfare problems at higher densities, whilst a few others have, contrary to expectations, suggested that broilers may actually find crowds of other birds attractive. A tracking method was developed and used to provide an insight into the social preferences of commercial broiler chickens in situ-inside commercial, closed-system broiler houses. The aim was to simultaneously assess the relative impact of global measures of density, such as target and actual stocking densities and local measures of the social environment on the behaviour and route taken to feed by focal birds. Birds were tracked inside 20 commercial broiler houses across the UK. Results from this study show that stocking density per se seems to have little direct effect on the individual behaviours of focal broiler chickens. However, there may still be an indirect effect of stocking density on broiler behaviour, mediated through the local social environment. Â© 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a school}} of thought that future demand for meat and <b>other</b> <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> {{products}} is unsustainable for several reasons, including greenhouse gas emissions, especially from ruminants; standards of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> health and welfare, especially when <b>farm</b> <b>animals</b> are kept intensively; efficiency of conversion by livestock of solar energy into (human) food, particularly by pigs and poultry; water availability and usage {{for all types of}} agricultural production, including livestock; and human health and consumption of meat, eggs and milk. Demand for meat is forecast to rise as a result of global population growth and increasing affluence. These issues buttress an impending perfect storm of food shortages, scarce water and insufficient energy, which is likely to coincide with global population reaching about 9 billion people in 2030 (pace Beddington). This paper examines global demand for animal products, the narrative of ‘sustainable intensification’ and the implications of each for the future of <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> welfare. In the UK, we suggest that, though non-ruminant farming may become unsustainable, ruminant agriculture will continue to prosper because cows, sheep and goats utilize grass and other herbage that cannot be consumed directly by humans, especially on land that is unsuitable for other purposes. However, the demand for meat and other livestock-based food is often for pork, eggs and chicken from grain-fed pigs and poultry. The consequences of such a perfect storm are beginning to be incorporated in long-term business planning by retailers and others. Nevertheless, marketing sustainable animal produce will require considerable innovation and flair in public and private policies if marketing messages are to be optimized and consumer behaviour modified...|$|R
