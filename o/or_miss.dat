5|$|Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent {{suggested}} that Spencer audition {{for the role}} of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit <b>or</b> <b>miss.</b>|$|E

25|$|Several plants contain {{serotonin}} {{together with}} a family of related tryptamines that are methylated at the amino (NH2) and (OH) groups, are N-oxides, <b>or</b> <b>miss</b> the OH group.

25|$|The canal {{was a very}} {{efficient}} way of moving large amounts of heavy goods cheaply and with minimal labor. But White and Hazard had single-handedly spurred canal construction {{up and down the}} East Coast by taming the Lehigh River with navigations in less than two years, and four years ahead of promises to investors. Unfortunately, the northern canals would freeze in the winter, and their towpaths were muddy in spring and late fall. This made it impractical for a burgeoning mill town that needed year-round freight transportation, but if LC Co. was putting monies into railroads, other businessmen {{were going to have to}} take a hard careful look. With steamboat tugs proven on the Merrimack and Middlesex Canal themselves, and news of railroads building in Europe and now, the United States, investors would need to adopt new techniques sooner <b>or</b> <b>miss</b> opportunities.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} orchid seed {{germination}} was traditionally a hit <b>or</b> <b>miss</b> affair, {{and the single}} biggest factor preventing orchid growing from moving from being a rich-man’s hobby to a business where money could be made. Irregular and irreproducible germination seriously hampered the speed and success rate of Mead’s hybridization efforts, {{and it was not}} uncommon for him to have to wait 10 or more years before a new orchid bloomed for the first time, in one instance taking 17 years. But Mead was a patient man, employing scientific principles and keeping detailed and careful notes. His horticultural notebook in the Michael A. Spencer Collection on Theodore Mead, Special Collections and University Archives, University of Central Florida, lists several thousand crosses as well as information on all his other plants. In addition, he photographed many of his new creations.|$|E
500|$|Charles Bramesco of The A.V. Club {{recommended}} the film, writing that [...] "The film is patently absurd, but the filmmakers are fully committed to that absurdity.

Charles Webb of MTV.com called the performances [...] "a little rough", and wrote [...] "If Killer Klowns isn't especially scary, it's only kind of funny but still gets by on the execution of extremely inventive visuals based on the clown/circus motif". Dread Central gave the film three {{out of a possible}} five stars. JoBlo.com gave the film a rating of 8/10, stating that the film [...] "is the KING of 80's B-movies and it delivers the tacky goods by the truckloads".

I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, <b>or</b> <b>miss</b> some little act, which I might forget, should I run away– Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and [...] "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".|$|E
500|$|... "Bart to the Future" [...] has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews from critics compared to [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] which met with positive response. Nancy Basile of About.com listed {{it as one}} of the episodes she felt [...] "shined in season eleven". While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on [...] "Bart to the Future", writing: [...] "This kind of fantasy episode can be hit <b>or</b> <b>miss,</b> and that trend holds true here. However, more of 'Future' succeeds than flops. Though a few gags bomb, most of them prove pretty good. At no point does this become a classic, but it amuses much of the time." [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club wrote in 2011 that the episode [...] "was not so good, although better than many of the real stinkers yet to come at that point. Still, it utterly failed to rise to the challenge of 'Lisa’s Wedding.'" ...|$|E

[...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "Lisa-based shows definitely fall into the hit <b>or</b> <b>miss</b> category, and “Ten” stays within those confines." [...] While he praised some of Homer's scenes, including [...] "his drunken versions of pop songs," [...] he maintained that [...] "not much else connects." [...] He concluded his review by writing [...] "Though we find the occasional laugh, the overall impact remains lackluster." [...] DVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski gave the episode a B-, and wrote that [...] "Homer's answer to the rhetorical question about gymnastics 'Who wants {{to put on a}} leotard and get screamed at?'" [...] was the episode's [...] "highlight".|$|E

500|$|Throughout the book's seventeen-year gestation, Joyce {{stated that}} with Finnegans Wake he was {{attempting}} to [...] "reconstruct the nocturnal life", and that the book was his [...] "experiment in interpreting 'the dark night of the soul'."

[...] While pondering the generally negative reactions to the book Joyce said: I can't understand some of my critics, like Pound <b>or</b> <b>Miss</b> Weaver, for instance. They say it's obscure.

500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit <b>or</b> <b>miss,</b> and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E
500|$|Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy {{was better}} received. Bob Mackey at USgamer {{appreciated}} how {{the games were}} mostly left untouched, while getting minor improvements, {{such as the ability}} to read the text at the player's own pace rather than waiting for it to [...] "slowly [...] across the screen". He said that the game's graphical upgrades were hit <b>or</b> <b>miss,</b> with certain characters, including Phoenix and Edgeworth, looking great, while elements that originally had less definition, such as the judge's beard, were [...] "a little wonky". Thomas Whitehead at Nintendo Life said that Capcom had done a [...] "solid job" [...] with the port, and appreciated the stereoscopic 3D effect and the game's faithfulness to the original; he, however, felt that the lack of an orchestral soundtrack similar to that in [...] was a minor disappointment. Geoff Thew at Hardcore Gamer called the updated art gorgeous, and noted that it did not have the same animation-related problems as the Trilogy HD on iOS. He appreciated the 3D effect, which he said works well most of the time, but said that the window frame in the detention center was not rendered on its own layer; he said {{that it was not a}} huge problem, but that it was distracting as the player visits that area often. He also commented on the lack of a remastered soundtrack, calling it a letdown.|$|E
