500|$|The nordic {{combined}} events used both venues listed for cross country skiing and ski jumping. The test event for Nordic combined {{occurred during the}} weekend of 15–17 February 2008. Because {{of the lack of}} snow and warm weather prior to the test event, the schedule for the test event was adjusted to the sprint event on 15 February, the Gundersen event on 16 February, and the sprint qualification event on 17 February. The sprint event on 15 February was cancelled to changing winds. Meanwhile, the Gundersen event on 16 February was changed to a mass start event won by Norway's Petter Tande. Two unsuccessful attempts at the ski jumping part of the sprint qualification event to high winds on the 17th resulted in the event's cancellation. A World Cup event leading up to the championships was to have taken place 13–14 December 2008 in the 10km individual large hill event as a test event, but was cancelled on 6 December 2008 to warm weather and lack of snow.

500|$|While Beauty and the Beasts several {{theatrical}} re-releases and reissues {{have been}} met with generally mixed reviews, critical response towards the [...] "Be Out Guest" [...] musical sequence has remained predominantly positive.

[...] Similarly, the Seattle Post-Intelligencers William Arnold wrote, [...] "On the other hand, it's understandable why [...] was cut from the original. It's almost too similar to the film's show-stopper, 'Be Our Guest'." [...] Reviewing the film's 2012 3D conversion, Todd Gilchrist of Boxoffice wrote that [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] is [...] "effective, immersive and maybe even memorable." [...] Meanwhile, Annlee Ellingson of Paste wrote, [...] "It's thrilling to experience this film's major set pieces on the big screen again, especially the Broadway-infused 'Be Our Guest' number." [...] The Times-Picayunes Mike Scott wrote, [...] "But then the 3-D all but disappears until the 'Be Our Guest' number -- with its artfully surreal dance of the dishes." [...] Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, who otherwise criticized the film's songs, praised [...] "Be Our Guest", writing, [...] "Apart from the spectacular Busby Berkeleyesque Be <b>Our</b> <b>Guest,</b> the film pretty much grinds to a halt whenever one of the songs... starts up." [...] Likewise, Neil Smith of Total Film concluded that [...] "only ‘Be Our Guest’ and the ballroom swoop really benefit from a stereoscopic make-over that doesn’t do the hand-drawn remainder many favours." ...|$|E
