40|$|We {{focus on}} the effects of {{changing}} costs <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> in the minimum-effort coordination game. We find three main results. First, as the cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> increases, the level <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> decreases. Second, as the cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> increases, the convergence speed to an equilibrium also increase. Third, the overall efficiency (average payoff) does not monotonically decrease as the cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> increases. Average payoff decreases for the most part but actually increases when the cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> is very high. Even though groups are converging towards worse equilibria as the cost increases, they are converging faster, and therefore lose less due to fewer periods of non-coordination. This non-monotonicity in the average payoff suggests that individuals may be better off with higher costs <b>of</b> <b>effort...</b>|$|R

40|$|Perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> is the {{conscious}} sensation <b>of</b> the <b>effort</b> exerted during a physical task, {{and it is}} one of the subjective experiences that accompany voluntary actions. Perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> has an important role in the self-regulation of behavior. In physical tasks requiring endurance, perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> is one <b>of</b> the main determinants of pacing and performance {{and it is one}} of the barriers that prevent sedentary individuals from adopting an active lifestyle. Furthermore, high perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> is one <b>of</b> the main features of the disabling fatigue affecting patients with cancer and other medical conditions. The afferent feedback model postulates that perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> arises from sensory signals produced by peripheral receptors (e. g., group III–IV afferents). According to the corollary discharge model, perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> arises from corollary discharges of the central motor command to the working muscles (including the respiratory muscles). Current electrophysiological evidence, showing that motor-related brain activity correlates with perception <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> corroborates the corollary discharge model <b>of</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> Preliminary evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that the cingulate and insular cortices, and possibly the thalamus and precuneus, are brain areas that might be involved in perception <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> Future research should focus on targets for interventions aimed at reducing perception <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> Such interventions might benefit athletes involved in endurance performance, patients suffering from fatigue, and sedentary individuals wishing to adopt a more active lifestyle...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile.

5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>efforts</b> to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects {{to drain the}} Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the natural water flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. While fatigue is a common daily phenomenon, the exact relationship between perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and fatigue is still unknown. Existing tools for assessing perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> are effectively limited to whole body exercise, while current methods for assessing voluntary activation are painful and not feasible for clinical application. The main aims of this thesis were to evaluate existing methodologies for their appropriateness in assessing perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and voluntary activation following isolated muscle function testing, and {{to examine the relationship}} between subjective perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and objective changes in the healthy motor control system. The implementation of reliable and valid assessment tools in clinical practice may enable clarification of the pathogenesis of many neurological conditions that have chronic fatigue as a key feature. Four studies of within-subjects repeated measures design have been conducted. Sixtynine healthy volunteers were recruited among staff and students of Brunel University. Magnetic stimulation was tested as a valid alternative to electrical stimulation in the conventional single-pulse Twitch Interpolation Technique. The 0 – 10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) was also tested for its reliability and validity in assessing the perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> during isometric exercise of elbow flexors. The changes <b>of</b> perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> following a submaximal elbow flexion fatiguing task, as well as following transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the motor cortex were also tested. The main findings showed significant differences between peripheral and magnetic stimulation in conventional single-pulse Twitch Interpolation Technique. The 0 – 10 NRS demonstrated linear properties and reported excellent test-retest reliability and good concurrent criterion validity in recording perception <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> under repeated isometric contractions of elbow flexors. Ten minutes of a submaximal intermittent isometric fatiguing exercise produced a significant elevation in rating <b>of</b> perceived <b>effort,</b> which was associated with central and peripheral neurophysiological changes of the motor control system.

The model extends previous consumer choice models {{in that the}} consumer not only chooses a product, but also decides how much effort to apply to a given choice problem. The model yields a unique optimal level <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> which depends on the consumer's cost <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> the expected utility gain of a correct choice, and {{the complexity of the}} choice set. We show that the relationship between <b>effort</b> and cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> is negative, whereas the relationships between effort and product utility difference and choice task complexity are undetermined. To resolve this theoretical ambiguity and to explore our model empirically, we investigate the relationships between <b>effort</b> and cost <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> product utility difference and choice task complexity using data from a conjoint choice study of two-alternative consumer restaurant choices. Response time is used as a proxy for effort and consumer involvement measures capture individual differences in (relative) cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and perceived complexity. Effort is explained using the (estimated) utility difference between alternatives, the number of elementary information processes (EIP's) required to solve the choice problem optimally and respondent specific cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and complexity perceptions. The predictions of the theoretical model are supported by our empirical findings. Response time increases with lower cost <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> and greater perceived complexity (i. e. higher involvement). We find that across the range of choice tasks in our survey, effort increases linearly with smaller product utility differences and greater choice task complexity. ...|$|R
