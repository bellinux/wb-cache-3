5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the textures of nickel, copper, silver, aluminium, indium and of alloys <b>on</b> their <b>basis,</b> <b>the</b> alloys with the given magnetism, with the given {{elasticity}} and other properties. The purposes are {{to learn the}} mechanism of texture-formation, to develop the alloys with the orientation-sensitive properties for the instrument making, to develop the non-failing continuous control of texture in the metallurgical production. The theoretical results are the model of annealing doubles in the metals of face centred cubic lattice; the hypothesis {{about the nature of}} formation of cubic texture and about the influence of dopes <b>on</b> it; <b>the</b> knowledge about the selective segregation of dopes along the grain boundaries. The new scientific results are the anomalous influence of silicon <b>on</b> <b>the</b> texture of nickel strip; the knowledges about the near order of orientation and about the macrotexture. The new alloys with the risen elastic properties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> indium <b>basis,</b> with <b>the</b> risen magnetism <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nickel <b>basis,</b> <b>the</b> semiconducting materials <b>on</b> <b>the</b> silver <b>basis</b> have been developed. The manufacturing method of these materials as well as of chromic bronze and others has been developed or has been improved. The textural control during the annealing of strip has been developed and has been put into operation.

5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of sound production, but membranophones <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of {{the shape of the}} instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E
