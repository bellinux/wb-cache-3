5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for their teams (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.|$|E

5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>course,</b> and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E

40|$|At a {{time when}} {{languages}} in universities are under pressure, community-based learning language courses can have many positive benefits: they can increase interest in language learning, they can foster greater engagement with learning, and they can encourage active learning, creativity and teamwork. These courses, which link the classroom and the community, help address needs in the community, share resources and make languages more visible. By giving {{students the opportunity to}} engage in practical work, their transferable skills are enhanced. The gap between the university and community is closed and positive attitudes towards language learning are fostered. This paper examines research into community-based learning and language courses and the effect that the approach has on students. Using <b>an</b> example <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>course</b> in NUI Galway, the author gives voice to the student experience <b>of</b> <b>a</b> CBL <b>course</b> and its impact on their motivation, their style of learning and their attitudes towards language learning.
