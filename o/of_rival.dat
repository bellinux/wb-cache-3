5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder <b>of</b> <b>rival</b> Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and despite the fact that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|Although the Colorados had {{defected}} to the Flores insurgency, {{the national guard}} continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine Federalists who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground <b>of</b> <b>rival</b> parties, and Bartolomé Mitre's victory at Pavón in 1861 had signaled the triumph of his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo José de Urquiza. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.|$|E
40|$|It is {{commonly}} perceived that firms {{do not want}} to be outsiders to a merger between competitor firms. We instead argue that it is beneficial to be a non-merging rival firm to a large horizontal merger. Using a sample of mergers with expert identification <b>of</b> relevant <b>rivals</b> and the event-study methodology, we find rivals generally experience positive abnormal returns at the merger announcement date. We also find that the stock reaction <b>of</b> <b>rivals</b> to merger events is not sensitive to merger waves; hence, 'future acquisition probability' does not drive the positive abnormal returns <b>of</b> <b>rivals.</b> Further, we find the positive (or non-negative) abnormal returns <b>of</b> <b>rivals</b> to be robust when considering heterogeneity in merger and rival characteristics.

On 6 November 1998, a peace agreement was signed in Honiara between the United States and Solomon Islands governments. However, since the late 1990s, Honiara has been the centre of ethnic violence and political unrest in the country.

Arsenal had been the more successful team in recent years, having won three First Division titles in succession {{in the past few}} seasons; while Sheffield United were keen to win the trophy after the success <b>of</b> <b>rival</b> team Sheffield Wednesday in the 1935 Final.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the aggregated actions <b>of</b> <b>rivals</b> {{belonging to the}} same organizational field affect a firmâ€™s exits from existing market segments. We argue that while a firmâ€™s exit decisions are strongly influenced by the aggregated actions by other firms which may serve as an uncertainty-reducing signal, the focal firmâ€™s strategic responses to signals from the organizational field <b>of</b> <b>rivals</b> are more complicated, informed, and rational, than is usually suggested. For instance, in its evaluation of signals about segment attractiveness based on the aggregated actions <b>of</b> <b>rivals,</b> the focal firm will give different weights to rivalsâ€™ actions according {{to the strength of}} competitive threat, will make refined inferences about the attractiveness of a segment based on the performances <b>of</b> <b>rivals,</b> and will give a greater weight to recent actions by rivals than to older ones. The results of our event history analysis of all segment exits by Korean SI ventures support all our hypotheses. Intended rationality; segment exit; signal; SI ventures; uncertaint...|$|R

ENZO automatically generates the corresponding differential equations from a stipulated enzyme reaction scheme.

5|$|In 1894, Wurtenburg {{was hired}} to replace former Yale {{teammate}} John A. Hartwell as the {{head coach of the}} US Naval Academy football team. Hartwell's 1893 team had amassed a record of 5–3, including a win over rival Army and a loss to rival Penn. Wurtenburg began his coaching career on October 6, leading his team to a 6–6 tie with the Elizabeth Athletic Club of New Jersey at Worden Field on the Naval Academy campus in Annapolis. His first win as a coach came over two weeks later, on October 21, in a 12–0 shutout <b>of</b> <b>rival</b> Georgetown; it was followed by a defeat of the Carlisle Indian School. His first and only loss of the season came on October 27, at the hands <b>of</b> <b>rival</b> Penn in a 12–0 shutout. At about that time, Wurtenburg left the country and traveled to Germany to complete his medical studies. The team recovered and defeated Lehigh on November 3, then tied rival Penn State. The season ended two weeks after that match with a 30–6 defeat of Baltimore City College. The team did not compete against their major rival Army that year, after violent fights between fans the previous year; President Grover Cleveland banned the game, which would not be played again until it was reinstated in 1899 by Theodore Roosevelt. Sometime during November, Wurtenburg returned from Germany along with fellow Yale medical graduate A.S. Cheney, and announced his intention to practice medicine in New Haven. That year, he received certification, and he expressed interest in eye, throat, and ear treatment.|$|E

KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
