Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> discovered Williamson's corpse lying {{face down on the}} floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|While the WHA <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> players slowly {{joined the}} NHL, those behind the Iron Curtain were {{restricted}} from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, {{and his brother}} Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia {{with the aid of}} Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans' entrance into the NHL. Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft. However, defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them. Michal Pivonka defected from Czechoslovakia in 1986, while Russian Alexander Mogilny defected following the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. Czech teenager Petr Nedved walked into a Calgary police station in January 1989 after playing in the Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament.|$|E
5|$|While European-born {{players were}} a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to see them in the NHL until 1980, {{although}} the WHA employed a number of them. Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s. The WHA <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> players slowly joined the NHL, but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit.

Shortly {{before the end of the}} 1988–89 regular season, Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL. Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E

25|$|Hogg {{ended up}} with 7/33, all that was {{required}} was to bat out {{the remainder of the}} day to claim victory. But as only Warrandyte can, a shaky batting display <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> the team were precariously at 7/77. A solid partnership recovered the damage to get to 7/113 with just 22 overs left in the match, but again the game changed, as the final 3 wickets fell in 3 overs. So Ainslie required 117 runs from 19 overs to reverse the result, and raced to 0/24 after the first 2. Then another twist, 2 quick wickets to Hogg and then a run out made it 3/34. The score reached 3/49 with 11 overs to play, when Hogg struck a batsman on the head with a bouncer, and an ambulance was required on the ground. Light was fading during the delay, and the umpires decided play couldn't recommence, so once again Warrandyte assumed the victory. But then more controversy, as RDCA officials announced play would continue on an unprecedented 4th day. So the players returned to the East Ringwood oval, and with a huge crowd in attendance, fortunes ebbed and flowed again until 7 runs were required from the final over with 5 wickets in hand. A bye from a disputed run out, a boundary, and finally a leg bye saw Ainslie Park reach the total, winning outright with 3 balls remaining of the 240th and last over. Warrandyte left to ponder how the lost a game they had already won.|$|E
25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them. They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, he <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had said (over the intercom), {{that there was a}} message from the Apple office. Ono <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at the back window, another person was banging on the window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon and pointed to a binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E

Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E

The old man wanted nothing so much as an audience, and the tales of his exploits served to pass the evening."

2500|$|On , Catherine rose {{early in}} the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon {{settling}} down to work on papers at her study. Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> peered in. Catherine was sprawled on the floor. Her face appeared purplish, her pulse was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E

2500|$|But {{the ladies}} of Winchester had brought some of this harsh {{treatment}} on themselves. From the very first Union occupation, they had treated Federal soldiers despicably. Going to church one Sunday, one woman accidentally dropped her Bible or prayer brook. A passing soldier immediately {{picked it up and}} offered it to her. She glared at him hatefully and refused it. When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could she see his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her. She put it to his head and told him to get off her doorstep. As he tried to limp away, she shot him in the back. That night, several young soldiers took a vow to punish the women of Winchester for murdering their comrades when they returned. This is the context within which Milroy was operating.|$|E
2500|$|By 5pm, the {{authorities}} had not delivered {{any amount of}} fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill.

Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying [...] "I don't want to do this. But I have no choice.". Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; she knew that he kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the Quran on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline's security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but [...] "nothing like what seemed to be about to happen." [...] French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.|$|E
2500|$|General Murray survived two plane crashes in his lifetime. The {{first was}} before the {{ejection}} seat and took place when he was instructing a student {{that was one of}} The Tuskeegee Airmen. They were flying in a single-engine, two-seater trainer with a slide-back canopy over Florida. An oil hose broke and they lost engine power. Murray was able {{to take control of the}} plane and land it in a swampy field, causing severe damage to the engine and belly of the plane. They were not injured. The second plane crash was when General Murray was an executive for an aerospace company and was aboard the company's business jet as a passenger. The plane began its descent for landing on a very cold winter day in Michigan. General Murray, concerned about an ice buildup, looked out the window over the wing and noticed large sheets of ice on the wings. He quickly notified the pilots, but it was too late. General Murray then observed the ice breaking off of the wings and being sucked into the jet engine intakes. The engines shut down, and the plane had to make an emergency landing on a partially iced-over lake. Upon the plane crashing, it immediately burst into flames. General Murray quickly <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> ushered out the pilots and the other executives he was traveling with. The water was now covered in aircraft fuel. The fuel ignited, leaving General Murray no escape. His only option was to dive into the flames that were on top of the water. He suffered burns that were, fortunately, not serious.
