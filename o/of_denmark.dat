5|$|Anne {{was born}} on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Denmark.</b> Her birth came as a blow to her father, King Frederick II <b>of</b> <b>Denmark,</b> who was desperately hoping for a son. But her mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, was only 17; three years later she did bear Frederick a son, the future Christian IV <b>of</b> <b>Denmark.</b>|$|E

In 1852, however, George's father was designated the heir presumptive to the childless King Frederick VII <b>of</b> <b>Denmark,</b> and the family became princes and princesses <b>of</b> <b>Denmark.</b> George's siblings were Frederick (who succeeded their father as King <b>of</b> <b>Denmark),</b> Alexandra (who became wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom {{and the mother of}} King George V), Dagmar (who, as Empress Maria Feodorovna, was consort of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the mother of Emperor Nicholas II), Thyra (who married Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale) and Valdemar.|$|E

5|$|Copenhagen is {{the major}} {{economic}} and financial centre <b>of</b> <b>Denmark.</b> The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce.

The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare.

5|$|Greenland {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{constituent}} countries of the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Denmark,</b> with Queen Margrethe II as the reigning sovereign. The territory first came under monarchical rule in 1261, when the populace accepted the overlordship of the King of Norway; by 1360, Norway had entered into a personal union with the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Denmark,</b> which became more entrenched with the union of the kingdoms into Denmark–Norway in 1536. After the dissolution of this arrangement in 1814, Greenland remained as a Danish colony, and, after its role in World War II, was granted its special status within the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Denmark</b> in 1953. The monarch is represented in the territory by the Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner), Mikaela Engell.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{religion in}} Aalborg {{as in the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>Denmark</b> is Christianity. Aalborg is the seat of a bishop within the Lutheran State Church <b>of</b> <b>Denmark.</b> The cathedral of this bishopric is the Budolfi Church, originally built no later than 1132 by Viborg's Bishop Eskil. This church was considerably smaller than the current one, as it was merely a parish church. The existing structure was completed in the late 14th century, {{on the grounds of}} the former church, and was listed for the first time in the Atlas <b>of</b> <b>Denmark</b> in 1399. The church was named after St Botolph, an English abbot and saint. The church is constructed in the Gothic style. In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and, after consideration, St Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg. Aalborg is also home to the former Catholic church, the Abbey of Our Lady, converted from a Benedictine nunnery.|$|E
