Carney's first task was to streamline reporting to Washington about ground realities in Haiti, as well as bringing in U.S. policymakers in to see firsthand what U.S. taxpayer dollars were funding in the country. Carney touted humanitarian successes of U.S. policy in Haiti, including success in preventing the spread <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>and</b> providing lunch money to upwards of 500,000 Haitian students each school day. Microcredit financing efforts were also on display, as was the U.S. Coast Guard to monitor Haiti's coastline for Cali go-fast boats laden with cocaine shipments bound for the U.S. mainland.|$|E

5|$|In {{the book}} and the lectures, Lewis argues that {{significant}} changes are required to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>and</b> subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
5|$|Many Western Catholics and non-Catholics have voiced {{disagreement}} on the Church's support for natural family planning, and contend {{it contributes to}} overpopulation and poverty. The Church's rejection of condom use is widely criticized, in particular with regard to countries where the incidence <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>and</b> HIV has reached epidemic proportions. In its defense, Catholics cite countries such as Kenya and Uganda, where behavioral changes are encouraged instead of condom use, and where greater progress in controlling the disease has been made than in countries that promote condom use alone.|$|E
5|$|The life {{expectancy}} in Bahrain is 73 {{for males and}} 76 for females. Compared to many countries in the region, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>and</b> HIV is relatively low. Malaria and tuberculosis (TB) do not constitute major problems in Bahrain as neither disease is indigenous to the country. As a result, cases of malaria and TB have declined in recent decades with cases of contractions amongst Bahraini nationals becoming rare. The Ministry of Health sponsors regular vaccination campaigns against TB and other diseases such as hepatitis B.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> institutions, <b>and</b> social {{cohesion}} on {{per capita income}} growth in 34 African countries using the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel GMM estimator.

The empirical results indicate that social cohesion enhances the growth effects <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> {{but there is a}} threshold effect, suggesting that aid becomes effective in enhancing growth in countries with higher social cohesion. Surprisingly, the results show that beyond a certain level of improvements in institutional quality, institutions (political rights and civil liberties) reduce the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> Growth, aid effectiveness, institutions, social cohesion, Africa, F 35, F 43, O 17...|$|R

Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees {{are used in}} the US.

The most prominent supporters of this hypothesis are Duesberg himself, biochemist and vitamin proponent David Rasnick, and journalist Celia Farber. The scientific community contends that Duesberg's arguments {{are the result of}} cherry-picking predominantly outdated scientific data and selectively ignoring evidence in favor of HIV's role in AIDS.

25|$|It is {{believed}} that latent HIV can cross the blood–brain barrier inside circulating monocytes in the bloodstream ("Trojan horse theory") within the first 14 days of infection. Once inside, these monocytes become activated and are transformed into macrophages. Activated macrophages release virions into the brain tissue proximate to brain microvessels. These viral particles likely {{attract the attention of}} sentinel brain microglia and perivascular macrophages initiating an inflammatory cascade that may cause a series of intracellular signaling in brain microvascular endothelial cells and damage the functional and structural integrity of the BBB. This inflammation is HIV encephalitis (HIVE). Instances of HIVE probably occur throughout the course <b>of</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>and</b> are a precursor for HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The premier model for studying HIV and HIVE is the simian model.|$|E
