5|$|However, over time, the {{cumulative}} probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{encounter with a}} star increases, and disruption of the planets becomes all but inevitable. Assuming that the Big Crunch or Big Rip scenarios {{for the end of}} the Universe do not occur, calculations suggest that the gravity of passing stars will have completely stripped the dead Sun of its remaining planets within 1quadrillion (1015) years. This point marks the end of the Solar System. Although the Sun and planets may survive, the Solar System, in any meaningful sense, will cease to exist.|$|E

5|$|The Pleiades {{have long}} been {{known to be a}} {{physically}} related group of stars rather than any chance alignment. The Reverend John Michell calculated in 1767 that the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> alignment of so many bright stars was only 1 in 500,000, and so surmised that the Pleiades and many other clusters of stars must be physically related. When studies were first made of the stars' proper motions, it was found that they are all moving in the same direction across the sky, at the same rate, further demonstrating that they were related.|$|E

Returning home {{in the morning of}} the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, Charles Manson. At first, Wilson was frightened by Manson, but Manson assured him he came with no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing his shoes. The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the Manson Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E

5|$|Joyce {{had begun}} his {{education}} at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 {{but had to}} leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his peers at Belvedere.

5|$|Several {{favorite}} son candidates had delegates {{interested in their}} nomination, although they were seen as having less <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of gaining the nomination. Alexander Campbell had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier. He {{was seen as a}} pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party's more conservative members. Henly James {{was the head of the}} Grange in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there, but attracted little support outside his own delegation. In the Wisconsin delegation, many favored Edward P. Allis, an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works. Allis was a longtime supporter of soft money, but had no experience in elected office. Finally, Solon Chase of Maine had some support from the New England delegations. Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper, Chase's Inquirer, and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878. Chase was among the most radical of the Greenbackers, attracting support from the party's left-wing members.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people now had to find additional cash, driving up the price of copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to melt down the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E

5|$|The Jacksonville Jaguars claimed Kafka off waivers on June 11, 2013, one {{day after}} his release by the Patriots. The Dallas Cowboys had also put in a claim for him. The general manager for the Jaguars, Dave Caldwell, said on June 13 that Kafka had as good <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> at being named the {{starting}} quarterback as Blaine Gabbert, Chad Henne, or Matt Scott had. Kafka was the third quarterback {{to play in the}} first preseason game for the Jaguars on August 9 against the Miami Dolphins after Henne and Gabbert. He went 4-of-8 for 19yards and an interception in the game. In the second week of the preseason, he went 1-for-3 for −4yards. He did not play in the team's third preseason game, but passed for 46yards and a touchdown in the fourth game. The Jaguars signed Ricky Stanzi on August 27 for additional competition for the team's third quarterback job. Kafka and Scott were both released in favor of Stanzi during final roster cuts on August 30, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated {{that if there were}} even a sliver <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader to approve a nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.|$|E

50|$|The {{answer is}} that {{prisoner}} A didn't gain information about his own fate, since he already knew that the warden would give him the name of someone else. Prisoner A, prior to hearing from the warden, estimates his chances of being pardoned as 1/3, the same as both B and C. As the warden says B will be executed, it's either because C will be pardoned (1/3 <b>chance),</b> or <b>A</b> will be pardoned (1/3 chance) and the B/C coin the warden flipped came up B (1/2 chance; for <b>a</b> total <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1/6 <b>chance</b> B was named because A will be pardoned). Hence, after hearing that B will be executed, the estimate <b>of</b> <b>A's</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being pardoned is half that of C. This means his chances of being pardoned, now knowing B isn't, again are 1/3, but C has <b>a</b> 2/3 <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> being pardoned.|$|R

25|$|It was {{realised}} {{as early}} as 1767 that the stars in a cluster were physically related, when the English naturalist Reverend John Michell calculated that the probability of even just one group of stars like the Pleiades being the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> alignment as seen from Earth was just 1 in 496,000. Between 1774–1781, French astronomer Charles Messier published a catalogue of celestial objects that had a nebulous appearance similar to comets. This catalogue included 26 open clusters. In the 1790s, English astronomer William Herschel began an extensive study of nebulous celestial objects. He discovered {{that many of these}} features could be resolved into groupings of individual stars. Herschel conceived the idea that stars were initially scattered across space, but later became clustered together as star systems because of gravitational attraction. He divided the nebulae into eight classes, with classes VI through VIII being used to classify clusters of stars.|$|E
