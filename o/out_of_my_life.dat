Porter played high school football as a wide receiver. He also played on a highly successful team in high school, and described himself as huge fan of the Friday Night Lights movie. Meanwhile, Taylor Kitsch, the show's Tim Riggins, said in an interview that he was able to relate to his character based on his own personal experiences: [...] "my father is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> more or less", he revealed in an interview, [...] "So I discover stuff that maybe I wasn't even dealing with as a person." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Shake Me, Wake Me (When It's Over)" [...] was {{released}} {{as the lead}} single from the group's third studio album, On Top (1966), in February 1966. The album {{was a combination of}} [...] "current hits" [...] and [...] "crossover material" [...] to attract a larger audience for Four Tops. The song was written and produced by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Eddie Holland, who had collaborated with Four Tops on various occasions in the past. It is written in the key of C major with the quartet's vocals ranging from G4 to D6.

2500|$|Crosby and McGuinn also {{collaborated on}} the jazzy [...] "I See You", which {{represented}} {{another example of}} abstract lyrics coupled with raga-influenced, psychedelic guitar solos. Author Johnny Rogan has commented that [...] "I See You" [...] was indicative of The Byrds' {{move away from the}} darkly-romantic songs of Gene Clark towards material that examined psychological states. The album also includes the instrumental [...] "Captain Soul", a song credited to all four band members that grew out of an in-studio jam of Lee Dorsey's [...] "Get <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life,</b> Woman" [...] and which features Gene Clark playing harmonica.|$|E

It was Mona who was troubled the most by having to care for her niece and nephew. [...] "It was very big of her to take on the responsibility, but having said that, I wish people wouldn't do that. I wish people wouldn't be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your 'big' and keep your 'rotten' and get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> because, quite frankly, I would rather have gone to a children's home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same.

Jackson's musical goal was to evolve her teen pop sound to something more substantial. [...] "I know what I wanted to do, I always wanted a street sound. Michael kept saying 'Do it, move away, do your own sound.' That's why I moved to New York, to stop living in a fantasy world, get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sheltered <b>life.</b> As far as I'm concerned, it's my first album." ...|$|R
