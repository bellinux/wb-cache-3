50|$|The Fernando Pó batis is {{restless and}} shy, highly {{arboreal}} and forages within {{the canopy of}} tall trees. It forages for insects by gleaning foliage, by flycatching or by picking prey off leaves while briefly hovering. Large insects with hard exoskeletons are rubbed and hit against a branch before being dismembered. It will join other species in mixed foraging flocks. Little {{is known about the}} breeding biology but fledged juveniles have been seen in October. The nest is built in the <b>outer</b> <b>fork</b> of a branch by both birds in the pair, using bark strips and fibres.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings are pale yellow, much mottled with bright reddish ferruginous, and clouded with chestnut brown. This is most conspicuous {{in a broad}} fasciaform shade, commencing a little before {{the middle of the}} costa, extending outward to the costal cilia, narrowed downward to the cell, and thence bifurcate to the dorsum. The inner fork, more conspicuous than the outer, forming a brown dorsal patch at one-fourth from the base, the <b>outer</b> <b>fork</b> diffused toward the termen which is also shaded throughout with chestnut brown. The hindwings are dark tawny brown, tending to brownish fuscous toward their apex; cilia brownish grey, with a paler, patch below the apex.|$|E

A study of the Linnet (Carpodacus mexicanus frontalis) was conducted on the island of Hawaii from 1969 through 1973. Pair bond formation commences in early spring with a characteristic male courting behavior. Both native and introduced trees are utilized as nesting sites and {{there appears to be a}} direct correlation between nest height and total height of the tree. Favored areas of placement were found to be in the lower inside region of the tree, with a possible shift occurring to the <b>outer</b> <b>forks.</b> Nest construction [...] primarily by the female [...] takes from six to 11 days. The measurements of a number of nests are given with the types of materials utilized. Clutch size was found to be 3. 9 ± 0. 7 eggs and the mean weight of the eggs was 1. 5 ± 0. 2 grams. Incubation period was 13 to 14 days and the nestling period varied from 14 to 17 days. The breeding season of the Linnet in Hawaii extends from early March through late July. It appears that in the past 100 years the breeding biology of the Linnet in Hawaii has changed little from that of the birds in western North America. Research was supported in part by the International Council for Bird Preservation, the McInerny Foundation, the Hawaii Audubon Society and the ISLAND ECOSYSTEMS Integrated Research Program of the US/IBP...|$|R

40|$|Asynchronous {{circuits}} {{already have}} shown their benefits. The main drawback {{is the lack}} of powerful CAD and layout generation tools limiting the widespread use of the asynchronous methodology. QDI asynchronous circuits are known as a powerful category of asynchronous circuits targeting performance and power driven design. In this paper we addressed standard cell implementation of the template based QDI circuits utilizing standard layout generation tools. This is achieved by analyzing and removing <b>outer</b> cell isochronic <b>fork</b> constraint which is the main timing constraints limiting the standard layout generation. The isochronic fork free final netlist has 10 - 20 % area overhead in average which is the cost of facilitating the use of standard CAD tools...|$|R
50|$|A. eonegundo has {{compound}} leaves {{divided into}} {{at least three}} leaflets, with the leaflets pinnately veined and ranging up to 4.8 cm in length. The leaflets have small petiolules and asymmetric bases flaring out on the basal side while remaining narrow on the apical side. Each lateral leaflet has 7 secondary veins that fork near the leaf margin with the inner branch curving upwards to join the next secondary vein up, while the <b>outer</b> <b>fork</b> extends to the leaf margin. The outer forks brace the sinuses between the teeth on the blade margins. Overall {{the teeth of the}} leaflets compound, each of the large teeth having 1 to 2 smaller teeth on the basal side. The leaves have tertiary veins that form acute angle-right angle structuring with the veins spaced 0.7 - 1.3 cm apart. The quaternary veins form a network of areoles that are irregular polygons.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of an abnormal failure of forklift forks {{is presented in}} this work. The investigation results suggested that failure occurred due to fatigue mechanism followed by sudden overload fracture. The orientation of fatigue fracture indicates abnormal lifting operation, favouring crack initiation from <b>outer</b> <b>fork</b> area which is the compression designed zone. Moreover, various surface flaws and weakness areas (such as surface marks, decarburized microstructures and weld zones) identified on the <b>outer</b> <b>fork</b> zone, compromise fatigue strength inducing premature crack nucleation and fast growth towards final failure...|$|E
