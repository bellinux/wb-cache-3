Our protocol included clinical data, assessment of functional interference of symptoms and neurological examination including <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> of MD. RESULTS: Eight (13. 3 %) subjects reported the presence of tremor at the moment of interview and 29 (48. 3 %) recalled this symptom at some point during treatment. Neurological examination identified 14 (23. 3 %) subjects with MD: upper limb symmetric action tremor in 13 (21. 6 %) and parkinsonism (rigidity and bradykinesia) in 1 (1. 7 %). No other MD was detected. The mean scores indicated mild clinical signs in all cases. Symptoms were considered subjectively mild with no functional interference.

40|$|Streams are {{important}} habitats, providing shelter and feeding opportunities {{for a wide}} range of organisms. The species depending on running waters includes a wide array of fish species, using these waters for their whole or parts of their lifecycle. Streams are also the subject of different anthropogenic impact, e. g. hydropower development. Hydropower development usually means lost connectivity, altered flow regimes and channelization. Channelization is one of the major factors causing stream habitat loss and degradation and thereby a threat to biodiversity of running waters. In the present study, the ecological impact of channelization on the fish fauna along a gradient of channelization severeness was examined. Besides channelization, stream velocity and depth were taken in to account. The study was carried out in two adjacent nemoboreal streams, Gavleån and Testeboån. The study was conducted between the 6 th of June and the 10 th of October 2012 at 15 sites. Sites were selected using historical maps <b>and</b> field <b>observations</b> <b>and</b> <b>graded</b> 0 - 3 depending on the degree of channelization. Fish community were sampled with, Nordic multi-mesh Stream Survey Net (NSSN). In all, 1. 465 fish were captured, representing 15 species and seven families. The sites differed in species richness, abundance and proportion of individuals. Based on the results from rarefaction curves and ANOVA, channelization was found to be the main factor affecting the fish biota, both in abundance as well as species richness and composition. In general the rheophilic species declined along the gradient of increasing channelization severeness, while limnophilic species increase...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if students who observe bullying report higher levels of depression, anxiety, and aggression as compared to students who do not observe bullying. Three hypotheses guided this investigation. First, it was hypothesized that students who observe bullying will have significantly higher internalizing (e. g., depression and anxiety) and externalizing (e. g., aggression) problems than those who do not observe bullying. Second, males will exhibit higher scores on self-reported externalizing behaviors (i. e., The Aggression Questionnaire), and females will exhibit higher scores on self-reported internalizing behaviors (i. e., The Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children and Children’s Depression Inventory). Secondary analyses were run to determine if the effect of observer status was dependent on gender and/or grade. Third, students who report a higher frequency of observing bullying interactions will also report higher internalizing and externalizing problems than students who report observing bullying at a lower frequency. ^ Participants in this current investigation were 129 sixth, seventh, eighth <b>and</b> ninth <b>grade</b> students across three Midwestern schools. Findings from ANCOVAs utilizing multiple regression confirm that students who observe bullying report significantly higher rates of anxiety than students who do not observe bullying. After controlling for observer status as well as frequency of <b>observation,</b> school <b>and</b> <b>grade,</b> females report significantly higher levels of anxiety than males. Students who observed bullying at a higher frequency (once or more per day) reported significantly higher levels of anxiety than students who did not observe bullying. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences between students who observed bullying interactions and those who did not on self report scores of depression and aggression. ^ The implications of the results are discussed, as well as the potential impact that the findings may have on bullying prevention and intervention. Finally, this study will address the limitations of the current investigation and will identify possible directions for future research. ...|$|R

The experimental groups were: control; chamomile recutita; triamcinolone acetonide and clobetasol propionate. For the in vitro study the cell viability of fibroblasts cultured for 24 h in media conditioned by the substances was obtained by the MITT reduction analysis. For the in vivo study, 125 male rats were submitted to experimental ulcers treated or not (control) by the substances tested. At 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 days later 5 animals of each group were sacrificed. The lesions were analyzed by means of clinical <b>observation</b> <b>and</b> histological wound-healing <b>grading.</b> Data were compared by ANOVA (p <= 0. 05). All experimental groups presented positive cell viability in 24 h. The cultures treated with chamomile presented the smallest cell viability. All animals of the chamomile group exhibited complete wound healing 9 days before the other groups. Complete repaired lesions were observed after 5 days of treatment only in the chamomile group. Animals treated with chamomile presented significantly faster wound healing in comparison to those treated with corticosteroids. Based on the conditions of this study, we concluded that chamomile in comparison to corticosteroids promotes faster wound healing process. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{qualitative}} research is to describe the learning experiences of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> of new teachers and to describe how teaching experience at a school can affect teachers' learning experience. Science method pre-service teachers from a university in New South Wales who gained fulltime employment on completion of their course {{were invited to participate}} in the research project during their first year of teaching. Data was collected from the interested participants to identify their conceptions, actual and intended practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> in three stages using a questionnaire and semi structured interviews in a longitudinal study. Data collected at different stages was compared to describe the learning experiences of new teachers. Furthermore, qualitative data from interviews was analysed to describe how school based teaching experience affect the learning of new teachers. It was found that new teachers experience changes in their conceptions and practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> during the first school semester of their teaching experience. There was minimal change in the teachers' conceptions about the general purpose of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> However, there were noticeable changes in the teachers' conceptions about the quality of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> in terms of what constitutes as acceptable practices of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> This suggests that school based teaching experience play a significant role in the learning of the new teachers about assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading,</b> although teachers did not attribute this change to their teaching experience at this school. Findings of this research study have implications for pre-service education programs offered by universities, indicating a need to include more explicit courses in the area of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading.</b> New teachers also need to be provided with more support in the area of assessment <b>and</b> <b>grading</b> as part of their induction and mentoring systems offered at schools...|$|R

Using a multimethod, multilevel approach, {{this study examined the}} link between classroom emotional climate and academic achievement, including the role of student engagement as a mediator. Data were collected from 63 fifth- and sixth-grade classrooms (N � 1, 399 students) <b>and</b> included classroom <b>observations,</b> student reports, <b>and</b> report card <b>grades.</b> As predicted, multilevel mediation analyses showed that the positive relationship between classroom emotional climate <b>and</b> <b>grades</b> was mediated by engagement, while controlling for teacher characteristics <b>and</b> <b>observations</b> of both the organizational and instructional climates of the classrooms. Effects were robust across <b>grade</b> level <b>and</b> student gender. The discussion highlights the role of classroom-based, emotion-related interactions to promote academic achievement...|$|R
