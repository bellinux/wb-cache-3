40|$|There {{is growing}} concern {{regarding}} the potentially negative impacts of sea level rise (SLR) on tidal wetlands in the Mid-Atlantic {{region of the}} United States.

In Chapter two, I investigate the nitrogen removal role of Chesapeake Bay tidal wetlands under current and simulated long-term SLR. I also examine nitrogen removal at smaller scales in Maryland, comparing restoration goals for nitrogen loading reductions {{with the loss of}} nitrogen <b>removal</b> <b>services</b> expected by 2025.
