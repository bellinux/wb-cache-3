40|$|Blood-contacting {{devices have}} contributed to {{improving}} the treatment of patients. However, thrombus formation at the interface between a connector and tube is still a potential source of thrombus-related complications that induce stroke or myocardial infarction. We aimed to develop a non-blood-contacting real-time method for visualizing thrombus formation, and to experimentally investigate the time-dependent phenomenon of thrombus formation at the interface between a connector and a tube in a medical device. An optical coherence tomography device with a center wavelength of 1330 nm was used to visualize thrombus formation during porcine blood circulation for 50 min in a closed 50 -mL circulation system isolated from ambient air. The thrombus formation sites at the interface between a tube and connector were visualized. The area of the thrombus formation at the interface between the inlet of the connector and the tube {{was found to be}} 0. 012 ± 0. 011 mm 2. Conversely, at the interface between the outlet of the connector and the tube, the area was found to be 0. 637 ± 0. 306 mm 2. Thus, significantly larger amounts of thrombus were formed at the <b>outlet</b> <b>interface</b> (p < 0. 01). The thrombus formation area at the <b>outlet</b> <b>interface</b> increased over time. Conversely, the area of thrombus formation showed repeated increasing and decreasing behavior at the inlet interface. Flow visualization with particle image velocimetry showed the presence of a flow separated area in the minimal flow phase at the inlet interface and a large recirculating slow flow region at the <b>outlet</b> <b>interface</b> in the minimal flow phase. These data suggested that the recirculating stagnant flow region contributed to thrombus growth. The method presented here was effective in quantitatively assessing time-dependent phenomena of thrombus formation at the connector-tube interface. The method may contribute to the assessment of thrombogenicity of a novel design of connector...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of proteins utilising a polymer-based restricted access support material with ion exchange properties (IERAM) is outlined. Solid phase extraction coupled on-line with a microbore reversed phase HPLC {{system for the}} quantitation of small marker proteins is demonstrated. The cation-exchange restricted access packings were characterised {{with respect to their}} adsorption and desorption kinetics. The IERAM material was also investigated by capacity, selectivity, and biocompatibility determinations when applied to the quantification of small molecular weight proteins such as cytochrome C, Lysozyme, Ribonuclease A, Myoglobin, Insulin, human serum albumin, and a Tryptic inhibitor. The integrated system was coupled to mass identity of selected proteins by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The chromatographic <b>outlet</b> was <b>interfaced</b> to an "Interplate" fractionation collecter that sampled 1 μL volumes directly onto the MALDI target plate. The fully automated coupled column system was run unattended overnight and applied to protein quantitations in human plasma samples. Recovery data for a selected number of proteins varied between 90 - 96 % (n = 10) with a limit of quantification around 2 μM with an injection volume of 100 μL. The RSD data were typically less than 8 % at a 50 μM protein level (n = 7) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mathematical model of screw compressors’ working process, {{in which the}} internal flow domains are divided into three kinds of fluids—the inlet fluid, the primitive volume fluid, and <b>outlet</b> fluid. Grid <b>interface</b> method and dynamic mesh technique of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) theory were utilized to simulate the suction, compression, and discharge process in order to model the dynamic characteristics of the flow domains in a screw compressor. To verify that the model is numerically accurate and the simulation method is effective, experiments on the pressure-volume changes in screw compressor were carried out. The result {{has shown that the}} simulation data is in good agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, the numerical calculation model and the simulation method can be very useful for the screw compressor design and research...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the unsteady airflow through the fan stage of a bypass turbofan is pro- posed. Experiments are conducted in the turbofan test facility of ISAE, specially suited to reproduce windmilling operation in an ambient ground setup. Hot-wire anemometry is used to obtain steady Mach number and flow angle profiles {{as well as to}} characterize the unsteady, turbulent flow, at different stations across the fan stage (fan inlet, <b>outlet</b> and rotor/stator <b>interface).</b> Phase averaging of unsteady signals and integral length scale estimations provide further evidence of the presence of a vortex shedding from the stator, as well as {{the fact that it is}} correlated to the rotor blade passing frequency. Self-similarity of mean Mach number, flow angle and turbulent intensity profiles is observed. Furthermore, turbulent scale profiles are found to scale well with blade passing period...|$|R
30|$|The gas core flow in {{a typical}} annular flow was modeled by Han (2005) and Han and Gabriel (2007). Similar to the works of Jayanti and Hewitt (1997), the effects of liquid film flow on the gas core were {{simplified}} and considered {{through the use of}} experimental correlations. The physical configuration of the interfacial wave as observed by Zhu and Gabriel (2004) was utilized in their study. RNG k–ε turbulence model was employed in their simulation. Periodic boundary conditions were utilized for both the inlet and the <b>outlet</b> boundaries. The <b>interface</b> between the two phases was taken to be a moving wall with its entrainment rate and velocity obtained from experimental correlations. Results from the simulation showed that minimum static pressure exists at the vicinity of the wave peak and it was proposed that this might be the cause of the high droplet entrainment into the gas core region close to the wave peak.|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} {{withdrawal of}} weakly compressible fluids is investigated by smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with a revised model of surface tension. In our model problem, fluid is withdrawn from a two-dimensional microcavity {{through a narrow}} <b>outlet</b> above the <b>interface</b> of two immiscible fluids. The outflow boundary is implemented by a particular zone of fluid particles with prescribed velocity, together {{with the introduction of}} artificial boundary particles. Based on the average number density of fluid particles, the effective contribution of boundary particles is corrected for the compressible context. It is found that there exists a critical withdrawal rate for each initial interface height, beyond which the lower phase becomes entrained in a thin spout along with the upper phase. Besides, the Froude number with redefinition for this kind of multiphase flow could serve as a criterion of flow behavior. Furthermore, larger surface tension, smaller dynamical viscosity and density of the upper phase all lead to longer threshold time of formation of the spout state, and thus are favorable to the withdrawal of upper phase both in terms of higher efficiency and larger quantity...|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{rheological}} properties {{play a key}} role in the stability of a wide range of high-interface materials and thin films. For many systems, it is desirable to understand the response of the interface to a change of composition in the surrounding bulk phases. Stimuli, such as changes in pH or electrolyte concentration, can have a major effect on the structure and properties of the interfacial layer, or induce adsorption and desorption phenomena. Shear rheology is a particularly sensitive measure of such changes, as it only probes the extra stresses in the interface, regardless of possible variations in interfacial tension. In the present work, a widely used geometry for interfacial rheometry, the double-wall ring, is modified to enable subphase exchanges. The trade-off between the speed of exchange and the stress exerted by the flow in the subphase onto the interface is carefully considered. The optimal geometrical design is found by employing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A geometry with inlets positioned at the bottom and <b>outlets</b> near the <b>interface</b> minimizes the mixing time. Experiments on interfaces with colloidal particles and proteins, subjected to changes in electrolyte concentration and pH, respectively, are used to evaluate the performance of the setup. status: publishe...|$|R
