5000|$|The {{number of}} species invasions {{has been on the}} rise at least since the {{beginning}} of the 1900s. Species are increasingly being moved by humans (on purpose and accidentally). In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats (e.g.: zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast). Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance. Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals. An important question is, [...] "do invasive species cause extinctions?" [...] Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives, but not extinctions. Invasive species seem to increase local (i.e.: alpha diversity) diversity, which decreases turnover of diversity (i.e.: beta diversity). <b>Overall</b> <b>gamma</b> diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes, but even some of the most insidious invaders (e.g.: Dutch elm disease, emerald ash borer, chestnut blight in North America) have not caused their host species to become extinct. Extirpation, population decline and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common. Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers, [...] by introducing them for food and other purposes. Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas (and thus become invasive) occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a stochastic, discrete, {{structured}} meta population model {{to explore the}} dynamics and patterns of biodiversity of riparian vegetation. In the model, individual plants spread along a branched network via directional dispersal and undergo neutral ecological drift. Simulation results suggest that in comparison to 2 -D landscapes with non-directional dispersal, river networks with directional dispersal have lower local (alpha) and <b>overall</b> (<b>gamma)</b> diversities, but higher between-community (beta) diversity, implying that riparian species are distributed in a more localized pattern and more vulnerable to local extinction. The relative abundance patterns also change, such that higher percentages of species are in low-abundance, or rare, classes, accompanied by concave rank-abundance curves. In contrast to existing theories, the results Suggest that in river networks, increased directional dispersal reduces alpha diversity. These altered patterns and trends result from the combined effects of directionality of dispersal and river network structure, whose relative importance {{is in need of}} continuing study. In addition, riparian communities obeying neutral dynamics seem to exhibit abrupt changes where large tributaries confluence; this pattern may provide a signature to identify types of interspecific dynamics in river networks...|$|E
40|$|The ventro-lateral {{pulvinar}} is reciprocally {{connected with}} the visual areas of the ventral stream that are important for object recognition. To understand the mechanisms of attentive stimulus processing in this pulvinar-cortex loop, we investigated the interactions between the pulvinar, area V 4, and IT cortex in a spatial-attention task. Sensory processing {{and the influence of}} attention in the pulvinar appeared to reflect its cortical inputs. However, pulvinar deactivation led to a reduction of attentional effects on firing rates and gamma synchrony in V 4, a reduction of sensory-evoked responses and <b>overall</b> <b>gamma</b> coherence within V 4, and severe behavioral deficits in the affected portion of the visual field. Conversely, pulvinar deactivation caused an increase in low-frequency cortical oscillations, often associated with inattention or sleep. Thus, cortical interactions with the ventro-lateral pulvinar are necessary for normal attention and sensory processing and for maintaining the cortex in an active state. The pulvinar is often proposed to modulate cortical processing with attention. Zhou et al. find that beyond any role in attention, the pulvinar input to cortex seems necessary to maintain the cortex in an active state. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in neuroscience concerns how {{the human brain}} represents perceptual and conceptual information. Tradition-ally, researchers probed this issue by identifying single neurons that increased their firing rate when an animal encountered certain stimuli.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed {{in the application}} of many models of catchment behaviour that catchment rainfall is uniformly distributed over a catchment. This study examines the effects of non-uniform spatially distributed rainfall on the application of the unit hydrograph theory. A simple distributed linear catchment model is used to simulate the response of a catchment to stationary and moving storms and three different unit hydrograph derivation techniques have been applied to the responses obtained. The model responses demonstrate that spatial distribution of rainfall can produce effects which might be mistakenly used as evidence of non-linear catchment behaviour. The unit hydrograph derivation techniques were least successful for slow moving storms and large catchments. <b>Overall</b> the <b>gamma</b> distribution method resulted in the best estimates of the unit hydrographs. However the least squares techniques achieved the best results for stationary storms. The spatially distributed rainfall resulted in the derivation of markedly different unit hydrographs for different storms on the same catchment.

Although neuroimaging evidence has mostly corroborated these accounts, the basic mechanism(s) of reduced functional connec-tivity remains elusive. In this study, we examine the developmental trajectory and underlying mechanism(s) of dysfunctional connec-tivity by using gamma oscillatory power as an index of local and long-range circuit integrity. An early-onset psychosis group and a matched cohort of typically developing adolescents listened to monaurally presented click-trains, as whole-head magnetoence-phalography data were acquired.

Thus, it is a potential model species for studies of the earliest stages of domestication; however, there is little available quantitative information on its wild population biology and ecology. As such information is vital to studies of the ecological changes occurring during domestication, {{the purpose of this study}} was to consolidate the relevant knowledge available and conduct a preliminary search for patterns in the invertebrate communities of wild bogs. The alpha diversity was found to be greater than the <b>overall</b> (<b>gamma</b> diversity), which is likely a result of the metric used and the fact that there was minimal overlap in rare species between bogs. In addition, alpha diversity was found to be significantly negatively correlated with bog age. Two pairs of species were found to be correlated with each other, Blunt-nosed (Limotettix vaccinia (Van Duzee)) and Sharp-nosed leafhopper (Scaphytopius sp.), along with fleabeetle (Sysena frontalis (F.)) and firebeetle (Cryptocephalus incertus (Oliv.). In addition, it was found that spiders are significantly more common in western bogs, while firebeetle is significantly more common in eastern bogs. However, this may be indicative of a correlation with bog age rather than a true correlation with geographic location.

40|$|Trafficking of {{radioactive}} material, particularly {{special nuclear material}} (SNM), {{has long been a}} worldwide concern. To interdict this material the US government has installed radiation portal monitors (RPMs) around the globe. Building materials surrounding an RPM can greatly effect the detector?s background radiation levels due to Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM). In some cases this effect is so great that the initial RPM setup had to be rebuilt. This thesis develops a methodology for quick and efficient determination of the specific activity and composition of building materials surrounding a RPM to predict background levels, therefore determining the minimum detectable quantity (MDQ) of material. This methodology builds on previous work by Ryan et al by generating material and source cards for a detailed Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) deck, based on an experimental RPM setup to predict the <b>overall</b> <b>gamma</b> background at a site. Gamma spectra were acquired from samples of building materials and analyzed to determine the specific activity of the samples.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed an exploratory TTO modeling study, using a cohort of diabetes mellitus patients. Four parametric distributions (exponential, lognormal, gamma, and Weibull) were compared in terms of their goodness of fit. Covariates that could influence the TTO were investigated.

It is shown that the macroscopically apparent injection condition depends on the geometry of the inlet section. A reduction of the cross-sectional area of the inlet relative to that of the column is very effective in excluding the diffusive solute input, thus allowing us to use the solutions for a flux Injection also at rather low mean flow velocities nu. If the whole cross section of a column is exposed to a large reservoir like that of ambient air, a semi-infinite resident injection is established, which can be distinguished from a flux injection even at relatively high velocities nu, depending on the mechanical dispersivity of the porous medium...|$|R

40|$|On March 11 2011 the {{north-eastern}} {{region of}} Japan {{was hit by}} a magnitude 9 earthquake, which occurred underneath the sea-bed 70 km east of the Oshika peninsula in Tohoku. The north-eastern shore of Honshu {{was hit by a}} tsunami resulting from this earthquake. As a consequence, reactors 1 - 4 at the nuclear power station Fukushima-Daiichi suffered a completed loss of power and cooling causing a partial core meltdown in units 1, 2 and 3 followed by a series of explosions and the release of large quantities of radioactivity into the environment. The accident was rated level 7 (the highest level) on the International Nuclear Event Scale. While most of the emissions were driven towards the Pacific Ocean, a significant amount of radioactive material was deposited onto the Japanese land-mass, resulting in enhanced localised radiation exposure. This report covers measurements and detailed radiation maps conducted by a UK University team working with Japanese colleagues during a series of visits in 2012. They have been presented and shared locally in Japan at time of acquisition. Since then the data have been cross-validated relative to soil samples from a reference site established at the University of Fukushima, and analysed independently in the UK and in Japan. This report provides detailed descriptions of the data sets, validated radiometric maps for 134 Cs, 137 Cs and the <b>overall</b> <b>gamma</b> dose rates, together with a full account of the establishment of the calibration site. The work reported here demonstrates the utility of detailed radiometric maps in helping to understand the distribution of radionuclides in complex environmental systems. This information is potentially of use to help avoid unnecessary external radiation exposure in the outdoor environment, to help to visualise and target areas for remediation, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} clean-up and soil removal activities, to examine uptake of radioactivity from the environment through agricultural systems, and to monitor redistribution over time of the activity in the environment. The report includes full copies of digital data sets for the demonstration surveys. Radiometric methods provide means of measuring radioactivity with recognised roles in nuclear emergency response, and environmental applications. In the aftermath of nuclear accidents they are crucial to evaluate the environmental impact of the accident and guide remediation measures. The Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) is a research centre attached to the University of Glasgow with extensive experience of radiometric mapping using airborne and ground based systems, conducting most of the UK post-Chernobyl radiation mapping using airborne systems and coordinating European projects to harmonise and cross-calibrate systems for nuclear emergency response purposes. In the early stages of major accidents the most pressing needs are for rapid, large scale, information. Airborne surveys of the affected area were conducted initially by a joint US/Japanese team and later on by The Ministry of Education Science and Technology (MEXT) and the Japanese Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), eventually providing national scale radiation maps with a spatial resolution of several hundred meters. In later stages of accident recovery there are increasing needs for more detailed spatial information and increasing requirements for objective, traceable and cross validated analysis. Systems for this work need to be mobile, preferably portable, efficient, robust and well calibrated, providing detailed real time information directly on location. The SUERC Portable Gamma Spectrometry system fulfils these criteria. It provides a spatial resolution of better than 10 m for mapped data and allows a real time identification of spatial features down to 10 - 20 cm. In the work reported here, calibration sites have been established in Fukushima at the campus of Fukushima University and the Fukushima Prefecture Fruit Tree Research Institute to provide objective and internationally traceable validation of ground based instruments. High resolution HPGe spectrometry of soil samples conducted at laboratories at Fukushima University and SUERC was used for validation of the field instrument. Values of 137 Cs activity concentration measured by the two laboratories were in full agreement to high precision. Agreement for the 134 Cs activity concentration values was within 5 - 10...|$|E
40|$|An {{airborne}} {{gamma ray}} {{survey was conducted}} for the Scottish Office Environment Department of coastal and inland parts of SW Scotland to define existing background levels, to locate features worthy of further attention, and to demonstrate the emergency response capabilities of radiometric methods. Coastal areas were surveyed with 500 m line spacing. Inland areas were specified to 2 km line spacing, however {{it was possible to}} achieve 1 km line spacing in the majority of the inland zone. Fieldwork was conducted between the 1 st and 16 th February 1993. A total of over 17, 000 gamma ray spectra were recorded, using a 16 litre NaI spectrometer mounted in a helicopter flying at 50 - 75 m ground clearance and 120 kph. A total area of 3650 km 2 was surveyed in 41. 6 flying hours, from roughly 4370 line kilometres. The data were reduced in the field using standard SURRC procedures for background subtraction, stripping of spectral interferences, altitude correction, and calibration. Preliminary maps of the distribution of 137 Cs, 40 K, 214 Bi, 208 Tl, and estimated ground level gamma dose rate were produced during the fieldwork period using working calibration values derived from previous surveys. A set of core samples was collected from Wigtown Merse, Longbridgemuir and Caerlaverock merse for calibration purposes, and aerial observations were performed at these sites. Further soil sampling and ground level in-situ gamma spectrometry was performed in the summer of 1993 to investigate the applicability of the calibration to a range of upland soil types and topographical environments. These locations received peak deposition from the Chernobyl accident, are vulnerable to wet deposition, and are difficult to monitor rapidly using ground based methods. A total of 76 soil cores, subdivided into 168 separate samples was thus collected for high resolution gamma spectrometry in the laboratory. This was conducted from April to November 1993. For the terrestrial sites the aerial survey estimates based on the working calibration, were in good agreement with both in-situ gamma spectrometry and the results of core analysis. This validates the preliminary maps in these contexts, and confirms that a general calibration is sufficient for fallout mapping under emergency response conditions. On coastal salt marsh sites (merse), where aged deposits of Sellafield derived activity have accumulated, subsurface activity profiles for 137 Cs and 241 Am and the presence of superficial levels of 134 Cs were observed from the soil cores. Similar features have been observed in previous surveys. In these cases the effects of source burial {{must be taken into account}} to avoid underestimation of activity levels by both ground-based and aerial gamma spectrometry. A separate set of detailed maps for the principal merse sites was therefore prepared using a calibration factor derived from the soil cores from this context. There are prospects for developing spectral analysis procedures to account for source depth in aerial surveys. Source burial on the merse also has implications for sampling techniques, and for dose rate measurement, which would merit further consideration. The radiometric maps show clearly the distributions of each individual nuclide and indicate the contribution which individual localised features make to the <b>overall</b> <b>gamma</b> ray dose rate. Naturally occurring nuclides reflect the underlying geological and geomorphological contexts of the landscape. The main granite intrusions, most notably at Cairnsmore of Fleet, the Loch Doon Granodiorite, Glencairn of Carsphairn, the Dalbeattie granite, and Criffel Pluton are readily visible in 40 K, 214 Bi and 208 Tl maps, and control their local radiation environments. A number of areas of enhanced 214 Bi, which may reflect radon potential, were noted. A transient radon associated 214 Bi signal was observed on the west of the Wigtown peninsular during the survey. Examination of spectral data in the vicinity of Dundrennan has confirmed that there is no evidence of widespread terrestrial contamination arising from the use of depleted uranium projectiles on the range. The 137 Cs map indicates the environmental distribution of this nuclide in considerable detail. Levels of 137 Cs range from approximately 2 kBq m- 2, a level consistent with global weapons’ testing fallout, from 2 - 40 kBq m- 2 on terrestrial sites affected by deposition from the Chernobyl accident, and from 40 kBq m- 2 to over 200 kBq m- 2 on tide washed pastures which have accumulated marine sediments from the Irish Sea. All three levels are represented within the survey zone, in a manner which is consistent with the findings of previous aerial surveys in adjacent areas, and with ground based studies. The main Chernobyl deposition in Dumfries and Galloway appears to have occurred between an area just east of the Nith, and Glenluce. The northern limit has not yet been defined, and there may be grounds for considering extension of the northern and particularly eastern limits of the inland survey zone. Within the survey zone the deposition pattern is complex, including both upland and lowland components. The plume trajectories for deposition inferred from these observations are oriented northwards rather than in the NW directions predicted by meteorological derived estimates. This may explain the contradiction between results from the Central Highlands and the estimated fallout patterns. The data presented here both add to previous knowledge, and serve as a baseline against which any future changes can be measured. The survey provides systematic coverage of the sedimentary and terrestrial coastal system for the first time, and has identified a number of merse sites which have accumulated radioactivity from past marine discharges from Sellafield, and which are not routinely monitored under existing Scottish Office arrangements. Some of these locations are extensive and fall within SSI’s; furthermore they are key sites for studying future deposition trends. It would seem prudent to review radiological assessments in the light of this work to ensure that the patterns of occupancy and sensitive ecologies of the merse are taken fully into account. The emergency response potential of aerial radiometrics has been clearly demonstrated in this project. It provides the only practical means of providing comprehensive environmental measurements of remote and upland landscapes on a short time scale, with an effective area sampling density some 106 - 107 times greater than soil sampling. Results are compatible with ground based approaches, and could focus ground based efforts effectively under emergency conditions. Modern approaches to data recording and analysis are able to produce maps during the survey period. National baseline mapping in Scotland, at 1 km resolution, would require less than 800 flying hours; 20 km line spacing would take roughly 40 hours of flight time. A long term programme of high resolution national baseline mapping, coupled to an emergency response standby arrangement, would provide an extremely cost effective way of preserving the capability developed since the Chernobyl accident, while producing high quality environmental data for research purpos...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of tropical clouds remains a major open scientific question, {{given that the}} associated phys-ics is not well represented by models. One challenge is to realistically reproduce cloud droplet size dis-tributions (DSD) and their evolution over time and space. Many applications, not limited to models, use the Gamma function to represent DSDs. However, {{there is almost no}} study dedicated to understanding the phase space of this function, which is given by the three parameters that define the DSD intercept, shape, and curvature. Gamma phase space may provide a common framework for parameterizations and inter-comparisons. Here, we introduce the phase-space approach and its characteristics, focusing on warm-phase microphysical cloud properties and the transition to the mixed-phase layer. We show that trajectories in this phase space can represent DSD evolution and can be related to growth processes. Condensational and collisional growth may be interpreted as pseudo-forces that induce displacements in opposite directions within the phase space. The actually observed movements in the phase space are a result of the combination of such pseudo-forces. Additionally, aerosol effects can be evaluated given their significant impact on DSDs. The DSDs associated with liquid droplets that favor cloud glaciation can be delimited in the phase space, which can help models to adequately predict the transition to the mixed phase. We also consider possible ways to constrain the DSD in two-moment bulk microphysics schemes, where the relative dispersion parameter of the DSD can play a significant role. <b>Overall,</b> the <b>Gamma</b> phase-space approach can be an invaluable tool for studying cloud microphysical evolution and can be readily applied in many scenarios that rely on Gamma DSDs...|$|R

40|$|The human {{olfactory}} system recognizes {{a broad spectrum}} of odorants using approximately 400 different olfactory receptors (hORs). Although significant improvements of heterologous expression systems used to study interactions between ORs and odorant molecules have been made, screening the olfactory repertoire of hORs remains a tremendous challenge. We therefore developed a chemical systems level approach based on protein-protein association network to investigate novel hOR-odorant relationships. Using this new approach, we proposed and validated new bioactivities for odorant molecules and OR 2 W 1, OR 51 E 1 and OR 5 P 3. As it remains largely unknown how human perception of odorants influence or prevent diseases, we also developed an odorant-protein matrix to explore global relationships between chemicals, biological targets and disease susceptibilities. We successfully experimentally demonstrated interactions between odorants and the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB 1) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor <b>gamma</b> (PPAR <b>gamma).</b> <b>Overall,</b> these results illustrate the potential of integrative systems chemical biology to explore the impact of odorant molecules on human health, i. e. human odorome...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although the time-to-onset (TTO) is an {{important}} aspect in causality assessment of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), limited information about it is available in publicly available literature. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether the TTO of common ADRs of antidiabetic drugs could be modelled using parametric distributions and whether these distributions were dependent on patient characteristics. Methods: We performed an exploratory TTO modelling study, using an existing observational cohort of diabetes mellitus patients. Four parametric distributions (exponential, lognormal, gamma and Weibull) were compared in terms of their goodness of fit using the Akaike information component (AIC) and evidence ratios. Covariates that could influence the TTO (sex, age group and suspected concomitant medication) were investigated using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing. Results: For the antidiabetic drugs metformin, sulphonylurea (SU) derivatives and dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors, a total of 441 ADRs were included for analysis. These consisted of reports concerning diarrhoea (n= 255), nausea (n= 127) and dizziness (n= 59). <b>Overall,</b> the <b>gamma</b> distribution provided the best goodness of fit, although differences with the Weibull distribution were negligible in some instances. No statistically significant differences in TTO distributions for any of the covariates, or between different antidiabetic drugs for a given ADR, were found. Mean and median TTO values were similar for different drug-ADR combinations. Conclusions: Our study shows that the TTO of common ADRs associated with antidiabetic drugs can be modelled using the gamma or Weibull distribution. These models can be used as a concept for the development of a structured approach to study the timing of events, and thus the causality assessment of ADRs. Furthermore, the results seem to indicate that a causal relationship between drug and ADR should not be dismissed based on a long TTO alone...|$|R

METHODS: 105 women with early stage (1 a 1 - 2 a) cervical cancer were scheduled for the sentinel node procedure in conjunction with a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy. The day before surgery, 1 - 1. 5 mL 120 MBq Tc(99) albumin nanocolloid was injected submucosally at four points around the tumor followed by a lymphoscintigram (LSG) to achieve an overview of the radiotracer uptake. RESULTS: During surgery, the <b>overall</b> detection rate (<b>gamma</b> probe) of at least one SLN was 90 % (94 / 105 women) whereas at least one SLN was identified in 94 % (61 / 65 women) with a tumor 2 cm) node without radiotracer uptake. The negative predictive value for patients with cervical cancers </= 2 cm was 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: The SLN-technique seems to be an accurate method for identifying lymph node metastases in cervical cancer patients with tumors of 2 cm or smaller. In case of a unilateral SLN only, a complete lymphadenectomy should be performed on the radionegative side. All bulky nodes must be removed...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear {{radiation}} damage due to displacement and ionization effects on power devices is well known. This affects {{the performance of}} the systems, which use these power devices. This paper presents a study on the performance degradation of a modern power supply unit operating in a nuclear environment. In this paper, a buck-boost converter has been considered which is used for feeding DC power to various electronic systems, DC drives, etc. in nuclear power plant. The power devices, which constitute the buck-boost converter, were irradiated with gamma rays and the basic parameters were monitored to determine the deviations. The experimental results have been utilized to find out the probability of failure of each device of the power converter and subsequently the reliability evaluation of the buck-boost converter has been carried out using fault tree analysis. The experimental database has been used to mathematically model the gamma radiation effects, which helps in predicting the life of electronic systems in a nuclear environment. The polynomials derived are very useful for enhancing the availability of modern power supply system working in a nuclear environment. The buck-boost converter has been simulated using PSpice to analyse the <b>overall</b> effect of <b>gamma</b> radiation damage on the modern power supply system by feeding experimental results of individual power devices into the simulation.

40|$|The ALOS PALSAR (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) sensor {{can provide}} full polarimetric data (HH, HV and VV) for {{scientific}} purposes. Dutra et al. (2008) showed that, {{from the three}} possible channels, HH-HV channels presented better classification results when the following five classes are used: primary forest, secondary forest, bare soil, agriculture and degraded forest. This study is extending the former work by {{increasing the number of}} classes, including now pasture and dirty pasture, and testing if contextual classification can improve the overall accuracy. The results showed that the contextual classification does improve the per point classification results, however not as good as region classification when SEGSAR segmentation is used. Region based classification, particularly the one developed to take in account as much as possible the radar statistical behavior, performed better for VV-HV channels with 98. 6 % of <b>overall</b> accuracy using <b>gamma</b> filter on image and 92. 7 % without gamma filter on image. Comparing this study with Dutra et al. (2008), it was possible to observe that the better channels are different, with only two classes more, which shows that the best channels set is totally dependent on a particular set of classes being considered. So, the best dual polarization depends on the desired land use application, but the HV channels seems to be always chosen. The presence of HV channel in the dual polarization products provide the better combinations for general mapping of the rain forest problem. Pages: 7749 - 775...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} is {{a significant}} threat to global health. Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine provides only partial protection, and the skin test reagent used to aid diagnosis of both active and latent tuberculosis, purified protein derivative (PPD), lacks specificity and sensitivity. The use of genetically detoxified Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) as a delivery system for two immunodominant proteins of M. tuberculosis that are of greater specificity than PPD, early-secreted antigenic target 6 -kDa protein (ESAT- 6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP- 10), was therefore investigated. CyaA toxoids incorporating these antigens were able to restimulate T cells from more than 91 % tuberculosis patients and healthy sensitized donors. Delivery of antigen by CyaA decreased by 10 -fold the amount of ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 required to restimulate T cells, and in low responders, the <b>overall</b> frequency of <b>gamma</b> interferon-producing cells detected by enzyme-linked immunospot assay was increased (P < 0. 01 for both antigens). Delivery of ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 by CyaA enabled the detection of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells: these responses could be blocked by inhibition of major histocompatibility complex class II or class I, respectively. Covalent linkage of antigen to the CyaA vector was required for enhancement to occur, as a mixture of mock CyaA toxoid plus recombinant ESAT- 6 {{did not lead to}} enhancement. In a simplified whole-blood model to detect tuberculosis infection, the frequency of positive responses to CFP- 10 was increased by CyaA delivery, a potentially important attribute that could facilitate the identification of latent infection...|$|R

In contrast, gaze aversions in line-drawn faces do not produce these N 170 differences (Rossi et al., 2014), suggesting that physical stimulus properties or experimental context may drive these effects. Here we investigated the role of stimulus-induced context on neurophysiological responses to dynamic gaze. Sixteen healthy adults viewed line-drawn and real faces, with dynamic eye aversion and direct gaze transitions, and control stimuli (scrambled arrays and checkerboards) while continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. EEG data from 2 temporo-occipital clusters of 9 electrodes in each hemisphere where N 170 activity {{is known to be}} maximal were selected for analysis. N 170 peak amplitude and latency, and temporal dynamics from Event-Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSPs) were measured in 16 healthy subjects. Real faces generated larger N 170 s for averted vs. direct gaze motion, however, N 170 s to real and direct gaze were as large as those to respective controls. N 170 amplitude did not differ across line-drawn gaze changes. <b>Overall,</b> bilateral mean <b>gamma</b> power changes for faces relative to control stimuli occurred between 150 – 350 ms, potentially reflecting signal detection of facial motion. Our data indicate that experimental context does not drive N 170 differences to viewed gaze changes.

40|$|Class of 2010 AbstractOBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the number of inpatient discharges and burden of illness due to testicular cancer with data from the national database Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). METHODS: This retrospective study looked at hospital discharge records to obtain information regarding the inpatient burden of illness of testicular cancer patients. The study looked at procedures, co-­‐morbidities, hospital characteristics, case-­‐mix control, and the Deyo-­‐Charlson to see how they were associated with the charges, length of stay, and inpatient mortality. Also included in the study was information regarding patient age, method of payment, and hospital type and size. A linear multivariate regression was performed to estimate determinates of hospital costs. RESULTS: During the 5 -­‐year time frame of the study, 28, 985 inpatient admissions with testicular cancer were identified. For the overall sample, the average total charges per hospitalization were 29, 857. For the 717 patients that died while receiving inpatient treatment, the associated charges averaged 73, 800, more than double that associated with the <b>overall</b> sample. The <b>gamma</b> regression of charges for the overall sample showed an association between increased charges and age, length of stay, number of procedures, all admission years in reference to 2002, admission to a large-­‐sized hospital in reference to a small hospital, admission to an urban hospital in reference to a rural hospital, admission to a teaching in reference to a nonteaching hospital and the Deyo-­‐Charlson score. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular cancer is on the rise worldwide and is associated with a high inpatient burden of illness...|$|R
40|$|Activation of oncogenes is {{the initial}} step in {{cellular}} transformation. Oncogenes favor aberrant proliferation, which, at least initially, induces cellular stress. This oncogenic stress {{can act as}} a safeguard mechanism against further transformation by inducing senescence or apoptosis. Yet, the few premalignant cells that tolerate and escape these senescent or apoptotic responses are those that will ultimately generate tumors. The caspase- 3 /p 120 RasGAP module is a stress-sensing device that promotes survival under mild stress conditions. A point mutation in RasGAP that prevents its cleavage by caspase- 3 inactivates the pro-survival capacity of the device. When the mice homozygous for this mutation (D 455 A knock-in mice) are patho-physiologically challenged, they experience much stronger cellular damage than their wild-type counterparts and the affected organs rapidly lose their functionality. We reasoned that the caspase- 3 /p 120 RasGAP module could help premalignant cells to cope with oncogenic stress and hence favor the development of tumors. Using gamma-irradiation and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) as tumor initiators, we assessed the survival advantage that the caspase- 3 /p 120 RasGAP module could provide to premalignant cells. No difference in overall mortality between wild-type and D 455 A knock-in mice were observed. However, the number of ENU-induced liver tumors in the knock-in mice was higher than in control mice. These results indicate that the caspase- 3 /p 120 RasGAP stress-sensing module impacts on carcinogen-induced liver cancer incidence but not sufficiently so as to affect <b>overall</b> survival. Hence, <b>gamma</b> irradiation and ENU-induced tumorigenesis processes do not critically rely on a survival mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of organ homeostasis in stressed healthy tissues...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the resource intake necessary for the separation of a mixture of diastereoisomers (2 R, 3 R) - 3 -(3 -methoxyphenyl) -N, N- 2 -trimethylpentanamine 6 and (2 R, 3 S) - 3 -(3 -methoxyphenyl) -N, N- 2 -trimethylpentanamine 7 in the production of an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The resource intake analysis is based on exergy calculations of both material (chemicals) and energy (utilities) requirements. For two separation processes, crystallisation and preparative chromatography, analysis is not only carried out at the process level (alpha level), but also at the plant level (beta level) taking into account the 6 preceeding synthesis steps towards the diastereoisomers and the supporting processes, e. g. for delivering heating media from natural gas or treating waste gases. Finally, exergetic life cycle analysis allowed the inclusion of the <b>overall</b> industrial metabolism (<b>gamma</b> level) that is required to deliver all energy and materials to the plant to carry out the separation. The results show that, in this example, the large scale chromatography process is not the most resource efficient option because of its high utilities requirement, despite its lower chemical requirement (180 MJ versus 122 MJ total requirement per mol of the RR stereoisomer (2 R, 3 R) - 3 (3 -methoxyphenyl) -N, N- 2 -trimethylpentanamine monohydrochloride 8) (alpha level). Due to its higher efficiency, the plant only requires 4. 6 % more resources when it selects chromatography instead of crystallisation (434 versus 415 MJ total requirement per mol of the RR stereoisomer 8) (beta level). Since the efficiencies of the overall industry depend on the type of materials and energy that it has to deliver to the plant, overall resource withdrawal from the environment differs by 4. 2 % for crystallisation and chromatography (883. 7 and 920. 6 MJ mol(- 1) stereoisomer 8). The study has also shown that resource efficiency gain can be achieved by recycling solvents on the plant. Moreover, it is clear that there is more potential for resource efficiency improvement for the crystallisation than for chromatography because of the different nature of the resources consumed: chemicals, including solvents, versus utilities...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, all {{previously}} {{proposed modifications}} of natural gamma ray log and its spectral components data were reviewed {{and a new}} calibration equation for reliable assessment of the clay content in the Shurijeh reservoir Formation was presented. The quantitative XRD results showed a low average percentage of clay minerals for the gas producing well and moderate amounts for the non-producing well. The differences between the varying amounts of clay minerals in wells were attributed to {{the changes in the}} diagentic histories. In both wells, all the previously proposed modifications overestimated the weight percent clay indicating it is critical to calibrate petrophysically-derived weight percent clay to the laboratory data to find better estimations. The results also showed by using natural Steiber modified gamma ray values, more reliable clay contents could be obtained rather than all other previous modifications in this area. On the basis of minimum average percent relative error, the natural gamma ray and thorium curves were powerful tools to recognize the clay zones in a sandstone reservoir rather than potassium curve. In summary, the comparison of core clay contents from quantitative XRD data, estimated values using the previously proposed modifications and the empirical calibration, demonstrates that a simple nonlinear regression using the XRD data and natural gamma ray index (IGR) allows for the quantification of clay content with the least percent relative errors, i.e., lower than 12 %, which is comparable to the values of the methodological errors associated with the XRD analysis. This empirical relationship was the most efficient estimator for up to 20 % weight percent clay content; the most common situation in the sandstone reservoirs. The excellent agreement between the locally calibrated natural gamma ray index and the clay quantitative XRD data showed it was well suited to provide reliable quantitative clay content estimates. The application of the proposed approach in this paper, will significantly improve the weight percent clay estimations from the gamma ray log in the Gonbadli field. The depositional environment can be correctly recognized from the spectral gamma ray logging ratio, however the safest method of reservoir clay typing is still based on the laboratory analysis of core samples. <b>Overall,</b> the natural <b>gamma</b> ray log and its spectral components data proved to be dependable qualitative and quantitative tools to diagnose clay minerals in sub-surface formation studies. In this paper, the broad scope of problem-solving capability of them was illustrated in the reservoir formation evaluation.|$|R
40|$|Common {{everyday}} activities—riding a bike to work, {{taking notes}} on a lecture, or choosing food at the market—involve various neural processes, including perception, movement, and memory. These varied neural processes are supported by distinct brain regions. How do different brain regions coordinate their activities? Theoretical work suggests that brain oscillations have {{a critical role in}} this process, but the precise relations between human behavior and brain oscillations are unknown. ^ I performed five studies examining the human brain activity involved in working and spatial memory. First, I analyzed scalp-recorded brain oscillations during a working-memory task. Here, I found that theta (4 - 8 Hz) oscillations in distinct regions related to different aspects of working memory. This indicates that oscillations in the same frequency band simultaneously serve varied roles across the brain. Next, I examined the temporal relation between brain oscillations and single-neuron spiking activity, using intracranial recordings from neurosurgical patients performing a navigation task. This analysis revealed that single-neuron spiking was synchronized to oscillations in the theta and gamma (30 - 100 Hz) bands. Each of these frequency bands facilitated a different type of spike timing and thus appeared to have unique functional roles. I also analyzed how the amplitude of oscillations varies during navigation, and I found oscillatory patterns related to virtual movement and searching for unknown objects. In the gamma band, these navigation-related oscillations were lateralized to the right hemisphere. This suggests that the right hemisphere has a unique role in navigation and demonstrates that gamma oscillations identify the active brain regions in particular task. Finally, in addition to investigating neural correlates of broad cognitive processes, I examined whether neuronal oscillations reveal the neural representations of individual stimuli. Analyzing intracranial recordings during a working-memory task, I found that the amplitude of gamma oscillations encoded the identity of the currently viewed letter. These letter-specific gamma patterns coincided both with <b>overall</b> increases in <b>gamma</b> amplitude and with simultaneous changes in theta phase. ^ Overall, my work shows that brain oscillations are a unique signal that reveals how human behaviors are linked to both large-scale brain dynamics and to the activities of individual neurons. These oscillatory patterns reveal similarities and differences between human and animal neural activity, and this may be useful for identifying the unique characteristics of the human brain. ...|$|R
