The OE has been monitoring the geomagnetic activity {{for more than twenty years}} and also the ionospheric activity of the last ten years in the Spanish Antarctic Station Juan Carlos I (ASJI) (62. 7 ° S, 299. 6 ° E). La Salle is finishing the design and testing of a low-power communication system between the ASJI and Cambrils (41. 0 ° N, 1. 0 ° E) with a double goal: (i) the transmission of data from the sensors located at the ASJI and (ii) the performance of an oblique ionospheric sounding of a 12, 760 km HF link. Previously, La Salle has already performed sounding and modulation tests to describe the channel performance in terms of availability, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Doppler spread and delay spread. This paper closes the design of the physical layer, by means of the channel error study and the synchronization performance, and concludes with a new physical layer proposal for the Oblique Ionosphere Sounder. Narrowband and wideband frames have been defined to be used when the <b>oblique</b> <b>sounder</b> performs as an ionospheric sensor.

40|$|Multi-diagnostic observations, {{covering}} a significant area of northwest Europe, were {{made during the}} magnetic storm interval (28 – 29 April 2001) {{that occurred during the}} High Rate SolarMax IGS/GPS-campaign. HF radio observations were made with vertical sounders (St. &nbsp;Petersburg and Sodankyla), oblique incidence sounders (OIS), on paths from Murmansk to St. &nbsp;Petersburg, 1050 km, and Inskip to Leicester, 170 km, Doppler sounders, on paths from Cyprus to St. Petersburg, 2800 km, and Murmansk to St. Petersburg, and a coherent scatter radar (CUTLASS, Hankasalmi, Finland). These, together with total electron content (TEC) measurements made at GPS stations from the Euref network in northwest Europe, are presented in this paper. A broad comparison of radio propagation data with ionospheric data at high and mid latitudes, under quiet and disturbed conditions, was undertaken. This analysis, together with a geophysical interpretation, allow us to better understand the nature of the ionospheric processes which occur during geomagnetic storms. The peculiarity of the storm was that it comprised of three individual substorms, the first of which appears to have been triggered by a compression of the magnetosphere. Besides the storm effects, we have also studied substorm effects in the observations separately, providing an improved understanding of the storm/substorm relationship. The main results of the investigations are the following. A narrow trough is formed some 10 h after the storm onset in the TEC which is most likely a result of enhanced ionospheric convection. An enhancement in TEC some 2 – 3 h after the storm onset is most likely a result of heating and upwelling of the auroral ionosphere caused by enhanced currents. The so-called main effect on ionospheric propagation was observed at mid-latitudes during the first two substorms, but only during the first substorm at high latitudes. Ionospheric irregularities observed by CUTLASS were clearly related to the gradient in TEC associated with the trough. The <b>oblique</b> <b>sounder</b> and Doppler observations also demonstrate differences between the mid-latitude and high-latitude paths during this particular storm. Keywords.

40|$|We study three-wave {{resonant}} {{interactions among}} kinetic-scale <b>oblique</b> <b>sound</b> {{waves in the}} low-frequency range below the ion cyclotron frequency. The nonlinear eigenmode equation is derived {{in the framework of}} a two-fluid plasma model. Because of dispersive modifications at small wavelengths perpendicular to the background magnetic field, these waves become a decay-type mode. We found two decay channels, one into co-propagating product waves (forward decay), and another into counter-propagating product waves (reverse decay). All wavenumbers in the forward decay are similar and hence this decay is local in wavenumber space. On the contrary, the reverse decay generates waves with wavenumbers that are much larger than in the original pump waves and is therefore intrinsically nonlocal. In general, the reverse decay is significantly faster than the forward one, suggesting a nonlocal spectral transport induced by <b>oblique</b> <b>sound</b> waves. Even with low-amplitude sound waves the nonlinear interaction rate is larger than the collisionless dissipation rate.

40|$|Observations {{made during}} 1958 and 1959 using a sweep frequency, HF, <b>oblique</b> <b>sounder</b> located at College, Alaska, are discussed, and {{selected}} groups of echoes are illustrated. Groundscatter is the predominant echo type observed on mid-latitude backscatter records, {{but this is}} not true [...] in the high latitudes. The majority of the scatter echoes from soundings [...] toward geomagnetic north were direct F region scatter of two main types - [...] IF and constant range echoes. These same echo types were observed from [...] the E region during magnetic disturbances (the slant Es echo corresponds [...] to the IF echo). These echoes were centered about geomagnetic north on [...] swept azimuth soundings and were produced by scatter near the oblique [...] reflection point in the ionosphere. Thus, we conclude that the echoes [...] were caused by scatter from irregularities aligned along the geomagnetic [...] field. [...] The IF echo branches off the first order vertical incidence F region [...] trace and increases linearly in range with frequency. It is produced by [...] scattered energy which is least-time focused. The scatterers are essentially [...] randomly distributed within large regions called clouds in the F [...] region. The height of the irregularities producing the IF echo can be [...] computed if the vertical incidence traces are clear; heights between 200 [...] and 350 km have been found by this technique, indicating that electron [...] density irregularities are not confined only to the lower ionosphere. [...] From the regularity of occurrence of the IF echo, it is highly probable [...] that the irregularities extend throughout much of the F region. [...] The constant range echo is produced by energy scattered from the [...] field-aligned surface of a cloud of irregularities. The soundings were [...] made to the north so the clouds producing the observed constant range [...] echo extended east and west. [...] The IF and the constant range echoes are useful research tools [...] because they indicate the amount of cloudiness present in the F region. [...] During the summer day, the F region is relatively free of clouds, while [...] during the winter night, it is quite overcast. The cloud size and distribution [...] depend primarily upon the zenith angle of the sun, the smaller [...] the zenith angle, the smaller and fewer the clouds. [...] Geomagnetic effects do not appear to influence the behavior or the [...] F region clouds, although this point is somewhat uncertain. The E region [...] clouds which produced the slant Es echo were definitely correlated with [...] geomagnetic activity but not to solar radiation, there appeared to be [...] no connection between the causes of the E and the F region direct scatter echoes even though they were propagated by the same general mechanisms.

The area-averaged sound absorption coefficient is calculated after spatial integration of these quantities over the surface area of interest. Alternatively, one may use a three-dimensional intensity probe. In that case, the determination of the amplitudes of the plane waves can be formulated as a least-squares problem. Measurements performed for a sound absorbing foam demonstrate that accurate results can be obtained, even under non-ideal acoustic conditions. Measurements carried out for a periodic absorber show that the method is accurate below the cut-on frequency of scattering as long as the amplitude of the evanescent surface waves is significantly smaller than that of the specularly reflected wave...|$|R

Both mentioned effects depend strongly on rate of acoustic energy loss in the medium. For attenuation exceeding some critical value (when active impedance constituent of a medium is equal to the liquid impedance) the reflection is anomalous, displacement practically vanishes and instead of a displacement an abrupt decrease of a reflected beam intensity takes place. Comparison of peculiarities of an ultrasonic beam reflection from media with different attenuation is demonstrated by Toepler shadow method. Experimental data are in accordance with the theory.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the open access journal Noise Theory and Practice available at [URL] efficiency of acoustic absorbers used for noise control can be improved by providing a smooth transition from the impedance of air to the impedance of the absorbing material in question. In the present work, such a smooth transition is materialised via application of gradient index metamaterial layers formed by quasi-periodic arrays of solid cylinders (tubes) with their external diameters gradually increasing from the external row of tubes facing the open air towards the internal row facing an absorbing porous layer. If acoustic wavelengths are much larger than the periodicity of the array, such a structure provides a gradual increase in the acoustic impedance towards the internal row of cylinders. This allows the developer to achieve an almost perfect impedance matching between the air and porous absorbing materials, such as sponges, fibreglass, etc. In the present work, a wide range of measurements of sound reflection coefficients from different absorbing materials combined with matching metamaterial layers formed by the arrays of brass tubes have been carried out at the frequency range of 500 - 3000 Hz.

40|$|The {{propagation}} {{environment at}} high frequencies (HF, 2 - 30 MHz) {{has a significant}} impact on the performance of radio systems (especially data communications). However, the ability to communicate information over very long ranges using ionospheric propagation paths without any intermediate infrastructure makes the use of HF attractive for many applications. In order to increase the utility of HF communications there is a strong desire to increase HF data rates. Currently data rates of up to - 2400 bps can be reliably achieved in standard 3 kHz HF channel allocations. Whilst further increases in data rate within the confines of these narrowband frequency allocations is likely, the use of larger bandwidths (contiguous or otherwise) appears to offer potential for much greater throughputs. This requires a greater understanding of the characteristics of wideband channels and also requires transmitting and receiving equipment capable of wideband/multi-channel operation. New waveforms have been proposed for the transmission of higher data rates in extended channel bandwidths (6 kHz). The results of laboratory measurements and analysis of data collected during on-air trials of a number of 16 kbps waveforms are presented. Analysis indicates that operation over surface wave and benign skywave channels is possible, demonstrating the benefit of exploiting greater channel bandwidths. Suitable architectures for the implementation of wideband and multi-channel digital HF radios (software radios) have been investigated. The work presented indicates that it is now possible, for the first time, to construct high performance, direct sampling wideband digital HF receivers. In such a receiver the entire HF band is digitised and then all subsequent processing is undertaken digitally. Conceptually this would allow an arbitrary number of channels to be simultaneously received using a single RF frontend and digitiser. With careful design performance comparable with that of the high performance conventional super-heterodyne single channel receivers can be obtained. A prototype wideband multi-channel digital HF transceiver with this architecture has been implemented and its performance shown to agree with that predicted. A particular challenge in complex systems such as software radios is the deployment of software across a number of heterogeneous processors. A new asynchronous, eventbased, processing architecture which employs messaging to allow processing tasks to be effectively distributed across a multiple processors and buses is proposed. It has been implemented on the digital transceiver platform and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. A new low-power pulse-compression <b>oblique</b> HF ionospheric <b>sounder,</b> known as WHISPER, has been developed. This sounder has been implemented as a software application on the wideband HF digital transceiver. Waveforms suitable for making wideband (- 80 kHz) measurements of the channel time varying complex impulse response have been designed. These have been used to make measurements on a 170 km path in the UK during Spring 2001. The results of these measurements have been analysed and confirm the ability of the sounding instrument to measure the channel scattering function and the amplitude and phase within individual modes. A number of possible directions for further analysis, pertinent to the design of wideband HF modems, have been proposed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

[...] The results obtained during an experimental investigation of the drift [...] motions of auroral ionization are summarized, and certain properties of [...] the luminous aurora established by photo-electric measurements reviewed. [...] Some preliminary observations of solar radio emission at 65 mc/s are [...] reported. [...] A technique of estimating the electron densities of the outer ionosphere [...] by the use of nose whistlers is described. The method involves the numerical [...] integration of the whistler dispersion equation after first assuming a model for the distribution in density. This technique is applied to several [...] whistlers which occurred on 19 March 1959 resulting in estimates of electron [...] densities between four and five earth's radii. [...] The temporal variations in the occurrence of chorus during the IGY [...] at College and Kotzebue, Alaska are studied. [...] The results of an investigation of the effect of latitude on the [...] diurnal maximum of chorus indicate that it is desirable to use a latitude [...] based on the location of the eccentric dipole rather than the usual geomagnetic [...] latitude for the study of chorus. [...] The mathematical theory of longitudinally propagated whistlers in a [...] magnetic dipole field is developed. The usual method for deriving electron [...] density distributions in the exosphere from nose whistler observations by [...] means of assumed distribution functions is criticized and shown to be [...] ambiguous and subjective. A systematic method which avoids subjective [...] assumptions is described. The whistler propagation problem is reduced to [...] an integral equation and a first order principal value solution is obtained [...] by using an approximate form of the equation. Higher order solutions may [...] then be derived by an indicated iterative procedure. [...] Five short-term transpolar transmission tests conducted jointly by the [...] Geophysical Institute and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment [...] during 1956 - 59 are described briefly. Some preliminary results of a [...] transarctic propagation study on 12, 18 and 30 mc/s made by the Geophysical [...] Institute in cooperation with the Kiruna Geophysical Observatory, Sweden, [...] are reported. Simultaneous backscatter soundings of the polar region from [...] College, Alaska and recordings c£ the forward propagated signal at Kiruna, [...] Sweden are used to deduce the propagation conditions and modes. The 12 mc/s [...] and 18 mc/s pulse transmissions from College were received at Kiruna over 80...|$|R
