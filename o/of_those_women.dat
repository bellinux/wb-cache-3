25|$|According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at Queens College, between 2000 and 2005, {{young women}} in their twenties earned more than their male {{counterparts}} in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major {{reason for this is that}} women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.|$|E

That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. There was a whole facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those resilient women over and over. Though no one woman that I met in Kabul inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible stories of survival were always with me, and a good part of my inspiration for this novel came from their collective spirit." ...|$|E

[...] "The ladies of Grey's Anatomy dominate the category, and it'd be far from a stretch to say at least two <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> rose to high dramatics last season", commented Levine, while praising Sandra Oh for her portrayal of Cristina Yang who endured a tumultuous seasoning relationship, seeing her trepidation at spending a life together with the man she loved. He regarded the appearances of Chandra Wilson as more subdued, though [...] "by no means less well-executed". He deemed Miranda Bailey a rock, being the most level-headed character on the show with a right thing to say in any situation. He expressed admiration towards Chandra Wilson, by describing her as being [...] "flashy and over the top", which he considers better than being consistently good. Considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Levine assessed of her performance, by remarking the slight difficulty she has in reaching each emotional state Izzie Stevens has to go through: [...] "Showrunner Shonda Rhimes {{puts a lot of}} pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge." [...] However, he also noted that Izzie's irrational actions during crisis situations may be bothering.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sexuality}} {{of women}} is a topic that is generally associated with feminist theory; however {{there is not much}} focus on the life and experience <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who do not fit the traditional heterosexual standards. Although feminist theory considers intersectionality of many topics, lesbian experience is often set to the side. In many aspects of feminist theory, there is a slight reference of compulsory heterosexuality. Compulsory heterosexuality is the assumption that it is traditionally [...] "normal" [...] or favorable to be heterosexual. However, in the aspects of women's sexuality, it is completely possible to be free and feminist, and not heterosexual. This, in many ways relates to the patriarchal perspective of women and their sexuality. By denying one gender the freedom to their sexuality, the concept of compulsory heterosexuality is enforced; thus marginalizing women's sexuality and the lesbian experience overall.|$|E

2500|$|In {{comparison}} to the United States, Chile did not have so many feminists among its evolution of women’s intrusion to the political sphere. Chilean women esteemed Catholicism as their rites of passage, which initiated women’s movements {{in opposition to the}} liberal political party’s eruption in the Chilean government. The traditional domesticated setting that women were accustomed to was used as a patriarchal reasoning for women’s restriction of women’s votes. However, Chileans religious convictions as devout Catholics initiated their desire to vote against the adamant anticlerical liberal party. In 1875, Domitila Silva Y Lepe, the widow of a former provincial governor, read the requirements deeming [...] "all adult Chileans the right to vote", and was the first woman to vote. Other elitist Chilean women followed her bold lead, which resulted in the anticlerical liberal party of congress to pass a law denying women the right to vote. Despite this set back, Ms. Lepe and other elite women expressed their religious standings to the conservative party. The conservative party were favorable of the women because they knew their support would influence the conservative party’s domination in politics. In 1912 Social Catholicism began to erupt. Social Catholicism- upper class women’s organization of working class women-was led by Amalia Errazuriz de Subercaseaux. She introduced the Liga de Damas Chilenas (League of Chilean Ladies) amongst 450 other upper-middle class women with intentions to “uphold and defend the interests <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>women</b> who worked for a living without attacking the principles of order and authority”. Following this organization, many other elite women began socially constructed women’s institutions. Amanda Labarca was also an elitist, but disagreed with the privileged women’s subjection of working class women and founded the ladies reading club. She believed women should be educated, regardless of their socioeconomic status to have a more influentially productive role in society.|$|E
