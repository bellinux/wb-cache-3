5|$|Little says Rosenberg was {{influenced}} by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community focus in his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> is an {{important}} resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that {{there has always been}} an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the anonymity of online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> built around a common asexual identity.|$|E

5|$|A major {{driver of}} human impact on Earth systems is the {{destruction}} of biophysical resources, and especially, the Earth's ecosystems. The environmental impact <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> or of humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and {{the scale of the}} human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the War of 1812, as the British post in Florida was {{evacuated}} the Corps' Florida detachment {{was paid}} off and disbanded. Although several men accompanied the British to Bermuda, the majority continued to live in settlements around the wooden stockade the Corps had garrisoned (which had become a symbol of slave insurrection). This legacy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> of armed fugitive slaves with a substantial arsenal would lead to tensions with the United States of America. Those remaining later took part in the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816, after which they joined the southward migration of Seminoles and African Americans escaping the American advance. Members of the Colonial Marine battalion who were deployed on the Atlantic coast withdrew from American territory. They would continue in British service as garrison-in-residence at Bermuda until 1816, when the unit was disbanded and the ex-Marines resettled on Trinidad.|$|E

5|$|State {{law allows}} for the {{incorporation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> as either a city or a town; the only additional requirement to incorporate as a city is a minimum population of 3,000.

State law allows adjoining towns to merge and it allows a city to annex a town, {{but it does not}} allow cities to merge. Additionally, a town may change its form of government to a city upon reaching the minimum population of 3,000. There are, however, large communities that have remained incorporated as a town in spite of attaining a large population; Gilbert, with more than 200,000 residents, remains incorporated as a town.|$|E

5|$|Tonkin Highway reaches {{past the}} edge of {{suburbia}} at its southern extent. Planning provides {{for it to be}} extended when required. The initial plans indicated the extension would continue south through undeveloped or semi-rural areas such as Mundijong, Cardup & Jarrahdale. South of Mundijong, the planned route would deviate east to terminate at South Western Highway near Jarrahdale Road, which would then be upgraded. Following the 2001state election, the new government abandoned the Jarrahdale Road option, preferring a shorter route that deviated to South Western Highway near Orton Street, closer to Byford. In July 2012, seven years after the previous extension was completed, the Minister for Transport announced the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> working group to investigate an extension of Tonkin Highway beyond Thomas Road. The group met several times to identify and evaluate possible solutions to traffic congestion in the area, and prepare a strategic business case for the next extension. , the preferred options are to extend the highway to South Western Highway, at a location either south of Lakes Road or south of Mundijong Road.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{symbolism}} included in memorials was political in tone, and politics {{played an important}} part in their construction. Many memorials were embroiled in local ethnic and religious tensions, with memorials either reflecting the contribution of particular groups to the conflict or being rejected entirely by others. In several countries it proved difficult to produce memorials that appealed to and included the religious and political views of all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> The Fascist governments that came to power in Italy and Germany during the inter-war period made the construction of memorials a key part of their political programme, resulting in a number of larger memorial projects with strong national overtones being constructed in the 1930s. While few memorials embraced a pacifist perspective, some anti-war campaigners used the memorials for rallies and meetings. Many of the political tensions of the inter-war period had diminished {{by the end of the}} 20th century, allowing some countries to commemorate the events of the war through memorials for the first time since the end of the war. In the centennial of World War I, the memory of the war has become a major theme for scholars and museums.|$|E
5|$|The Early Middle Ages {{witnessed}} {{the rise of}} monasticism in the West. The shape of European monasticism was determined by traditions and ideas that originated with the Desert Fathers of Egypt and Syria. Most European monasteries were of the type that focuses on community experience of the spiritual life, called cenobitism, which was pioneered by Pachomius (d. 348) in the 4th century. Monastic ideals spread from Egypt to Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries through hagiographical literature such as the Life of Anthony. Benedict of Nursia (d. 547) wrote the Benedictine Rule for Western monasticism during the 6th century, detailing the administrative and spiritual responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> of monks led by an abbot. Monks and monasteries had a deep effect on the religious and political life of the Early Middle Ages, in various cases acting as land trusts for powerful families, centres of propaganda and royal support in newly conquered regions, and bases for missions and proselytisation. They were the main and sometimes only outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many of the surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics were copied in monasteries in the Early Middle Ages. Monks were also the authors of new works, including history, theology, and other subjects, written by authors such as Bede (d. 735), a native of northern England who wrote in the late 7th and early 8th centuries.|$|E
