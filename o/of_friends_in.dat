5|$|At {{the urging}} <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 {{to operate a}} {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods. Despite making considerable progress with the business, the free-labor venture proved unprofitable and he abandoned the enterprise in 1857. From 1847 through 1857, Coffin continued to assist hundreds of runaway slaves by lodging them in his Ohio home. When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, Coffin traveled around the Midwest and overseas to France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E

5|$|Although Zahir was bereft <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> <b>in</b> Istanbul and Damascus, he was {{forging a}} new {{alliance}} with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the Hejaz, Ali Bey al-Kabir. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to Syria for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of Gaza and Jaffa under commander Ismail Bey. Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the Jordan Valley with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. They made {{it as far as}} Muzayrib, but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan in order to avoid harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa.|$|E
