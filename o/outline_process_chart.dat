50|$|The first {{structured}} {{method for}} documenting process flow, the flow <b>process</b> <b>chart,</b> {{was introduced by}} Frank Gilbreth to members of ASME in 1921 as the presentation “Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way”. Gilbreth's tools were quickly integrated into industrial engineering curricula. In the early 1930s, an industrial engineer, Allan H. Mogensen began training business people by using these tools of industrial engineering at his Work Simplification Conferences in Lake Placid, New York. A 1944 graduate of Mogensen's class, Art Spinanger, took the tools back to Procter and Gamble where he developed their work simplification program called the Deliberate Methods Change Program. Another 1944 graduate, Ben S. Graham, Director of Formcraft Engineering at Standard Register Industrial, adapted the flow <b>process</b> <b>chart</b> to information processing with his development of the multi-flow <b>process</b> <b>chart</b> to display multiple documents and their relationships. In 1947, ASME adopted a symbol set derived from Gilbreth's original work as the ASME Standard for <b>Process</b> <b>Charts.</b>|$|R
