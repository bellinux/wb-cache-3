5|$|The Ravens {{first met}} the New England Patriots in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens {{suffered}} a bitter 27–24 {{loss in the}} Patriots' quest for perfection. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Ravens lost to the Patriots 27–21 {{in a game that}} involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each <b>other</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> media after the game. The Ravens defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33–14. This {{was the first time the}} Ravens had ever defeated the Patriots.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} {{coherence}} was only {{introduced into the}} metric system {{in the third quarter}} of the 19th century; in its original form the metric system was non-coherent—in particular the litre was 0.001m3 and the are (from which the hectare derives) was 100m2. However the units of mass and length were related to each <b>other</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> physical properties of water, the gram having been designed as being the mass of one cubic centimetre of water at its freezing point.|$|E

Within four days Arnhem was totally under Allied control, allowing the Canadians to advance further into the Netherlands. Less than {{two weeks after the}} battle a general truce brought major combat operations in the country to an end and on 5 May the German commander in chief in the Netherlands surrendered to the Canadian Army. Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to a close.|$|E

5|$|In 1216, after {{requesting}} Muhammad II of Khwarazm not to aid Kuchlug, Genghis Khan dispatched general Jebe {{with two}} tumens (20,000 soldiers) {{to deal with}} the Qara Khitai threat, while sending Subutai with another two tumens on a simultaneous campaign against the Merkits. The two armies traveled alongside each <b>other</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Altai and Tarbagatai Mountains until arriving at Almaliq. At that point, Subutai turned southwest, destroying the Merkits and protecting Jebe's flank against any sudden attacks from Khwarazm. Jebe relieved Almaliq, then moved south of Lake Balkash into the lands of the Qara Khitai, where he besieged the capital of Balasagun. There, Jebe defeated an army of 30,000 troops and Kuchlug fled to Kashgar. Taking advantage of the unrest fomenting under Kuchlug's rule, Jebe gained support from the Muslim populace by announcing that Kuchlug's policy of religious persecution had ended. When Jebe's army arrived at Kashgar in 1217, the populace revolted and turned on Kuchlug, forcing him to flee for his life. Jebe pursued Kuchlug across the Pamir Mountains into Badakhshan in modern Afghanistan. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni, a group of hunters caught Kuchlug and handed him over to the Mongols, who promptly beheaded him.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{retain the}} lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, {{but this is}} lost in {{terrestrial}} adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess electroreceptors {{that allow them to}} locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular eardrum lies {{on the surface of the}} head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the stapes, to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called papilla amphibiorum, in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each <b>other</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> medium of sound.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{retreating}} South Korean troops {{to cover their}} movements, the Chinese had infiltrated the brigade position {{in the initial stages}} of the battle, penetrating between A and B Companies, 3 RAR astride the road, and largely surrounding the latter before moving into the rear positions. The Australians struggled to distinguish the Chinese from the South Koreans in the dark, although the Korean Service Corps porters attached to the battalion were able to provide valuable assistance to the defenders distinguishing the Chinese by the sounds of their voices. At 21:30 the Chinese launched their first attack on the forward platoon of American tanks, which had been posted on the road without infantry support. The initial moves were easily repelled; however, a stronger attack an hour later forced the tanks to withdraw after two of the tank commanders were killed, including the platoon commander. The Chinese then proceeded to assault the Australians on two different axes: one against the two forward companies in front of Hill 504, and the <b>other</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> valley astride the road around Battalion Headquarters. Finally, by 23:00 the New Zealand artillery had returned to the brigade, although they provided only limited support {{throughout the rest of the}} night.|$|E

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was in his humanity (that is, in history) crucified, and died, descending into Hades (Sheol), the place of the dead, as all humans do. But He, alone among humans, has two natures, one human, one divine, which are indivisible and inseparable from each <b>other</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mystery of the incarnation.

Similarly, the Kirkus reviewer calls the illustrations charming and writes that they [...] "have all the clever details that are Dyer's signature touch", noting specifically the lavender frames of Miss Violet's eyeglasses and the inclusion of the dogs' names on their collars. Fletcher suggests that, apart from the [...] "ominous grays and greens" [...] in the illustrations of the forest scenes with the bear, the pastel-colored illustrations in the book are evocative of 1940s picture postcards, which she considers [...] "just right for such jolly capers".|$|E
