5|$|A 2001 {{proposal}} envisaged three routes, lines 1, 2 and 3. The {{first was}} a circular route around the northern suburbs, {{and the others were}} radial routes to Newbridge in the west and Newcraighall in the south. All lines would have passed through the city centre. In May 2004, a 15-year operating contract was awarded to Transdev, to <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> the tram network. This contract was cancelled in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{innovation}} {{initiated by}} a city or a region {{is the creation}} of mixed public-private enterprises for urban water supply that has begun in 1995 in Cartagena, followed by Barranquilla and other Northern and Central cities and towns. Another innovation is an association of community-based organizations (CBOs) providing water supply in rural and peri-urban areas in the departments of El Valle, Cauca and Risaralda in Southwestern Colombia. It began in the late 1990s {{with the assistance of the}} Universidad del Valle in Cali in order to protect and recover source watersheds and to strengthen the CBOs' capacity to administrate, <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> their water systems.|$|E

Like SEALs, SWCCs must have excellent physical fitness, highly motivated, combat-focused and responsive in high stress situations.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2008, {{the project}} had been {{estimated}} {{at a total}} cost of $3.1 billion USD, however the revised project has an estimated cost of $1 billion USD (The difference in estimates partially {{due to differences in}} previous tunnel designs). Financial closing on the project was reached in October, 2009. Miami-Dade County allegedly contributed $402 million, the city of Miami $50 million, and the state $650 million to build, <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> it. Those contributions are spread during construction and operation of the tunnel project. During construction, 90% of the funds are provided by the private sector. Of the estimated one billion dollar total project cost, 607 million it said to go to design and construction, 195.1 million to financing, 59.6 million to insurance and maintenance during construction, 41.2 million to reserves, and 209.8 million for state development cost.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{project is}} a {{public-private}} partnership (PPP or P3), designed to transfer the responsibility to design, build, finance, <b>operate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> the project to the private sector. Ten banks, BNP Paribas, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, RBS Citizens, N.A., Banco Santander, Bayerische Hypo, Calyon, Dexia, ING Capital, Societe Generale, and WestLB, will provide the senior debt financing for the project, which totals $341.5 million. The project attracted three bidding consortia. Under the concession agreement, FDOT will make milestone payments to the concessionaire (Miami Access Tunnel) during the construction period, upon the achievement of contractual milestones. 90% of Miami Access Tunnel's equity is provided by Meridiam Infrastructure Miami LLC (Luxembourg based Meridiam SARL); the remaining 10% by France's Bouygues Travaux Publics SA, operating as Dragages Concession Florida Inc. The Port of Miami Tunnel Project {{was one of the}} first P3s in Florida, and the first availability-based P3 deal in the US, after the Interstate 595 (I-595) renovation project in Broward County.|$|E

5|$|The turnpike runs east–west across Pennsylvania, {{from the}} Ohio state line in Lawrence County to the New Jersey state line in Bucks County. It {{passes through the}} Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, and Philadelphia areas, along with {{farmland}} and woodland. The highway crosses the Appalachian Mountains, in {{the central part of}} the state, through four tunnels. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, created in 1937 to construct, finance, <b>operate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintain</b> the road, controls the highway. Five members comprise the commission, including the secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and four other members appointed by the governor of Pennsylvania. In 2014, the roadway had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 117,000vehicles between Norristown and I-476 to a low of 12,000 vehicles between the Ohio border and Pennsylvania Route18 (PA18). As part of the Interstate Highway System, the turnpike is part of the National Highway System. The Pennsylvania Turnpike is designated a Blue Star Memorial Highway honoring those who have served in the United States Armed Forces; the Garden Club Federation of Pennsylvania has placed Blue Star Memorial Highway markers at service plazas along the turnpike.|$|E
