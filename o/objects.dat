5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has revealed that}} the size distributions of the hot classical and cold classical <b>objects</b> have differing slopes. The slope for the hot <b>objects</b> is q = 5.3 at large diameters and q = 2.0 at small diameters with the change in slope at 110 km. The slope for the cold <b>objects</b> is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a change in slope at 140 km. The size distributions of the scattering <b>objects,</b> the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp {{decrease in the number}} of <b>objects</b> below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized to be due to either the collisional evolution of the population, or to be due to the population having formed with no <b>objects</b> below this size, with the smaller <b>objects</b> being fragments of the original <b>objects.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Whole Object Assumption is {{the belief}} that labels refer to whole <b>objects</b> instead of parts or {{properties}} of those <b>objects.</b> Children are believed to hold this assumption because they typically label whole <b>objects</b> first, and parts of properties of <b>objects</b> later in development.|$|E

5|$|The {{classical}} <b>objects</b> (cubewanos) {{are very}} different from the scattered objects: more than 30% of all cubewanos are on low-inclination, near-circular orbits whose eccentricities peak at 0.25. Classical <b>objects</b> possess eccentricities ranging from 0.2 to 0.8.

5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of <b>objects,</b> one uses a number to {{describe}} how many <b>objects</b> are in the set.

The concept of parity is used for making groups of two <b>objects.</b> If the <b>objects</b> in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of <b>objects</b> is even. If an object is left over, then the number of <b>objects</b> is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E
5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} <b>objects</b> together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two <b>objects</b> to a third, subject to certain requirements.

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc <b>objects</b> {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered <b>objects</b> {{among the most}} distant and coldest <b>objects</b> in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting <b>objects</b> traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt <b>objects</b> {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} <b>objects</b> for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary <b>objects.</b> The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense <b>objects</b> are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest <b>objects</b> are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small <b>objects</b> and high densities for the largest <b>objects.</b> One possible explanation for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated <b>objects</b> collided to form the largest <b>objects.</b>|$|E
5|$|Astronomically, {{the most}} {{important}} property of compact <b>objects</b> is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation.

50|$|In {{object-oriented}} {{and functional}} programming, an immutable <b>object</b> (unchangeable <b>object)</b> is an <b>object</b> whose state cannot be modified {{after it is}} created.

In some cases, an <b>object</b> is considered immutable even if some internally used attributes change but the <b>object's</b> state appears to be unchanging from an external point of view.

50|$|<b>Object</b> Spaces is a {{paradigm}} {{for development of}} distributed computing applications. It {{is characterized by the}} existence of logical entities, called <b>Object</b> Spaces.

5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the scattered disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such <b>objects</b> towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud <b>objects</b> are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc.
