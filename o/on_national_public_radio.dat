25|$|Later in 1997, he {{was invited}} to speak at a Leadership Network pastors' conference in California. The speech he made {{inspired}} many within the nascent emerging church movement and, according to Driscoll, shifted the movement's focus from reaching Generation X to reaching the postmodern world. As a result, Mars Hill Church and Driscoll were thrust into the national spotlight: he was interviewed <b>on</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> and Mother Jones magazine published a feature on the church. Mars Hill Church grew from 160 members in 1996 to 350 in 1999.|$|E
25|$|A 13-episode radio {{adaptation}} of the original 1977 film written by science fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden was first broadcast <b>on</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> in 1981. Lucas, {{a fan of the}} NPR-affiliated campus radio station at his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the Star Wars radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1. Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their roles from the film. The production used John Williams' original score from the films and Ben Burtt sound designs from the film.

The performance of the composition by the pianist Randy Kerber was described by one critic <b>on</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> as [...] "letting the inherent wistfulness of the music emerge", with the piece [...] "perfectly suited" [...] to the movie {{as it was a}} [...] "tender and heartfelt remembrance of a love lost".|$|E

500|$|Satin's {{mandatory}} {{national service}} proposal drew significant media coverage, {{in part because}} of his status as a draft refuser. [...] Satin argues that a draft could work in the United States if it applied to all young people, without exception, and if it gave everyone a choice in how they would serve. [...] He proposes three service options: military (with generous benefits), homeland security (at prevailing wages), and community care (at subsistence wages). [...] On Voice of America radio, Satin presented his proposal as one drawing equally from the best of the left and the right. [...] <b>On</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio,</b> he emphasized its fairness.|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to try to prove that an animal has {{the same rights as}} humans, Brian starts an {{advocacy}} group, and is suggested by Lois to join PETA, but she is unable to enunciate the word differently from how she pronounces [...] "Peter," [...] leading her husband to become confused. The end of the gag has Chris stating his belief that Betty White {{is a member of the}} organization, with his wording prompting Peter to yell, [...] "That doesn't even make sense!" [...] Brian goes on to create a public service announcement regarding animal rights, one of which involves a dog being [...] "tortured" [...] by having to listen to the radio show All Things Considered <b>on</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio,</b> which the dog's owner leaves on for him before leaving the house.|$|E

500|$|On {{the dawn}} of the final month of campaigning, Barr {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio,</b> and discussed his political positions, including those on health care, a topic that had rarely been discussed by Barr {{over the course of his}} campaign. Barr gave his shortest response to the issue, saying that [...] "everybody ought to be able to get health care, but that's up to them..." [...] and went on to say that [...] "the government could be...reducing and removing the onerous regulations that actually prevent people from being able to afford health care." [...] Close to the end of the campaign, Barr's polling numbers remained stagnant. An Associated Press-GfK poll from late October placed the candidate at 1% nationally, the same figure he had stood at three weeks previously.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Claudia Sadowski-Smith {{has called}} Cisneros [...] "perhaps {{the most famous}} Chicana writer", and Cisneros has been {{acknowledged}} as a pioneer in her literary field as the first female Mexican-American writer to have her work published by a mainstream publisher. In 1989, The House on Mango Street, which was originally published by the small Hispanic publishing company Arte Público Press, was reissued in a second edition by Vintage Press; and in 1991 Woman Hollering Creek was published by Random House. As Ganz observes, previously only male Chicano authors had successfully made the crossover from smaller publishers. That Cisneros had garnered enough attention to be taken on by Vintage Press said {{a lot about the}} possibility for Chicano literature to become more widely recognized. Cisneros spoke of her success and what it meant for Chicana literature in an interview <b>on</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> on 19 September 1991: ...|$|E
500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed <b>on</b> <b>National</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Radio</b> with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, I would probably be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
