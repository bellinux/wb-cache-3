An ISHM system, as a whole, consists of several subsystems that monitor different components of an OSP including: Spacecraft, Launch Vehicle, Ground Control, and the International Space Station. In this research, therefore, we propose a new methodology to design and optimize ISHM as a distributed system with multiple disciplines (that correspond to different subsystems of OSP safety). A paramount amount of interest has been given in the literature to the multidisciplinary design optimization of problems with such architecture (as will be reviewed in the full paper) ...|$|R

An alternative method of achieving the full reusability of launch vehicles, is the autonomous deep space flight of hydrogen powered ground started core stages flown directly to orbit. 1 Direct orbital insertions are enabled by engine clustering and sequential engine shutdowns. Hydrogen powered core stages with multiple clustered engines implicitly represent useful deep space infrastructure. Controlled assets placed in high earth orbits essentially exist as infrastructure forever. Deep space and geostationary orbits do not require any continuous reboost propulsion and fuel, and provide continuous illumination for their solar energy conversion systems, but they also require vast amounts of radiation shielding in order to be made habitable by humans. Large amounts of space based salvageable assets already exist in geosynchronou...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{hypersonic}} aircraft as <b>orbital</b> <b>space</b> transport <b>planes</b> {{and the design}} of retrievable reentry vehicles require {{as accurate as possible}} a simulation of the aerothermodynamic flow conditions along the flight path or reentry trajectory. Since observance of all crucial parameters governing the chemical and thermodynamic effects in the flow field and at the wall cannot be obtained experimentally in ground test facilities, free flight measurements under real operational conditions of hypersonic aircraft are indispensible. From this requirement the HYPERBA validation experiment is derived for validation of the numerical simulation methods of the aerothermodynamic reentry flow of a retrievable reusable aircraft (EXPRESS). In a German-Japanese cooperation under this reentry technology program, newly developed hypersonic sensors are used to conduct free flight measurements during ballistic reentry of the EXPRESS capsule into the atmosphere. The objective of this project is to permit a first evaluation of free flight data with regard to developing simplified numerical design tools for ablative and reusable heat shield materials, while taking into account the gas-wall interaction. With the development of this first free flight data base and its availability to German industry the foundation of a data base will be laid, which provides a reference to future reentry flight experiments and thus creates a basis for complete validation of numerical simulation methods of aerothermodynamic reentry flows.
