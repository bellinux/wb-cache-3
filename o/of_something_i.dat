500|$|Nicolas Cage {{was cast}} as Al Columbato. He reflected, [...] "I {{was terrified of}} the role of Al, because it was like nothing I'd ever done before, and I didn't know how to get to the places the role was asking me to go emotionally." [...] For scenes in which Al's face is {{disfigured}} and swathed in bandages, Cage lost 15 pounds and had two of his front teeth pulled out. [...] "I wanted to look like I was hit by a bomb," [...] he said. [...] "It gave me a feeling <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> had lost. I felt this was a once-in-a-lifetime part, and it deserved that much." ...|$|E
500|$|During the tour, filmmaker Baz Luhrmann {{commissioned}} Radiohead {{to write}} a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: [...] "When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt [...]45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately." [...] Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape {{the direction of the}} rest of the album; Yorke said it [...] "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spinâ€”something I was proud <b>of,</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over me because <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>I</b> hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as the pathetic hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E
