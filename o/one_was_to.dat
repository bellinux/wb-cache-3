5|$|After the Constitution of May 3, 1791, sejms {{were to be}} {{held every}} two years and last 70 days, with a {{provision}} for an extension to 100 days. Provisions for extraordinary sejms were made, {{as well as for}} a special constitutional sejm, which was to meet and discuss whether any revisions to the constitution were needed (that <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> deliberate every 25 years).|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its religious school. Wax initiated {{some changes in the}} congregation's religious practices. <b>One</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have a real ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, her {{government}} {{announced that it}} would open two detention centres for 2000 immigrants, due to the pressures in allowing women and children to be released into the community. <b>One</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be opened in Inverbrackie, South Australia, and one in Northam, Western Australia. She said it would be a short-term solution to the problem and that temporary detention centres would be closed.|$|E

5|$|Local magistrates had {{to appoint}} two {{inspectors}} known as visitors {{to ensure that}} factories and mills were complying with the Act; <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be a clergyman {{and the other a}} Justice of the Peace, neither to have any connection with the mill or factory. The visitors had the power to impose fines for non-compliance and the authority to visit at any time of the day to inspect the premises.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{figure out how to}} animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was {{to make sure that the}} hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. <b>One</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E

5|$|Plans for the Normandy {{invasion}} included five assault landings {{from the}} sea, supported by airborne landings on both flanks by British and American airborne divisions. In {{what would be}} its first action, the 6th Airborne Division was chosen {{to land on the}} left flank of the British landing zone. Its primary objective on day <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> capture intact two bridges over the Caen canal and the River Orne. The division's secondary objective was the destruction of the Merville gun battery, which could engage ships landing nearby at Sword. To prevent German reinforcements approaching the invasion area from the east, 6th Airborne also had to destroy the bridges crossing the River Dives then dig in around Ranville and hold the left flank of the advance.|$|E
5|$|The Android {{operating}} system was officially unveiled in November 2007 {{along with the}} founding of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA); a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. These companies included Google, along with HTC, a company who was at the time, one of the largest manufacturers of phones. While Google indicated in 2008 that several linux devices were being tested in preparation for the official public launch of Android, only <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be released in the United States that year—the HTC Dream. Plans called for the Dream to be released on T-Mobile USA {{by the end of the}} year (with some reports suggesting October 2008), targeting the holiday shopping season. Sprint had worked with the OHA, but had not yet unveiled any plans to release an Android phone of its own, while Verizon Wireless and AT did not have any plans for Android devices yet at all.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E

30|$|Generally in {{the dynamic}} {{modeling}} of infectious diseases, we will first consider a deterministic model, however, considering {{the real world}} is filled with random and unpredictable, using stochastic model to model the dynamic of infectious diseases is more practical. Different stochastic disturbance approaches have been introduced into epidemic models. On the whole, there are four common random stochastic approaches. The first <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> introduce the parameters’ disturbance to a deterministic system (see, e.g., [39 – 47]), the second <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> investigate the stochasticity by using the method of time Markov chains (see, e.g., [48 – 52]). The third <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> consider Lévy jump noise (see, e.g., [53 – 55]). The fourth <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> study stochastic disturbance around the positive equilibria of a deterministic system (see, e.g., [56, 57]).
