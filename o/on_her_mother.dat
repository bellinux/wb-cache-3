5|$|Amanda Ripley's {{introduction}} in Aliens was {{not included}} in the theatrical version of the film, since 20th Century Fox was concerned about the film's running time. Sigourney Weaver criticized the cut, seeing Amanda as crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development and her bond with the orphaned Newt. While developing Alien: Isolation, Creative Assembly originally desired a female protagonist and decided to use Amanda as the best way to focus <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Ellen's, traits. The picture model for Ripley in Aliens is Elizabeth Inglis, Sigourney Weaver's mother, and in Alien: Isolation she is voiced by Andrea Deck with motion capture by Kezia Burrows. Amanda's design in Alien: Isolation was based on pictures from Elizabeth Inglis' youth.|$|E

25|$|Boyhood began filming {{without a}} {{completed}} script. Linklater had prepared each character's basic plot points, and the ending—including the final shot—but otherwise wrote {{the script for}} the next year's filming after rewatching the previous year's footage, incorporating the changes he saw in each actor. All major actors participated in the writing process, contributing their life experiences; for example, Hawke's character is based on his and Linklater's fathers—both Texan insurance agents who divorced and remarried—and Arquette's character is based <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> who resumed her education later in life and became a psychotherapist.|$|E
25|$|Males {{within a}} group have a {{dominance}} hierarchy, with one male having alpha status. The dominance status of male macaques usually changes when a former alpha male leaves or dies. Other {{ways in which}} status changes is when an alpha male loses his rank or when a troop splits, leaving a new alpha position open. The longer a male is in a troop, the higher his status is likely to be. Females also exist in a stable dominance hierarchy, and a female's rank depends <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> Younger females tend to rank higher than their older siblings. Higher-ranking matrilines have greater social cohesion. Strong relationships with dominant females can allow dominant males to retain their rank when they otherwise would not.|$|E
500|$|Sophie didn't {{appear in}} season 2 {{for the first}} couple of episodes, the {{spotlight}} was mostly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Mozart, and two older subordinates, Daisy and Kinkaju, as they were the prime evictee's of the season. When Sophie was finally mentioned, she was found babysitting Flower's pups with her brother, Spud. The pair were having a very uneventful day, unlike {{the rest of the family}} who were caught in a fight for their lives with the Commando family.

They rushed below ground to defend the pups, unaware that the [...] "stranger" [...] was in fact their evicted mother, Mozart.

500|$|Millett focused <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> in Mother Millett, a {{book about}} how she was made aware by her sister Sally of the {{seriousness}} of Helen Millett's declining health and poor nursing home care. Kate removed her mother from the home and returned her to an apartment, where caregivers managed her health and comfort. In the book, [...] "Millett writes about the situation—her mother's distance and imperiousness, her family's failure to recognize the humanity of the old and the insane—with brutal honesty. Yet she also describes moments of forgiveness, humility and admiration." [...] During this time, she developed a close relationship, previously inconceivable, with her mother, which she considered [...] "a miracle and a grace, a gift." [...] Her relationships with her sisters were troubled during this time, but they all came to support their mother's apartment-living. The suggestion of her role as the heroine in Mother Millett, however, may have been [...] "at the expense of her two siblings".|$|E
500|$|Ernest's {{support of}} the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant {{he was no longer}} the {{potential}} leader of a political movement; although it was true that {{he had been able to}} retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. I assure you that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E

[...] It follows the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee's sister, the actress June Havoc.|$|E

2500|$|Tate {{was born}} Catherine Ford on 12 May 1968 in Bloomsbury, {{where she was}} raised in the Brunswick Centre. Her mother, Josephine, was a florist. Tate has said that the {{character}} of Margaret in The Catherine Tate Show, who shrieks at the slightest of disturbances, is based largely <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> Tate never knew her father as he left very early on in her life and, consequently, she was brought up in a female-dominated environment, being cared for by her mother, grandmother, and godparents. As a child, Tate suffered from OCD and was obsessed with word association. For example, she was not able to leave a jumper on the floor because it might have brought misfortune to her mother, whose name began with the letter [...] "J" [...] like [...] "jumper".|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} that Penthouse would be publishing these photos, the Miss America Organization responded by giving Williams 72 hours to resign. Williams later stated that [...] "the heightened spectacle and circus {{of it all}} was kind of crazy. I had people saying 'Fight for the crown! Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede!' [...] " [...] Williams also later noted that the situation was particularly hard <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> Helen, who felt that she should not resign as Williams had performed her [...] "duties and excelled at everything I was asked to do plus doing 50% more of appearances that were not scheduled because I was the first African American Miss America." [...] Helen was also upset that [...] "the pageant {{did not come to}} my support, they felt I needed to resign." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{her mother}} later began {{suffering}} {{as a result}} of the radiation therapy, Ruiz drove daily from her Phoenix workplace to the hospital in Lordsburg. [...] She developed the same symptoms as her mother, whose death made Ruiz feel that she was going to die also. [...] While she didn't die, she did realized how dependent she had been <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> [...] She became determined to succeed in her career and started attending assertiveness-training courses offered at the hospital. [...] The courses helped her to increase her self-esteem, set goals, separate herself from her mother, and feel like she was in control of her life. [...] According to Ruiz, this sense of control was illusory: [...] "I didn't realize that it was God who was in control, I actually thought I was the one in control, can you believe it?!" ...|$|E

Her travels also included many German cities, including Leipzig, where Franz Werfel's play Spiegelmensch (Mirror Man) premiered in 1921.

2500|$|A {{few months}} after the pageant, Williams {{discussed}} the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.” Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said {{that one of the most}} important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> who [...] "endured a lot" [...] during that period.|$|E
