5|$|Despite {{never having}} heard of female doctors, {{from an early}} age Mayo had been set on {{pursuing}} a career in medicine. However, Edward Rennie, then a professor at the University of Adelaide advised Helen's father that she was too young to commence study in Medicine, so in 1896, Mayo enrolled in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Adelaide. The death <b>of</b> <b>her</b> younger sister Olive at the end <b>of</b> <b>her</b> first year of study meant that Mayo was unable to sit her final exams for that year, and when she repeated her first year in 1897, she failed two <b>of</b> <b>her</b> five subjects (Latin and Greek). Having gained her father's permission, Mayo enrolled in medicine in 1898. She was a distinguished medicine student, coming top <b>of</b> <b>her</b> class and winning the Davis Thomas scholarship and the Everard Scholarship in her fourth and fifth years of study, respectively.|$|E

The Herring Gulls observed included a proportion with colour-rings on their legs.
