5|$|By the 1950s, Roosevelt's {{international}} role as {{spokesperson for}} women {{led her to}} stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), although she never supported it. In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA {{was no longer a}} threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position. She died just before the commission issued its report. It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> and needs, and not by an Equal Rights Amendment.|$|E

25|$|Currently, the {{availability}} of drugs proven to treat neuropathic pain is limited and varies widely from patient to patient. Many developed drugs have either been discovered by accident or by observation. Some past treatments include opiates like poppy extract, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like salicylic acid, and local anesthetics like cocaine. Other recent treatments consist of antidepressants and anticonvulsants, although no substantial research on the actual mechanism of these treatments has been performed. However, patients respond to these treatments differently, possibly because <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> or genetic backgrounds. Therefore, researchers {{have come to realize}} that no one drug or one class of drugs will reduce all pain. Research is now focusing on the underlying mechanisms involved in pain perception and how it can go wrong in order to develop an appropriate drug for patients afflicted with neuropathic pain.|$|E

500|$|Sociologists Virginia Rutter and Pepper Schwartz {{consider}} Alvy and Annie's {{relationship to}} be a stereotype <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in sexuality. The nature {{of love is}} a repeating subject for Allen and co-star Tony Roberts described this film as [...] "the story of everybody who falls in love, and then falls out of love and goes on." [...] Alvy searches for love's purpose through his effort to get over his depression about the demise {{of his relationship with}} Annie. Sometimes he sifts through his memories of the relationship, at another point he stops people on the sidewalk, with one woman saying that [...] "It's never something you do. That's how people are. Love fades," [...] a suggestion that it was no one's fault, they just grew apart and the end was inevitable. By the end of the film, Alvy accepts this and decides that love is ultimately [...] "irrational and crazy and absurd", but a necessity of life. Christopher Knight points out that Annie Hall is framed through Alvy's experiences. [...] "Generally, what we know about Annie and about the relationship comes filtered through Alvy, an intrusive narrator capable of halting the narrative and stepping out from it in order to entreat the audience's interpretative favor." [...] He suggests that because Allen's films blur the protagonist with [...] "past and future protagonists {{as well as with the}} director himself", it [...] "makes a difference as to whether we are most responsive to the director's or the character's framing of events". Knight believes Alvy's quest upon meeting Annie is carnal, whereas hers is on an emotional note. Despite the narrative's framing, [...] "the joke is on Alvy." ...|$|E

According to the outcomes <b>of</b> decomposition analyses, <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in smoking-tendency (or inclination to smoke) accounted for 98 % <b>of</b> the total <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking. When the <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking was decomposed into specified factors, the difference in smoking-tendency between married men and women {{was found to be}} the most crucial factor as it explained 11 % <b>of</b> the total <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking.

40|$|The {{effect of}} social factors on the male/female {{difference}} in mortality in Finland was studied by comparing age-adjusted mortality {{of males and}} females by social class and marital status. 44, 548 death certificates (years 1969 - 1971) and 1970 census data for 25 - 64 -years olds were analysed. The <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> was 2. 8 -fold: 5. 3 -fold for violent causes and 2. 3 -fold for natural causes. The greatest <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> from violent causes was found in accidental poisonings (18. 7 -fold) and drownings (12. 8 -fold), and from natural causes in mental disorders (mainly alcoholism: 5. 7 -fold) and in ischemic heart disease (4. 5 -fold). The <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> was most prominent in unskilled workers, divorced and widowed and less prominent in married and upper professionals. The great variation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> <b>of</b> mortality by social class and marital status seems to indicate that mortality difference between males and females is associated to external factors rather than biological differences between men and women.

Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences.

40|$|In 1950, Otto Pollak {{claimed in}} his book the {{criminality}} of women, that female offenders were preferentially treated in a criminal justice system dominated by men and thus characterised by male notions of chivalry.
