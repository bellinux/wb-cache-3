50|$|The {{human and}} {{environmental}} health impacts that may result {{from the use of}} MMT will be a function of exposure to either: (1) MMT in its original, unchanged, chemical form and/or (2) manganese combustion products emitted from vehicles operating on gasoline containing MMT as an <b>octane</b> <b>improver.</b>|$|E
50|$|Though {{initially}} marketed in 1958 as a {{smoke suppressant}} for gas turbines, MMT was further developed as an <b>octane</b> <b>improver</b> in 1974. When the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered the phase out of TEL in gasoline in 1973, new fuel additives were sought. TEL has been, and still is, used in certain countries as an additive {{to increase the}} octane rating of automotive gasoline.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} of low-pressure (40 kPa) rich laminar premixed flames of two potential new biofuels, 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF) and 2 -methylfuran (MF), {{has been investigated}} using gas chromatography after sampling by a sonic probe. This work follows {{a study of the}} same flames made using electron-ionization molecular-beam mass spectrometry (EI-MBMS). Temperature profiles have been measured using a thermocouple with and without the probe and compared with those obtained during EI-MBMS experiments, showing the important influence of the probe geometry. The mole fraction profiles above the burner of numerous products and intermediates (31 for MF, 40 for DMF) have been quantified, including all the isomers which were globalized during EI-MBMS experiments, as well as some heavier aromatic products such as ethylbenzene and styrene. The profiles of these aromatics confirmed their significantly enhanced formation in the case of DMF compared to MF, which was already shown in the previous study. The model of the oxidation of these two substituted furans have been up-dated to include new reactions for the formation of C- 8 aromatics, as well as reactions proposed in literature for large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) formation. Simulations show a significant enhancement effect on the formation of PAH, such as pyrene or phenanthrene: their maximum mole fractions are increased by a factor of more than 400 in the DMF flame compared to that of MF, while it is only a factor 3 in the case of benzene. Simulations show that PAH mole fractions are also slightly larger in the DMF flame than in a flame of a gasoline surrogate containing toluene as an <b>octane</b> <b>improver</b> under the same conditions. However the PAH mole fractions in the DMF flame are significantly lower than in a flame of pure toluene, showing that this biofuel could be an interesting <b>octane</b> <b>improver</b> in replacement of aromatics...|$|E
30|$|Ethanol and butanol are {{suitable}} for gasoline engines {{and can be used}} as <b>octane</b> <b>improvers</b> since their low relative reactivity at low temperatures suppresses uncontrolled auto-ignition (Rakopoulos et al. 2010 b). While auto-ignition should be avoided in gasoline engines, it is necessary for diesel engines and for modern engines. Thus, new fuels with high reactivity at low temperatures are required to achieve the overall aim of reducing the world’s dependency on conventional fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.|$|R
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} use of higher {{alcohols}} and several cellulose-derived oxygenates as blend components in gasoline. Material compatibility issues {{are expected to be}} less severe for neat higher alcohols than for fuel-grade ethanol. Very little data exist on how blending higher alcohols or other oxygenates with gasoline affects ASTM Standard D 4814 properties. Under the Clean Air Act, fuels used in the United States must be 'substantially similar' to fuels used in certification of cars for emission compliance. Waivers for the addition of higher alcohols at concentrations up to 3. 7 wt% oxygen have been granted. Limited emission testing on pre-Tier 1 vehicles and research engines suggests that higher alcohols will reduce emissions of CO and organics, while NOx emissions will stay the same or increase. Most oxygenates can be used as <b>octane</b> <b>improvers</b> for standard gasoline stocks. The properties of 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran, dimethylfuran, 2 -methylfuran, methyl pentanoate and ethyl pentanoate suggest that they may function well as low-concentration blends with gasoline in standard vehicles and in higher concentrations in flex fuel vehicles...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} mixed {{alcohols}} has grown since ether compounds were banned as gasoline <b>octane</b> <b>improvers</b> in North America. Molybdenum-based catalysts in sulfide form are an attractive catalyst {{system for the}} conversion of synthesis gas to alcohols, due to their excellent resistance to sulfur poisoning and high activity for the water-gas shift reaction. The higher alcohols activity over these catalysts is low, due {{to the formation of}} hydrocarbons and CO 2. Although a number of catalysts have been developed for this purpose, not any are used commercially at this time. The main objective of this Ph. D. research is to develop a catalyst system that is capable of selectively producing higher alcohols, particularly ethyl alcohols from synthesis gas. In the present series of studies, the investigation of an alkali-promoted trimetallic Co-Rh-Mo catalyst system has led to improvements in product stream composition. The effect of different loadings of active metal (Mo), alkali (K) promoter, and metal promoters (Co and Rh) on higher alcohol synthesis from synthesis gas were investigated using commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as the catalyst support. The role of support on higher alcohols synthesis was also studied using different supports, such as ã-Al 2 O 3, activated carbons with different textural characteristics, and MWCNTs. The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method and extensively characterized in both oxide and sulfide phases using different techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that the metal particles were uniformly distributed inside and outside of the carbon nanotubes, and that metal dispersions were higher on the alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst supported on MWCNTs. The existence of promoted and un-promoted MoS 2 sites was confirmed by diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies of adsorbed CO over sulfided catalysts. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) tests showed that the addition of metal promoters improved the reduction behaviour of the catalysts. XRD patterns showed that alkali-promoted catalysts were less crystalline compared to that of the catalyst not promoted with K. The formation of Co (Rh) -Mo-S species was evident in the XANES spectra of bimetallic and trimetallic alkali-promoted MoS 2 catalysts. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts were assessed in a fixed-bed micro-reactor using temperature, pressure, and gas hourly space velocity in the ranges of 275 to 350 °C, 800 to 1400 psig (5. 52 – 9. 65 Mpa), and 2. 4 to 4. 2 m 3 (STP) /(kg of cat.) /h, respectively. The Ni-promoted catalyst showed higher activity towards the formation of hydrocarbons over that of alcohols. The total alcohols space time yield (STY) and higher alcohols selectivities are significantly higher over the activated carbon-supported catalysts compared to those supported on alumina. With increased content of K, the formation of alcohols increased and hydrocarbons formation rate was suppressed. The total alcohols STY increased with increased Co content over the Co-promoted MoS 2 -K/MWCNTs catalysts, whereas, the maximum ethyl alcohol and higher alcohols selectivities were observed on the catalyst promoted with 4. 5 wt % Co. Over the Rh-promoted MoS 2 -K/MWCNTs catalysts, the maximum total alcohol yield, ethanol selectivity, and higher alcohols selectivity were observed on the catalyst with 1. 5 wt % Rh. The MWCNT-supported alkali-promoted trimetallic catalyst with 9 wt % K, 4. 5 wt % Co, 1. 5 wt % Rh, and 15 wt % Mo showed the maximum higher alcohols STY and selectivity compared to other catalysts investigated. The textural properties of the support, such as average pore diameter, pore volume and surface area, could significantly influence the extent of reduction, morphology, adsorption and has direct influence on the synthesis of mixed alcohols from synthesis gas. The optimum higher alcohols STY and selectivity were obtained over the Co-Rh-Mo-K/MWCNT catalyst at 330 °C, 1320 psi (9. 1 Mpa), 3. 8 m 3 (STP) /(kg of cat. /h) using a H 2 to CO molar ratio value of 1. 25. To predict the reaction rate for higher alcohols synthesis, the power law model was used for the reaction between CO and H 2 on the catalyst surface and the data of this study are well fitted by the model. The activation energies of ethanol and higher alcohols obtained over Co-Rh-Mo-K/MWCNTs were low compared to those values reported in the literature. The sulfided alkali-promoted trimetallic Co-Rh-Mo catalyst supported on MWCNTs was stable over a period of 720 h of continuous reaction...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{bioethanol}} {{leads the}} automotive fuel market {{as the main}} substitute for gasoline in spark-ignition engines. However, worldwide interest has been triggered in the potential of 2, 5 -dimethylfuran, known as DMF, since the discovery of improved production methods. Although the energy content of DMF is {{comparable to that of}} gasoline, little is known about its combustion characteristics and emissions. Therefore, this work examines the effect of DMF in a single cylinder direct-injection spark-ignition engine. The results are compared to ethanol and gasoline using the optimized spark timings for gasoline and the respective fuel. In summary, DMF produces competitive combustion and emissions qualities to gasoline, which, in some cases surpass ethanol. The two biofuels have a higher burning rate and lower initial combustion duration than gasoline. They also produce greater combustion efficiency, which helps to lower hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. These initial results highlight how DMF, which was originally only considered as an <b>octane</b> <b>improver,</b> has the potential to become a competitive renewable gasoline alternative. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
