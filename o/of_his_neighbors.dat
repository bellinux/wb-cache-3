5|$|Marshall did {{not believe}} in rule by the masses, {{frequently}} expressing his disdain for the common people. His sharp wit and lack of tact in writing did little to endear him to his neighbors. Like most of the members of his family, he subscribed to Federalist principles, although the majority of Kentuckians were affiliated with the Democratic-Republicans. He was also ostracized by many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> for being zealously antireligious. He wrote pamphlets denouncing religion of all kinds and published them at his own expense. His later descendants were so embarrassed of his anti-religious writings that they had his personal papers burned.|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The Audubon Society became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E
5|$|At Governor William Dennison's request, Garfield {{deferred}} {{his military}} ambitions {{to remain in}} the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> and former students. The regiment traveled to Camp Chase, outside Columbus, Ohio, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell.|$|E

5|$|Evan {{suspects}} that one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> is an alien {{due to his}} strange, stiff way of speaking and because he {{always seems to be}} watching Evan. As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E

Like Alex's uncle, Scott has become obsessed by the Resistance and Christopher Sim.|$|E
25|$|However, {{although}} {{it was difficult to}} succeed in the fight against pirates in a city where many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> were involved in these activities, Zamorano and other agents, besides pressuring Spanish authorities and judicial officers, were following the trail of the effects stolen to burden them and incentivized local lawyers by offering them 10% of the true seizures that were made.|$|E
25|$|Elpidio is, therefore, naïve {{enough not}} to {{understand}} the ulterior motives of his classmates. Two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> are particularly guilty of charging admission to other classmates to show Elpidio naked {{from the waist down}} and exhibiting his rather overdeveloped genitalia at school. Elpidio, being an adult, is not carded for purchasing liquor, and is tricked into buying beer and pornography by his mates.|$|E

25|$|The {{defeated}} rulers were {{obliged to}} make annual pilgrimages to Tunipalangga's court in Gowa to deliver tribute and renew the ritual demonstration of submission and loyalty, while marriage to local subjugated dynasties legitimized the authority of Gowa. By 1565 only the most powerful Bugis kingdom, Boné, remained independent of Gowa's sphere of influence in South Sulawesi. Tunipalangga not only forced the submission of most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors,</b> but also enslaved and relocated entire populations to build irrigation networks and fortifications.|$|E
25|$|During the American Revolutionary War, Abraham {{served as}} a captain of the Augusta County militia, and with the {{organization}} of Rockingham County in 1778, he {{served as a}} captain for that county.

25|$|There are {{accounts}} of protection {{offered to the}} minorities by their fellow citizens that were successful in fending off the mob. The most organized team rallied behind air force captain Reşat Mater. Mater happened to be off duty and visiting his home in Cevizli's Muhasebeciler Street, which was {{right next to the}} rally point, İstanbul Caddesi. Mater first hid some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> in his house, then he took to the street with his gun and his uniform.

On his return, {{he stopped at the}} bank in Catskill, New York, where he learned that his tannery had burned down in his absence The building was uninsured, and was a loss of $1000; the cause was never determined. However, he resolved to rebuild it. Friends of Pratt's and his brothers donated money for the rebuilding, and it was quickly built.|$|E
25|$|Although Daniel Hughes {{operated}} {{in an area}} of the United States where slavery had long since been banned, this did not mean that many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> and townsfolk agreed with his stance on slavery. Hughes, his wife and 16 children had to take care in hiding their work to liberate the slaves. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 allowed slave catchers to pursue runaway slaves into the Northern states when they had been previously, under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793, forced to stop at the Mason–Dixon line. Allowing slave catchers to pursue runaways into the northern states made life more dangerous and difficult for all conductors on the Underground Railroad, including Hughes.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolutionary War one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors,</b> John Philip De Haas became commander of the 1st Pennsylvania Battalion.

However, he only found out about his appointment in August while campaigning in the north and did not assume command of his battalion until October.|$|E

While working as an elevator operator at the Asakusa France-za strip club, he became an apprentice of its comedian Senzaburo Fukami and eventually the theater's MC.|$|E

The ornate tinamou lives mainly upslope in hilly puna grassland but will move each morning {{to the bottom of}} the slopes to feed and drink. Granivorous species will move daily into grain fields with some, such as Darwin's nothura, remaining in the fields until there is no food left. Open country and southern species maintain territories only during the breeding season and at other times seem to wander at random.|$|E
25|$|Hostilities in the Black Hawk War {{began on}} May 14, 1832, when Black Hawk's warriors soundly {{defeated}} Illinois militiamen at the Battle of Stillman's Run. Potawatomi chief Shabbona worried that Black Hawk's success would encourage Native attacks on American settlements, and that Potawatomis {{would be held}} responsible. Soon after the battle, Shabbona, his son, and his nephew rode out to warn nearby American settlers, {{that they were in}} danger. Many people fled to Ottawa for safety, but William Davis, a settler from Kentucky, who had built the controversial dam, convinced some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neighbors</b> they were not in danger.
