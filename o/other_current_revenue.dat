40|$|Theme 3 The Cairo Metro {{the first}} in Africa and the Middle East is a two-line system, heavily-used. Data from the {{operator}} and a direct passenger survey are used to illustrate patterns of use and draw policy implications for <b>other</b> systems. While <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> exceeds operating costs, cross-subsidies may exist between different passenger groups {{as a result of}} highly-discounted student season tickets. A fare increase in 1996 is used to estimate short-run elasticity of demand with respect to price, approximately 0. 2, a similar figure to other metro systems. Substantial use is made of motorised feeder modes, notably shared taxis (paratransit minibuses). The high level of use occurs despite a substantial premium over other public transport fares, and lack of integrated ticketing. A likely explanation is that the fares are reasonable compared with incomes, and that the price differential is offset for many users by the time savings vis a vis congested traffic conditions.

40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find the}} key determinants of the variation of the tax revenue capacity in China, and to evaluate China’s tax revenue performance at provincial level. The econometric quantitative method is applied in this study for these purposes. The data {{used in this study}} covers the period between 1995 and 2013 on 31 provinces, autonomous or municipal cities directly {{under the control of the}} Central Government. Differing from the previous research, a new dependent variable, the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> ratio is used in addition to the conventional tax ratio. The <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> is the sum of tax revenue and non-tax soured revenue excludes State Owned Enterprises revenues and expenditures. Eleven independent variables falling into six categories were selected. These six categories were: The traditional tax handles, GDP decomposition, Population factors, Income inequality, Governmental factors, and Corruption. The contributions of this study are: Firstly, for the first time the author constructed the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> ratio as the second dependent variable to represent the broader fiscal revenue and true tax-like revenue performance for studying tax effort index in China. Secondly, this study constructed the rural-urban income disparity Theil index as one of the explanatory variables in the tax effort index models for the first time in China’s tax performance study. Thirdly, for the first time in the tax effort index literature, this study used country specific data on corruption in a single country tax effort index model. The main results of this study are: 1) tax revenue capacity is mainly determined by the economic factors whereas the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> capacity is determined by both the economic and social factors; 2) tax revenue performance is diluted by the existence of non-tax sourced revenues; 3) the <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> ratio is a better indicator for true tax performance; 4) There exists a regional disparity of tax or <b>current</b> <b>revenue</b> capacity among provinces. 5) tax/current revenue capacities and tax/current revenue efforts are mismatched in some provinces...|$|R

50|$|Revenues for {{the seven}} Canadian teams have all {{increased}} significantly since the lockout.
