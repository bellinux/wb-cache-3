However, a 2017 study on Ardipithecus ramidus challenges this belief. Scholarly opinions vary as to the developments since {{the appearance of the}} genus Homo some 2.5 million years ago. Some scholars assume the development <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> language-like systems (proto-language) as early as Homo habilis (2.3 million years ago) while others place the development <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> symbolic communication only with Homo erectus (1.8 million years ago) or Homo heidelbergensis (0.6 million years ago), and the development of language proper with Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens with the Upper Paleolithic revolution less than 100,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). It is in the collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
5|$|During the Cretaceous period, a few species <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> ants ranged widely on the Laurasian supercontinent (the Northern Hemisphere).

Ants became dominant after adaptive radiation {{at the beginning of the}} Paleogene period. By the Oligocene and Miocene, ants had come to represent 20–40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of the species that lived in the Eocene epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in Baltic amber fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in Dominican amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{combined}} statistical {{and structural}} approach {{have been used}} in this paper for texture representation. A set <b>of</b> Texture <b>Primitives</b> have been suggested.

The set <b>of</b> universal <b>primitives</b> are labeled as local descriptor and the frequency of occurrences <b>of</b> these <b>primitives</b> is used as the global descriptor, namely Texture Primitive Spectrum for a given texture image. Since the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>primitives</b> and their placement rules uniquely define a texture image, the primitive spectrum is also unique, for a texture image. These spectrums are shown to be effectively used for un supervised texture classification for Brodatz and Vistex data bases of texture images.

5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E
5|$|Many eusauropods, {{including}} Dinheirosaurus {{have been}} found in the Late Jurassic of Europe. The sauropods are from {{around the base of the}} Tithonian as based on the presence of Anchispirocyclina lusitanica. One sauropod, a diplodocid currently based on an unnamed specimen including vertebrae and some bones, is clearly different from Dinheirosaurus and Losillasaurus, confirming the presence of a least two and possibly more diplodocids in the Late Jurassic of Spain and Portugal. This is unique in the variety of diplodocoids in all Europe, with the only other genera possibly non-diplodocoid (Cetiosauriscus), or classified in Rebbachisauridae. This suggests that the biogeography <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> sauropods is incomplete, with possible primitive eusauropods and diplodocids surviving in the Late Jurassic, potentially until the Berriasian.|$|E
5|$|The Devonian {{tetrapods}} {{went through}} two major bottlenecks during {{what is known}} as the Late Devonian extinction; one at the end of the Frasnian stage, and one twice as large at the end of the following Famennian stage. These events of extinctions led to the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> tetrapods with fish-like features like Ichthyostega and their primary more aquatic relatives. When tetrapods reappear in the fossil record after the Devonian extinctions, the adult forms are all fully adapted to a terrestrial existence, with later species secondary adapted to an aquatic lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Rhynie in Aberdeenshire {{is the site}} of an {{important}} sedimentary deposit - Rhynie chert. The bulk of this fossil bed consists <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> plants that had water-conducting cells and sporangia but no leaves, along with arthropods: Collembola, Opiliones (harvestmen), pseudoscorpions and the extinct, spider-like Trigonotarbids. This fossil bed is remarkable for two reasons. Firstly, the age of the find (early Devonian circa 410 Ma) makes this one of the earliest sites anywhere containing terrestrial fossils, coinciding with the first stages of the colonisation of land by plants and animals. Secondly, these cherts are famous for their exceptional state of ultrastructural preservation, with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens. For example, stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material.|$|E
5|$|Velociraptor was warm-blooded to some degree, as it {{required}} {{a significant amount}} of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like Velociraptor did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest a more moderate metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism <b>of</b> <b>primitive</b> birds and dromaeosaurids.|$|E
