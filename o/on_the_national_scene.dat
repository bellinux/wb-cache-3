5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene</b> when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan to sit with him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene</b> was brief, but Democrats hoped that {{his reputation as a}} reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their early days in the House.|$|E

Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the people.'

[...] The only scholarly works on his life are a master's thesis by Sidney I. Pomerantz, written in 1932, and a doctoral dissertation by Albert V. House, from 1934; both are unpublished.

500|$|When McKinley, Hanna {{and their}} {{associates}} saw the emotional {{appeal of the}} Bryan campaign for free silver, they decided upon an extensive and expensive effort to educate the electorate. [...] The McKinley campaign had two main offices; one in Chicago, effectively run by Dawes, and one in New York, used by Hanna as a base of operations as he sought to gain support from New York financiers. [...] Hanna's task was to raise the money; other campaign officials, such as Dawes, determined how to spend it. [...] Being relatively unknown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene,</b> Hanna initially had little success, despite Wall Street's fear of Bryan. Some Wall Street titans, although disliking Bryan's positions, did not take him seriously as a candidate and refused {{to contribute to the}} McKinley campaign. Those who did know Hanna, such as his old schoolmate Rockefeller—the magnate's Standard Oil gave $250,000—vouched for him. [...] Beginning in late July 1896, Hanna had an easier time persuading industrialists to give to the McKinley/Hobart campaign. [...] He also gave large sums himself. [...] This money went to pay for advertising, brochures, printed speeches and other means of persuading the voter; the country was flooded with such paper.|$|E

500|$|Large sums had to {{be spent}} quickly, and Hanna energetically built a businesslike campaign. Bryan's surge contributed {{to a sense of}} crisis that enabled Hanna to make peace in his party, {{eventually}} uniting all behind McKinley with the exception of some Silver Republicans. But as the campaign began operations, and began them on a huge scale, money was short. Hanna initially spent much of his time in New York, where many financiers were based. [...] He faced resistance at first, both because he was not yet widely known <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>scene,</b> and because some moneymen, although appalled at the Democratic position on the currency issue, felt Bryan was so extreme that McKinley was sure to win. [...] Others were disappointed New York Governor Morton was not the presidential nominee, but their support became warmer as they came to know McKinley and Hanna. Reports of Bryan support in the crucial Midwest, and intervention by Hanna's old schoolmate, John D. Rockefeller (his Standard Oil gave $250,000), made executives more willing to listen. After a gloomy August for the campaign's fundraising, in September, corporate moguls [...] "opened their purse strings to Hanna". J.P. Morgan gave $250,000. [...] Dawes recorded an official figure for fundraising of $3,570,397.13, twice what the Republicans had raised in 1892, and as much as ten times what Bryan may have had to spend. Dawes' figure did not include fundraising by state and local committees, nor in-kind donations such as railroad fare discounts, which were heavily subsidized for Republican political travelers. Estimates of what Republicans may have raised in total have ranged as high as $16.5million.|$|E
