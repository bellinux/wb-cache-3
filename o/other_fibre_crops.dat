He was amnestied in January 1925 and sent to Yalta to recover. He returned to Moscow in autumn 1925 to work for the Ministry of Agriculture and devoted his energies to improving the cotton crop in Central Asia. By 1930 he was head of an institute dedicated to development of cotton and <b>other</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>crops.</b> He married Donna Gruz and they had twin girls in 1934. In July 1937 he was arrested, and he was sentenced to death for espionage on 25 November 1937; he was shot the next day. He was rehabilitated posthumously in 1956, three years after Stalin's death.|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} awareness of sustainable production in our society in recent decades {{has led to the}} search for new environmentally-friendly products. Natural fibres from flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), which are renewable and can be degraded biologically after their use, are an alternative that has been considered as a replacement for synthetic fibres in many industrial applications, for example, as reinforcement in composites, rubber and concrete. The objective of` this work was to carry out a thorough literature review on the production and use of flax for non-textile applications in general, and on aspects related to harvest and handling in particular. The report starts with a review of earlier Swedish research and development projects and then focuses on harvest and handling methods. Thereafter, quality aspects related to harvest and handling of flax, i. e. straw moisture contents and degree of retting, are reviewed. A summarising discussion and proposals for future research are presented in the last chapter. After the closure of the last flax long fibre processing plant in 1966, there has been no commercial production of flax fibres in Sweden. However, interest in using flax fibres in non-textile applications was stimulated in the late 1980 s, and a number of projects started in the 1990 s with the aim of restoring Swedish flax fibre production. Today, there are no flax processing plants in operation, but it is recommended that new research and development projects be directed towards the creation of a demand for biofibres before such plants are established. This would be a first step towards creating a future market for short natural fibres obtained from flax, and also from <b>other</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> such as hemp. The harvest and handling operations constitute {{an important part of the}} total production costs, Computer simulation of these operations is recommended in order to find more cost-effective and reliable delivery systems, Such simulations should include quality aspects regarding the straw moisture content and the degree of retting, provided that reliable, quick and inexpensive methods to assess the degree of retting are developed, and that models describing the moisture content changes and the progress of retting are constructed...|$|E
40|$|Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) {{is a high}} {{yielding}} <b>fibre</b> <b>crop</b> {{that can}} be utilised as raw material in many industrial applications ranging from traditional fabrics, yarns and ropes to new applications in building materials, composites and lightweight car parts. Kenaf competes in some applications with <b>other</b> bast <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> such as jute, hemp and flax and with wood or wood residues in other markets such as in wall panels and pulp and paper applications. Traditional gunnysack markets switched over to cheap synthetic manmade fibres based on fossil oil, resulting in a decline of demand and production of jute and allied fibres over the past decades. This declining trend may be reversed, only when the different new markets for <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> described in this chapter can be established on a viable scale. When the policies for {{the transition from a}} petroleum-based economy to the biobased economy are to be implemented, increased demand for these kind of cellulose resources has to be anticipated for.

30|$|Wood pulp fibres are {{presently}} a major {{area of research}} for several end-use applications. Fibres can be utilised as reinforcement in bio-degradable composites and {{as a source of}} raw materials for bio-energy and biochemical production. Wood pulp fibres have been applied as the raw material for the production of a fibrillated material, which was introduced and defined as microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) by Turbak et al. [1] and Herrick et al. [2]. Several modern and high-tech nano-applications have been envisaged for MFC [1]. Although cellulose fibres have constituted the main source for MFC production, the utilisation of <b>other</b> pulp <b>fibres,</b> agricultural <b>crops</b> and by-products have also been explored [3 – 5]. With the years, various subjective definitions have been given to the fibrillated materials, e.g. nanofibrillated cellulose, nanofibres, nanofibrils, microfibrils and nanocellulose [6 – 10].|$|R

40|$|<b>Fibre</b> <b>crops</b> are {{important}} natural resources, as they sustainably provide bast fibres, an economically-valuable raw material {{used in the}} textile and biocomposite sectors. Among <b>fibre</b> <b>crops,</b> textile hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is appreciated for its long and strong gelatinous bast fibres. The stem of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> is a useful system for cell wall-oriented studies, because it shows a strong tissue polarity with a lignified inner core and a cellulosic hypolignified cortex, {{as well as a}} basipetal lignification gradient. Along the stem axis of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops,</b> a specific region, denoted snap point, marks the transition from elongation (above it) to fibre thickening (below it). After empirically determining the snap point by tilting the plant, we divided the stem segment containing it into three non-overlapping consecutive regions measuring 1 cm each, and carried out targeted RT-qPCR on cell wall-related genes separately, in outer and inner tissues. Different gene clusters can be observed, two of which are the major gene groups, i. e., one group with members expressed at higher levels in the inner tissues, and one group whose genes are more expressed in the cortex. The present results provide a molecular validation that the snap point is characterised by a gradient of events associated with the shift from fibre elongation to thickening...|$|R
40|$|Bast fibres are extraxylary sclerenchymatous cells {{characterized}} by a noteworthy length and by a cell wall composed of crystalline cellulose. Bast fibres support mechanically the phloem and are used for different industrial applications by the textile and biocomposite sectors. <b>Fibre</b> <b>crops</b> like hemp (Cannabis sativa), flax (Linum usitatissimum), ramie (Boehmeria nivea), jute (Corchorus olitorius, C. capsularis), kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus) are therefore important natural resources which can help develop a sustainable economy.

40|$|Lignin and {{cellulose}} {{represent the}} two main components of plant secondary walls and the most abundant polymers on Earth. Quantitatively {{one of the principal}} products of the phenylpropanoid pathway, lignin confers high mechanical strength and hydrophobicity to plant walls, thus enabling erect growth and high-pressure water transport in the vessels. Lignin is characterized by a high natural heterogeneity in its composition and abundance in plant secondary cell walls, even in the different tissues of the same plant. A typical example is the stem of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops,</b> which shows a lignified core enveloped by a cellulosic, lignin-poor cortex. Despite the great value of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> for humanity, however, still little is known on the mechanisms controlling their cell wall biogenesis, and particularly, what regulates their spatially-defined lignification pattern. Given the chemical complexity and the heterogeneous composition of fibre crops’ secondary walls, only the use of multidisciplinary approaches can convey an integrated picture and provide exhaustive information covering different levels of biological complexity. The present review highlights the importance of combining high throughput -omics approaches to get a complete understanding of the factors regulating the lignification heterogeneity typical of <b>fibre</b> <b>crops...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bast fibre {{industries}} {{have a long}} standing tradition, both in China and Europe. In the past decades significant changes {{have taken place in}} the sector and strong competition is faced on the market with manmade fibres on the one hand, {{and on the other hand}} at the farm level with other crops that offer more secure income. Both in China and Europe a decline in productivity can be observed, despite the growing environmental awareness of consumers and despite increased demand for ecological benign products. In this report, the trends in the traditional markets (textiles, ropes, etc.) and changing demands for <b>fibre</b> <b>crop</b> products were reviewed and the prospects for expanding new markets explored. Several new applications for bast <b>fibre</b> <b>crops</b> have been developed in the past decades in automotive industries and building materials. In recent years a remarkable shift has taken place in the industrial yarn and fabric manufacturing from EU towards China. High quality European fibres are being spun and woven in Chinese factories, while the finished consumer products are exported back to Europe. It can be concluded from the market trend analysis that a need exists both in Europe and China for innovation at different levels of the <b>fibre</b> <b>crop</b> production and supply chain and without closer cooperation between all players, the risk is great that further deterioration will occur of this ancient craft and expertise...|$|R
