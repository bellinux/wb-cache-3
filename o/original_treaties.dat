50|$|In 1865 the Morant Bay Rebellion {{marked a}} moment in Jamaican history when the {{dialogue}} {{between the government and}} the oppressed reached a fever pitch led by Baptist deacon and activist Paul Bogle. There was confusion between the poor black population and the Maroon population as to where the stronger Maroons’ allegiance lay during the siege. It has been said that the Maroons ultimately made a decision to support the British in quelling the uprising on the premise that they wanted to stay loyal to the <b>original</b> <b>treaties</b> {{between the government and the}} early Maroon population. John Stuart Mill’s social influence on the Jamaican government system was profound because he headed the now defunct Jamaica Committee which helped create a necessary process of intervention on the behalf of the governed and oppressed that would put into question and challenge the necessity of excessive punitive actions against opposition; ultimately, this helped foster the growing sentiment of freedom of speech.|$|E
5000|$|None of the <b>original</b> <b>treaties</b> {{establishing}} the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights. It was not envisaged for European Union measures, that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions, {{to be subject}} to human rights. At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights, hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights. The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states' constitution became ever more apparent. In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights, which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union draws a list of fundamental rights from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties.|$|E

One of the purposes is to choose such architectural decisions of the designed system and modern technologies that can actualize the raised claims by the system we design. The choice is performed by analyzing some architectural decisions, comparing them to each other, and evaluating their advantages and shortcomings. Using the method of simulation the effectiveness of the chosen architectural decision will be estimated. The goal of this work was to develop barter service accounting system - documents adjustment process and also to fix stages of supply processes and control them properly. System development was based on analysis of barter department activities and business processes. The outcome of this work was detailed UML activity model and system project. The information system was developed using Microsoft SQL server, Internet Information Services and Visual FoxPro technologies. The developed system is aimed to deal with following problems: •	to simplify process of refunding debt and control: a. 	Exchange of information between different departments which are involved in to the barter service processes; b. 	Automating development of requirements (incomes/disbursements); c. 	The supply of original treaty is controlled by indicator aids. •	The <b>original</b> <b>treaties</b> are saved in the electronic document archives...|$|E

40|$|According to the {{original}} scheme of the ‘Founding Fathers’, the relations between supranational authorities and national administrations were to be characterised by a strict separation of their respective spheres of competence. This did in fact hold true, {{at least in the}} <b>original</b> <b>treaties</b> regulating the Communities. Over the years this framework has been so thoroughly modified that administrative collaboration as a legal reality {{has become one of the}} EU’s distinguishing features. As a result, a relatively simple constitutional structure has been rendered slowly but surely more complicated by an increasingly articulated administrative system. The present administrative system is characterised by the fact that the powers relating to the Community public functions are conferred upon a number of structurally separate authorities, whose nature is national, supranational or, sometimes, a composite of the two. The European Community assumes the form of permanent interaction and even merger of what were originally two distinct legal systems. This paper focuses on the relatively new, and most impressive and original technique of administrative integration: the adoption of a number of Community regulations for specific sectors, to be implemented not just by a supranational administration (central or peripheral), but by a plurality of national, supranational and sometimes mixed authorities, with a special role assigned to a Community office. The purpose of this paper is to consider the various regulations by sector as variants of an emerging general model of exercise for certain Community functions. It will be argued that such a general model is presently in the process of consolidation, notwithstanding the variety of approaches adopted by European legislators. decentralisation; governance; multilevel governance; network approach...|$|E
40|$|As the EU's {{fundamental}} rights regime reaches maturity, this book offers the first full-length {{overview of the}} historical development and current role of {{fundamental rights}} in the law and policy of the European Union. It analyses both the institutional aspects (the place of fundamental rights in the EU legal order and their role in decision-making procedures) and substantive dimensions (the range and scope of rights recognized as part of EU law). Part I traces the emergence of fundamental rights as {{a feature of the}} EU legal order, from the initial silence of the <b>original</b> <b>Treaties</b> to the development of fundamental rights as general principles of law safeguarded by the European Court of Justice, and the adoption of a number of legislative instruments linking the protection of certain fundamental rights to the establishment of the internal market. Part II moves on to examine fundamental rights in the current landscape of EU law and policy. It analyses the constitutionalization of fundamental rights through Treaty amendments and the development of an area of freedom, security and justice among the Member States. It examines the role of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and of the Fundamental Rights Agency; and the relationship between the EU and the Council of Europe in the protection of human rights on the European continent. Finally, Part III offers a critical analysis of the role of fundamental rights in the external relations of the EU. As a whole, the book offers an ideal introduction to understanding the European Union as a human rights organization, suitable for use by graduate students, and an invaluable reference point for academics and legal practitioners needing an overview of EU fundamental rights law and policy...|$|E
40|$|In May 1995, European Union {{issued the}} White Paper "Preparation of the Associated Countries of the Central and Eastern Europe for the Integration into the Internal Market of the Union", where it stated that "the main {{challenge}} for the associated countries in taking over internal market legislation lies not in the approximation of their legal texts, but in adapting their administrative machinery and their societies to the conditions necessary to make the legislation work […]" (paragraph 3. 25). The European Council in Madrid (1995) brought the solid orientation of the Community towards enlargement while stressing the need for candidate countries (at the time) to adjust their administrative structures. What continued to be lacking though (creating as such confusions for the accession agenda) was the reference to how national administration of the CEE countries must adapt or towards {{what they needed to}} direct their institutional public administration reforms. This is what this paper aims at clarifying, by offering a possible, democratic reading of the "consolidated administration" criterion in the case of Croatia, using the experience of the CEE countries (specifically, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania). In doing so, I will investigate the European Union's role in the public administration reform of Croatia. My assumption in the case would be that the European Union is an actor that during the accession trials, assists Croatia in democratizing the organization and functioning of its public administrations, just {{as it did in the}} case of the CEE countries. The cross-country comparison of the public administration reforms is to be made under the theoretical framework provided for by the Europenisation and New Public Management literature, while the operationalisation of the consolidated administration criterion will be achieved by redesigning Robert Dahl's democratization theory and apply it on the case of the European Union's acquis communautaire. My documentary analysis on national public administration reforms will be restricted on strategy-level documents of the countries in question and the Progress Reports the European Commission provided during the past and current enlargements. The acquis will be at its turn limited as to refer strictly to the <b>original</b> <b>treaties</b> and those following them; the Accession Treaties of the Member States and the international organizations and acts of the organizations created through international agreements. A special attention will be also given to the contents of the White Paper on Enlargement of the European Union. As far as the outcomes are concerned, I expect the research to allow a refining of the role the European enlargement policies play in confirming the domestic political options for administrative reform in Croatia. In addition, a clarification of the "consolidated administration" criterion might prove useful for the advanced study of the public administration reforms in the current associated countries to the European Union. europeanisation, administrative consolidation, public reform...|$|E

40|$|The legal {{personality}} (or capacity) is an attribute that can {{belong to the}} participators in international relations. It divides {{all the members of}} international society into two groups. First of them consists of entities, that enjoy the {{legal personality}} - we describe them as subjects of international law. In this group belong states, intergovernmental organisations (so called IGOs) and a group of various other units, e. g. The Holy See or the Sovereign Order of Malta. The second group is composed from the entities without legal personality under international law. Here we could find wide group of non-governmental organisations and strong supranational corporations. They may possess significant political power and heavily influence deciding of the states and intergovernmental organisations, they may have legal personality under municipal law but they do not enjoy the legal personality under the international public law. The legal personality is defined as possessing rights and duties enforceable at law. It means, that the subject under international law can conclude agreements, can enter into diplomatic relations (enjoys so called right of legation), can submit claims and act before international court or judge, has right to enjoy immunities for itself and for its representatives, can become a member of international organisation or become a party of international convention and also has to hold the responsibility for own unlawful actions. International organisations, as a subject of international law, enjoy the legal personality different from the personality of member states. There is no doubt about the legal personality of European Communities. Every of the three charters founding the European Coal and Steal Community, European Community and Euroatom includes explicit provision, that the founded organisation enjoys legal personality. Looking at the Maastricht and as well at the Amsterdam treaty, we cannot find any smilar provision concerning the legal personality of European Union. The issue of whether the Union has legal personality is disputed. The prevailing view is been that it was not the will of the member states to give the Union legal personality. Expert opinion generally maintains that an international organisation such as the European Union doesn't have the legal personality unless its founders confer such personality on it expressly. In contradistinction to the <b>original</b> <b>treaties</b> about Communities the member states in Maastricht treaty did not acknowledged the personality of Union. Article 24 and 38 of the Treaty of the European Union (added by the Treaty of Amsterdam) give the Council of the European Union the capacity to conclude international agreements. But this competence is strictly limited only on areas covered by the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters and only when it is necessary to implement those titles. The legal effects of such agreement apply only on member states individually and according to the terms and conditions laid down by national law. Regarding this provision the European Union must be seen as a Union of States without legal personality of its own under international public or domestic law, which, when it takes action at international level, does so on the behalf of the member states on not on his own account. The question of legal personality was comprehensively researched by the European Convention. There was created a working group on legal personality. The group examined the matter closely and for the purpose heard the views of a number of experts. In the final report that was brought into open in October 2002 the working group recommended conferring explicit legal personality on the Union. The single legal personality, according to the opinion of working group, should replace the existing legal personalities. The question of legal personality was one of the "simple" issues discussed by Convention. The working group on legal personality has finished its search quite early (comparing with other working groups) and the final report was established on broad consensus. ...|$|E
