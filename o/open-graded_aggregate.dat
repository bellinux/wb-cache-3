40|$|The {{need for}} hard-surfaced porous {{pavements}} has grown {{over the past}} few years as the market accepts PPS technology as a viable solution, as regulations leave few other options and as frequency of use increases. The FilterPave system is a unique porous pavement system that uses post-consumer recycled glass as the <b>open-graded</b> <b>aggregate.</b> Approximately 90 glass beverage bottles are used in just one square foot of pavement, making constructive use of abundant recycled materials that are traditionally sent to the landfill and used as daily cover...|$|E
40|$|Pavement {{subsurface}} drainage is increasingly included in pavement designs. Typically, the subdrainage components {{consist of a}} drainage layer, edge collection system and outlet. Questions have developed relative to use of bound and unbound aggregate in the drainage layers as well as drainage layer location within the section. ^ The current study {{is a continuation of}} the study HPR- 2078, “Locating the Drainage Layer for Flexible Pavements”. In this previous study, three test sections were constructed in a new pavement on a by-pass around Fort Wayne Indiana. These test sections were instrumented to record temperatures, moisture, frost penetration, rainfall and subdrainage system outflow. Collected data and Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis indicate the systems are performing satisfactorily. However, concern developed over the stability and rutting characteristics of the open-graded drainage layers. As a continuation study, longer term environmental and subdrainage performance data was collected. Additional data was collected from FWD tests, condition surveys, roughness measurements. Laboratory triaxial tests were also conducted on all asphalt mixtures, unbound aggregate materials and subgrades. Tests of asphalt mixtures were conducted at two loading speeds and both wet and dry. Asphalt mixture tests were conducted at the recorded 7 -day high field temperature. These data were used in FEM analysis of the stability and rutting characteristics of the test sections. ^ The three subdrainage systems continue to be effective. There is no change in the ranking of performance. Section 1 (open-graded asphalt drainage layer) continues to drain significantly faster than section 2 and 3 (<b>open-graded</b> <b>aggregate</b> layer). Water infiltration through the surface has decreased. The pavement sections are in excellent condition in terms of cracking and rutting. ...|$|E
40|$|Porous asphalt {{is a new}} {{generation}} of flexible pavement using <b>open-graded</b> <b>aggregate</b> which has a fraction of coarse aggregate not less than 85 % of the total weight of the mixture to obtain a higher cavity, which serves as a rough surface drainage on the road surface that allow water to seep into the upper layer is vertical and horizontal, the ability to reduce noise and increase the friction between the road surface by vehicle tires. The increasing need for a national asphalt requires Pertamina to import almost half of total domestic demand. One alternative that could be considered to reduce imports and improve the performance of asphalt mixtures is to utilize liquid asphalt asbuton. Liquid asbuton is a new technology of processing asbuton rock containing 70 % binder and 30 % mineral, which is expected {{to be used as a}} mixture of petroleum asphalt that has been used as a binder in the asphalt mixture. The problem is how the performance of the combination of oil and liquid asphalt asbuton when used as a binder in the porous asphalt mixtures. To test the performance of porous asphalt, has been studied in the laboratory by creating a test object using open graded version of the FHWA total of 160 specimens with 6 variations in levels of binder content of asphalt with a combination of 40 % oil and 60 % liquid asphalt asbuton and with 4 variations in levels of additional material of polypropylene. From the results obtained the test results cantabro loss test results ranging from 7. 70 % - 51. 37 %, porosity ranges 11. 67 % - 16. 27 %, permeability ranges from 0. 064 cm/sec - 0. 134 cm/sec, stability ranges from 857. 07 kg ??? 967. 12 kg, and binder drain down around 0. 08 % - 0. 20 %...|$|E
40|$|CCAP {{mixtures}} {{have been}} used by numerous agencies across Indiana and the Midwest. CCAP mixtures consist of hard, angular, <b>open-graded</b> <b>aggregates</b> that provide strength to pavement structures. The gelled multi-grade asphalt provides a thick, durable asphalt film that slows the progression of aging and thereby promotes increased pavement life. This presentation details the engineering and design behind CCAP mixtures, provides ideal pavement candidates for CCAP mixtures, and showcases projects across the region...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{demonstrated}} that a positive subsurface drainage is beneficial in enhancing pavement performance and thus extending pavement service life. Typical permeable base materials include asphalt/cement-treated, <b>open-graded</b> <b>aggregates</b> and unbound <b>aggregates.</b> Although asphalt/cement-treated, <b>open-graded</b> permeable bases perform well based on the past engineering practice, they are expensive solutions and less desirable for some roadways when compared to unbound aggregates, especially for low- to medium-volume roadways. In these situations, {{it is possible to}} use a properly graded unbound aggregate that is adequately drainable and structurally stable during the construction and service lifetime after the roadway is open to traffic. This study is to determine a proper/optimum gradation by conducting laboratory testing for unbound aggregates of Mexican limestone that are commonly used in Louisiana highways. However, there is trade-off between structural stability and permeability of unbound aggregates. The increase of permeability is often at the cost of structural stability or vice verse. Therefore, the criteria for selecting an optimum gradation are: (1) an adequate permeability to drain the infiltrated-water from the pavement as quickly as possible; and (2) a sufficient structural stability to support the traffic loading. The permeability of unbound aggregate is quantified by its saturated hydraulic conductivity while its structural stability is characterized by variou...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{concrete}} is {{a mixture}} of <b>open-graded</b> coarse <b>aggregate,</b> water and cement. It is also occasionally referred to as no-fines concrete or pervious concrete. Due to its high infiltration capacity, it is viewed as an environmentally sustainable paving material for use in urban drainage systems since it can lead to reduced flooding and to the possibilities of stormwater harvesting and reuse. However, the high porosity is due in the main part to the lack of fine aggregate particles used in the manufacture of porous concrete. In this paper, a numerical method is presented to understand more fully the structural properties of porous concrete. This method will provide a useful tool for engineers to design with confidence higher strength porous concrete systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{pavement}} is {{a special}} type of pavement that allows rain and snowmelt to pass through it, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and surrounding areas. In addition, porous pavement filters some pollutants from the runoff if maintained. There {{are two types of}} porous pavement: porous asphalt and pervious concrete. Porous asphalt pavement consists of an <b>open-graded</b> coarse <b>aggregate,</b> bonded together by asphalt cement, with sufficient interconnected voids to make it highly permeable to water. Pervious concrete consists of specially formulated mixtures of Portland cement, uniform, <b>open-graded</b> coarse <b>aggregate,</b> and water. Pervious concrete has enough void space to allow rapid percolation of liquids through the pavement. The porous pavement surface is typically placed over a highly permeable layer of open-graded gravel and crushed stone. The void spaces in the aggregate layers act as a storage reservoir for runoff. A filter fabric is placed beneath the gravel and stone layers to screen out fine soil particles. Figure 1 illustrates a common porous asphalt pavement installation. Two common modifications made in designing porous pavement systems are (1) varying the amount of storage in the stone reservoir beneath the pavement and (2) adding perforated pipes {{near the top of the}} reservoir to discharge excess storm water after the reservoir has been filled. Some municipalities have also added storm water reservoirs (in addition to stone reservoirs) beneath the pavement. These reservoirs should be designed to accommodate runoff from a design storm and should provide for infiltration through the underlying subsoil. APPLICABILITY Porous pavement may substitute for conventional pavement on parking areas, areas with light traffic, and the shoulders of airport taxiways a runways, provided that the grades, subsoils, drainage characteristics, and groundwater conditions are suitable. Slopes should be flat or very gentle. Soils should have field-verified permeability rates of greater than 1. 3 centimeters (0. 5 inches) per hour, and there should be a 1. 2 meter (4 -foot) minimum clearance from the bottom of the system to bedrock or the water table...|$|R
40|$|Porous asphalt is a {{flexible}} pavement layer with high percent of interconnected air void and constructed using <b>open-graded</b> type of <b>aggregate.</b> Aggregate shape and surface texture plays {{a vital role}} in determining the engineering properties and performance of porous asphalt. Angular-shaped aggregate which has a clear defined fracture faces and sharp edges are preferable to be used in asphalt mixture since it encourages better interlocking structures within the aggregate’s skeleton. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of aggregate’s angularity on engineering properties and performance of porous asphalt using a combination of conventional method and empirical Particle Index Test method. The term of engineering properties includes experimental works to determine the resilient modulus and stability while performance deals with the porosity and durability characteristics of porous asphalt due to variations in the Particle Index Number (Ia). From laboratory data analysis, it was found that angular particles delivers larger Ia number compared to those less-angular or non-angular particles. Significant improvement in the resilient modulus and stability properties has been obtained with application of angular-shaped aggregate. Angular particles also results in higher porosity of mixture but causes undesirable durability performance on porous asphalt against abrasion loss. Some improvements have been recommended to enhance the strength properties and performance of porous asphalt based on engineering explanation...|$|R
