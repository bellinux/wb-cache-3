Estimates for the plans, which were named Nordstern, were for a population of 250,000 of exclusively Germans. However, all that was ever realized at Øysand was the airfield and a small army base, as well as a series of prison camps.|$|E

25|$|Lagrange was a {{favourite}} of the king, {{who used}} frequently to discourse {{to him on}} the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson went home, and thenceforth Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and found by experiment the exact amount of work which he was able to do without breaking down. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight <b>off</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> single erasure or correction.|$|E
25|$|Clare becomes {{interested}} in Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) {{when he gets}} a lucrative property development job. They grow closer to him and she attempts to seduce him but he rebuffs her advances, due to recently separating from his wife, Stacey (Lacey Turner), but relents when Clare dresses up as Princess Leia to impress him. He propositions her but Clare refuses {{to have sex with}} him, breaking down and telling him about an affair she had with an aggressive, married man named Arnold. Arnold traces Clare to Walford, wanting to rekindle their affair but Clare only wanted Arnold to buy her expensive gifts and when he stopped, she fled. Clare knows that Arnold had bought his wife expensive jewellery and persuades Bradley to help her steal it by claiming that it belongs to her. Believing Arnold is a bully, Bradley agrees. The robbery goes <b>off</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> hitch, but Arnold sees Clare leaving and returns to Walford to confront her. Clare admits that she never loved Arnold and was only using him for his money. When he threatens to call the police, Clare threatens to ruin his marriage and Bradley throws him out after Clare lies that he was verbally abusing her. Satisfied with her pay off, Clare realises that Bradley is too good for her and tells him this, refusing to start a relationship, but is jealous, however, when Bradley reconciles with Stacey.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly's {{second and}} final Ashes tour to England {{as a player}} in 1938 again saw him as the most {{effective}} bowler in the team. His final record of 22 wickets {{at an average of}} 27.72 in the four Tests—the Third Test was rained <b>off</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> ball being bowled—was marginally less than 1934, and in all matches he took 104 wickets at 16.59. In its report of the tour, however, Wisdens 1939 edition noted that [...] "it was nothing short of remarkable that despite the moderate support accorded to him he bowled so consistently well and so effectively." [...] Again, O'Reilly was often used defensively where there was no help from the wicket, but, Wisden added, [...] "when... the wicket gave him the least encouragement he robbed the greatest batsmen of initiative, and was most destructive".|$|E

Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling {{off the side of the}} cliff. The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: [...] "From where we were , you could see the local cemetery; and the box [...] looked like a casket.

500|$|A similar {{attempt was}} made on 4 September, when McPherson again spotted {{warships}} off Brunsbüttel, Wilhelmshaven and in the Schillig Roads. The Blenheim's radio failed again and no attack could be launched, until after McPherson's return. A force of 10 Blenheims from No. 110 Squadron RAF and No. 107 Squadron RAF along with five more from 139 Squadron and eight Wellingtons of No. 149 Squadron RAF took off to locate the German warships , [...] and , which some did manage to locate. No. 149 Squadron was not prepared for war. At {{least one of the}} crews—Flying Officer (F/O) Bill McRae—nearly took <b>off</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> bomb load. Looking in, he noticed the bomb bay empty. On the way to the target, Squadron Leader Paul Harris ordered his gunners to test their weapons. They all failed and he was heading into German territory defenceless. Not wanting to turn back on his first raid, he pressed ahead. No. 9 Squadron RAF also bombed the same targets later in the day, attacking targets in and around Brunsbüttel. Results were poor, however, with five Blenheims and two Wellingtons being lost and only minimal damage caused to the German warships. Admiral Scheer was hit by three bombs that failed to explode, while the light cruiser —while not one of the priority targets—was present, and also damaged by a Blenheim that crashed into the forecastle of the ship. The crash killed 11 sailors and injured 30.|$|E

Capsule Computers' Travis Bruno commented that Zero is [...] "largely the villain of the series", but that he felt the need to see her journey through to its end. Ron Duwell of Techno Buffalo, while commenting on the quality of the design of the characters, claimed that Zero was [...] "the best looking of the bunch with her acrobatic kicks and sword slashes being pulled <b>off</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> hitch." [...] Geoff Thew of Hardcore Gamer complimented the character, calling her actions, attitudes and language [...] "a nicely self-contained example of how [...] plays with juxtaposition." [...] Mike Splechta of GameZone agreed, stating [...] "the character designs were fantastic. I loved Zero's look in particular; her white flowy dress only serves as a contrast to her violent behavior since it gets drenched in blood the more you tear enemies apart with her weapons." [...] RPGFans Derek Heemsbergen referred to Zero as [...] "foul-mouthed butcher", although he was generally positive about her story and her interactions with Mikhail and the disciples, calling the latter [...] "strange and often hilarious". Andrew Barker, in an analysis of the game for RPGFan, referred to her as [...] "violence personified", noting how the game gradually justified her actions. She was also noted, alongside One, as being the only Intoner who had no real need for a disciple. In a final note, he said that he only felt comfortable with Zero during the game's fourth branch, where her motives were revealed. Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek described her as a conscious mockery of standard action-game protagonists, referring to her as [...] "murderous, foul-mouthed, impulsive, abusive, and all but impossible to like." ...|$|E

It follows the casting and creative process, in which Mr G's short temper and perfectionism make the project increasingly more difficult for all involved. Finally, Annabel's parents intervene and tell Mr G they are uncomfortable of the dramatisation of their late daughter's life and death, in particular the song [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] that painted Annabel as a vapid party girl addicted to drugs. Mr G then quickly writes [...] "Mr G: The Musical" [...] and is forced to cast a boy with Down syndrome as the lead. Mr G's beloved dog Celine is hit by a car, and all aspects of his life seem to be in a downward spiral. However, the musical goes <b>off</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> hitch, with Mr G providing the vocals.

Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers", and concluded, [...] "Don’t expect a miracle.

[...] Game Informer, whilst disappointed in the game concluded [...] "I'm glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, I have no desire to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what Duke Nukem Forever is and ready to never talk about it again. Welcome back, Duke. I hope your next game (which is teased after the credits) goes <b>off</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> hitch." [...] GiantBomb however concluded that for those [...] "part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it has some kind of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on."

As a new commanding officer, Bertholf {{had to deal with}} the international shipping community and assist vessels entering the harbor with finding the proper berth as well as enforcing anchorage and port regulations. This experience in command of a small cutter would be necessary before he could assume command of the larger cutters in the Revenue Service and required tact and good judgment. [...] In August 1907, he was promoted to captain, detached from duty in Philadelphia and assigned to be the temporary captain of [...] at Wilmington, North Carolina while the commanding officer was on a temporary assignment. During the short assignment, Bertholf was able to use his experiences at the Naval War College in fleet training exercises with several other USRCS cutters in the Atlantic Ocean. [...] Landing exercises utilizing the crews of the cutters were performed at Yorktown, Virginia along with squadron formations and gunnery exercises at sea. After the commanding officer returned to the Seminole, Bertholf was expecting to return to his command on Wissahickon when he received the surprise of orders assigning him to the command of his old ship, Bear. [...] This was a great honor and a great responsibility as the Bear was the most famous cutter in the Revenue Cutter Service. He reported aboard Bear as it was finishing a maintenance overhaul at Mare Island in December 1907 and he was required to move her to another shipyard in Oakland, California to have repairs completed. He was expecting to get underway in the spring for the annual Bering Sea Patrol; but instead received orders to escort the Great White Fleet into San Francisco Bay.
