50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{service to}} DID for outgoing calls from a PBX {{to the central}} <b>office</b> <b>exchange</b> is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct Dial Central Office (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller line identification (CLI) or caller-id of extensions for outgoing calls is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.|$|E
50|$|A ringer box {{consists}} of bells or gongs and an electromagnetically-driven clapper which strikes the gongs when actuated. The electromagnet of the clapper {{responds to the}} alternating current sent from a central <b>office</b> <b>exchange</b> or another phone via the telephone network wiring. The direct current required by the telephone's audio circuitry is blocked with a capacitor before entering the ringer to prevent the ringer from being triggered by circuit interruptions and pulse dialing. Typical ring voltages {{are in the range}} from 60 to over 100 Volts, and alternate at a frequency of 20-30 Hertz.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{sophisticated}} electronics {{in the early part}} of the 1990s, telephone service providers developed methods to share a single copper line to transmit multiple telephone calls simultaneously. Various pair gain methods using time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing prevented interference between simultaneous calls. A distant suburb may have a subscriber loop carrier or digital loop carrier system in which a remote concentrator is located near the subscribers to connect multiple local subscriber loops to one common line to a central <b>office</b> <b>exchange.</b> A single optical fibre can also be shared between multiple subscribers in fibre to the cabinet systems.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the results of}} providing feeding-back information to general practitioners on their antibiotic prescriptions by comparing three methods: providing simple information feedback, information feedback accompanied by a telephone exchange with a physician-advisor, or finally, information feedback accompanied by a collegial exchange in their office with a physician-advisor. Method: We performed a randomized trial comparing 400 general practitioners in three different regions (Auvergne, Limousin, Poitou-Charentes) who prescribed {{the highest percentage of}} wide-spectrum antibiotics by dividing them into four groups containing 100 physicians each: control group (1), group receiving just antibiotic prescription profiles (2), group receiving antibiotic prescription profiles plus a telephone exchange with a physician-advisor (3), group receiving antibiotic prescription profiles plus a collegial exchange with a physician-advisor in their office (4). The antibiotic prescription profiles were sent in January 2004 and the exchanges took place in February 2004. We assessed the impact of these actions in March and April 2004 by comparing the four groups according to their average prescription rate of wide-spectrum antibiotics by using variance analysis tests. Results: Three physicians were excluded from the study because they stopped practicing. 20 physicians did not receive the programmed collegial exchange; nonetheless, they were included in the analysis of their respective inclusion group. The percentage of prescriptions for wide-spectrum antibiotics following the three different information feedback actions was not significantly different when group 1 and 2 were compared and when group 3 and 4 were compared. However, {{there was a significant difference}} between groups 2 and 3 and between groups 2 and 4 (p < 10 - 3). Conclusion: An information feedback audit associated with a collegial telephone exchange (just as efficacious as and less expensive than an <b>office</b> <b>exchange)</b> is an efficient method for providing support to general practitioners. It should be further tested over the long-term and in other medical contexts, notably in chronic diseases...|$|E
