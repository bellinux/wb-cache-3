5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>on</b> December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward {{from the cold}} front. The anticyclone moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered the upper level flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>on</b> May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
