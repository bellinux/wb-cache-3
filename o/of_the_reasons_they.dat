One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> {{emigrated to the}} colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small house {{that had previously been}} the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.|$|E

In fact, many children in the 2004 study said that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> {{ran away from home}} is because {{they did not want to}} be forced to work and unable to attend school. Obviously, however, the demands of living alone make it very unlikely that they will be able to obtain education through leaving.|$|E
25|$|In imperial-times Chinese {{social and}} {{religious}} culture there were charitable organizations for virtually every social service: burial of the dead, care of orphans, provision {{of food for}} the hungry. The wealthiest in every community—typically, the merchants—were expected to give food, medicine, clothing, and even cash to those in need. According to Caroline Reeves, a historian at Emmanuel College in Boston, that began to change {{with the arrival of}} American missionaries in the late 19th century. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> gave for being there was to help the poor Chinese.|$|E

The next two games were Championship encounters: a win over Division One {{whipping}} boys, Glamorgan and a defeat at Lord's to Middlesex. Little one-day practice may have been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> lost by three wickets to Surrey in the C Trophy, as they hadn't played a one-day game in two weeks. This one-day drought had also left them languishing near the bottom of the table, and a no-result against Middlesex didn't help. An innings defeat by Nottinghamshire followed, which left them eighth in Division One of the Championship at the end of May, and they ended the month with a League loss to Lancashire.|$|E

500|$|Beagles are {{excellent}} {{with children and}} this is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> have become popular family pets, but they are pack animals, and are prone to separation anxiety, a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended. [...] Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as [...] "speaking", [...] "giving tongue", or [...] "opening") when they catch the scent of potential quarry. They also generally get along well with other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also {{do not need to be}} worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.|$|E

500|$|Catherine Seipp of National Review Online {{described}} it as a [...] "nasty but extremely funny" [...] cartoon. Caryn James of The New York Times called it a show with an [...] "outrageously satirical family" [...] that [...] "includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies". The Sydney Morning Herald named Family Guy the [...] "Show of the Week" [...] on April 21, 2009, hailing it a [...] "pop culture-heavy masterpiece". Frazier Moore from The Seattle Times called it an [...] "endless craving for humor about bodily emissions". He thought it was [...] "breathtakingly smart" [...] and said a [...] "blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal". He summarized it as [...] "rude, crude and deliciously wrong". The New Yorkers Nancy Franklin said that Family Guy is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity. The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after Saturday Night Live. IGN called Family Guy a great show, and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as Family Guy. Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> love the show is because nothing is sacred—it makes jokes and gags of almost everything. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as [...] "a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do." [...] Family Guy has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.|$|E
500|$|Grand Theft Auto IV sees a {{shift in}} the series to a more {{realistic}} and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser said [...] "what we're taking as our watchword on [...] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had." [...] Art director Aaron Garbut said one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> decided to set the game in New York because [...] "we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is," [...] and since they were hoping the push the [...] "detail, variety and life" [...] to a high level, it seemed that [...] "basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit." [...] Dan Houser added [...] "because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold." [...] The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City; Dan Houser said [...] "what we've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective." [...] The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series. Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IVs predecessor , Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when [...] "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings you can go into, and the level of detail in those buildings" [...] are taken into account. The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one {{at the start of the}} project (which was done with every previous Grand Theft Auto game) and another smaller one further into development. A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.|$|E

McVeigh experimented with cannabis and methamphetamine after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia.

[...] The album was influenced by Carlton's breakup with its co-producer, Stephan Jenkins, and Carlton said that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> remained friends was that [...] "nothing took precedence over the music ... No matter {{what was going on in}} the emotional realm, all we cared about was the album. It created this kinetic environment that was kind of like Fleetwood Mac. It made for better music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Loudest Engine {{took place at}} the Killers' Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas, from September to October 2010. The album was recorded with a Studer A820 2" [...] 24-track reel-to-reel analogue tape machine. 00:07, c 3:00, d 1:25, e3:23. After Joel insisted that the album be recorded to tape, Stoermer sought and acquired the recording unit. The band decided to not record anything that they could not perform live, referring to their last album Radio Wars, which was very electronically oriented. Members of the band stated that they had a lot more freedom than ever before in the studio, which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> chose Stoermer as a producer. They knew as a musician that he understood the importance of letting a band just play music instead of pressuring them to push their instrument or sound elsewhere. Stoermer researched autobiographies of record producers, including the book, Recording The Beatles, to use as technical reference points for recording the album.|$|E

The atmosphere was different for Reese and Bianca's relationship.

[...] When questioned about the origins of the Clum manuscript during the early 1980s, Boyer changed his story to say that he did not receive the Clum manuscript from Colyn after all, instead it was given to him by one of Earp's nieces, Jeanne Cason Laing. When asked if these were all the same manuscript, Boyer replied, [...] "Some of them are a manuscript. Some are only a mishmash, as a matter of fact... The earlier ones of those guys all lean heavily on Clum and Parsons for insights, which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>they</b> got in trouble with Josephine Earp...
