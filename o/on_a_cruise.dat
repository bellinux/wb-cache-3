5|$|A French frigate {{squadron}} sent to <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> in the Northern Bay of Biscay in {{the early}} autumn of 1793 was commanded by Captain Zacharie Allemand and consisted of the frigates Carmagnole, Résolue, Sémillante and Uranie with the brig-corvette Espiègle. On 22 October, the squadron sighted the 16-gun Spanish brig Alcoudia and Allemand ordered Uranie under Captain Jean-François Tartu to separate from the squadron and pursue the Spaniard. Uranie was easily able to capture Alcoudia, taking the prisoners on board the frigate and establishing a prize crew on the brig. Two days later, Uranie was sailing southwards in company with the prize with the wind at the southwest, when a sail appeared to the north at 09:30.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Emden won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for {{excellent}} gunnery in the East Asia Squadron. In early December, Emden steamed to Incheon {{to assist}} the grounded German steamer Deike Rickmers. In May 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Karl von Müller became the ship's commanding officer; he was shortly thereafter promoted to Fregattenkapitän (Commander). In mid-June, Emden went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> to the German colonies in the Central Pacific, after which she was stationed off Nanjing, as fighting between Qing and revolutionary forces raged there. During this period, on 26 August, rebels attacked the ship, and Emdens gunners immediately returned fire, silencing her attackers. Emden moved to Shanghai on 14 August.|$|E

5|$|In early 1897, Boycott's health {{became very}} poor. In {{an attempt to}} improve his health, {{he and his wife}} went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> to Malta. In Brindisi, he became seriously ill, and had to return to England. His health {{continued}} to deteriorate, and on 19 June 1897 he died at his home in Flixton, aged 65. His funeral took place in the church at Burgh StPeter, conducted by his nephew Arthur StJohn Boycott, who was at Lough Mask during the first boycott. Charles Boycott's widow, Annie, was subsequently sued over the funeral expenses and other debts, and had to sell some assets. A number of London newspapers, including The Times, published obituaries.|$|E
5|$|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm went to Kiel after {{returning}} from the expedition to China, where on 14 August Konteradmiral Fischel raised his flag aboard the ship. She {{was assigned to the}} I Squadron as the second command flagship for the annual autumn maneuvers. These exercises were interrupted by the visit from Nicholas II of Russia, who came aboard Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm. After the maneuvers, Fischel was replaced by Konteradmiral Curt von Prittwitz und Gaffron on 24 October. In late 1901, the fleet went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> to Norway, during which Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm stopped in Oslo. During the months of December, January, and February, the ship was in drydock for major repair work.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Austria-Hungary, Panther initially {{served with the}} main fleet. During this period, she visited Spain for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. Starting in the mid-1890s, the ship {{spent much of her}} time abroad. From 1896 to 1898, she was stationed in China, and she sent a shore party to help United States Marines protect US civilians during a riot. She went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> in the Mediterranean in 1902, and in 1905, she visited East Africa. Panther was modernized in 19091910 and received a new gun armament. At the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, the ship was assigned to the Coastal Defense Special Group; these ships provided artillery support to an Austro-Hungarian Army attack in January 1916 that knocked Montenegro out of the war. The next year, Panther was withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a training ship. Awarded to Britain in the postwar division of war prizes, Panther was broken up for scrap in Italy in 1920.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the review, Rhode Island steamed to New York for an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. During the overhaul, on 8 March, the ship was assigned to the 3rd Division, 1st Squadron. After emerging from the dry dock, she resumed her normal peacetime routine of maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} squadron, gunnery practice, and training cruises. In February 1910 she was sent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> in the Caribbean. The ship was reassigned to the 4th Division, 1st Squadron on 20 October, and two weeks later she and the rest of the squadron held a naval review in Boston for President William Howard Taft on 2 November. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to visit European ports; Rhode Island went to Gravesend. During the cruise, the fleet conducted large scale battle and reconnaissance training. Rhode Island and the rest of the ships recrossed the Atlantic and stopped in Guantanamo Bay on 13 January 1911.|$|E
5|$|Captain Murray {{then took}} Levant <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> {{to hunt for}} French or American vessels off Cadiz. While {{pursuing}} this task in June 1779 he ran across the Spanish battle fleet, comprising 32 ships {{of the line and}} two frigates, heading south towards an unknown destination. Spain was still nominally a neutral power and after a brief exchange of pleasantries the Spanish fleet left Levant unmolested and continued on its way. Murray immediately set sail for England to report that the Spanish were at sea, pausing off Land's End on 17 July to capture the French privateer La Revanche. Levant finally reached Portsmouth in late July but by this time Murray's news of the Spanish fleet was out of date; Spain had already declared war on Britain and her fleet had reached Gibraltar to commence an extended siege.|$|E

5|$|Dubourdieu's {{squadron}} {{was spotted}} approaching {{the island of}} Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in HMS Active, which had led the British squadron from Port St George <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> off Ancona. Turning west, the British squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half a mile of the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the British line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in Favorite {{at the head of}} the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of Active {{at the head of the}} British line and cross it further east with Danaé, which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the British line in two places and destroy the British squadron in the crossfire.|$|E
5|$|Hrabri was {{launched}} in 1927 as the first submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy. Along with Nebojša, she left the Tyne in late January 1928. In company with the Yugoslav submarine tender , the two submarines arrived in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928. In May and June 1929, Hrabri, Nebojša, Hvar and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. According to the British naval attaché, the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta.|$|E
5|$|Idaho {{returned}} to the peacetime routine of fleet exercises {{over the next five}} years; these were held off the coast of North and South America, as far south as Chile. The ship was also present for a variety of ceremonies during this period, including a Naval Review for President Warren Harding in Seattle in 1923. The Pacific Fleet was reorganized as the Battle Fleet in 1922. She took part in major exercises off Hawaii in 1925, departing California on 15 April. The exercises lasted until 1 July, after which Idaho embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> to the southern Pacific. Stops included Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand. While returning from Hawaii to California, she carried Commander John Rodgers, who had failed in his attempt to fly a seaplane from California to Hawaii. The ship reached San Francisco on 24 September. For the next six years, Idaho was based in San Pedro, where she continued to conduct readiness training, alternating between the Pacific and the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|The keel for Lussin {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} at San Rocco in September 1882. She {{was scheduled to be}} launched on 13 September 1883, but delays in the completion of her hull pushed her launching to 22 December. Completion of the ship was delayed further by a strike of the workers at the STT shipyard; {{this was the first time}} a strike had delayed the construction of a vessel for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. After her engines and boilers were installed, she was towed to Pola on 12 July 1884 by the paddle steamer Triton. In early October, she began sea trials, and on 21 February 1885, she completed her speed tests. She was commissioned for service the following day, and from 27 March to 30 April embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> in the southern Adriatic Sea before operating with the main Austro-Hungarian ironclad squadron until it was disbanded for the year on 17 July.|$|E
5|$|After their crews {{arrived to}} take them back to Austria-Hungary in early 1886, both vessels were taken into the navy's {{shipyard}} in Pola, where their armament was installed {{over the course of}} 1887, to include their torpedo tubes. Both ships took part in the Barcelona Universal Exposition, which saw a squadron of ironclads and cruisers sent to represent Austria-Hungary at the opening ceremonies. Coincidentally, both ships ran aground during training operations in late June 1888. The two cruisers spent much of the early 1890s laid up, with Panther being reactivated in 1896 for a major training cruise in the Pacific Ocean from May 1896 to February 1898, and Leopard returning to service in 1897 to participate in an international naval demonstration off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War. Leopard went on a training cruise in the Pacific in 19001901 for naval cadets, while Panther spent those years in reserve. The latter went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> to Morocco in 1902, and to eastern Africa in 1905 to arrange a trade treaty with Ethiopia before embarking on another cruise in the Pacific. In the meantime, Leopard served with the main Austro-Hungarian fleet in home waters in the mid-1900s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1890s, Morris was {{increasingly}} ill and living largely as an invalid; {{aside from his}} gout, he also exhibited signs of epilepsy. In August 1891, he took his daughter Jenny {{on a tour of}} Northern France to visit the Medieval churches and cathedrals. Back in England, he spent an increasing amount of time at Kelmscott Manor. Seeking treatment from the prominent doctor William Broadbent, he was prescribed a holiday in the coastal town of Folkestone. In December 1894 he was devastated upon learning of his mother's death; she had been 90 years old. In July 1896, he went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>cruise</b> to Norway with construction engineer John Carruthers, during which he visited Vadsö and Trondheim; during the trip his physical condition deteriorated and he began experiencing hallucinations. Returning to Kelmscott House, he became a complete invalid, being visited by friends and family, before dying of tuberculosis on the morning of 4 October 1896. Obituaries appearing throughout the national press reflected that at the time, Morris was widely recognised primarily as a poet. Mainstream press obituaries trivialised or dismissed his involvement in socialism, although the socialist press focused largely on this aspect of his career. His funeral was held on 6 October, during which his corpse was carried from Hammersmith to Paddington rail station, where it was transported to Oxford, and from there to Kelmscott, where it was buried in the churchyard of St. George's Church.|$|E
