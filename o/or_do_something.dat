Chandler brand amps were also used for overdubs and [...] "higher parts". Delson spoke about his studio setup for The Hunting Party, stating that [...] "It's great to have a setup where I can run combinations of heads and cabs simultaneously to get the most appropriate tone, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> more straightforward like record just one cabinet with two mikes".|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{out against}} homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service {{announcements}} in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. [...] "I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it," [...] {{he said in a}} 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.|$|E
500|$|Scott Bellis, who had {{previously}} portrayed Fenig in the first season episode [...] "Fallen Angel", had auditioned for other roles on the show in the interim, but had always been rejected by the producers because his character was felt to be too memorable. Bellis met series star David Duchovny at a gym several times, and learnt from him that the character of Max was being considered for a two-part episode. The episode's co-writer Frank Spotnitz {{did not want to}} have Fenig's appearance [...] "milked" [...] <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> the show had already done. As such he {{came up with the idea}} to kill off Fenig in the first part of the episode, which he felt was [...] "a bold choice".|$|E

500|$|After signing to DGC Records, Nirvana began {{recording}} {{its second}} album Nevermind in May 1991. [...] "In Bloom" [...] {{was one of}} the first songs the band recorded during the album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California; Vig thought it would be good to start recording a song previously recorded at Smart Studios. The arrangements for [...] "In Bloom" [...] and the other songs previously recorded with Vig in 1990 were largely unchanged; the recently hired drummer Dave Grohl stayed mostly with what his predecessor Chad Channing had recorded, but added more power and precision to the recording. Cobain sang progressively [...] "harder" [...] during the recording of the song, which made it difficult for Vig to balance the volume levels between the verses and choruses. Vig recalled that he had to change the input level [...] "on the fly" [...] and hoped that Cobain would not [...] "change the phrasing <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different" [...] while recording.|$|E
500|$|In February 1981, {{the project}} was re-designated A320, with efforts focused on the former SA2. During the year, Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150-seat {{aircraft}} envisioned and required by the airline. The A320 would carry 150 passengers [...] using fuel from wing fuel tanks only. The Dash 200 had more fuel through the activation of centre fuel tank, increasing fuel capacity from [...] to , enabling flights with a distance of [...] The aircraft would measure [...] and , respectively. Airbus then had to decide on a cross-section for the A320. It considered a fuselage diameter of [...] "the Boeing 707 and 727, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> better".

500|$|Producer Marc E. Platt {{contacted}} actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: [...] "I {{have this}} list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me [...] writers, directors, actors whom I {{have to work}} with before I go onto another career <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else with my life." [...] Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had always been interested in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre, believing that the action films of today focused more on stunts instead of characters. Despite this, Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later. Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver, saying that he was drawn to the [...] "very strong character" [...] at its core, as well as the [...] "powerful" [...] romance.|$|E

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic and I think a character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E

2500|$|Grievers {{can make}} meaning of death through philanthropic {{services}} such as charities, foundations, and organizations. Meaning-making through philanthropy can create financial support, social support, emotional support, and helps create positive results from the negative experience of the death. For example, one couple that lost a child described how they developed [...] "Nora's Project" [...] after their daughter with a disability died, {{in order to help}} provide wheelchairs for children with disabilities around the world. The mother said: [...] "With Nora's Project, I am also healing. I am able to turn something that was horrific, the way she died, into something that will do good in the world". Like this mother, it is common for individuals to want to create <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> positive for others. Philanthropy helps people make meaning by continuously and altruistically honoring a life while simultaneously helping others going through a similar experience.|$|E

2500|$|His {{relationship}} with then UKIP party leader Nigel Farage {{was full of}} [...] "animosity" [...] and [...] "tension", and he called for Farage to step down as party leader on several occasions. Farage has also called Carswell [...] "irrelevant", in response to them supporting different campaigns to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum. In response to Carswell calling for the party leader's resignation, Farage said that Carswell should [...] "put up or shut up", further saying that [...] "either he's {{going to have to}} accept that [...] <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> different". After Farage's resignation as UKIP leader following the EU referendum, Carswell tweeted a [...] "sunshades smiley emoji", which some parts of the media described as showing the [...] "uneasy relationship" [...] between the two men, Carswell later said to the BBC that [...] "I tweet smiley faces all the time, I'm very optimistic". He also said that while Farage had [...] "played a role" [...] in the referendum, the resignation was [...] "a huge opportunity" [...] for the party.

2500|$|Litigation often {{begins and}} is {{resolved}} by member state courts. They interpret and apply EU law, and award remedies of compensation and restitution (remedying loss or stripping gains), injunctions and specific performance (making somebody stop <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>something).</b> If, however, {{the position in}} EU law appears unclear, member state courts can refer questions to the Court of Justice for a [...] "preliminary ruling" [...] on EU law's proper interpretation. TFEU article 267 says court [...] "may" [...] refer [...] "if it considers" [...] this [...] "is necessary to enable it to give judgment", and [...] "shall bring the matter before the Court" [...] {{if there is no}} possibility for further appeal and remedy. Any [...] "court or tribunal of a Member State" [...] can refer. This is widely interpreted. It obviously includes bodies like the UK Supreme Court, a High Court, or an Employment Tribunal. In Vaassen v Beambtenfonds Mijnbedrijf the Court of Justice also held that a mining worker pension arbitration tribunal could make a reference. By contrast, and oddly, in Miles v European Schools the Court of Justice held that a Complaints Board of European Schools, set up under the international agreement, the European Schools Convention, could not refer because though it was a court, it was not [...] "of a member state" [...] (even though all member states had signed that Convention).|$|E
2500|$|The War of 1812 with England began {{about this}} time. There were many embargo laws then {{enforced}} and basically little trading with Europe in general. His cabinet-making business {{was all but}} rubbed out as the New England economy was in a recession at the time. It turned out little importation of European products came to America because of the war. There was a sharp incentive to make items in New England that were normally made in Europe. Many products were scarce and much rewarded for those that could produce them in America. Munroe figured {{there had to be}} a way to exploit this concept so thought of some ideas of things he could make. Being practical he first produced cabinetmaker’s squares since he already had skills in this area and it would be easy for him to make these. He did his level best selling them at a fair price, however competition eventually made his business decline. He then noticed the scarcity of imported pencils and the high price that people paid for them. Munroe figured that making these for people was a financial opportunity. He learned of earlier users that were successful in selling them, like Benjamin Franklin who promoted pencils in the Pennsylvania Gazette in 1729.
