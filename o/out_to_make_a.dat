5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was {{rewriting}} the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War and what he {{perceived to be the}} utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Atlantis: The Lost Empire was {{conceived}} in October 1996 when Don Hahn, Gary Trousdale, Kirk Wise, and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in Burbank, California. Having recently completed The Hunchback of Notre Dame the producer and directors {{wanted to keep}} the Hunchback crew together for another film with an Adventureland setting. Drawing inspiration from Jules Verne's A Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), they set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film which would fully explore Atlantis (compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne's novel). While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis, the filmmakers became interested in the clairvoyant readings of Edgar Cayce and decided to incorporate some of his ideas—notably that of a mother-crystal which provides power, healing, and longevity to the Atlanteans—into the story. They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century (the film's time period), and traveled 800feet underground in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would {{serve as a model for}} the approach to Atlantis in the film.|$|E

25|$|Challoner devoted {{much energy}} {{and time to}} {{revising}} the English Catholic Bible. He had long perceived a need to update {{the language of the}} Douay–Rheims Bible that had appeared over the years 1582–1610. Challoner did not set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> new translation; his aim was to remove antiquated words and expressions so that the Bible would be more readable and understandable by ordinary folk. While still at University of Douai, {{he was one of the}} approving prelates for a revision of the Rheims New Testament published in 1730 by the college president, Robert Witham. After returning to England, he and Francis Blyth published in 1738 another revision of Rheims in an attractive large folio edition.|$|E
25|$|Both {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} game early on, and with just over four minutes {{left in the}} first quarter, the Steelers had to punt the ball from their own 13-yard line. Josh Miller appeared to bail his team out with a 64-yard punt, but Steelers receiver Troy Edwards was penalized for going out of bounds before tackling Troy Brown on the return. This turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> big difference, as the punt was redone and on the second attempt, Brown returned it 55 yards for a touchdown. Pittsburgh responded by driving 65 yards in 10 plays, one of them a 34-yard run by quarterback Kordell Stewart, and scoring with a 30-yard field goal from Kris Brown, cutting the score to 7–3.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half, the Cowboys scored their only {{touchdown}} {{in the third quarter}} with a two-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber. Finally in the fourth quarter New Orleans got a touchdown when running back Mike Bell scored from one yard <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> 24–10 Dallas lead. Drew Brees also made a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Moore. After that, Nick Folk attempted a 24-yard field goal, but the kick was no good. With a big advantage to take the lead as the clock was expiring, the Saints were driving for the game-tying score, but DeMarcus Ware made his second sack on Drew Brees, which again caused the ball to be fumbled. This time the ball was recovered by nose guard Jay Ratliff. With the ball in possession, Dallas took a knee to conclude the game.|$|E
25|$|Picasso {{came into}} his own as an {{important}} artist during {{the first decade of}} the 20th century. He arrived in Paris from Spain around the turn of the century as a young, ambitious painter <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> name for himself. Although he eventually left most of his friends, relatives and contacts in Spain, he continued to live and paint in Spain while making regular trips back to France. For several years he alternated between living and working in Barcelona, Madrid and the Spanish countryside, and made frequent trips to Paris. By 1904, he was fully settled in Paris and had established several studios, important relationships with both friends and colleagues. Between 1901 and 1904, Picasso began to achieve recognition for his Blue period paintings. In the main these were studies of poverty and desperation based on scenes he had seen in Spain and Paris at the turn of the century. Subjects included gaunt families, blind figures, and personal encounters; other paintings depicted his friends, but most reflected and expressed a sense of blueness and despair.|$|E
25|$|It {{was quickly}} decided that The Wild Bunch, which had several {{similarities}} to Goldman's work, would {{be produced in}} order to beat Butch Cassidy to the theaters. By the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay into what became The Wild Bunch. Filmed on location in Mexico, Peckinpah's epic work {{was inspired by a}} number of things—his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde, America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War, and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but the crude men attempting to survive the era. Starring William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ben Johnson, Warren Oates, Strother Martin, Jaime Sánchez, and Edmond O'Brien, the film detailed a gang of veteran outlaws on the Texas/Mexico border in 1913 trying to survive within a rapidly approaching modern world. The Wild Bunch is framed by two ferocious and infamous gunfights, beginning with a failed robbery of the railway company office and concluding with the outlaws battling the Mexican army in suicidal vengeance prompted by the brutal torture and murder of one of their members. Irreverent and unprecedented in its explicit detail, the 1969 film was an instant success. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences, characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, were perfected in The Wild Bunch. Many critics denounced its violence as sadistic and exploitative. Other critics and filmmakers hailed the originality of its unique rapid editing style, created {{for the first time in}} this film and ultimately becoming a Peckinpah trademark, and praised the reworking of traditional Western themes. It was the beginning of Peckinpah's international fame, and he and his work remained controversial for the rest of his life. The film was ranked No. 80 on the American Film Institute's top 100 list of the greatest American films ever made and No. 69 as the most thrilling, but the controversy has not diminished. When The Wild Bunch was re-released for its 25th anniversary, even though it received an NC-17 rating from the MPAA, the depiction of violence, especially in the opening robbery sequence, had been significantly edited to soften its impact. Nonetheless, the film continues to be powerful even after so many years. Peckinpah received his only Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for this film.|$|E

In 1986, the farm which the site was part of was parceled <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>an</b> industrial park, and the new owners deeded the park property to the St. Joseph County Historical Society.

50|$|In a {{poker game}} {{with more than}} one betting round, an out is any unseen card that, if drawn, will improve a player's hand to one that is likely to win. Knowing the number of outs a player has is an {{important}} part of poker strategy. For example in draw poker, a hand with four diamonds has nine <b>outs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> flush: there are 13 diamonds in the deck, and four of them have been seen. If a player has two small pairs, and he believes that it will be necessary for him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> full house <b>to</b> win, then he has four outs: the two remaining cards of each rank that he holds.|$|R

She questions the loyalty of her male love interest and he {{is believed to be}} cheating on her with another woman. Claire Lobendfeld of Complex interpreted the song as being about a person fighting with his own feelings of jealousy. She felt that instead of flirting with other people during a night <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> lover jealous, the protagonist goes for a [...] "downtrodden" [...] direction and reconnects with old people from her past.|$|E
500|$|Hans Singer {{suggested}} that Nurkse's theory makes dubious {{assumptions about the}} underdeveloped economy. For example, Nurkse assumes that the economy starts with nothing at hand. However, an economy usually starts at a position which reflects the previous investment decisions undertaken in the country, and at any given moment, an imbalance already exists. So the logical step would be to take on those investment programmes which compliment the existing imbalance in the economy. Clearly, such an investment cannot be a balanced one. If an economy makes the mistake of setting <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> balanced investment, a new imbalance is likely to appear which will require still another [...] "balancing investment" [...] to bring equilibrium, {{and so on and}} so forth.|$|E
500|$|On Burton's hiring, he and Logan {{reworked}} the screenplay; Logan {{felt they}} agreed over the film's tone due to [...] "share stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies". Turning a three-hour stage musical into a two-hour film required some changes. Some songs were shortened, {{while others were}} completely removed. Burton said [...] "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway show, we were <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> movie, so we {{tried to keep the}} pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is not a real big fan of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape." [...] Burton and Logan also reduced the prominence of other secondary elements, such as the romance between Todd's daughter Johanna and Anthony, to allow them to focus on the triangular relationship between Todd, Mrs. Lovett, and Toby.|$|E

On the same night, Jack Deming, a friend of Tom's who has lost heavily in speculation on Tom's advice, calls at the latter's rooms, very much intoxicated, brandishing a revolver and vowing vengeance. Tom calms his excited visitor, who falls asleep on the couch, after which Tom writes {{a letter to his}} former sweetheart and dispatches it by his servant. When the servant returns, he discovers his master dead on the floor of his apartment and Jack just leaving the room revolver in hand. Jack is arrested on suspicion, and young Miss Marsh , a bright young woman in the detective department, is detailed from headquarters to investigate the case.

500|$|One of Blow's design goals was {{to achieve}} {{gameplay}} innovation naturally through the artistic {{expression of the}} game. He used Rod Humble's The Marriage as an example, in which Humble set <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> game that related his feelings {{of being in a}} marriage, instead of developing game concepts first and adding the story later. As such, Blow noted that while there were no new gameplay mechanics, the gameplay felt different from any other game. Another concept that he used for Braids development related to the game's presentation to the player. Blow recognized that many games present a complex interface to the player that {{get in the way of}} understanding the game, but at times are needed to explain the game's rules to draw in players. Blow referenced Jeff Minter's Space Giraffe, pointing out that the game never communicated the purpose of playing the game upfront to the player, citing that as one of the reasons for the game's poor reception. Braid was developed to promote this non-verbal communication to the player, explaining the fundamental rule of each world at its start and allow the player to interact with that rule throughout the world. Commenting during the development of his following game, The Witness, Blow noted that he would run into difficulty in demonstrating Braid through video footage alone, as it would not show [...] "what happens in the player's mind during the puzzle-solving process", a problem that he had also encountered with The Witness.|$|E
