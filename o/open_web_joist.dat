50|$|The first joist in 1923 was a Warren truss type, {{with top}} and bottom chords of round bars and a web formed from a single {{continuous}} bent bar. Various other types were developed, but problems also followed because each manufacturer had their own design and fabrication standards. Architects, engineers and builders {{found it difficult to}} compare rated capacities and to use fully the economies of steel joist construction. Members of the industry began to organize the Institute, and in 1928 the first standard specifications were adopted, followed in 1929 by the first load table. The joists covered by these early standards were later identified as <b>open</b> <b>web</b> steel <b>joists,</b> SJ-Series.|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The design of structures to resist explosive loads has become more of a concern to the engineering community. This research focuses on the design techniques for the loading on roof structures and the resistance of <b>open</b> <b>web</b> steel <b>joists.</b> A procedure has been developed to devise a uniform dynamic load on a roof that matches the response from blast loads. This research uses finite element analysis to evaluate the responses from numerically calculated blast loads and compares them to the equivalent loading response and the response of experimentally measured roof blast pressures. While the responses from finite element modeling matched the experimental responses, the equivalent loading procedure did not adequately predict the initial peak deflection or the maximum deflection. The response of several structural members used in roof construction, such as hot-rolled steel beams and reinforced concrete slabs, are well documented and understood. <b>Open</b> <b>web</b> steel <b>joists</b> (OWSJ) are other types of common roof components. Their responses under loading are not clearly defined, and current methods extrapolate techniques used in the design and analysis of hot-rolled steel beams and reinforced concrete. It is believed that the failure mechanisms of OWSJ significantly are not accurately being taken into account. The resistance function is computed from three tests and compared to current methodologies. It is recommended that an analytical resistance function for OWSJ be clearly defined, which includes all failure limit states...|$|R
40|$|While damages due to ponding {{are common}} and expensive, {{provisions}} for {{design and construction}} of flat roof systems lack guidance regarding these loads. The goal {{of this research is}} to present methods of designing or building flat roofs that are less vulnerable to this condition. An investigation of the literature, building codes and design specifications has been undertaken. It was found that although ponding theory has expanded to cover many areas in the literature, details within design specifications are still lacking. The effect of ponding loads has been studied through numerical analysis. This investigation confirmed the basic published theory, and also presents new results. It was found that for a roof close to the ponding stability limit, slope does not provide large benefits until it is steeper than many commercial roofs. A design of a full-scale, realistic experiment has been completed. This design calls for loading <b>open</b> <b>web</b> steel <b>joists</b> under ponding loads to failure. It is hoped that through this test, the contribution of the ponding effect to the total load can be determined and the results will provide better design and constructio...|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{structural}} components {{that make up}} a steel frame - tension members, compression members, bending members, combined force members and their connections. Tension members are usually found as web and chord members in trusses and <b>open</b> <b>web</b> steel <b>joists.</b> Ideally tension members carry tensile forces, or pulling forces, only and its end connections are assumed to be pinned. Pin connections prevent any moment(rotation) or shear forces from being applied to the member. Compression members are also considered as columns, struts, or posts. They are vertical members or web and chord members in trusses and joists that are in compression or being squished. Bending members are also known as beams, girders, joists, spandrels, purlins, lintels, and girts. Each of these members have their own structural application, but typically bending members will carry bending moments and shear forces as primary loads and axial forces and torsion as secondary loads. Combined force members are commonly known as beam-columns and are subjected to bending and axial compression.Connections are what bring the entire building together. They join these members together and must ensure that they function together as one unit.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} performance of precast prestressed concrete joists used for floor or roof members. The main objective {{of this study was}} to create a <b>joist</b> with <b>web</b> openings. The benefits of web openings are two-fold. First, a reduction of the double tee weight itself is achieved. Second, the web openings are used to run the mechanical ducts and electrical wires through the webs rather than beneath them, which reduces floor-to-floor height and results in an overall building height reduction. ^ In the first part of the study, the prestressed precast double tees were investigated. Two groups of specimens were designed to investigate the number of openings, strand profile, and different reinforcement details around the openings. Since the web openings reduce the stiffness of the double tee, deflections, anchorage of the reinforcement, and vibrations were major issues. A design procedure and design aid in the form of tables were developed. The results indicate that the behavior of the double tee with web openings is the same as the behavior of the conventional double tee. ^ In the second part of the study, the development of a new hybrid joist was investigated. In this system, the benefits of both <b>open</b> <b>web</b> steel <b>joists</b> and prestressed precast double tees were combined. The new hybrid joist system involves using prestressed precast trusses to support a cast-in-place deck. The system can be all precast where a flange deck is prefabricated in a second stage with the truss to make a T-shape whose web is a prestressed truss. The joist would accommodate different span lengths and spacings. This system is light, strong, and allows mechanical ducts to penetrate through its depth. ^ Analytical investigation was conducted to evaluate {{the performance of}} the hybrid joist. Several series of specimens were designed to investigate the behavior of the joist. Since the joist is a new system, flexural behavior, deflections, anchorage of the reinforcement and vibrations were major issues. The behavior of the joist was promising for introducing a new concept of hybrid joist. A design procedure and design aid in the form of tables were developed to help designers in the preliminary selection of the joist sizes. The results indicate that the structural behavior of the hybrid joist is comparable to that of double tees. ...|$|R
