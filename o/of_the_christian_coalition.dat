25|$|Pope Callixtus III took King Thomas very seriously: {{he ordered}} that the King of Bosnia be handed the Crusaders' cross, the papal flag and the crusading fund, marking {{him as the}} leader of the {{coalition}} in July 1457. Thomas relied not on his own dubious strength, however, but on assistance of Western rulers. His emissaries to King Alfonso V of Aragon, Doge Francesco Foscari of Venice, Duke Francesco I Sforza of Milan, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy all reported refusals of help. Cardinal Carvajal was sent to Bosnia to meet with King Thomas. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione skeptically wrote that Carvajal would have been better off if he had stayed in Buda. Indeed, Carvajal found Thomas ill-equipped to deal with the enemy. The Pope became disillusioned with him, and the leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>coalition</b> was transferred to the Albanian lord Skanderbeg.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was}} to provide {{knowledge}} about <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> Departments <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education in <b>the</b> forty-seven member colleges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> College <b>Coalition.</b> <b>The</b> information was used to develop a model for <b>the</b> reorganization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education of Huntington College, Huntington, Indiana. <b>The</b> objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was to}} determine <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> -Departments <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education in <b>the</b> forty-seen member colleges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> College <b>Coalition.</b> <b>The</b> areas investigated were <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Education Department chairperson, faculty, and <b>the</b> organizational structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curriculum format <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Departments <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education <b>of</b> <b>the</b> member schools <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coalition. <b>The</b> Academic Deans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> member colleges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coalition were contacted by letter and asked to provide the name and address <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Education Department chairperson. Based on the information supplied by the Deans the total population for the study was twenty-eight Christian Education Department chairpersons located within <b>the</b> member colleges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> College <b>Coalition.</b> <b>The</b> data were gathered from a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> literature, a questionnaire, and a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> catalogs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> member schools <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coalition. The data were presented in narrative form and where appropriate, tables were developed. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study were: 1. Sixty-three percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> member colleges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> College <b>Coalition</b> have <b>Christian</b> Education Departments located within <b>the</b> organizational structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institution. 2. Seventy-five percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responding Department chairpersons considered insufficient the time available for research (other than for classroom preparation). 3. The Department chairperson was responsible for an average of 48. 9 student advisees. 4. The average instructional course load for Christian Education Department chairpersons, equated in semester hours per academic year, was 18. 25 semester hours. 5. The Department chairperson was identified as being the key factor in departmental success. 6. <b>The</b> preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small, private, Church-related, Christian college was linked to distinctive mission statements and objectives. Based on <b>the</b> data, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conclusions made were: 1. The initial assumption presented in Chapter One, "Christian liberal arts colleges customarily include a Department <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education in <b>the</b> academic scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institution," proved to be inaccurate. 2. Departmental leadership is extremely important to <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education Departments. 3. Departments of Christian Education lack a specific identity as revealed by the various Divisions in which <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education is located and <b>the</b> variety <b>of</b> nomenclature used to describe the curriculum format. 4. Christian Education Department chairpersons appear to carry a heavy instructional and activity load which mitigate research opportunities. 5. The department structure {{may not be the best}} academic unit for housing Christian education curriculum in a Christian liberal arts college. 6. <b>The</b> preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> College was linked to distinctive mission statements and objectives which were identified as <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> faith and learning, an uncompromising institutional commitment to Biblical truth and <b>the</b> lordship <b>of</b> Jesus Christ, and a program which validates institutional claims both in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classroom. Following are some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recommendations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study: 1. The study should be replicated to determine <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> Education Departments in Bible colleges. 2. A future study should be conducted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discipline <b>of</b> <b>Christian</b> education within <b>the</b> member colleges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> College <b>Coalition.</b> 3. A future study should be conducted with students majoring in Christian education to determine department effectiveness in vocational, avocational, and professional training. 4.
