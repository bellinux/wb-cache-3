5|$|Aside from a brief {{break in}} firing 23 September to take aboard wounded from the , damaged by gunfire, New Jersey was heavily engaged in bombarding the Kansong area, {{supporting}} {{the movement of}} the U.S. X Corps. The pattern again was harassing fire by night, destruction <b>of</b> <b>known</b> targets by day. Enemy movement was restricted by the fire of her big guns. A bridge, a dam, several gun emplacements, mortar positions, pillboxes, bunkers, and two ammunition dumps were demolished.|$|E

5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number <b>of</b> <b>known</b> quarks with the number <b>of</b> <b>known</b> leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation in DPB is {{also caused}} by the {{chemokine}} MIP-1alpha and its involvement with CD8+ T cells. Beta defensins, a family of antimicrobial peptides found in the respiratory tract, are responsible for further inflammation in DPB when a pathogen such as P.aeruginosa is present. If present with DPB, the human T-lymphotropic virus, type I, a retrovirus, modifies DPB pathogenesis by infecting T helper cells and altering their effectiveness in recognizing the presence <b>of</b> <b>known</b> or unknown pathogens involved with DPB.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>known</b> extrasolar planets, 47 Ursae Majoris c {{was discovered by}} detecting changes in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. This was done by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum.|$|E

At the time of discovery, Upsilon Andromedae A was already known to host one extrasolar planet, the hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b; however, by 1999, it was clear that the inner planet could not explain the velocity curve.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{fragmentary nature}} <b>of</b> <b>known</b> Paraceratherium fossils, the animal has been reconstructed in several {{different}} ways since its discovery. In 1923, W. D. Matthew supervised an artist to draw a reconstruction of the skeleton based on the even less complete P. transouralicum specimens known by then, using the proportions of a modern rhinoceros as a guide. The result was too squat and compact, and Osborn had a more slender version drawn later the same year. Some later life restorations have made the animal too slender, with little regard to the underlying skeleton. Gromova published a more complete skeletal reconstruction in 1959, based on the P. transouralicum skeleton from the Aral Formation, but this also lacked several neck vertebrae.|$|E
