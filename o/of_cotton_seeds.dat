5000|$|While Zuo is {{best known}} for his {{military}} acumen, he believed that the key to peace and stability lay in an educated, prosperous citizenry. He sometimes referred to himself by his art name, [...] "peasant from Xiang", and was keenly interested in agriculture. He advocated the scientific reform of commercial agriculture both as a way to strengthen China's economic self-suffiency and also as a way to manage civilian populations by improving their standard of living and controlling the kinds of crops they grew. During the 12 years he spent in northwestern China, he undertook extensive agricultural research on different crops and methods. Comparing the benefits and indications of two ancient agricultural methods, the more established long field, crop rotation method (代田法) and the less common intensive, small-field method (區田法), Zuo believed that the latter method, cultivating small fields of densely-planted monocultures, was more suitable to the dry, extreme climate of the northwest region. To promote this method, he authored two pamphlets explaining the method which were then distributed freely to local farming communities. Zuo also recognised the threat of opium to the nation's stability and economic health and advocated replacing opium poppies with cotton as the major cash crop in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. He authorised the large scale distribution <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> and published pamphlets on its cultivation and processing. In 1878, he also oversaw the establishment of a large weaving factory in present-day Mulan County, Gansu Province, with the aim of creating a new textile industry in the region and providing socially-acceptable employment to women.|$|E
40|$|The dataset "Seed Dealer Survey" was {{collected}} {{to inform the}} research study that examines the efficiency <b>of</b> markets for <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> in Pakistan with particular emphasis {{on the market for}} genetically modified <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> embodying insect-resistance traits from the soil bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis (Bt) that have been conferred through genetic modification. The purpose of the seed dealer survey and seed collection was to test the seed, through DNA fingerprinting, for purity and other traits (germination, moisture etc.). The survey was designed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and implemented by Innovative Development Studies (IDS). The sample selection of seed dealers involved three steps: i) identification of markets from where most of the survey households in our sample for the study purchase seeds; ii) preparation of a list <b>of</b> all <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealers in these identified markets; and iii) selection of five seed dealers in each market and collect samples of three top selling varieties. The household survey identified that nearly 32 percent <b>of</b> the selected <b>cotton</b> growers purchased <b>seeds</b> from markets. These markets were located in 42 tehsils. Keeping in view the representation of all agroecological zones (AEZs) <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> growing areas, 27 tehsil markets were randomly selected. A list <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealers and <b>cotton</b> varieties that they purchased to sell in (kharif) 2015 were prepared in the selected tehsil markets. A <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> dealer is defined as a vendor <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seed.</b> From the dealer listing, five seed dealers were selected randomly and subsequently top three selling <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> varieties per dealer were selected. In total, we had 135 seed dealers in our sample. A structured questionnaire was administered to collect information on the sale, purchase, and inventory <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seed</b> varieties. <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> selected three <b>cotton</b> varieties were collected from each seed dealer.

40|$|AbstractThis work {{studied the}} {{potential}} of four bacteria as starter cultures for the fermentation <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> (Gossypium hirsutum) to produce Owoh condiment. Cotton seed was fermented using spontaneous traditional method and starter cultures. Single cultures of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumillus, and Staphylococcus spp. and their combinations with and without Staphylococcus spp. were used as starters for the fermentation at 35 °C for 3 days. Chemical components of fermented and unfermented samples <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> were analysed for titratable acidity, pH, gossypol and proximate using standard methods. Sensory evaluation of the fermented products was carried out for colour, aroma, taste, stickiness and overall acceptability. Data were analysed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and means separated by Duncan׳s multiple range test. Crude protein, crude fat, crude fibre, ash, moisture content, dry matter, carbohydrate, pH, titratable acidity and gossypol ranged from 22. 40 % to 13. 62 %, 28. 25 % to 15. 29 %, 11. 29 % to 2. 51 %, 3. 65 % to 1. 25 %, 39. 26 % to 55. 85 %, 60. 74 % to 44. 15 %, 34. 41 % to 67. 33 %, pH 6. 67 to 8. 24, 0. 36 % to 0. 02 % and 0. 004900 % to 0. 000233 %, respectively.

40|$|Texas ranks {{first in}} cotton {{production}} in the United States and accounts for approximately 40 % of the total production. Most of the cotton production is concentrated in the Texas High Plains where cotton and peanut are commonly grown in rotation. With peanut being a legume crop, farmers routinely leave residue on the soil surface to improve soil fertility; however, V. dahliae can survive in the crop residue contributing inoculum to the soil. A microplot {{study was conducted to}} investigate the impact of peanut residue infested with V. dahliae on subsequent microsclerotia density in soil and Verticillium wilt development in cotton. The effects of infested peanut residue rate on percent germination <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> and on wilt incidence were monitored in 2008 and 2009. In both years microplots were planted with a susceptible cotton cultivar, Stoneville (ST) 4554 B 2 RF. Increasing infested peanut residue rate was positively correlated with wilt incidence in cotton and negatively correlated with germination <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds.</b> Density of microsclerotia in the soil increased significantly with increasing rates of infested peanut residue over time. Results indicate infested peanut residue serve as a source of V. dahliae inoculum, and removing infested residue can reduce disease development in subsequent cotton crops...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Cotton (G. vitifolium) was {{indigenous}} in Esan cultivated and {{utilized for}} weaving of cloth {{and consumption of}} seeds as food. It met {{the needs of the}} people throughout the pre-colonial period and by the inception of colonial rule {{in the first decade of}} the 20 th century the demand for cotton assumed a new dimension. Foreign varieties <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>seeds</b> were introduced by British agents while Esan farmers were encouraged to cultivate it as an export crop. As long as the new type of cotton fetched a good price in the market, Esan farmers cultivated it side by side with the local type which they used in weaving the indigenous cloth. But during World War 1, when prices of produce including cotton fell Esan farmers lost will to cultivate cotton generally as more foreign fabrics came into the markets. This position remained until the end of the colonial period despite the fertile nature of Esan land for cotton growing and British attempt at developing cotton as an export crop from the area...|$|E
