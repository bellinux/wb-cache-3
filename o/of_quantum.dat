5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics is the problem <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated {{within the framework of}} classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> theory to the force of gravity.|$|E
5|$|All of this cosmic {{evolution}} {{after the}} inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity.

5|$|Depending {{on which}} {{features}} {{of general relativity}} and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and on what level changes are introduced, there are numerous other attempts {{to arrive at a}} viable theory <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> gravity, some examples being the lattice theory of gravity based on the Feynman Path Integral approach and Regge Calculus, dynamical triangulations, causal sets, twistor models or the path integral based models <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> cosmology.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that modern computer workloads (e. g. processing time of web requests) follow heavy-tailed distributions. In a heavy-tailed distribution there are {{a large number of}} small tasks and a small number of large tasks. The rationale for using a multi-level time sharing policy is that it can minimise both waiting time and slowdown of tasks that require relatively small service requirements. This in turn will improve the overall performance of the system. Using a 2 -level system (policy), we investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> on the overall performance of a multi-level time sharing policy under a range of workloads and task size variabilities. We measure the performance using slowdown and flow time. First, we show that for most workloads and task size variabilities there exists a unique set <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> (&# 039;optimal&# 039; set <b>of</b> <b>quanta)</b> that would result in the best performance. Second, we investigate the performance degradation in one metric under the optimal parameters of other metric. Through an extensive numerical analysis, we find that under high system loads and task size variabilities using the optimal set <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> corresponding to overall expected slowdown can result in the overall expected flow time to deteriorate significantly. Finally we show that a 3 -level system with the optimal set <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> outperforms a 2 -level system with the optimal set <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> for all the scenarios considered...|$|R

In this work on metamaterials for application in split-ring resonators in antenna arrays, only the temporal variation of the number <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> in more sites in a non-periodic boundary condition is detailed for a generalized Klein-Gordon lattice. A generalized Hamiltonian is considered which was then quantized by bosonic operators to study the temporal evolution <b>of</b> <b>quanta.</b> Moreover, the time <b>of</b> redistribution <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> that is proportional to QB’s lifetime shows important variation with different quanta at different permittivity, which has important implications in devices...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} the term smooth entanglement entropy transfer, {{a phenomenon that}} {{is a consequence of}} the causality-cancellation property <b>of</b> the <b>quantum</b> gravity environment. The causality-cancellation <b>of</b> the <b>quantum</b> gravity space removes the causal dependencies of the local systems. We study the physical effects of the causality-cancellation and show that it stimulates entropy transfer between the quantum gravity environment and the independent local systems <b>of</b> the <b>quantum</b> gravity space. The entropy transfer reduces the entropies of the contributing local systems and increases the entropy <b>of</b> the <b>quantum</b> gravity environment. We discuss the space-time geometry structure <b>of</b> the <b>quantum</b> gravity environment and the local quantum systems. We propose the space-time geometry model of the smooth entropy transfer.

40|$|Abstract-It {{has long}} been {{realized}} that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude {{is more likely to}} fall.

In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number <b>of</b> <b>quanta</b> is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum.

40|$|According to a-temporal {{gravitation}} theory, universe can {{be considered}} a self-renewing system that recreates itself. It is an a-temporal phenomenon in which physical space and matter are in permanent dynamic equilibrium, and its total entropy tends to zero.

Universe has a granular structure: its elementary constituents are <b>quanta</b> <b>of</b> space having the size of Planck length and being endowed with different vibrations.
