5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It has been argued that the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|The village {{name has}} been spelt in {{different}} ways, including: Bentewurda or Bintewurda (12th century) and Bynteworth (c. 15th century). The <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> of the name Bent-worth {{may have been a}} place of cultivated land, or a way through land such as woodland. The Swedish scholar Eilert Ekwall argues that a derivation from the Old English bent-grass is unlikely, and suggests a derivation from The tũn of Bynna's people.|$|E
5|$|The Gaelic overkingdom of Dál Riata was on {{the western}} coast of modern Scotland, with some {{territory}} on the northern coasts of Ireland. It probably ruled from the fortress of Dunadd, now near Kilmartin in Argyll and Bute. In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, it encompassed roughly what is now Argyll and Bute and Lochaber in Scotland, and also County Antrim in Ireland. Dál Riata is commonly viewed as having been an Irish Gaelic colony in Scotland, although some archaeologists have recently argued against this. The inhabitants of Dál Riata are {{often referred to as}} Scots, from Latin scotti, a name used by Latin writers for the inhabitants of Ireland. Its <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> is uncertain, but it later refers to Gaelic-speakers, whether from Ireland or elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|New originalism” {{presents}} a profound challenge to originalist determinacy – that is, {{to the notion}} that <b>original</b> constitutional <b>meanings</b> alone can resolve most constitutional controversies. While new originalists purport to seek out and adhere to <b>original</b> <b>meanings</b> of constitutional provisions, they acknowledge that some <b>original</b> <b>meanings</b> are too thin to fully resolve many constitutional questions. Such acknowledgment stands in sharp tension with traditional claims of originalist determinacy. While new originalism improves on “old originalism” in important ways, the former’s break from determinacy is not clean enough. New originalists are correct that it is neither epistemologically defensible nor normatively preferable to attribute complete answers to constitutional controversies to <b>original</b> textual <b>meanings</b> alone. This Article bolsters that point, responding to old originalists’ newest defenses of determinacy. Yet the Article criticizes new originalists for their own, more limited determinacy. While new originalists maintain that <b>original</b> <b>meanings</b> alone often are insufficient to resolve constitutional controversies, they overlook the epistemic uncertainties intrinsic in ascertaining <b>original</b> <b>meanings</b> themselves. This Article offers an “all the way down” critique of originalist determinacy. It challenges originalism’s ability not only to answer all constitutional questions, but also to settle reliably on single <b>original</b> <b>meanings</b> in the first place. The Article proposes to build on two of new originalism’s tools – its embrace of thin <b>original</b> <b>meanings</b> and its distinction between interpretation and construction – and to build as well on historicist critiques of originalism to create a new approach to epistemic uncertainty in constitutional interpretation. The approach is called “interpretive modesty. ...|$|R

5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's <b>original</b> <b>meaning.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (Jerusalem) as given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E
5|$|The port was {{released}} on September 17, 2009. It was later re-released as part of Sony's budget series release on August 2, 2012. Speaking in January 2010, Namco Bandai announced {{that they had no}} plans to release the port overseas. Later that year, Yuri's English voice actor Troy Baker said that he had been recording new English dialogue for the PS3 port. A report from a Namco Bandai employee sparked speculation that the reason behind the lack of a localization was due to a deal with Microsoft to keep the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive in western territories. Later, she retracted this statement, apologizing for creating false impressions. Series producer Hideo Baba later said that the main factor in this decision was the strain put on the team with the simultaneous release of the <b>original,</b> <b>meaning</b> a Japan-exclusive release was chosen to lessen the burden. This also coincided with poor marketing feedback for the series in western territories.|$|E

The divisions between the theories relate to what exactly that identifiable original intent or <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> is: the intentions of the authors or the ratifiers, the <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> of the text, a combination of the two, or the <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> of the text but not its expected application.|$|E

25|$|Though {{there may}} be no {{evidence}} that the Founding Fathers intended the Constitution to be like a statute, this fact does not matter under Scalia's approach. Adherence to <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> is explicitly divorced from the intent of the Founders; rather, the reasons for adhering to <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> derive from other justifications, such as the argument that the understanding of the ratifiers (the people of the several States {{at the time of the}} adoption of the Constitution) should be controlling, as well as consequentialist arguments about original meaning's positive effect on rule of law.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, {{the court}} held that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to {{regulate}} non-commercial activities.

Thomas dissented in Raich, again arguing for the <b>original</b> <b>meaning</b> of the Commerce Clause.|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} an invited {{response}} to Professor Lee Strang’s article Originalism and the Aristotelian Tradition: Virtue’s Home in Originalism, 80 Fordham L. Rev. 1997 (2012). Strang defends <b>original</b> public <b>meaning</b> originalism from a virtue theoretic perspective that he traces to the “central Western tradition” {{and ultimately to}} Aristotle. I reply that those committed to that tradition do better (1) to reject <b>original</b> pubic <b>meaning</b> originalism, (2) to embrace some version of original intent originalism, and (3) to defend the <b>original</b> intent <b>meaning</b> of the U. S. Constitution only with important reservations and on certain conditions. The original sin of <b>original</b> public <b>meaning</b> originalism, I argue, is that it illegitimately suppresses the lawgiver.

25|$|This {{term has}} no {{generally}} accepted meaning.
