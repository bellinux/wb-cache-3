25|$|Critical common-sensism, {{treated by}} Peirce as a {{consequence}} of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to either}} reduce or explain the {{evolution}} of the higher elements <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world,</b> naturalism is left to explain away the higher elements as mere illusions. In doing this, naturalism condemns us to a scepticism in the both epistemology and ethics. It is worth noting, that while Schiller's work has been largely neglected since his death, Schiller's arguments against a naturalistic account of evolution have been recently cited by advocates of intelligent design to establish the existence of a longer history for the view due to legal concerns in the United States (See: Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District).|$|E
25|$|The {{world of}} Earthsea {{is one of}} sea and islands: a vast {{archipelago}} of hundreds of islands surrounded by mostly uncharted ocean. Earthsea contains no large continents, with the archipelago resembling Indonesia or the Philippines. The largest island, Havnor, at approximately 380 miles across, {{is about the size}} of Great Britain. The cultures of Earthsea are not direct analogues of those <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world,</b> but are literate non-industrial civilizations. Technologically, Earthsea is an early Iron Age society, with bronze used in places where iron is scarce. Weapons also include the use of wood and other hard but easily crafted metals. The overall climate of Earthsea is temperate, comparable to the mid-latitudes (over a distance of about 1800 miles) of the Northern hemisphere. There is a yearly transition from warm summers to cold and snowy winters, especially in northern islands like Gont and Osskil. In the southern regions of Earthsea it can be much warmer.|$|E

500|$|Burton was {{impressed}} with Daniel Waters' work on Heathers; Burton originally brought Waters aboard on a sequel to Beetlejuice. Warner Bros. then granted Burton {{a large amount of}} creative control. Denise Di Novi and Burton became the film's producers. The first film's producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber became executive producers, joining Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan. Dissatisfied with the Hamm script, Burton commissioned a rewrite from Waters. Waters [...] "came up with a social satire that had an evil mogul backing a bid for the Mayor's office by the Penguin", Waters reported. [...] "I wanted to show that the true villains <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> don't necessarily wear costumes." [...] The subplot of Penguin running for Mayor came from the 1960s TV series episodes [...] "Hizzoner the Penguin" [...] and [...] "Dizzoner the Penguin". Waters wrote a total of five drafts.|$|E

Scott of The New York Times called Ratatouille [...] "a nearly {{flawless}} {{piece of}} popular art, {{as well as}} one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film"; echoing the character Anton Ego in the film, he ended his review with a simple [...] "thank you" [...] to the creators of the film. Wally Hammond of Time Out gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon." [...] Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Brad Bird's second collaboration with Pixar is more ambitious and meditative than his Oscar-winning The Incredibles." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak up on you. And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect compliment to a delicious meal." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "For parents looking to spend time in a theater with their kids or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story, it's very much <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> but it never goes for the cheap, easy gag." [...] Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients – abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication – to produce a warm and irresistible concoction." ...|$|E

2500|$|The result, Schiller contends, is that naturalism cannot {{make sense}} of the [...] "higher" [...] aspects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> (freewill, consciousness, God, purpose, universals), while {{abstract}} metaphysics cannot {{make sense of}} the [...] "lower" [...] aspects <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> (the imperfect, change, physicality). In each case we are unable to guide our moral and epistemological [...] "lower" [...] lives to the achievement of life's [...] "higher" [...] ends, ultimately leading to scepticism on both fronts. For knowledge and morality to be possible, both the world's lower and higher elements must be real; e.g. we need universals (a higher) to make knowledge of particulars (a lower) possible. This would lead Schiller to argue for what he at the time called a [...] "concrete metaphysics", but would later call [...] "humanism".|$|E

5000|$|According to Plato, Socrates {{postulated}} a {{world of}} ideal Forms, which he admitted were impossible to know.

2500|$|In {{making the}} case that the naturalist method also results in an {{epistemological}} and moral scepticism, Schiller looks to show this method's inadequacy at moving from the cold, lifeless lower world of atoms to the higher world of ethics, meanings, and minds. As with abstract metaphysics, Schiller attacks naturalism on many fronts: (1) the naturalist method is unable to reduce universals to particulars, (2) the naturalist method is unable to reduce freewill to determinist movements, (3) the naturalist method is unable to reduce emergent properties like consciousness to brain activity, (4) the naturalist method is unable to reduce God into a pantheism, and so on. Just as the abstract method cannot find a place for the lower elements <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> inside the higher, the naturalist method cannot find a place for the higher elements <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>world</b> inside the lower. In a reversal of abstract metaphysics, naturalism denies the reality of the higher elements to save the lower. Schiller uses the term [...] "pseudo-metaphysical" [...] here instead of naturalism—as he sometimes does—because he is accusing these naturalist philosophers of trying to solve metaphysical problems while sticking to the non-metaphysical [...] "lower" [...] aspects of the world (i.e. without engaging in real metaphysics): ...|$|E

Many traditional cultures have myths about the end of their world or civilization; however, these myths do not succeed [...] "in paralysing either Life or Culture". These traditional cultures emphasize cyclic time and, therefore, the inevitable rise of a new world or civilization on the ruins of the old. Thus, they feel comforted even in contemplating the end times.|$|E
