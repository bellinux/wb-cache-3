5000|$|A {{demand draft}} {{can also be}} {{compared}} to a cheque. However, demand drafts are difficult to countermand. Demand drafts can only be made payable to a specified party, also known as pay to <b>order.</b> But, <b>cheques</b> can also be made payable to the bearer. Demand drafts are orders of payment by a bank to another bank, whereas <b>cheques</b> are <b>orders</b> of payment from an account holder to the bank.|$|R

Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment <b>orders,</b> like <b>cheques,</b> have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based.

40|$|The Backus-Gilbert {{inversion}} technique {{was applied to}} scattering data and calculated examples were given to ascertain its ability to recover the aerosol properties with no a-priori assumptions. In <b>order</b> to <b>cheque</b> this inversion procedure {{as well as other}} techniques (such as Daves' and Herman's et al.), a controlled experiment was performed. The experiment dealt with spherical particles the Mie scattering curves of which was measured by use of a dye-laser. These curves were used to accurately determine the refractive index of the particles. Mixtures of three different known sizes were then prepared and the scattering intensity vs. wavelength was measured at 90 deg scattering angle. The mixtures contained also various known relative concentrations of the three sizes. The analysis of the measured results will be shown and discussed...|$|R

The types of financial transactions which a customer may transact through online banking {{are determined by the}} financial institution, but usually includes obtaining account balances, a list of the recent transactions, electronic bill payments and funds transfers between a customer's or another's accounts. Most banks also enable a customer to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software. The facility may also enable the customer to <b>order</b> a <b>cheque</b> book, statements, report loss of credit cards, stop payment on a cheque, advise change of address and other routine actions.|$|R

30|$|In {{the period}} of September 2009 to September 2010, two of my colleagues studied the {{influence}} of a number of parameters (depth, temperature, salinity and illumination) on size, growth condition, diet and attachment via development of byssal threads (Grutters and Verhofstad 2010). Bivalves have survived a long history from about 510 million years ago to present. This means that it has been adapted to geologically and climate-changing conditions, which might be reflected in the evolution of their proteome. For this reason, the present study was started in order to see whether the presence of certain proteins might unveil certain metabolic systems in this aquatic animal. Almost simultaneously, an article from Riva et al. (2012) did so in relation to the effect of a pollutant (triclosan) on the metabolism of Dreissena polymorpha with emphasis on gills. In the same year, Fields et al. (2012) and Tomanek et al. (2012) published a study on the effect of temperature and hyposalinity on protein expression in the gills of the Mytilidae Mytilus galloprovincialis and Mytilus trossulus. In addition, we were interested in comparing amino acid sequences of our mussel with animals stemming from later periods of life in <b>order</b> to <b>cheque</b> the phylogenetic developments that had taken place meanwhile.|$|R
50|$|Insurance is {{restricted}} to registered member institutions, and covers only the first $100,000 in very specific categories of accounts, such as savings accounts and chequing accounts, guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) and other term deposits with an original term to maturity of five years or less, money <b>orders,</b> travellers' <b>cheques</b> and bank drafts issued by CDIC members and cheques certified by CDIC members, and debentures issued by loan companies that are CDIC members. Credit unions and Quebec and New Brunswick's caisses populaires are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance plans, which generally follow the federal model. Deposits in foreign currencies are not insured, even when held by a registered CDIC financial institution. Guaranteed Investment Certificates with a term longer than 5 years are also not insured. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada are not covered. Some funds in Registered Retirement Savings Plans or Registered Retirement Income Funds at a bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like debentures issued by government or corporations. The general principle is to cover reasonable deposits and savings, but not deposits deliberately positioned to take risks for gain, such as mutual funds or stocks.|$|R

The inquiry was led by Alan Bell, a resident magistrate, {{as part of his}} broader, mostly secret, search for Dáil funds. The banks' officials were reluctant to cooperate.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{three types of}} {{negotiable}} instruments payable on demand which are issued, stamped or signed by banks prior to their collection and payment, and used as mechanisms for the transmission of funds.

The article {{is concerned with the}} binding effect, or the irrevocability, of the bank 2 ̆ 7 s obligation on these instruments under the law of bills and notes. It concludes that (1) the issuer of the bank draft is liable as a drawer, and under some circumstances, also as a maker or acceptor, that (2) cheque certification amounts to the acceptance of the cheque, and that (3) imprinting the amount on a personal money order ought to be treated like cheque certification.

Gold and silver bullion {{as well as}} cash were carried in large amounts between the mint and banks and Express messengers were armed for security. Small business money shipments and valuables such as jewellery were routinely handled in small packets.

Canadian Express Cartage Department was formed in March 1937 to handle pickup and delivery of most express shipments including less-than-carload freight.

Express routes using highway trucks beginning in November 1945 in southern Ontario and Alberta co-ordinated railway and highway service expanded service to better serve smaller locations especially on branchlines. Trucking operations would go on to expand across Canada making it an important transport provider for small shipments.

He is told this is selling well, or that is much admired. Heaven defend that he should admire on his own account! He orders the stock urn or the stock slab because it is large and sufficiently expensive for his means and sorrow, and because he knows of nothing better. So we mourn as the stonemason decrees, or after the example and pattern of the Smiths next door. But some day it will dawn upon us that a little thought and a search after beauty are far more becoming than an <b>order</b> and a <b>cheque</b> to the nearest advertising tradesman.

40|$|A bank is a {{financial}} institution that provides banking and other financial services to their customers. A bank is generally understood as an institution which provides fundamental banking services such as accepting deposits and providing loans. There are also nonbanking institutions that provide certain banking services without meeting the legal definition of a bank. Banks are {{a subset of the}} financial services industry. A banking system also referred as a system provided by the bank which offers cash management services for customers, reporting the transactions of their accounts and portfolios, through out the day. The banking system in India, should not only be hassle free but it should be able to meet the new challenges posed by the technology and any other external and internal factors. For the past three decades, India’s banking system has several outstanding achievements to its credit. The Banks are the main participants of the financial system in India. The Banking sector offers several facilities and opportunities to their customers. All the banks safeguards the money and valuables and provide loans, credit, and payment services, such as checking accounts, money <b>orders,</b> and cashier’s <b>cheques.</b> The banks also offer investment and insurance products. As a variety of models for cooperation and integration among finance industries have emerged, some of the traditional distinctions between banks, insurance companies, and securities firms have diminished. In spite of these changes, banks continue to maintain and perform their primary role—accepting deposits and lending funds from these deposits. Comme...|$|R
