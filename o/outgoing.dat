30|$|A social {{accounting}} matrix is simply {{defined as a}} single-entry accounting system whereby each macroeconomic account is represented by a column for <b>outgoings</b> (payments) and a row for incomings (receipts) (Hayden and Round 1982). It is represented {{in the form of}} a square matrix with rows and columns, which brings together data on production, income generation, consumption, investment and external transaction. In a SAM, incomings are indicated as receipts for the row accounts in which they are located and <b>outgoings</b> are indicated as expenditure for their column accounts. Since all incomings must be, in a SAM, accounted for the <b>outgoings,</b> the total of rows and columns must be equal for each account. Taylor and Adelman (1996) sees the SAM as a tabular presentation of the accounting identities, stating that incomings must be equal to <b>outgoings</b> for all sectors of the economy.|$|R

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; the <b>outgoing</b> X-rays {{have the}} same energy, and thus same wavelength, as the incoming X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from the incoming X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the <b>outgoing</b> beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|At an intersection, the {{incoming}} and <b>outgoing</b> lanes of traffic (including {{the ends of}} pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles) may be represented as the vertices of a graph, placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction. The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an <b>outgoing</b> lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph. For instance, this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an <b>outgoing</b> lane of traffic that both {{belong to the same}} segment of road, representing a U-turn from that segment back to that segment, only if U-turns are allowed at the junction. For a given subset of these edges, the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding. Thus, a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non-interfering subsets, and the book thickness of this graph (with its fixed embedding on the spine) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the line had not been well executed, and maintenance costs were considerable; in addition the three stationary engines were expensive to operate.

The agricultural traffic from Strathmore had not developed as much as had been forecast, so that the lower income and the weekly burden of the <b>outgoings</b> was a serious problem. Operating expenses were high, at 83% of gross revenue; every train required five engines: the three stationary engines and two on the level sections. The <b>outgoings</b> left inadequate funds to service the loan debt.|$|R
