5|$|Due to {{the heavier}} {{concentration}} of Japanese surface combat vessels and their well-positioned logistical base at Simpson Harbor, Rabaul, and their {{victory at the}} Battle of Savo Island in early August, the Japanese had established <b>operational</b> <b>control</b> over the waters around Guadalcanal at night. However, any Japanese ship remaining within range—about —of American aircraft at Henderson Field, during the daylight hours, {{was in danger of}} damaging air attacks. This persisted for the months of August and September, 1942. The presence of Admiral Scott's task force at Cape Esperance represented the U.S. Navy's first major attempt to wrest night time <b>operational</b> <b>control</b> of waters around Guadalcanal away from the Japanese.|$|E
