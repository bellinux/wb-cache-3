50|$|The most virulent {{cork oak}} {{pathogen}} may be Diplodia corticola, a sac fungus which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus Biscogniauxia mediterranea {{is becoming more}} common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the <b>oak</b> pinhole <b>borer</b> (Platypus cylindrus), a species of weevil.|$|R
50|$|The tunnels {{made by the}} <b>oak</b> pinhole <b>borer</b> {{are about}} 1.6 mm in {{diameter}} and do not weaken the timber to any great extent. However, they do spoil the appearance of veneers, and the ambrosia fungus produces black staining. The beetles and larvae continue their tunnelling activities in stacked timber, and although at first they only burrow through the sapwood, later they {{move on to the}} heartwood. Insecticides have no effect on adults and larvae inside their tunnels, but kiln drying of the timber can kill them when the fungus is unable to survive the dessication.|$|R

In situ reference data were incorporated into a machine-learning algorithm that produced a regression-tree model for predicting aboveground woody biomass per segment. Model results on training data appear adequate for prediction purposes (mean error 2. 38 kg/m 2, R 2 = 0. 83).

40|$|We {{allowed the}} <b>oak</b> <b>borer,</b> Platypus quercivorus, to {{construct}} galleries in fresh logs of Pasania edulis in an evergreen broad-leaved forest {{during a period}} from June to December 1997 and counted the number of adults that emerged from each gallery {{in the autumn of}} 1997 and summer of 1998. Attack by this species, namely the start of gallery construction, was observed from early June to early October in 1997. The distribution patterns of entry holes changed from uniform to contagious with the increment of their density. Reproductive success was lower for galleries started after August than those started in June and July, from which new adults emerged in September and October 1997. The galleries started after the end of August did not develop well and failed to produce any new adults. These results suggest that the time of attack is very important for reproductive success of this species and that adults should start gallery construction by the end of July to produce a considerable number of new adult beetles. The construction of galleries by new adults in autumn may contribute little to the population dynamics of this species. ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>oak</b> pinhole <b>borer</b> infests mature trees, favouring stressed, dying or dead {{standing}} trees, fallen {{trees and}} logs; the insects choose a sick or moribund tree, but their activities do not kill trees. Besides oak trees, they can infest other hardwood trees, including beech, sweet chestnut, ash, elm and walnut. The adults can mature {{at any time}} of year but are at their most active from July to September. At this time of year, the male excavates a hole a few centimetres deep. The female goes inside and then emerges, with mating taking place {{on the surface of the}} bark. The female then re-enters the hole and the male follows. The female extends the tunnel further, working radially, and the male pushes the wood fragments out, leaving a pile of frass. This residue is fine and soft which distinguishes it from the more granular, coarser material produced by most wood-boring beetles. The walls of the gallery soon become covered with a layer of ambrosia fungi, spores having been introduced on the body surface of the beetles. This symbiotic fungus is only found in the galleries made by ambrosia beetles and provides them and their larvae with nourishment; they do not feed on the wood.|$|R
50|$|The last Lord of Castle Wertenstein died in 1745. In {{the years}} that {{followed}} (1748 to 1754), his offspring sold the lordship to Tholey Abbey, which thus acquired the tithing rights. Moreover, the Abbey exercised low jurisdiction, while high jurisdiction, as had been so before, lay with the Duke of Lorraine. Appeals, therefore, had to be heard in Lorraine’s capital, Nancy. In 1766, the last Duke of Lorraine died, and France came into the Duke’s inheritance. Only a few years later, though, the Duke of Zweibrücken brokered a deal with France whereby Zweibrücken traded certain places in Alsace for the villages of Freisen, Heimbach, Weiersbach, Bleiderdingen and Leitzweiler. The Duke thereby managed to fill some of the territorial gaps in his holdings in 1783.In November 1792, three years after the French Revolution, French Revolutionary troops descended on the Leitzweiler area. The French burnt Leitzweiler down, but this might have been a case of “mistaken identity”. It seems that the French soldiers were to have burnt Eitzweiler, another village a few kilometres away, today a constituent community of Freisen in the Saarland. To offset Leitzweiler’s loss, Eitzweiler was ordered to deliver to Leitzweiler oakwood so that the mistakenly burnt village could rise from its ashes. This, however, was not what Leitzweiler got. Instead, the wood delivered to the village was ash, which was not as popular as <b>oak,</b> for house <b>borers</b> found it quite appetizing. With the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797, the Rhine’s left bank was ceded to France. All lordly holdings were seized by the state and French law was imposed. Leitzweiler was part of the Department of Sarre and in the canton of Birkenfeld.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} within-tree {{population density}} {{of a new}} invasive species in southern California, the goldspotted <b>oak</b> <b>borer,</b> Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), with respect to host species and the community of other borers present. We measured emergence hole densities of A. auroguttatus and other borers on the lower stem (bole) of naïve oaks at 18 sites in southern California and on co-evolved oaks at seven sites in southeastern Arizona. We sampled recently dead oaks {{in an effort to}} quantify the community of primary and secondary borers associated with mortality—species that were likely to interact with A. auroguttatus. Red oaks (Section Lobatae) produced greater densities of A. auroguttatus than white oaks (Section Quercus). On red oaks, A. auroguttatus significantly outnumbered native borers in California (mean ± SE of 9. 6 ± 0. 7 versus 4. 5 ± 0. 6 emergence holes per 0. 09 m 2 of bark surface), yet {{this was not the case}} in Arizona (0. 9 ± 0. 2 versus 1. 1 ± 0. 2 emergence holes per 0. 09 m 2). In California, a species that is taxonomically intermediate between red and white oaks, Quercus chrysolepis (Section Protobalanus), exhibited similar A. auroguttatus emergence densities compared with a co-occurring red oak, Q. kelloggii. As an invasive species in California, A. auroguttatus may affect the community of native borers (mainly Buprestidae and Cerambycidae) that feed on the lower boles of oaks, although it remains unclear whether its impact will be positive or negative...|$|E
40|$|In the Ozark Mountains of the U. S. A., the red <b>oak</b> <b>borer</b> Enaphalodes rufulus {{contributes}} {{to the destruction of}} red oaks. To understand nutrient digestion in E. rufulus larvae, digestive proteinases are compared in both larvae fed heartwood phloem and those transferred to artificial diet. The pH of gut extracts is approximately 6. 3 in the midgut and foregut and decreases to 5. 5 in the hindgut region. The hydrolysis of casein by midgut extracts from E. rufulus larvae fed either artificial diet or phloem from tree sections increases in buffers greater than pH 6. 19, with maximum hydrolysis being observed at pH 10. 1. Casein zymogram analysis reveals two major proteinase activities in larval midgut extracts of diet-fed larvae, with molecular masses of approximately 25 and 40 – 60 kDa, whereas phloem-fed larvae have proteinase activities corresponding to 40, 45, 60, 80 and 3 ̆e 100 kDa. Substrate analysis indicates at least one major trypsin-like activity in both gut extracts with a molecular mass of 3 ̆e 100 kDa, but two chymotrypsin-like activities of approximately 25 and 3 ̆e 200 kDa are found only in diet-fed larvae. Inhibitors of serine proteinases are most effective in reducing the general proteolytic activity of midgut extracts from larvae fed either food source. The data indicate that serine proteinase inhibitors have the potential to reduce E. rufulus larval damage to oaks. In particular, transgenic technologies incoporating trypsin inhibitors may be effective in reducing protein digestion in phloem-feeding larvae...|$|E

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Geography. Currently, oak decline and the red <b>oak</b> <b>borer</b> are affecting large portions of the Missouri Ozarks. The challenge to resource managers is that once the decline is visible on the ground, the forest stand is beyond treatment and must be salvage logged. Local forest resource managers are interested in a remote sensing technique that is capable of detecting subtle changes in forest health, so that remediation measures can be applied before the stand is totally lost. Therefore, the goal of this project is to determine the ability of the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) to detect forest change in the Mark Twain National Forest using only the wetness component (TCW) and compare this technique to the more common Short wave-infrared/Near-infrared (SWIR/NIR) ratio technique used extensively in the eastern United States for forest change detection. This project tested the usefulness of this easy and inexpensive technique by applying it to the Missouri Ozark forest landscape in order to detect changes in forest biomass, characterize the structure of forest change patches, and assess contrasting rates of change on public and privately owned forests. This study found that the TCW detected biomass decrease as well as the SWIR/NIR ratio, forest change patch shapes worked well in identifying anthropogenic change, and that rates of biomass change were higher on private lands than public lands...|$|E
40|$|The goldspotted <b>oak</b> <b>borer,</b> Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer, (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) is an {{invasive}} wood-boring beetle that aggressively attacks native {{oak trees}} in southern California, U. S. A. Native to Arizona, this beetle was initially {{detected in the}} Cleveland National Forest, San Diego County, California in 2004, but was likely introduced accidentally several years earlier through movement of infested oak firewood. Prior to its introduction and subsequent invasiveness in southern California, A. auroguttatus was rarely collected and very little information was known about this insect. The continuing ecological and economical damage caused by A. auroguttatus in southern California has made {{the development of a}} classical biological control program for this invasive pest a high priority. However, the implementation of an effective classical biological control program for any invasive species requires the knowledge of several critical components such as the pest's biology, area of origin, natural enemies (in the home and introduced range), and life history traits. Consequently, in order to acquire the basic information needed to initiate a classical biological control program for A. auroguttatus in California, this dissertation research had the following four objectives: 1) determine the fecundity and longevity of A. auroguttatus under varying diet and mating treatments, 2) assess the dispersal capabilities of A. auroguttatus adults in the laboratory using computerized flight mills, 3) use molecular methods to identify the area of origin for the California population of A. auroguttatus, and 4) survey for natural enemies of this beetle by deploying A. auroguttatus egg masses into the native and introduced range. Findings of this work showed that a carbohydrate-enriched diet increased longevity and fecundity, and the nutritional status and body size of A. auroguttatus adults had a significant influence on overall flight performance. The area of origin was not determined conclusively, although data suggests the Dragoon Mountains in Cochise Co., Arizona as a possible source for the California population of A. auroguttatus. Additionally, the first known egg parasitoid of A. auroguttatus was collected in AZ, and identified as Trichogramma sp. using molecular techniques. The results of this dissertation research will further the management of A. auroguttatus in southern California...|$|E
