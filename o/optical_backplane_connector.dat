In this way, slow electronic chips can be coor-dinated to generate a high aggregated bandwidth to relieve wiring congestion. Both nonreturn-to-zero and return-to-zero signaling modes based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser sources and pulse lasers are independently employed to implement 2. 5 - and 15 -Gb/s operations.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of supercomputers, routers, and switches are envisioned to have hundreds and thousands of optical interconnects among components. An optical interconnect attains a bandwidth-distance product as high as 90 GHz. km, about 200 times higher than can be attained by a copper interconnect. But defects (such as dust or scratches) as small as 1 micron on the connector endfaces can seriously degrade performance. Therefore, for every mate and de-mate, optical connectors must be inspected to ensure high performance data transmission capabilities. The tedious and time consuming task of manually inspecting each connector {{is one of the}} barriers to adoption of optics in the backplanes of large card-based machines. This thesis provides a framework and method for in-situ automatic inspection of <b>backplane</b> <b>optical</b> <b>connectors.</b> We develop an inspection system that fits into the envelope of a single daughter card, moves a custom microscope objective in three degrees of freedom to image the connector endfaces, and detects and classifies defects with major diameter of one micron or larger. The inspection machine mounts to the backplane {{in the same manner as}} a daughter card, and positions the microscope with better than 0. 2 micron resolution and 15 micron repeatability in three degrees of freedom. Despite tight packaging constraints, the ultra-long working distance custom microscope objective attains 1 micron Rayleigh resolution via deconvolution. Several images taken at different exposures and focus settings are fused to extend the imaging sensor's limited dynamic range and depth of field. A set of machine-vision algorithms are developed to process the resulting image and detect and classify the fiber core, cladding and their defects. by Andrew K. Wilson. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Optical {{interconnects}} play a {{key role}} in the implementation of high-speed short-reach communication links within high-performance electronic systems. Multimode polymer waveguides in particular are strong candidates for use in passive <b>optical</b> <b>backplanes</b> as they can be cost-effectively integrated onto standard PCBs. Various <b>optical</b> <b>backplanes</b> using this technology and featuring a large number of multimode polymer waveguide components have been recently demonstrated. The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex waveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (>= 25 Gb/s) due to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch conditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the highly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology. In this paper therefore, we present thorough loss and bandwidth studies on siloxane-based multimode waveguides and waveguide components (i. e. bends and crossings) that enable the implementation of passive <b>optical</b> <b>backplanes.</b> The performance of these components is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for different waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication. Useful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for each waveguide type. It is shown that the choice of waveguide parameters depends on the particular waveguide layout, assumed launch conditions and desired link bandwidth. As an application of these studies, the obtained results are employed to optimise the loss performance of a 10 -card shuffle router and enable >= 40 Gb/s data transmission.

40|$|The use of {{existing}} packaging techniques for microelectronics are studied {{in terms of}} their applicability to the packaging of optoelectronic device arrays for photonic inter-connect applications. In particular, the packaging of smart pixel arrays for free-space <b>optical</b> <b>backplanes</b> is quantitatively explored. This assessment is made from three basic perspectives: thermal management capabilities, connectivity and bandwidth, and alignment to a free-space optical system. In the assessment, a smart pixel array design space analysis is derived which shows that, by constraining the smart pixel array characteristics, the use {{of existing}} packaging technologies is possible. This leads to the derivation of expressions which relate both system and smart pixel array parameters to representative packaging parameters. It is seen in the analysis that while the thermal management imposes constraints on the window size, smart pixel density and size, the alignment imposes constraints mostly on the window size. The architectural characteristics of the smart pixel array are mostly affected by the connectivity and bandwidth of the packaging technology.
