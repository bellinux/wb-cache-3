5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished {{spheres of}} silicon {{with a mass}} of one kilogram. Spheres are used to simplify the measurement of the size (and hence the density) and to minimize {{the effect of the}} <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> that inevitably forms on the surface.

5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, lanthanum {{has the largest}} atomic radius of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as calcium oxide. A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective <b>oxide</b> <b>coating</b> like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. Lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. Lanthanum is the strongest and hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E

40|$|Fiber Fabry-Perot Interferometers (FFPI) are {{optical sensors}} {{which can be}} used to measure changes in stress or temperature, but efforts {{continue}} to improve them. Calculations show that the response can be dramatically altered with a gain inducing medium in the cavity. In order to induce gain, a highly doped Erbium (Er) fiber is incorporated in the FFPI. A pump wavelength of 1480 nm is used with a wavelength near 1550 nm. The pump must be at a significantly higher power level than the signal for gain. In order to correctly interpret responses, it is necessary to characterize the response of the measurement equipment. This includes everything from the laser and photodetector to system losses and the titanium <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> fibers. Fabrication of FFPIs involves fusing titanium <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> fibers to standard single mode fibers. Directly fusing an Er - doped fiber to a titanium <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> fibers was not possible because of incompatible splice conditions required in each case. Instead, an intermediate standard single mode fiber was spliced between them. This lengthened the cavity. Experimental results from the Er - doped Fiber Fabry-Perot Interferometer verified the hypothesis that improvements are obtainable. Overall, the measurements showed a 1. 3 dB improvement in the maximum-to-minimum Insertion Loss Ratio...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic {{contaminated}} groundwater is {{prevalent in}} a number of countries around the world, most notably West Bengal, Bangladesh and now the Terai region of Nepal. Wide public awareness of the contamination was not until the 1990 s, from years to several decades after tubewells were installed to extract groundwater for drinking water. Now, millions of people have arsenic poisoning which causes serious health effects such as arsenicosis, skin and liver cancer, circulatory disorder and hyperpigmentation. For the past three years, the MIT Nepal Water Project has been investigating arsenic contaminated tubewells in Nepal, and has begun to evaluate point-of-use arsenic removal technologies. These technologies must meet certain evaluation criteria: Effective removal of effective removal of total arsenic (As (III) + As (V)), minimally, below the Interim Nepali Standard of 50 [mu]/L; possibility of local manufacture with locally available materials; affordable to the Nepali citizens affected by arsenic contamination; socially acceptable in terms of maintenance, operation and water demand. The 2001 - 2002 MIT Nepal Project investigated three new technologies which might meet these criteria. Iron <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> sand is one of these technologies. Iron oxides are known to adsorb arsenic. Previous studies of arsenic and metal adsorption onto iron <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> sand prompted this investigation. Based on the methods utilized in these prior studies, the author produced seven different iron <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> sands, varying concentration of ferric nitrate used, coating mixture, and drying temperature. The arsenic removal capability of these sands was tested in Parasi, Nepal, Pepperell, Massachusetts and Salem, New Hampshire. Percent total arsenic removal varied from 11 - 99 %. Considering the evaluation criteria such as arsenic removal performance, cost, availability of materials, and local production, iron <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> sand technology successfully meets most or all of these requirements. However, in this study, social acceptability has not been determined. Detailed testing and evaluation of the iron oxide properties, as well as sufficient resources allocated to production of the media, is crucial before iron <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> sand technology could be implemented for point-of-use arsenic removal in Nepal or other developing countries. The author also produced a digitized map representing the extent of arsenic contamination in the Terai using paper maps as a base. by Barika R. Poole. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|The use of <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> sand {{filtration}} {{as an alternative}} to current costly methods for water treatment has been reviewed. The paper highlights the importance of iron, aluminium and manganese <b>oxides,</b> including sand <b>coated</b> with these <b>oxides,</b> for removal of heavy metals and other impurities from water. The literature review showed that <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> sand is able to remove heavy metals (both anions and cations) and other impurities (e. g. natural organic matter, microorganisms, sulphate, manganese, etc.) from surface water or groundwater. in this review an extensive list of the use of oxide (iron, aluminium and manganese) coated sand in water treatment by adsorption and filtration processes has been compiled to provide a summary of available information. The information available on the capacity of coated sand for pollutant uptake is very scarce, however some data on the capacity of coated sand for heavy metals uptake have been compiled and presented.

40|$|Reliability of {{electronic}} packages {{is a great}} concern to packaging design engineers. During its design life, packages experience {{a wide range of}} temperature variations. The mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between the different layers in the packages can generate high interfacial stresses due to these thermal loading. If these stresses exceed the limiting value, delamination will occur. The present study is focused on the reliability of the epoxy molding compound (EMC) and cuprous <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> copper substrate. In order to verify whether the interfacial adhesion is dominant by the content of cuprous oxide on the cooper substrate, two models were built to simulate the thermal cycling test with a constant cuprous oxide and a changing content of cuprous oxide on the copper substrate. The thermal cycling test was conducted with a given thermal profile. The adhesion strength between EMC and cuprous <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> copper substrate at different thermal cycles was evaluated using the button shear test (BST). A simple molecular model of a bi-material system, which consists of EMC and cuprous <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> copper substrate, was built to evaluate the interfacial energy of the Cu-EMC system. In order to dramatically reduce the computational time, the system was modeled with a limited number of atoms. A preset strain was applied to the model representing a forcing step as the EMC material was pulled away from the copper substrate. Equilibration was conducted to relax the whole system before the next strain step proceeded. The procedure was repeated using different strains. The interfacial energy at different thermal cycles was evaluated. The variation of the interfacial energy indicated the change in the adhesion strength between EMC and cuprous <b>oxide</b> <b>coated</b> copper during the thermal cycling test. The simulation results revealed that the cuprous oxide content in the copper substrate had a large effect on the adhesion between EMC and copper, which is consistent with the experimental observation. © 2005 IEEE...|$|R
