25|$|The X-ring {{chain is}} {{developed}} from O-ring chain {{which in turn}} is developed from non O-ring chain. While the regular O-ring chain has high durability, it also has more friction(compared to other types of roller chain) due to distortion of the O-ring due to pressure from the inner and outer chain plates. This results in loss of power in the transmission. Therefore, X-ring chain was developed by replacing <b>O-ring</b> <b>seal</b> with X-ring seal which increased durability and greatly reduced friction.|$|E
25|$|The DIN fitting {{is a type}} {{of direct}} {{screw-in}} connection to the cylinder. The DIN system is less common worldwide, but has the advantage of withstanding greater pressure, up to 300 bar, allowing use of high-pressure steel cylinders. They are less susceptible to blowing the <b>O-ring</b> <b>seal</b> if banged against something while in use. DIN fittings are the standard in much of Europe and are available in most countries. The DIN fitting is considered more secure and therefore safer by many technical divers.|$|E

40|$|Assembly joints {{of modern}} solid-rocket motor cases are usually <b>sealed</b> with {{conventional}} <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> The 5500 F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of insulation and by special compounds that fill assembly split-lines in the insulation. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings {{of the space shuttle}} solid-rocket nozzle-assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. Thus, solid-rocket motor manufacturer Thiokol approached the NASA Lewis Research Center about the possibility of applying Lewis braided-fiber preform seal as a thermal barrier to protect the <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> This thermal barrier would be placed upstream of the primary O-rings in the nozzle-to-case joints to prevent hot gases from impinging on the <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals</b> (see the following illustration). The illustration also shows joints 1 through 5, which are potential sites where the thermal barrier could be used...|$|R

40|$|A {{thermal barrier}} for {{extremely}} high temperature applications {{consists of a}} carbon fiber core and one or more layers of braided carbon fibers surrounding the core. The thermal barrier is preferably a large diameter ring, having a relatively small cross-section. The thermal barrier is particularly suited for use {{as part of a}} joint structure in solid rocket motor casings to protect low temperature elements such as the primary and secondary elastomeric <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals</b> therein from high temperature gases of the rocket motor. The thermal barrier exhibits adequate porosity to allow pressure to reach the radially outward disposed <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals</b> allowing them to seat and perform the primary sealing function. The thermal barrier is disposed in a cavity or groove in the casing joint, between the hot propulsion gases interior of the rocket motor and primary and secondary <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> The characteristics of the thermal barrier may be enhanced in different applications by the inclusion of certain compounds in the casing joint, by the inclusion of RTV sealant or similar materials {{at the site of the}} thermal barrier, and/or by the incorporation of a metal core or plurality of metal braids within the carbon braid in the thermal barrier structure...|$|R
40|$|This investigative program {{examines}} {{leakage testing}} of elastomeric <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals</b> for a solid rocket casing and provides direction towards an improved nondestructive postassembly test. It also details test {{equipment for the}} Space Shuttle systems solid rocket boosters (SRB). The results are useful to designers of hardware for pressure containment vessels which use <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> Using several subscale seal and groove configuration test fixtures equipped with either two or three <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals</b> in series, seal integrity is investigated with both a pressure decay and flowmeter methods. Both types of test equipment adequately detect the practical range of expected seal leak rates of 1 to 0. 0001 sccs. The flowmeter leak test equipment appears to reduce testing time substantially. Limited seal leakage testing is performed on full-sized rocket motor segment seals, a pre-Challenger short stack, providing comparison of bore seals to test specimen bore and face seals. The conclusions are that seal reliability, verified via a performance pressure test, can be affected by temperature, quantity of grease, test pressure, and seal pressure load direction. Potential seal failure scenarios including contamination, seal damage, and sealing surface damage are discussed. Recommendations are made for an improved test procedure...|$|R

40|$|Large {{solid rocket}} motors, as {{found on the}} Space Shuttle, are {{fabricated}} in segments for manufacturing considerations, bolted together, and sealed using conventional Viton <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> Similarly the nine large solid rocket motor nozzles are assembled from several different segments, bolted together, and sealed at six joint locations using conventional <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> The 5500 F combustion gases are generally kept a safe distance away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic or rubber insulation. Joint-fill compounds, including RTV (room temperature vulcanized compound) and polysulfide filler, are used to fill the joints in the insulation to prevent a direct flow-path to the O-rings. Normally these two stages of protection are enough to prevent a direct flow-path of the 900 -psi hot gases from reaching the temperature-sensitive <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> However, in the current design 1 out of 15 Space Shuttle solid rocket motors experience hot gas effects on the Joint 6 wiper (sacrificial) O-rings. Also worrisome {{is the fact that}} joints have experienced heat effects on materials between the RTV and the O-rings, and in two cases O-rings have experienced heat effects. These conditions lead to extensive reviews of the post-flight conditions as part of the effort to monitor flight safety. We have developed a braided carbon fiber thermal barrier to replace the joint fill compounds in the Space Shuttle solid rocket motor nozzles to reduce the incoming 5500 F combustion gas temperature and permit only cool (approximately 100 F) gas to reach the temperature-sensitive <b>O-ring</b> <b>seals.</b> Implementation of this thermal barrier provides more robust, consistent operation with shorter turn around times between Shuttle launches...|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} {{inspection system}} has been developed to inspect the <b>o-ring</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces on the Space Shuttle reusable solid rocket motor (RSRM) case segment joints. A laser digitizing system is {{used to create a}} three dimensional map of the <b>o-ring</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces. This data is analyzed for any irregularities, which are noted for further inspection and disposition. This paper describes both the hardware and the software used to gather data as well as the methods developed to analyze the data. The RSRM is assembled from four casting segments. Each of the field joints between these segments is <b>sealed</b> with three <b>o-rings.</b> These o-rings are critical for the proper operation of the motor. After launch the booster segments are recovered and reused. As part of the refurbishment process the <b>o-ring</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces are inspected for any irregularities. The system developed uses a combination of commercial and customized hardware and software. The system uses two computer systems in a real time environment to control a laser, an XYZ precision table, and case rotation and position information. The system is capable of inspecting both the tang end and the clevis end of the RSRM field joint. The o-ring grooves and flat sealing surfaces are inspected...|$|R
