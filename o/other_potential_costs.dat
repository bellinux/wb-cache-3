50|$|According to the National Fisheries Conservation Center, in May 1994 {{and again}} in August 1995, {{widespread}} salmon fishery closures in Washington, Oregon, and Northern California resulted in the declaration of a fishery resource disaster declaration by the Secretary of Commerce. An estimated 8,000 commercial fisherman were affected by the closures. Following the declaration $25 million in economic aid, of which $13.6 million was allocated to the State of Washington, was provided via the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan. The funds supported habitat restoration, data collection and salmon license buyback programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided and additional $10 million in disaster unemployment assistance, with $6.4 million of those funds being allocated to Washington. The Rural Development Administration provided $3 million in grants to finance small business development and the Small Business Administration made low-interest loans and debt-restructuring available. All costs that could potentially continue to increase as global warming further degrade existing commercial salmon fisheries. <b>Other</b> <b>potential</b> <b>costs</b> may include {{an increase in the}} amount of government sponsored buyback programs. These programs are designed to ease fishing pressure on declining stocks while providing financial assistance to those individuals who choose to exit the fishery. Buybacks take the form of Vessel Buyback Programs and License Retirement Programs. The average cost of a license or vessel purchased fewer than one of these plans is $10,000 for salmon and small vessel fleets but can rise as high as $10 million for a factory trawler such as those used further north in the Bering Sea. Nationally, these programs have totaled $160 million nationally since 1976.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{expansion}} of existing {{and the introduction of}} new guarantees for financial institutions has been a key element of the policy response to the recent financial crisis. Essentially, the government expanded its role as the provider of the safety net for banks by adopting the function of a guarantor of last resort. Among the various policy response measures, the expansion of guarantees has the benefit of entailing lower upfront fiscal costs relative to other options. Guarantees are not without cost however. Even if they do not generate significant upfront fiscal costs, they create contingent fiscal liabilities. <b>Other</b> <b>potential</b> <b>costs</b> include those arising from distortions to competition and incentives (moral hazard). For example, there may be a perception that similar guarantees will always be made available at low costs. The fact that the expansion of guarantees has not been as closely co-ordinated across borders as might have been desired has resulted in additional costs. To avoid additional costs arising fro...|$|E

40|$|Credit default swaps (CDSs) are {{derivative}} {{contracts that}} allow agents {{to shift the}} risk of default on an underlying credit from a credit protection buyer to a credit protection seller. Like other derivatives they are standardised relative to the underlying cash markets {{and in this way}} can help promote market liquidity. This in turn can facilitate risk shifting and price discovery. In this way they may lead to accurate pricing of credit risk and ultimately to the reduced costs of borrowing. However, like other derivatives it is possible that CDS contracts could play a part in market manipulations, especially when the underlying cash market is not transparent. This is a potential cost of CDS trading that should be weighed against potential benefi ts of liquidity, risk shifting and price discovery. We discuss the balance of these trade-offs in the context of singlename corporate CDSs, index CDSs, sovereign CDSs and CDSs on structured credit product tranches. We also discuss <b>other</b> <b>potential</b> <b>costs</b> of CDS trading including that they “make selling short too cheap ” and that they may create market instability by facilitating speculative attacks...|$|E
40|$|The {{costs of}} singing in birds are poorly understood. One {{potential}} type of cost is a metabolic cost of singing. Previous studies have measured short-term changes in oxygen consumption associated with bouts of vocalizations, with equivocal results. In this study, I used {{an alternative approach}} to measuring the metabolic cost of singing, by measuring overnight loss of body mass, in male common nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, singing at night at different rates. Nightingales were shown not to forage at night. They reached a higher mass at dusk prior to singing more at night, and lost more mass overnight when dusk mass and overnight song rate were high. These results show that singing at night is associated with increased overnight consumption of body reserves, which represents a significant metabolic cost of singing at night. However, the correlation between dusk mass and overnight song rate {{makes it impossible to}} determine whether these costs arise from the energetic costs of the singing itself, or from the metabolic costs of the additional body reserves laid down at dusk on nights when song rate was high. There are also likely to be costs associated with accumulating and carrying these extra body reserves during daylight, as well as <b>other</b> <b>potential</b> <b>costs</b> of singing such as an increased risk of predation. These results are consistent with those models of signalling in biology that predict or assume that honest signals are costly. Copyright 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} a {{general equilibrium model}} of firm formation in which organization is endogenous. Incentive-based wealth effects arises from lower bounds on wealth and utility, and these affect {{the way in which}} different organizational forms can divide the proceeds of production. Individuals may choose between organizaing their firms as hierarchies or as partnerships; these decisions are mediated by agency costs in both labor and financial markets. The type of organization which emerges depends on the distribution of wealth and need not be surplus maximizing: the same output could be produced with less labor if some firms were forced to reorganize from their equilibrium form. This result suggests that instead of serving to provide incentives efficiently, organizations may sometimes act to transfer surplus from some agents to <b>others,</b> at <b>potential</b> social <b>cost.</b> ...|$|R

Moreover, there are associated costs and benefits to poaching. Schmitt and Buss (2001) investigated the <b>potential</b> <b>costs</b> and benefits across sexes in relation to human mate poaching. Costs for women engaging in poaching behaviours include unwanted pregnancy, transmitted infection and diseases and insecurity about provisions (shelter, food, financial security). However, the associated benefits include, emotional support that she may not be receiving from her current partner and access to 'good genes' that the male possesses such as facial symmetry. <b>Potential</b> <b>costs</b> for males engaging in mate poaching can include resource depletion, violence and aggression from the females current partner who take part in mate guarding behaviours (behaviours used to protect their mate from <b>other</b> <b>potential</b> males or females).

40|$|Background. The Expanded Program on Immunization Contact Method (EPI-CM) is a {{proposed}} monitoring and program management tool for developing countries. The method involves health workers tallying {{responses to questions}} about health behaviors during routine immunizations and providing targeted counseling. We evaluated whether asking caretakers about health behaviors during EPI visits led to changes in those behaviors. Methods. We worked in 2 districts in Mali: an intervention district where during immunization visits workers asked about 4 health behaviors related to bed net use, fever, respiratory disease, and diarrhea, and a control district where workers conducted routine immunization activities without health behavior questions. To evaluate the effect of EPI-CM, we conducted a cross-sectional household survey at baseline and 1 year postintervention. We used multivariate logistic regression to compare between districts the change over 1 year in 4 health behaviors: use of insecticide-treated nets, appropriate fever treatment, care-seeking for respiratory complaints, and appropriate diarrhea treatment. Results. There {{were no significant differences}} between the 2 districts in the change in the 4 health behaviors when controlling for age, sex, maternal education and occupation, immunization history, and wealth. Conclusions. We found no evidence that EPI-CM increases healthy behaviors. Further evaluation of <b>other</b> <b>potential</b> benefits and <b>costs</b> of EPI-CM is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Approximately {{one-third of}} the {{electric}} motors in the industrial and commercial sectors use belt drives. 1 Belt drives provide flexibility in the positioning of the motor relative to the load. Pulleys (sheaves) of varying diameters allow {{the speed of the}} driven equipment to be increased or decreased relative to the motor speed. A properly designed belt power-transmission system offers high efficiency and low noise, requires no lubrication, and presents low maintenance requirements. However, certain types of belts are more efficient than <b>others,</b> offering <b>potential</b> energy <b>cost</b> savings. The majority of belt drives use V-belts, which use a trapezoidal cross section to create a wedging action on the pulleys to increase friction and improve the belt’s power transfer capability. Joined or multiple belts are specified for heavy loads. V-belt drives can have a peak efficiency of 95 % or more at the time of installation. Efficiency is dependent on pulley size, pulley wear, V-belt alignment, transmitted torque, under or oversizing belts for load requirements. Efficiency can deteriorate by as much as 5 % over time if slippage occurs because the belt is not periodically retensioned. The most important operational and maintenance issue in a V-belt drive is its tension. I...|$|R

Energy storage systems that are {{properly}} placed on the transmission system {{can be used to}} relieve transmission congestion [1]. Similarly, storage on distribution can be used to reduce peak loads [2]. The reduction in currents produced by congestion relief and peak reduction may also result in a decrease in line losses. Further efficiency improvements could be realized by optimizing the placement and scheduling of energy storage for loss reduction and efficiency improvement. The efficiency of the storage systems themselves, however, may limit their use in loss reduction or system efficiency improvement. Typical round-trip efficiencies for bulk storage systems are 70 - 85 % for pumped hydro and 70 - 90 % for electrochemical batteries [1, 3]. Comparing this with North American transmission and distribution efficiencies that usually exceed 90 %, the case for using storage to improve overall efficiency may be difficult to make. This presentation will examine the issues, comparing storage efficiencies with transmission and distribution efficiencies. It will examine selected cases to address the feasibility of optimizing the placement and scheduling of energy storage to improve system efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Efficiency improvement will then be discussed {{in the context of the}} <b>other</b> <b>potential</b> benefits and <b>costs</b> of storage...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{employers}} at 320 hospitality {{companies in the}} United States found a set of similar concerns and challenges regarding employment of persons with disabilities, although several of these issues {{are the result of}} lack of employer education. While small and medium-size companies had somewhat different issues than large companies, all firms had several concerns in common, starting with the belief that those with disabilities could not do the work. Another top concern was the <b>potential</b> <b>cost</b> of unspecified accommodations under the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, even though the record shows that most such accommodations are not exceptionally costly. <b>Other</b> <b>potential</b> concerns were the possibility that persons with disabilities would not have requisite skills or be as productive, and that supervisors would be uncomfortable supervising persons with disabilities and would not know how to discipline or evaluate them. Larger companies are more likely than small firms to actively recruit persons with disabilities, and those that do so are relatively less concerned about <b>potential</b> <b>costs</b> and the safety of those workers than those who do not. Among the policies that would encourage more hiring of workers with disabilities cited by the managers are employer tax credits and incentives, flexible work schedules, and disability awareness training. On balance, the survey indicates that greater knowledge about persons with disabilities would enhance their hiring prospects, particularly since those with disabilities constitute a loyal and stable pool of workers with a long record of satisfactory job performance...|$|R
