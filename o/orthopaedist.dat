30|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} is a recognizable entity for the commonest cause of acute childhood flaccid paralysis {{in the field}} of pediatric neurology [9]. Several reports in larger numbers of GBS patients have been delineated from the neurologists’ point of view, but there are few reports which specifically describe orthopaedic aspects [17, 18]. Some of the pediatric GBS patients consult the <b>orthopaedists</b> first because limb pain and gait disturbance are frequent primary complaints. Indeed, five of the seven patients initially consulted the orthopaedic department in the present study. The <b>orthopaedists,</b> however, are unfamiliar with the disease, since it has rarely been reported in detail in the orthopaedic literature. To prevent diagnostic delay, <b>orthopaedists</b> {{should be aware of the}} early symptoms and clinical manifestations of pediatric GBS.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To get {{insight into}} medical {{opinions}} {{about the use of}} orthopaedic footwear and the medical and social factors related to the prescription of orthopaedic footwear by <b>orthopaedists</b> and rehabilitation practitioners. Methods: In this study 85 <b>orthopaedists</b> and 96 rehabilitation practitioners filled out a questionnaire measuring perceived desirability of prescribing orthopaedic footwear in specific medical conditions, the perceived advantages of orthopaedic footwear, the perceived disadvantages of orthopaedic footwear, the attitude to orthopaedic footwear and satisfaction with the co-operation with the pedorthist. Clinicians were asked to estimate their referral rate of orthopaedic footwear. Results: <b>Orthopaedists</b> and rehabilitation practitioners agree that the prescription of orthopaedic footwear should be considered in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, amputation of the foot and diabetic foot and not be considered in the case of sprain and back pain. In the case of hallux valgi, dermatological problems and clavus (severe corn) a reticent prescription policy seems to be the optimal choice. In the other medical conditions studied no unequivocal prescription policy could be derived. Respondents who prescribed orthopaedic footwear more than the median (more than 50 prescriptions per year) were more often rehabilitation practitioner, perceived more advantages of prescription footwear, perceived less disadvantages of prescription footwear and were more satisfied about the co-operation with the pedorthist. Conclusion: In some medical conditions <b>orthopaedists</b> and rehabilitation practitioners agree about the optimal use of orthopaedic footwear. In some other medical conditions <b>orthopaedists</b> and rehabilitation practitioners are divided about the use of orthopaedic footwear. Reported rate of prescription was not related to desirability of prescription, but was related to beliefs such as perceived advantages, perceived disadvantages and satisfactio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Assessment {{of range}} of motion (ROM) and muscle {{strength}} is fundamental in the clinical diagnosis of hip osteoarthritis (OA) but reproducibility of these measurements has mostly involved clinicians from secondary care and has rarely reported agreement parameters. Therefore, the primary objective {{of the study was}} to determine the inter-rater reproducibility of ROM and muscle strength measurements. Furthermore, the reliability of the overall assessment of clinical hip OA was evaluated. Reporting is in accordance with proposed guidelines for the reporting of reliability and agreement studies (GRRAS). Methods In a university hospital, four blinded raters independently examined patients with unilateral hip OA; two hospital <b>orthopaedists</b> independently examined 48 (24 men) patients and two primary care chiropractors examined 61 patients (29 men). ROM was measured in degrees (deg.) with a standard two-arm goniometer and muscle strength in Newton (N) using a hand-held dynamometer. Reproducibility is reported as agreement and reliability between paired raters of the same profession. Agreement is reported as limits of agreement (LoA) and reliability is reported with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Reliability of the overall assessment of clinical OA is reported as weighted kappa. Results Between <b>orthopaedists,</b> agreement for ROM ranged from LoA [- 28 – 12 deg. ] for internal rotation to [- 8 – 13 deg. ] for extension. ICC ranged between 0. 53 and 0. 73, highest for flexion. For muscle strength between <b>orthopaedists,</b> LoA ranged from [- 65 – 47 N] for external rotation to [- 10 – 59 N] for flexion. ICC ranged between 0. 52 and 0. 85, highest for abduction. Between chiropractors, agreement for ROM ranged from LoA [- 25 – 30 deg. ] for internal rotation to [- 13 – 21 deg. ] for flexion. ICC ranged between 0. 14 and 0. 79, highest for flexion. For muscle strength between chiropractors, LoA ranged between [- 80 – 20 N] for external rotation to [- 146 – 55 N] for abduction. ICC ranged between 0. 38 and 0. 81, highest for flexion. Weighted kappa for the overall assessment of clinical hip OA was 0. 52 between <b>orthopaedists</b> and 0. 65 between chiropractors. Conclusions Reproducibility of goniometric and dynamometric measurements of ROM and muscle strength in patients with hip OA is poor between experienced <b>orthopaedists</b> and between experienced chiropractors. <b>Orthopaedists</b> and chiropractors can to a moderate degree differentiate between hips with or without osteoarthritis. </p...|$|R

30|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{is more common}} in the elderly adult population but rare in children. The incidence of GBS in children less than 17  years old is estimated at 0.8 per 100, 000 [12]. In pediatric GBS, not only the rarity of the disease but also limited patient cooperation during neurologic examinations make the diagnosis more difficult, leading to delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Moreover, children with GBS sometimes consult the <b>orthopaedists</b> because of limb pain and gait disturbance [13]. Thus, it is important for <b>orthopaedists</b> to recognize the clinical characteristics and diagnostic clues in pediatric GBS. In the present study, seven children with GBS were retrospectively reviewed, with specific focus on orthopaedic manifestations of the disease.|$|R
