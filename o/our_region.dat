Given the principle of mediocrity (in the same vein as the Copernican principle), {{it is probable that}} the universe teems with complex life.

During his early years at Bordeaux, he began attending high school. He hoped to earn a Baccalauréat in accounting, which he later accomplished. In addition to having a Baccalauréat, Chamakh is also very interested in politics and, in February 2010, voiced his support for the Democratic Movement (MoDem) political party ahead of the upcoming regional elections. In the 2010 regional elections, Chamakh was, surprisingly, listed as a candidate by the MoDem for the Gironde department in the Aquitaine region. The lead deputy of the party, Jean Lassalle, stated on the decision to name Chamakh to the ballot: [...] "I want to gather all the forces of Aquitaine to sustain <b>our</b> <b>region,</b> and Marouane is one of those forces who Aquitaine needs."

40|$|New {{achievable}} rate {{regions are}} derived for the two-user additive white Gaussian multiple-access channel with noisy feedback. The regions exhibit {{the following two}} properties. Irrespective of the (finite) Gaussian feedback-noise variances, <b>our</b> <b>regions</b> include rate points which lie strictly outside the no-feedback capacity region, and when the feedback-noise variances tend to 0 <b>our</b> <b>regions</b> converge to the perfect feedback capacity region.

Again, irrespective of the (finite) noise variance on the only feedback link, the regions include rate points which lie strictly outside the no-feedback capacity region. Moreover, in the case of perfect partial feedback, i. e., where the only feedback link is noise-free, for certain channel parameters the new regions even include rate points which lie strictly outside the Cover-Leung region. This answers in the negative the question posed by van der Meulen as to whether the Cover-Leung region equals the capacity region of the Gaussian multiple-access channel with perfect partial feedback. Finally, we propose new achievable regions also for a setting where the receiver is cognizant of the realizations of the noise sequences on the feedback links. ...|$|R
