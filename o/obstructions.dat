40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the value of}} bowel sounds analysis using an electronic stethoscope to support a clinical diagnosis of intestinal <b>obstruction.</b> METHODS: Subjects were patients who presented with a diagnosis of possible intestinal <b>obstruction</b> based on symptoms, signs, and radiological findings. A 3 M&#x 2122; Littmann® Model 4100 electronic stethoscope {{was used in this}} study. With the patients lying supine, six 8 -second recordings of bowel sounds were taken from each patient from the lower abdomen. The recordings were analysed for sound duration, sound-to-sound interval, dominant frequency, and peak frequency. Clinical and radiological data were reviewed and the patients were classified as having either acute, subacute, or no bowel <b>obstruction.</b> Comparison of bowel sound characteristics was made between these subgroups of patients. In the presence of an <b>obstruction,</b> the site of <b>obstruction</b> was identified and bowel calibre was also measured to correlate with bowel sounds. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients were studied during the period July 2009 to January 2011. Forty patients had acute bowel <b>obstruction</b> (27 small bowel <b>obstruction</b> and 13 large bowel <b>obstruction),</b> 11 had subacute bowel <b>obstruction</b> (eight in the small bowel and three in large bowel) and 20 had no bowel <b>obstruction</b> (diagnoses of other conditions were made). Twenty-five patients received surgical intervention (35. 2 %) during the same admission for acute abdominal conditions. A total of 426 recordings were made and 420 recordings were used for analysis. There {{was no significant difference in}} sound-to-sound interval, dominant frequency, and peak frequency among patients with acute bowel <b>obstruction,</b> subacute bowel <b>obstruction,</b> and no bowel <b>obstruction.</b> In acute large bowel <b>obstruction,</b> the sound duration was significantly longer (median 0. 81 s vs 0. 55 s, P = 0. 021) and the dominant frequency was significantly higher (median 440 Hz vs 288 Hz, P = 0. 003) when compared to acute small bowel <b>obstruction.</b> No significant difference was seen between acute large bowel <b>obstruction</b> and large bowel pseudo-obstruction. For patients with small bowel <b>obstruction,</b> the sound-to-sound interval was significantly longer in those who subsequently underwent surgery compared with those treated non-operatively (median 1. 29 s vs 0. 63 s, P < 0. 001). There was no correlation between bowel calibre and bowel sound characteristics in both acute small bowel <b>obstruction</b> and acute large bowel <b>obstruction.</b> CONCLUSION: Auscultation of bowel sounds is non-specific for diagnosing bowel <b>obstruction.</b> Differences in sound characteristics between large bowel and small bowel <b>obstruction</b> may help {{determine the}} likely site of <b>obstruction...</b>|$|R

We analyzed {{the correlation between the}} lacrimal duct <b>obstruction</b> and the relevant disease. And 280 cases reoccurred lacrimal duct <b>obstruction</b> during the average 2 a follow-up. The causes correlated with the relapsed <b>obstruction</b> were assessed. RESULTS: Lacrimal duct <b>obstruction</b> mostly occurred secondary to the inflammation of conjunctiva or nasal mucosa. The upper site <b>obstruction</b> correlated with the chronic conjunctivitis, while the lower site <b>obstruction</b> related to the hypertrophy of inferior turbinate.
