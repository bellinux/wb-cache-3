40|$|Abstract: Nail-patella {{syndrome}} is a hereditary <b>osteo-onychodysplasia.</b> It is an autosomal dominant disease with {{involvement of the}} LMX 1 gene. We report a case of Nail-patella syndrome with bilateral absence of patella, hypo plastic finger nails, dysplastic toe nails, and bilateral iliac horns. The toe nails dysplasia is rare in Nail- patella syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Nail-patella {{syndrome}} (NPS) {{which also}} known as hereditary <b>osteo-onychodysplasia</b> is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by a classic clinical tetrad {{of changes in the}} nails, knees, elbows and the presence of iliac horns. Occasionally the central nervous system, the eyes and the renal system are affected. NPS was reported worldwide, affecting males and females equally. Infertility was not mentioned in this syndrome before. Here we are reporting a case of NPS in a 38  year old Saudi male, in association with infertility, which was exceptional and could represent an additional manifestation to the syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary <b>osteo-onychodysplasia</b> (HOOD, nail-patella syndrome) is an {{autosomal}} dominant condition characterised by nail dysplasia, patellar hypoplasia or aplasia, and nephropathy. The risk for HOOD patients {{to have a}} child with HOOD who will develop renal failure cannot easily be deduced from published pedigrees. We have studied a large family with 30 patients with HOOD and have analysed 34 kindreds with HOOD nephropathy from published reports, comprising 213 patients. For a patient with HOOD from a family in which HOOD nephropathy occurs, the risk of having a child with HOOD nephropathy is about 1 : 4; the risk of having a child in whom renal failure will develop is about 1 : 10...|$|E
40|$|The miail-patella synidronie {{is one of}} {{the very}} few syndromes in which {{definite}} autosonial linkages have been established in mami. The earliest descnipt. iomi of the hereditary nature of this disorder was that of Scdgwick, quoted! by Little imi 1897. Turmier, in 1933, described this disorder in greater detail. Fomig, in 1946, gave the name iliac horns to the projections on the dorsolateral aspects of the ilia but did not associate them with arty specific symidrome. These iliac horns were later observed in associat. iomi with kmiee amid miail amionialies by other authors (Mimmo amid a. ssociat. es mm 1948 amid Thompsomi amid associates in 1949). Thus iliac hormis took their place as an imuportamit. comist. ituemit of this syndrome. Mamiy other bone abriornialit. ies have beeni mioticed imi somiie cases. The term hereditary <b>osteo-onychodysplasia,</b> coimied by Love amid!
