5|$|Garcia was {{pitching}} in semipro baseball when Cleveland Indians scout Willis Butler noticed him in Tulare, California. In 1942, Butler signed {{him as an}} amateur free agent to the organization's Class D farm team, the Appleton Papermakers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> State League. Garcia earned a 10–10 win–loss record with Appleton. He spent {{the next three years}} as a signalman in the United States Army during World War II.|$|E

5|$|McCarthy won {{reelection in}} 1952 with 54% of the vote, {{defeating}} former Wisconsin State Attorney General Thomas E.

5|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the Northwest Territory, then the Illinois Territory, then the Michigan Territory, and finally the Wisconsin Territory. The western and {{southern}} areas of the state, although theoretically part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Territory from its creation in 1836, were not formally organized until 1838, when they became part of the Iowa Territory.|$|E
50|$|In 1845, he left New York {{and moved}} to <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Territory, {{accomplishing}} a mixture of politics (member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1848 <b>Wisconsin</b> constitutional convention), journalism (editor and part owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Milwaukee Sentinel and Gazette), and education (superintendent of schools in Milwaukee in 1859-1860, and a regent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> in 1848-1854).

5|$|McCarthy {{campaigned for}} the Republican Senate {{nomination}} in Wisconsin while still {{on active duty}} in 1944 but was defeated by Alexander Wiley, the incumbent. After he left the Marines in April 1945, five months {{before the end of}} the Pacific war in September 1945, McCarthy was reelected unopposed to his circuit court position. He then began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate primary nomination, with support from Thomas Coleman, the Republican Party's political boss in Wisconsin. In this race, he was challenging three-term senator Robert M. La Follette Jr., founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Progressive Party and son of the celebrated Wisconsin governor and senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|$|E
5|$|The Rainy Lobe <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> {{glaciation}} was {{the most}} recent of the glaciation events, and it retreated about 10,000years ago. Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement. This direction is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges. The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock lakes in North America because their long axes lie transverse to the general movement of the glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the first}} half of the 19th century, the northeastern portion of the state was a part of the Northwest Territory, formed in 1787.

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
5|$|Groth {{was born}} in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania to William T. and Clara Court Groth. He played American Legion Baseball in East Palestine, Ohio in his teens, and {{attended}} Beaver Falls High School. He grew up pitching in the county league, and was both a right fielder and pitcher for the Chippewa Indians. After pitching for Chippewa in 1941, he was offered a contract for the 1942 season by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Groth turned down the offer instead signing with the Cleveland Indians, spending the 1942 season with the Indians' D-Class (Rookie League) affiliate, the Appleton Papermakers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> State League, where he played alongside future teammate Mike Garcia. In 26 games, he pitched in 203 innings, had a 16–10 win–loss record and a 3.59 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Linde's {{first taste}} of minor league action came in 1942, when he signed with the Green Bay Bluejays <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> State League. His {{performances}} that season included a near-no-hitter that {{was lost in the}} ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du Lac Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after a pitching performance, also against Fond du Lac, in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory. He finished the season with 13 wins, eight losses, and a 2.91 ERA in 22 pitching appearances. After the season ended, the league folded temporarily, and Linde enlisted with the United States Army Air Forces to serve in World War II.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the media}} {{attention}} to the statements about rape, a number of GOP officials quickly withdrew their endorsements of Rivard, including vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, Governor Scott Walker, US Senator Ron Johnson, former Governor Tommy Thompson, and State Representative Robin Vos, {{who is in charge}} of Assembly campaign efforts. The Associated Builders and Contractors <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin,</b> <b>the</b> Tavern League <b>of</b> <b>Wisconsin,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Restaurant Association, and <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Grocers Association also rescinded their endorsements of Rivard. However, he retained <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> several pro-life and business groups, and a county party rally including Rivard was held just two days after <b>the</b> firestorm <b>of</b> criticism began.|$|R

5|$|Nicol {{arrived in}} Chicago on July 20 and was penciled in {{to start on}} {{consecutive}} days against Charles Radbourn and Cy Young. Though he performed poorly in both games, the Colts still managed to win. He was shelled {{in the third inning}} by the Cincinnati Reds and on the next day, he gave up seven runs to the Cleveland Spiders in only two innings. Because of these starts, he did not appear in another game until August 14, when he was used in relief to face the Brooklyn Dodgers. His control issues flared up and he had trouble holding the Dodgers' baserunners. He was released one week later, having walked 10 batters in the 11 innings he pitched for the Colts. He ended the season playing for Marinette <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> State League.|$|E
5|$|Scott County {{was formed}} by an act <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> Territorial {{legislature}} in 1837. Both Davenport and its neighbor Rockingham campaigned to become the county seat. The city with the most votes from Scott County citizens in the February 1838 election would become the county seat. On {{the eve of the}} election, Davenport citizens acquired the temporary service of Dubuque laborers so they could vote in the election. Davenport won the election {{with the help of the}} laborers. Rockingham supporters protested the elections to the territorial governor, on the grounds the laborers from Dubuque were not Scott County residents. The governor refused to certify the results of the election. A second election was held the following August. To avoid another import of voters, the governor set a 60-day residency requirement for all voters. Davenport won by two votes. Because the margin of victory was so close, a third election was held in the summer of 1840. As the August election drew nearer, Rockingham residents grew tired of the county seat cause. Davenport easily won the third election. Consequently, to avoid questions about the county seat, Davenport quickly built the first county courthouse.|$|E
5|$|After {{speeches in}} favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little {{excitement}} for the idea of Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. Jeremiah McLain Rusk, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> delegation, and Benjamin Harrison, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a dark horse candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur, a member of Conkling's political machine, was chosen as the vice-presidential nominee.|$|E

5|$|The Florida {{peninsula}} appeared {{above sea}} level between 100,000 and 150,000years ago. As sea levels rose at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisconsin</b> ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from {{the northern part of}} Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and amount of water present.|$|E
