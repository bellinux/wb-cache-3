5|$|A port <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever – Game of the Year Edition for the Mac OS X {{operating}} system {{was developed by}} MumboJumbo, and published by MacPlay. It was released on November 21, 2002, soon after the original Windows release <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way (which was also ported to Mac OS X by MacPlay later). Similarly to the Windows version of the game, the Mac OS X port also uses GameSpy technology for its online multiplayer mode, allowing players to play with each other, no matter which platform they use.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> who could be of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of Certified Copy, Binoche {{appeared}} in a brief supporting role in The Son <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> for American writer and director Dito Montiel. The film also stars Channing Tatum, Al Pacino and Ray Liotta. The Son <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival to fairly negative reaction. It was acquired by Anchor Bay Entertainment for distribution in the US and other key territories arriving in selected US cinemas on 4 November 2011. As of December 2011, according to film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, The Son <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> is Juliette Binoche's least critically successful film, with only 18% of critics giving it a positive review.|$|E

However, when Foveaux returned to England in 1810 he was court-martialled for assenting to Bligh being deposed and imprisoned; Macquarie's recommendation was ignored. Foveaux was taken back into active service in 1811 and promoted lieutenant-colonel of the Greek Light Infantry; he pursued an uneventful military career after that, rising to the rank of lieutenant-general.|$|E

I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does when we try to produce a vacuum.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the PlayStation 2 port <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever was much less positive than the original version. It has a 70.12% ranking on GameRankings (42 reviews), and a score of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic (23 reviews). IGN gave the PlayStation 2 version an overall rating of 6.9 ("Passable") out of 10. The PlayStation 2 port received a 4.6 score ("Poor") out of 10 from GameSpot, and was panned mainly {{for the lack of}} the quicksave feature available in the PC version. The Mac OS X version of the game was given a 9.1 rating overall ("Outstanding") by IGN, and was called [...] "a fabulous Mac version of this top notch game." ...|$|E

Rediff.com criticised her decision to star in the film, writing that she [...] "gets no support from the way her character is written".

He has traveled to England, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan to promote baseball. In appreciation for his efforts, Commissioner Bud Selig penned a thank-you letter to Granderson which read in part, [...] "There are so many fine young men playing Major League baseball today, but I can think <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> who is better suited to represent our national pastime than you." [...] He has also served as something of an unofficial baseball ambassador to the African-American community, often participating in and initiating dialogue {{about the lack of}} black players {{at all levels of the}} sport. When he endorsed Nike, Inc., Louisville Slugger and Rawlings, he asked them to donate money to his foundation or equipment to inner-city baseball programs rather than pay him.|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Congress had {{authorized}} branch mints at Charlotte, North Carolina, Dahlonega, Georgia, and New Orleans, Louisiana, {{to strike}} into American coin the gold being mined in or {{entering the country}} through the South. [...] Despite the rich gold deposits nearby, both Charlotte and Dahlonega were in areas lacking men with technical training; accordingly trained personnel {{would have to be}} sent from Philadelphia. [...] New buildings were to be constructed. In August 1837, Mint Director Patterson received word of problems at both sites, including a partial collapse of the Dahlonega building. He wrote to Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury, proposing [...] "to send, to both the Gold mints, a confidential & skillful person, who may... give instructions as to correcting the errors, that have been committed... I know <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> competent to this task, except our Melter & Refiner, Mr. Peale." [...] Woodbury agreed, informing Patterson, [...] "you are authorized to send Mr. Peak." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack for the {{original}} version <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever (as well as the later Mac OS X port) was chiefly composed and produced by Guy Whitmore. The game uses DirectMusic technology, and its music {{is an example of}} an adaptive score: the music smoothly and flexibly adapts to the situations that players finds themselves in, in order to simulate film soundtracks. For instance, the music increases in tempo or urgency when the player is in a combat situation, or if enemies become aware of the player's presence. Whitmore's task as composer was [...] "to capture the flavor of the '50s/'60s spy genre, without infringing on any existing copyrights." [...] In order to avoid any legal troubles over music from the James Bond franchise of films and games, Whitmore was initially asked to refrain from using brass instruments; a directive he compared to [...] "being asked to produce a blues album without guitars". While some of the instrument sounds came from professional collections, others were home-made samples, including solo cello sounds performed by Lori Goldston, used in the H.A.R.M. theme. Influences for the score included German composer Peter Thomas, the soundtrack of the 1968 film Barbarella, and [...] "an array of Italian composers who did beautiful scores for low budget European erotic films." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Hubbard, the team's [...] "greatest asset was [...] {{the list}} of {{mistakes}} we made during Shogo. We started this project with a pretty sober view of what we could achieve. As a result, every major feature we outlined {{made it into the}} game, as well as a few additional items we came up with during the project." [...] However, there were still things that the team didn't have enough time to implement. For example, No One Lives Forevers team-based multiplayer portion was originally going to be a story-driven cooperative gameplay mode (similar to the [...] "Assault" [...] game type in the 1999 first-person shooter Unreal Tournament), including objectives and obstacles for the two teams. Like the single-player story in the game, this gameplay mode was also going to incorporate humor; for example, in one map, a goal of each team was to find a special watermelon for a mayor in a Moroccan marketplace. While this mode was publicly discussed even in July 2000, it is not present as such in the final product (which went gold on October 20). The different objectives were changed to a general goal for both teams in all maps: photographing the other team's intelligence item. However, a number of remnants stemming from the earlier gameplay design can be seen in some of the released maps, such as the office of the aforementioned mayor seen in the Morocco map. Fully realized co-operative multiplayer was, however, a feature <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever 2.|$|E
500|$|In May 2014, Night Dive Studios, a {{publisher}} of classic PC titles, filed trademarks for [...] "No One Lives Forever", [...] "The Operative", [...] "A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way", and [...] "Contract J.A.C.K.", Night Dive {{had also been}} able to acquire the source code for the games, which {{would enable them to}} remaster them for modern computer systems. However, Night Dive had yet to comment on the situation regarding who owned the rights to the game. At this point, the rights to the series was unclear, as the property may have been owned solely or in part by 20th Century Fox (which owned Fox Interactive {{at the time of the}} game's release), Activision (which acquired and merged with Vivendi Games, which in turn was the parent to Sierra Entertainment, the publisher <b>of</b> <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Lives Forever 2, and had acquired Fox Interactive in 2003), and Warner Bros. (which acquired Monolith Productions). Warner Bros. did file opposition to Night Dive's trademark, leading Night Dive to try to seek a license arrangement. However, Warner Bros. represented were concerned that if either Fox or Activision had a part of the owernship, that they would also need their approval. Night Dive attempted to work with Fox and Activision to search their archives, but as these transitions pre-dated computerized records, neither company wanted to do so. Night Dive's efforts were further stalled when they were told by Warner Bros. that they had no interest in partnering or licensing the IP, leading Night Dive to abandon their efforts to acquire the rights.|$|E
500|$|When Charlotte was eight, her father, whose {{affections}} {{had returned}} to Fitzherbert, decided that he wanted Carlton House to himself. [...] He took over his wife's apartments (Caroline received space in Kensington Palace instead), and moved their daughter into Montague House, adjacent to Carlton House. [...] As James Chambers, another Charlotte biographer, put it, the young Princess [...] "lived in a household of her own, in the company <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> who was not paid to be there". [...] The move took place without the presence of Charlotte's governess, Lady Elgin, with whom she was very close. [...] Lady Elgin {{had been forced to}} retire, ostensibly on account of age, but most likely because George was angry that Lady Elgin had taken Charlotte to see the King without George's permission. [...] George also dismissed the sub-governess, Miss Hayman, for being too friendly with Caroline—and the Princess of Wales promptly hired her. [...] Lady Elgin's replacement, Lady de Clifford, was fond of Charlotte, and too good natured to discipline the child, who had grown into an exuberant tomboy. [...] Lady de Clifford brought one of her grandsons, the Honourable George Keppel, three years younger than Charlotte, as a playmate for her. [...] Forty years later, Keppel, by then Earl of Albemarle, would remember Charlotte in his memoirs, the source of many of the anecdotes of Charlotte as a small girl. [...] In addition to tomboy tales of horses and fisticuffs, he remembered them seeing a crowd gathered outside the Keppel house at Earl's Court, who were hoping to see the young Princess. [...] The two children went outside and joined the crowd, unrecognised.|$|E
