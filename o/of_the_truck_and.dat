Hartmann jumped out of the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding on the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck,</b> <b>and</b> some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} two days saw a massive refugee column {{of cars and}} trucks [...] "laden with bundles... bumper to bumper" [...] trudging through the intersection. Melkonian ordered his forces to halt their advance until {{the remnants of the}} column dried up in the early afternoon of April 1. Assessing that most refugees had left, he ordered his units to advance and sent a detachment to guard a vital tunnel leading south towards Zulfugarli. While his troops had assumed that most civilians had left Kelbajar, they encountered a GAZ-52 transport truck in the tunnel and, thinking it was a military vehicle, fired and destroyed it with rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles. As they observed the wreck of the vehicle, the troops realized they had taken out a vehicle filled entirely with civilians: twenty-five Kurd and Azeri kolkhoz workers. Four of them, including the driver <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> his daughter, were killed. The rest were ordered by Melkonian to be taken to a hospital in Karabakh's capital of Stepanakert; however, as many as eleven of them died.|$|E

When all the prisoners are taken out and are arranged in a line, Mulder sees Krycek talking to one of the captors and runs toward them, tackling them. Mulder then steals a truck and flees with a unconscious Krycek in the back of it; a pursuit by his captors ensues. As Mulder drives the truck, Krycek awakes and jumps off it.

500|$|Madonna first {{performed}} [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] {{during the}} promotional tours for Music. The first of these, was on November 5, 2000, at Roseland Ballroom in New York City, {{and the other}} on November 29, 2000, at Brixton Academy in London. Accompanying musicians performing with Madonna were; Mirwais Ahmadzaï on guitar and longtime backing singers Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. During the performance of New York, she wore a black tank top with [...] "Britney Spears" [...] written on it, along with cowboy hats and boots. The costumes for the show and the set was designed by Dolce & Gabbana. Roseland's secondary stage was used for the performance and was decked as a neo-Western wonderland, with bales of hay, yellow-lit horseshoes and silver cacti throughout the lobby and entrance. Dancers dressed as cowboys vogued during the pre-show in provocative poses, lassoing each other and skating around the passersby. The stage was draped in an American flag. As the music started, the flag lifted to reveal a white Ford pickup truck from which Madonna emerged, singing [...] "Impressive Instant". Bare-chested male dancers encircled her, as she posed on the hood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> danced through the song. The vocoder effects on Madonna's voice was removed for the live performance, which Jennifer Vineyard from Rolling Stone felt made the singer's vocals sound [...] "less ridiculous". By the end of the performance, she as transported onto the main stage of Roseland, {{with the help of the}} audience member's hands. A similar performance was done at Brixton Academy; Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes' names printed on it. Around 3,000fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of [...] "50s rock and roll classics" [...] at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.|$|E

2500|$|Into the 1970s, many British made Dinky {{vehicles}} {{lost the}} precision quality of detailing and proportions seen {{during the two}} previous decades. Models like no. 186 Jensen FF or no. 213 European Ford Capri were rather chunky and unrefined with thick metal door frames, imprecise grilles, and ungainly doors and bonnets painted in separate colours {{from the rest of}} the body. Many just did not look quite right. Others, like the no. 1453 Citroën DS Présidentielle saloon were still impressive – flying French flags, with driver, and battery operated lights (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p.23). Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> construction models remained very clever as well, with many moving features, like the Bedford refuse truck or the Taylor Excavator. At this time, Dinky also introduced [...] "Action Kits" [...] which were regular models that came disassembled with build instructions and consisted of about 40 pieces (Smeed 1980, p.44-45). [...] On the other hand, French Dinky Toys, which had to compete with Solido since 1957, were much more accurate with better paint and sharper details than their English counterparts. The no. 825 DUKW military truck is a good example of the quality of French Dinky Toys (The Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday, April 30, 1998, around 3:00p.m., Jones {{parked his}} dark gray Toyota pickup truck on the {{transition}} loop from the Harbor Freeway to the Century Freeway in Los Angeles (...) [...] Jones {{sat in the}} front of his truck with his pet dog Gladdis, a seven-year-old Labrador-whippet mixed-breed. Jones began pointing a loaded shotgun at passing cars on the freeway, causing motorists to report him to the police. Jones himself then called 9-1-1, revealing he was emotionally distraught about HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations) and the circumstances surrounding his HIV. Jones said he was in pain due to mistreatment by the HMO in whose care he had been placed. As was confirmed later, aside from being HIV-positive, Jones also suffered from cancer. During the call, he fired off several rounds from his shotgun, with one of them going through the roof of his truck. Authorities then closed the two freeways, preventing anyone from approaching him. Jones remained in his truck the entire time, as police helicopters monitored his movements. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Weapons Team began to assemble and got into position around him. Jones then reached into a backpack he owned and took out clothing and a videotape. He then began throwing the items over the freeway wall. Afterwards, he got out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> walked across the empty freeway.|$|E
2500|$|Jones then unfurled a large, square banner {{with white}} hand-lettering that read: [...] "HMO's {{are in it}} for the money!! Live free, love safe or die." [...] Jones had made the banner {{specifically}} for the occasion and displayed it for the news helicopters to see. As it was pretty windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures and returned to his truck several times to pet his dog. This was all broadcast on live television by news helicopters recording the event live. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after-school cartoons had been interrupted in order to broadcast the incident. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned to his truck and sat in the front seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames, managing to peel off his pants, socks and underwear. He continued to wander about, naked from the waist, looking dazed and disoriented. He then walked {{to the edge of the}} freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway, however, he changed his mind and backed away from the edge, before returning to his ablaze truck. Moments later, at around 3:50p.m., he retrieved his shotgun from the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> <b>and</b> then walked back across the freeway. He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. Jones died at the age of forty, roughly two weeks after his birthday.|$|E
