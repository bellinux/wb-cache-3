5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh water, the osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding water. The animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark is {{a largely}} solitary animal, though {{occasionally}} several individuals {{may be found}} at the same location. In the Mozambique Channel, it outnumbers the bull shark on the east side while the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> on the west side, suggesting there may be competitive exclusion between these similar species. Parasites documented from the pigeye shark include the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini, the copepods Pandarus smithii and P. cranchii, and the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, Cathetocephalus sp., Floriceps minacanthus, Heteronybelinia australis, Otobothrium australe, O. crenacolle, and Protogrillotia sp. Young pigeye sharks are potentially vulnerable to predation by larger sharks. The natural mortality for juveniles in Cleveland Bay has been measured at no more than 5% per year; this rate is comparable to that in juvenile bull sharks, and is much lower than in juvenile blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) or lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E

5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{innervation}} {{shows that}} the homology is limited: the eyes of Onychophora form behind the antenna, whereas the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in arthropods.|$|E
50|$|Germans {{were placed}} under a {{different}} law than Slavs. While those were unfree (except for the nobles), did not own the soil they cultivated, and were to serve the nobility, the <b>opposite</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for the Germans.|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the band had little in common. In a 1972 NME interview, Newman said that he got on with Keen's music but not with Keen personally, while the exact <b>opposite</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> with regard to McCulloch.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, the National Vital Statistics System's {{homicide}} estimates exactly matched {{those of}} the SHR in 22% of U.S. counties. The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) generally produced higher estimates than the SHR does, but in 28% of U.S. counties, the <b>opposite</b> <b>was</b> <b>true.</b>|$|R

25|$|It {{should be}} noted both the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, {{resulting}} in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of the footwork and torso movement.|$|E
25|$|The loss of episodic {{memories}} in PD patients typically demonstrates a temporal gradient wherein older memories {{are generally more}} preserved than newer memories. Also, while forgetting event content is less compromised in Parkinson’s than in Alzheimer's, the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for event data memories.|$|E

50|$|This {{meant that}} in the winter the daytime pahars were shorter than the {{nighttime}} pahars, and the <b>opposite</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> in summer. The pahars were exactly equal on the equinoxes. Thus, {{the length of the}} traditional pahar varied from about 2.5 hours to 3.5 hours in the Indo-Gangetic plains.|$|R
25|$|Although in two {{dimensions}} the seal system of a Wankel {{looks to be}} even simpler {{than that of a}} corresponding multi-cylinder piston engine, in three dimensions the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> As well as the rotor apex seals evident in the conceptual diagram, the rotor must also seal against the chamber ends.|$|E
25|$|The {{central zone}} of Lofn, its rim and {{the ring of}} bright ejecta are water rich as was {{determined}} by the infrared spectroscopic observations by Galileo. <b>Opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for the dark material of the outer impact deposits, which appears to be relatively ice poor, but contains increased amounts of carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Avocados in savory dishes, {{often seen}} as exotic, are a {{relative}} novelty in Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Brazil, where the traditional preparation is mashed with sugar and lime, and eaten as a dessert or snack. This contrasts with Spanish-speaking countries such as Chile, Mexico, or Argentina, where the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and sweet preparations are rare.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} electoral tide {{was with the}} Republicans that year, the <b>opposite</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> in Pennsylvania.

25|$|Electrochemical {{capacitors}} (supercapacitors) {{consist of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator), and an electrolyte ionically connecting both electrodes. When the electrodes are polarized by an applied voltage, ions in the electrolyte form electric double layers of opposite polarity to the electrode's polarity. For example, positively polarized electrodes {{will have a}} layer of negative ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface along with a charge-balancing layer of positive ions adsorbing onto the negative layer. The <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for the negatively polarized electrode.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, Jensen's inequality, {{named after}} the Danish {{mathematician}} Johan Jensen, relates {{the value of a}} convex function of an integral to the integral of the convex function. It was proven by Jensen in 1906. Given its generality, the inequality appears in many forms depending on the context, some of which are presented below. In its simplest form the inequality states that the convex transformation of a mean is {{less than or equal to}} the mean applied after convex transformation; it is a simple corollary that the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of concave transformations.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{files were}} {{distributed}} by point-to-point technology: {{with a central}} uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, {{a large number of}} downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for peer-to-peer networking; the more downloaders the faster the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of warez.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between Stjórn III and Konungs Skuggsjá {{has been noted}} since 1818. It has traditionally been assumed that Konungs Skuggsjá borrowed from Stjórn III. That the <b>opposite</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> has <b>been</b> argued by Hofmann (1973) and Bagge (1979); Kirby (1986) argues in favour of the traditional view in his study Bible Translation in Old Norse.|$|R

50|$|Furthermore, men {{showed more}} bias for Ashkenazic men {{compared}} to women, but the <b>opposite</b> <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for Eastern names. This result may seem counter-intuitive as participants appear to share {{more in common}} if they were both male, thus we would expect Eastern females to be more marginalised, but is actually consistent with other studies which studied discrimination against Afro-American women.|$|R
25|$|Amazon also {{employs the}} use of drop shippers or meta sellers. These are members or {{entities}} that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just {{someone who has been}} in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.|$|E
25|$|No {{satisfactory}} explanation can as yet {{be given}} for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine {{the proportion of the}} two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though {{it is not possible to}} formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.|$|E
25|$|All Lithuanian verbs can be {{characterized}} by their aspect which can be either perfective or imperfective. Nevertheless, this important dichotomy is semantical, rather than expressed by purely grammatical means. Formally distinguishing an imperfective verb from its perfective counterpart is not possible, since those forms {{are not mutually exclusive}} or interdependant. Moreover, certain grammatical catogories (like past iterative tense) automatically negate any perfectiveness a certain verb might have in infinitive or in other tenses. The <b>opposite</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> as well: a different tense (like an inchoative or perfect tense) of an otherwise imperfective verb automatically grants a perfective meaning. Contrary to Slavonic languages, each and every Lithuanian verb, in spite of its aspect, has all tenses and forms described in previous chapters of this article.|$|E
