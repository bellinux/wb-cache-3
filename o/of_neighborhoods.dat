5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked {{because he was not}} represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It was brought to the fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> the <b>neighborhood</b> crossover <b>of</b> EMO algorithms is discussed through the numerical experiments. The neighborhood crossover chooses two parents which {{are close to}} each other in the objective space. All the individuals are sorted in order of proximity in the objective space, and then neighborhood shuffle is conducted, which randomly replaces individuals in the population at a fixed width interval of population size. This operation prevents crossing over repeatedly between the same pair of individuals. The width <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> shuffle is the parameter of this operation and this parameter determines the range of the population where individuals are shuffled. Therefore, this parameter affects the quality of the solutions. We implemented the NSGA-II with the neighborhood crossover and examined the effect of the width <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> shuffle to further investigate {{the effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> crossover. The results of the numerical experiment indicated that the effect <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> crossover can be achieved by applying neighborhood crossover to the search population created through copy selection. In addition, the necessity <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> shuffle and an appropriate width <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> shuffle were reviewed...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the associations of mothers’ perception <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and maternal resilience with risk of preterm birth and whether maternal resilience moderated the effect <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality perception. We analyzed data from 10, 758 women with singleton births {{who participated in}} 2010 – 2012 Los Angeles Mommy and Baby surveys. Multilevel logistic regression models assessed the effects of mothers’ perception <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and maternal resilience on preterm birth (yes/no), controlling for potential confounders and economic hardship index, a city-level measure <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality. Interaction terms were assessed for moderation. Mothers’ perception <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and maternal resilience were each uniquely associated with preterm birth, independent of potential confounders (p-values < 0. 05). The risk of preterm birth among mothers who perceived their <b>neighborhood</b> as <b>of</b> poor quality was about 30 % greater compared to mothers who perceived their <b>neighborhood</b> as <b>of</b> good quality; the risk was 12 % greater among mothers with low resilience compared to those with high resilience. Effects <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality were not modified by maternal resilience. The findings suggest that mothers’ perception <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> quality and resilience {{are associated with the}} risk of preterm birth. Further research should explore whether initiatives aimed at improving neighborhood quality and women’s self-esteem may improve birth outcomes...|$|R

The trio headlined the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour with My Chemical Romance, which ran from August to October 2011, with {{additional}} dates scheduled in Canada with Rancid and Against Me!. In 2012 the band embarked on a worldwide 20th Anniversary Tour. The band continued touring in 2012 with their 20th Anniversary Tour, where they performed the rescheduled European dates originally canceled {{in order to continue}} recording. They were scheduled to headline the Bamboozle 2012 Music Festival but cancelled when Barker had to undergo an operation for tonsilitis. The 20th Anniversary Tour extended into Australia for in 2013 as part of the Soundwave festival, as well as 4 sideshows along the east coast with punk acts The Vandals and Sharks. Barker, who still suffers a fear of flying, did not attend; Brooks Wackerman, drummer of Bad Religion at the time, filled-in for Barker's position for the Australian tour.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the U.S. Congress, {{then the}} {{governing}} {{institution of the}} District of Columbia, undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project, {{the first in the}} capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation. In 1946, Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act, which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital. Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped, and how. The RLA was not funded, however, until passage of the Housing Act of 1949. A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings, overcrowding, and threats to public health (such as lack of running indoor water, sewage systems, electricity, central heating, and indoor toilets). Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding. Original plans called for the demolition of almost all structures in Southwest Washington beginning in 1950, but legal challenges led to piecemeal razing of the area until the mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on the relationships between the coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to cross-sectionally and {{longitudinally}} examine the relationship between adolescent perceptions <b>of</b> their <b>neighborhood</b> and time spent in “risky contexts. ” Specifically, the relationship between adolescent perceptions <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> danger and the percent of time spent with older peers or outside was examined. In addition, this study analyzed the relationship between youth perceptions <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> support and the percent time they spent with older peers or outside. All these relationships were also explored in regard to the moderating impact of gender and parental monitoring. An Experience Time Sampling technique (ESM) was utilized to determine how youth spent their time, and questionnaires indicated their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> safety, support, and levels of parental monitoring. Overall, results of the analyses demonstrated that more positive perceptions <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> support and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> danger were significantly associated with more time spent in risky contexts.

5|$|The Bay Area hosts an {{extensive}} freeway and highway {{system that is}} particularly prone to traffic congestion, with one study by Inrix concluding that the Bay Area's traffic was the fourth worst in the world. There are some city streets in San Francisco where gaps occur in the freeway system, partly {{the result of the}} Freeway Revolt, which prevented a freeway-only thoroughfare through San Francisco between the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the western terminus of Interstate 80, and the southern terminus of the Golden Gate Bridge (U.S. Route 101). Additional damage that occurred {{in the wake of the}} 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake resulted in freeway segments being removed instead of being reinforced or rebuilt, leading to the revitalization <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> such as San Francisco's Embarcadero. The greater Bay Area contains the three principal north-south highways in California: Interstate 5, U.S. Route 101, and California State Route 1. U.S. 101 and State Route 1 directly serve the traditional nine-county region, while Interstate 5 bypasses to the east in San Joaquin County to provide a more direct Los Angeles–Sacramento route. Additional local highways connect the various subregions of the Bay Area together.|$|E

40|$|This study {{utilized}} {{a unique}} mixed methodology to examine perceptions <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> characteristics, independent mobility, and child civic engagement among 101 child-caregiver dyads. Children {{between the ages}} of 7 and 13 years completed a neighborhood walk with a member of the research team, identifying neighborhood boundaries, taking pictures of important places, and explaining their day-to-day activities. Responses from a written survey and neighborhood observations complimented the neighborhood walk data.
