5|$|Sicily {{was ruled}} as an {{independent}} kingdom by relatives or cadet branch {{of the house of}} Aragon until 1409 and thence as part of the Crown of Aragon. The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> was ruled by the Angevin ruler René of Anjou until the two thrones were reunited by AlfonsoV of Aragon, after the successful siege <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and the defeat of René on June 6, 1443. Eventually, Alfonso of Aragon divided the two kingdoms during his rule. He gave the rule <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> to his illegitimate son FerdinandI <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> who ruled from 1458 to 1494, {{and the rest of the}} Crown of Aragon and Sicily to Alfonso's brother JohnII of Aragon. From 1494 to 1503 successive kings of France CharlesVIII and LouisXII, who were heirs of Angevins, tried to conquer Naples (see Italian Wars) but failed. Eventually the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> was reunited with the Crown of Aragon. The titles were held by the Aragonese kings of the Crown of Aragon until the end of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg in 1700.|$|E
5|$|All royal {{charters}} issued {{during the}} first six months of Mary's reign emphasized that she had lawfully inherited her father's crown. However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the very idea of a female monarch. They regarded Charles III <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.|$|E

5|$|The {{cardinals}} who {{had turned}} against Pope Urban VI elected a new pope, Clement VII on 20 September 1378, which {{gave rise to the}} Western Schism. Louis acknowledged Urban VI as the legitimate pope and offered him support to fight against his opponents in Italy. As Joanna I <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> decided to join Clement VII's camp, Pope Urban excommunicated and dethroned her on 17 June 1380. The pope acknowledged Charles of Durazzo, who had lived in Louis's court, as the lawful king <b>of</b> <b>Naples.</b> After Charles of Durazzo promised that he would not claim Hungary against Louis's daughters, Louis dispatched him to invade Southern Italy {{at the head of a}} large army. Within a year, Charles of Durazzo occupied the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> and forced Queen Joanna to surrender to him on 26 August 1381.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of April 05 in 1906, {{killed more than}} 100 people and ejected the most lava ever recorded from a Vesuvian eruption. Italian authorities were preparing to hold the 1908 Summer Olympics when Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, devastating the city <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and surrounding comunes. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> requiring a new location for the Olympics to be found.|$|E
5|$|To elevate {{his son to}} Mary's rank, Emperor Charles V ceded to Philip {{the crown}} <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> {{as well as his}} claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Therefore, Mary became Queen <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and titular Queen of Jerusalem upon marriage. Their wedding at Winchester Cathedral on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip could not speak English, and so they spoke in a mixture of Spanish, French, and Latin.|$|E
5|$|Charles III <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> {{landed at}} Senj in Dalmatia in September 1385 and marched to Zagreb. Sigismund of Luxembourg came to Buda and persuaded {{the queen mother}} to give her consent to his {{marriage}} to Mary. The marriage took place in Buda in October, but Sigismund was not crowned king and received no governmental function. The queen mother convoked a new Diet and Mary again confirmed the noblemen's liberties, but the queens' rule remained unpopular. Sigismund left Buda and mortgaged the territories west of the River Vág to his Moravian cousins. Charles <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> had meanwhile left Zagreb, stating {{that he wanted to}} restore peace and public order in Hungary.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Naples and Sicily were reconquered by King Philip V of Spain, a Bourbon, who {{installed}} {{his younger}} son, Duke Charles of Parma, as King CharlesVII <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and Sicily, starting a cadet {{branch of the}} house of Bourbon. In 1799 Napoleon conquered Naples, governed by FerdinandIV <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> (later FerdinandI of the Two Sicilies) at the time. It was formed into the Parthenopaean Republic with French support. Under British pressure, especially from Lord William Bentinck, who was commander of British troops in Sicily, Naples was then handed back to Ferdinand, being forced to create a constitution for the Kingdom of Sicily. The island was under British occupation from 1806-14.|$|E
5|$|Louis was of {{age when}} succeeded {{his father in}} 1342, but his deeply {{religious}} mother exerted a powerful influence on him. He inherited a centralized kingdom and a rich treasury from his father. During {{the first years of}} his reign, Louis launched a crusade against the Lithuanians and restored royal power in Croatia; his troops defeated a Tatar army, expanding his authority towards the Black Sea. When his brother, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, husband of Queen Joanna I <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> was assassinated in 1345, Louis accused the queen of his murder and punishing her became the principal goal of his foreign policy. He launched two campaigns to the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> between 1347 and 1350. His troops occupied large territories on both occasions, and Louis adopted the styles of Neapolitan sovereigns (including the title of King of Sicily and Jerusalem), but the Holy See never recognized his claim. Louis's arbitrary acts and atrocities committed by his mercenaries made his rule unpopular in Southern Italy. He withdrew all his troops from the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> in 1351.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{married his}} first wife, Catherine of Poděbrady, in 1461. She died in {{childbirth}} in 1464. His second wife, Beatrice <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> whom he married in 1476, was infertile. In {{the last decade}} of his life, Matthias ensured the succession of his illegitimate son, John Corvinus, to the throne of Hungary. Matthias died on 6 April 1490.|$|E
5|$|Matthias's {{third wife}} Beatrice <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> {{was born in}} 1457. Their {{engagement}} was announced in Breslau on 30 October 1474, during the siege of the town by Casimir IV and Vladislaus Jagiellon. Her dowry amounted to 200,000 gold pieces. Beatrice survived her husband and returned to Naples where she died in 1508.|$|E
5|$|Roger {{spent most}} of the decade, {{beginning}} with his coronation and ending with the Assizes of Ariano, enacting a series of laws with which Roger intended to centralise the government, fending off multiple invasions and quelling rebellions by his premier vassals: Grimoald of Bari, RobertII of Capua, Ranulf of Alife, SergiusVII <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and others.|$|E
5|$|San Marco , {{named after}} Saint Mark, {{the patron saint}} of Venice, was ordered on 18 September 1905 and laid down on 2 January 1907 at the Regio Cantieri di Castellammare di Stabia in Castellammare di Stabia, on the Bay <b>of</b> <b>Naples.</b> The ship was {{launched}} on 20 December 1907 and completed on 7 February 1911.|$|E
5|$|After 1302 {{the island}} kingdom was {{sometimes}} called the Kingdom of Trinacria. Often the kingship was vested in another monarch such as the King of Aragon, the King of Spain or the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1816 the island Kingdom of Sicily merged with the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In 1861 the Two Sicilies were amalgamated with Sardinia and several northern city-states and duchies to form the Kingdom of Italy.|$|E
5|$|After the War of the Polish Succession {{broke out}} in 1733, Charles marched a Spanish army south and {{defeated}} the Austrians holding the kingdoms <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and Sicily. Pursuant to preliminary peace terms negotiated in 1735 (but not finalized until after Gian Gastone's death with the 1738 Treaty of Vienna), Charles surrendered Parma and the claim to the Tuscan throne to Francis III of Lorraine in exchange for being crowned king <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and Sicily. (Francis was forced to surrender Lorraine to Stanisław Leszczyński, the losing claimant to the Polish throne.) Neither the Grand Duke nor Francis III were consulted. The latter was reluctant to cede his homeland to France, but the Holy Roman Emperor (soon to be his father-in-law) compelled him. Gian Gastone was angry; he had become quite attached to the Infante-Duke, and didn't like {{the prospect of a}} foreigner ruling Tuscany. Spain accordingly withdrew its troops from Tuscany in January 1737; 6,000 Austrians took their place on Francis's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Andrew III of Hungary {{made his}} {{maternal}} uncle, Alberto Morosini, Duke of Slavonia, in July 1299, stirring up the Slavonian and Croatian noblemen to revolt. A powerful Croatian baron, Paul Šubić, sent his brother, George, to Italy in early 1300 to convince Charles II <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> {{to send his}} grandson to Hungary to claim the throne in person. The king <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> accepted the proposal and borrowed 1,300 ounces of gold from Florentine bankers to finance Charles's journey. A Neapolitan knight of French origin, Philip Drugeth, accompanied the twelve-year-old Charles to Hungary. They landed at Split in Dalmatia in August 1300. From Split, Paul Šubić escorted him to Zagreb where Ugrin Csák swore loyalty to Charles. Charles's opponent, AndrewIII of Hungary, died on 14January 1301. Charles hurried to Esztergom where the Archbishop-elect, Gregory Bicskei, crowned him with a provisional crown before 13May. However, most Hungarians considered Charles's coronation unlawful because customary law required {{that it should have}} been performed with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Székesfehérvár.|$|E
5|$|Born in Naples, Italy, {{he came to}} the United States in 1895 {{with his}} parents at the age of nine. His father Francesco Cotillo, had been a caterer in Naples. The family {{originally}} came from Avellino (Montella), in the hinterland <b>of</b> <b>Naples.</b> The family settled in East Harlem in East 113th Street among the increasing numbers of Italian immigrants. His father took up catering again and opened a popular pastry and confectionery shop. He has been credited with introducing the Italian ice cream spumoni into the United States.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz were {{fighting}} against the anti-French forces from the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> defeating them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December. Soon afterward, supplies from the captured Gaeta fortress allowed {{the creation of a}} Legion cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski. The Poles then fought at Magliano, Falari, Calvi and Capua before Naples capitulated on 23 January.|$|E
5|$|Charles I <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with Split and Šibenik against Omiš pirates in June and September 1274. The citizens of Omiš responded by {{an alliance with}} Venice in August, in accordance with a 20-year peace treaty signed by knezes Radoš, Bogdan, Juraj and Semen. This triggered conflict on the land and sea in 1275. The activities in the intermediate years are unknown, besides that in April 1278 the islands of Hvar and Brač recognized Venetian authority, and the Omiš in 1281.|$|E
5|$|Cossa succeeded Alexander V as John XXIII in 1410. John XXIII was {{acknowledged}} as pope by France, England, Bohemia, Prussia, Portugal, {{parts of the}} Holy Roman Empire, and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and Venice; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the Kingdoms of Aragon, Castile, and Scotland and Gregory XII was still favored by Ladislaus <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> Carlo I Malatesta, the princes of Bavaria, Louis III, Elector of the Palatinate, and parts of Germany and Poland.|$|E
5|$|During her regency in Hungary, Elizabeth faced several rebellions led by John Horvat and John of Palisna, who {{attempted}} {{to take advantage of}} Mary's insecure reign. In 1385, they invited King CharlesIII <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> to depose Mary and assume the crown. Elizabeth responded by having Charles murdered two months after his coronation, in 1386. She had the crown restored to her daughter and established herself as regent once more, only to be captured, imprisoned and ultimately strangled by her enemies.|$|E
5|$|Ernuszt {{was one of}} Matthias Corvinus' closest advisors. He {{urged the}} Holy See to grant the Zebegény Abbey in Baranya County to him in 1483. The king gave him a {{precious}} bowl in 1486. In the same year, Ernuszt (who spoke German) was made the captain-general or the deputy of the captain-general of Archduchy of Austria, which had recently been occupied by the king. Ernuszt loaned 1000 gold florins to Matthias's queen, Beatrice <b>of</b> <b>Naples.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{a revolt}} against Angevin rule, {{known as the}} Sicilian Vespers, threw off Charles of Anjou's rule of the island of Sicily. The Angevins managed to {{maintain}} control in the mainland part of the kingdom, which became a separate entity also styled Kingdom of Sicily, although it is {{commonly referred to as}} the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> after its capital. The island became a separate kingdom under the Crown of Aragon.|$|E
5|$|In 1409, Jelena {{decided to}} travel to Venice to {{negotiate}} peace in person. At the end of May, she arrived in Dubrovnik but {{had to wait for}} almost two months because her hosts warned her that there were Napolitan galleys in the Adriatic Sea. On 9 July 1409, while she was still waiting in Dubrovnik, Venice purchased the entire Dalmatian coast from Ladislaus <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> for 100,000 ducats. The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> was not a threat to Venetians anymore. By gaining the Dalmatian coast, Venetians further increased their influence and power in the region of the Adriatic Sea, which made Jelena's negotiating position difficult. When she finally arrived in Venice at the end of July, she was financially broken because of her long voyage. The Venetians had to support her with three ducats a day during negotiations which lasted for the next three months. On 26 October 1409, a year-long peace agreement with the Venetian doge, Michele Steno, was signed without territorial changes for any of the parties. Jelena traveled back to Zeta through Dubrovnik where she received 100 ducats worth of presents. Although both she and the Venetian representative swore on the Gospel to respect the truce, in reality there was no peace.|$|E
5|$|In 535, a small Byzantine {{expedition}} to Sicily met with easy success, but the Goths soon stiffened their resistance, and victory {{did not come}} until 540, when Belisarius captured Ravenna, after successful sieges <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> and Rome. In 535–536, Theodahad sent Pope Agapetus I to Constantinople to request the removal of Byzantine forces from Sicily, Dalmatia, and Italy. Although Agapetus failed in his mission to sign a peace with Justinian, he succeeded in having the Monophysite Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople denounced, despite empress Theodora's support and protection.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{proposed}} to renounce the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> if Clement dethroned Joanna. After the pope refused, Louis departed {{for his second}} Neapolitan campaign in April 1350. He suppressed a mutiny that occurred among his mercenaries while he and his troops {{were waiting for the}} arrival of further troops in Barletta. While marching towards Naples, he faced resistance at many towns because his vanguards, which were under the command of Stephen Lackfi, had become notorious for their cruelty.|$|E
5|$|Louis sent small expeditions {{one after}} one to Italy at the {{beginning}} of his war against Joanna, because he did not want to harass the Italians who had suffered from a famine the previous year. His first troops departed under the command of Nicholas Vásári, Bishop of Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), on 24 April 1347. Louis also hired German mercenaries. He departed from Visegrád on 11 November. After marching through Udine, Verona, Modena, Bologna, Urbino, and Perugia, he entered the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> on 24 December near L'Aquila, which had yielded to him.|$|E
5|$|On 27 September 1458, Alfonso V of Aragon, Skanderbeg's most {{important}} and helpful ally after the stipulation of the Treaty of Gaeta, died. In 1448, as gesture of friendship with Alfonso, Skanderbeg sent a detachment of Albanian troops commanded by General Demetrios Reres to Crotone to quell a rebellion against Alfonso. The next year, many of these men were allowed to settle four villages in Sicily which Alfonso controlled. Upon hearing of his ally's death, Skanderbeg sent emissaries to the new King <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> Ferdinand I, to give condolence for his father's death, but also to congratulate him on his accession to the throne <b>of</b> <b>Naples.</b> The succession was not without turbulence, however: René d'Anjou laid claim to the throne since his family had controlled Naples before Aragon had taken control of it, and also because Ferdinand was Alfonso's illegitimate son. The Southern Italian nobility, many of Angevin background, supported René d'Anjou over the Aragonese Ferdinand. Among them was Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini, the Prince of Taranto, and Jacopo Piccinino, a famed condottieri who had been invited by the Angevins. Francisco Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who was wary of a French presence in Italy, sided with Ferdinand and sent his nephew, Alessandro Sforza, to command his army in southern Italy. Pope Calixtus, a Spaniard who wished to see his compatriot in control <b>of</b> <b>Naples,</b> was {{in no position to}} help the weak Ferdinand, so he turned to Skanderbeg for help. However, by that time, Piccinino and his men had conquered all of southern Italy except Naples, Capua, Aversa, Gaeta, Troia, and Barletta, where Ferdinand was besieged.|$|E
5|$|On 67 July 1933, Trento {{took part}} in a major fleet review held in the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> for Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini. Trento became the flagship of the 2nd Division, 1st Squadron on 2 December. The ship visited Durazzo on 2326 June 1934, and on 1 July, became the flagship of the 3rd Division. She made another cruise in the eastern Mediterranean from 8 to 20 March 1935, during which she made calls in Rhodes and Leros. On 18 June, Trieste temporarily relieved Trento as the divisional flagship. Another naval review was held in the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> on 27 November 1936, to honor the Regent of Hungary, Miklós Horthy, who was visiting Italy at the time. Trieste again replaced Trento as the flagship on 27 January 1937. From 10 to 12 March 1937, Mussolini took a short tour of Italian Libya aboard the heavy cruiser , escorted by Trento. The two cruisers stopped in Benghazi, Tripoli, and Ra's Lanuf during the trip.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} the Allies, Austria agreed to send a force to the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> to depose Murat in February 1815, when it became {{apparent}} that Murat corresponded with Napoleon I, which was explicitly forbidden by a recent treaty. Murat never actually wrote to Napoleon, but Louis, intent on restoring the Neapolitan Bourbons at any cost, forged the correspondence, and subsidised the Austrian expedition with 25million francs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{portions}} of current NY21 south <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> had carried designations prior to 1930. In 1924, the Andover–Hornell segment was designated {{as part of}} NY17; at the same time, the short piece between modern NY415 {{and the center of}} Wayland became part of NY4. By 1926, the portion connecting Wayland to Naples was included in the new NY52. NY4 was renumbered to NY2 in 1927 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US4.|$|E
5|$|Slapstick {{was in part}} an {{operation}} of deception, to divert German forces away from the main Allied landings at Salerno on the same day, while also attempting to capture Taranto and Brindisi intact. The main value of Taranto was its large port. Its seizure would, with the expected capture <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> in the west by the Americans, give the Allies supply points on both Italian coasts.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481. A {{civil war}} ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons Bayezid II and Cem. Defeated, Cem fled to Rhodes, where the Knights Hospitaller {{kept him in}} custody. Matthias claimed Cem's custody {{in the hope of}} using him to gain {{concessions}} from Bayezid, but Venice and Pope Innocent VIII strongly opposed this plan. In late 1481, Hungarian auxiliary troops supported Matthias's father-in-law Ferdinand I <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> to reoccupy Otranto, which had been lost to the Ottomans the year before.|$|E
5|$|The Adriatic {{campaign}} {{was a minor}} theatre of war during the Napoleonic Wars in which a succession of small British Royal Navy squadrons and independent cruisers harried the combined naval forces of the First French Empire, the Kingdom of Italy, the Illyrian Provinces and the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> between 1807 and 1814 in the Adriatic Sea. Italy, Naples and Illyria were all controlled either directly or via proxy by the French Emperor Napoleon I, who had seized them at the Treaty of Pressburg {{in the aftermath of}} the War of the Third Coalition.|$|E
5|$|The two men saw an {{extraordinarily}} dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and {{a request by}} a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon {{the house for the}} courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay <b>of</b> <b>Naples.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{holding the}} signoria of Florence, Robert <b>of</b> <b>Naples</b> (12771343) had {{the eastern part}} of the Bargello in Florence constructed, where he had his vicar the Count of Battifolle reside. Villani writes in 1316 that Robert's vicar oversaw the {{construction}} of a large part of the new palace, which would suggest Robert's vicar had a great amount of influence in the construction of the eastern addition of the Palazzo del Podestà, including its Magdalen Chapel.|$|E
