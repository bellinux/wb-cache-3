5|$|According to Avery, Donatello's Ascension <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Giving of the Keys to St. Peter {{may have}} been {{intended}} to share {{the front of the}} sarcophagus, further strengthening the papal associations, which were created by dating Cossa's death using the ancient Roman Calends of January, which was uncommon on Florentine tombs, but was used in papal ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the Baroque styled tabernacle is almost entirely adorned with decorations, such as curiously shaped niche shelves, floating drapes and many cherubs. Carvings of fruits such as grapes and pomegranates have been created to {{in the shape of}} ritual offerings, symbolizing the Blood <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church. Among the floral elements, roses, daisies, and various types of four-petalled flowers can be found, including the indigenous chalchihuite.|$|E
5|$|In such studies, and {{in general}} Latter Day Saint parlance, the -suffixed terms Josephite and Brighamite {{have been used for}} the Missouri-based Community <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Utah-based LDS Church respectively; these terms have {{sometimes}} been used to distinguish groups of denominations as well. Those denominations within each group share a common ancestry and basic beliefs that are different from groups sharing other provenances. The present article, in a similar fashion, distinguishes among groups of denominations by use of commonly understood names such as Mormon fundamentalist or else by short descriptions that often reference a founder of the first church within a factional group–for example, Joseph Smith III in reference to Community of Christ as well as various churches and factions that trace their origin to it.|$|E

5|$|Ordained Catholics, as well {{as members}} of the laity, may enter into consecrated life either on an {{individual}} basis, as a hermit or consecrated virgin, or by joining an institute of consecrated life (a religious institute or a secular institute) in which to take vows confirming their desire to follow the three evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty and obedience. Examples of institutes of consecrated life are the Benedictines, the Carmelites, the Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Legionaries <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Sisters of Mercy.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Matteo Bandello {{observed}} Leonardo at {{work and}} wrote that some days he would paint from dawn till dusk without stopping to eat and then not paint {{for three or four}} days at a time. This was beyond the comprehension of the prior of the convent, who hounded him until Leonardo asked Ludovico to intervene. Vasari describes how Leonardo, troubled over his ability to adequately depict the faces <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> traitor Judas, told the Duke that he might be obliged to use the prior as his model.|$|E

50|$|There {{has been}} much {{criticism}} against ECyD because of its close relationship with <b>the</b> controversial Legionaries <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> Regnum Christi. <b>The</b> Controversies surrounding <b>the</b> Legion <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>and</b> especially <b>the</b> sexual scandals of Marcial Maciel have drastically lessened the amount of members of ECyD.|$|R

5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming <b>of</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with his RGS duties Markham served {{as secretary of}} the Hakluyt Society until 1886, subsequently becoming that society's president. As part of his work for this body, Markham was responsible for many translations from Spanish into English of rare accounts of travel, in particular those relating to Peru. In time scholars would express doubts about the quality of some of these translations, finding them prepared in haste and lacking in rigour. Nevertheless, this work ran to 22volumes in the society's publications. In 1873 Markham had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in subsequent years received several overseas honours, including the Portuguese Order <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Order of the Rose of Brazil. He briefly considered, but did not pursue, the idea of a parliamentary career.|$|E
