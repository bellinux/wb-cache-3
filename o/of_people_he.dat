5|$|Fleming made {{a number}} of revelations about Bond's {{character}} within the book, including showing an emotional side that was not present in the previous stories. In common with Fleming's other Bond stories, he used the names and places <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>he</b> knew or had heard of and Blofeld's research station on Piz Gloria was based on Schloss Mittersill, which the Nazis had turned into a research establishment examining the Asiatic races.|$|E

When Karan understands {{that he has been}} shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her. They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>he</b> came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} Fleming's other Bond stories, {{he used the}} names <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>he</b> knew, or knew of, {{throughout}} his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after British architect Ernő Goldfinger. Upon learning {{of the use of}} his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue over the use of the name, before the matter was settled out of court. Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within the book, and the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson.|$|E

5|$|M is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Ian Fleming's James Bond book and film series; {{the character is}} the Head of the Secret Intelligence Service—also known as MI6—and is Bond's superior. Fleming based the character on a number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>he</b> knew who commanded sections of British intelligence. M {{has appeared in the}} novels by Fleming and seven continuation authors, as well as appearing in twenty-four films. In the Eon Productions series of films, M has been portrayed by four actors: Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes, the incumbent; in the two independent productions, M was played by John Huston, David Niven and Edward Fox.|$|E
5|$|Many myths {{surrounding}} vampires originated {{during the}} medieval period. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The Old Norse draugr is another medieval {{example of an}} undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampire-like beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>He</b> linked this event {{to the lack of}} a shmirah (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|The general's objectivity, however, {{has often}} been questioned. Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his lack of objectivity and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>he</b> had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E
50|$|Vilner's Soviet loyalist {{line was}} highly {{appreciated}} by the USSR; in 1978 {{he was awarded}} the Order <b>of</b> Friendship <b>of</b> <b>Peoples.</b> <b>He</b> did not accept perestroika and regarded the fall of communism in the USSR as a coup.|$|R

Soon after Dreams From My Father was published he went into politics, entering the Illinois Senate. In 2004 he was chosen to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. In Obama's 2006 memoir The Audacity of Hope, he recollects that on being chosen to deliver this speech, he pondered the topics on which he had previously campaigned, and on major issues then affecting the nation, before thinking about the variety <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>he</b> had met while campaigning, all endeavouring in different ways to improve {{their own lives and}} to serve their country.|$|E
5|$|Posing as a nurse, Eva wheels Diabolik past groups <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>He</b> sneaks {{into the}} morgue where Valmont's {{body has been}} cremated, {{collects}} the eleven emeralds from his ashes and escapes. The police discover that Diabolik is still alive and offer a million-dollar reward for him. He reacts by blowing up the tax offices. Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it difficult to steal, and the block is loaded on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck on the tracks and re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed. It explodes when the train arrives and the gold falls into the water below. Diabolik and Eva collect it and return it to their hideout.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} publisher, Waugh {{was educated}} at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford, and briefly worked as a {{schoolmaster}} {{before he became a}} full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends, and developed a taste for country house society. In the 1930s, he travelled extensively, often as a special newspaper correspondent in which capacity he reported from Abyssinia {{at the time of the}} 1935 Italian invasion. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War (1939–1945), first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>he</b> encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown, which occurred in the early 1950s.|$|E

25|$|By most accounts, Löhe was {{an ideal}} pastor who interacted {{well with a}} variety of {{different}} classes <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>He</b> focused his theological studies on the Lutheran Confessions and put considerable thought into the celebration of Holy Communion as the center of congregational life. Löhe was especially interested in old Lutheran liturgies. Löhe was also noted for his ontological view of the pastoral office, which he believed existed independently of congregational call but as a direct appointment from Jesus Christ through ordination in opposition to C.F.W. Walther. He combined all these ideas with a heavy insistence on social renewal.|$|E

He was a member of Servants of India society (which included Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, Gopal Krishna Gokhle) which asked all its members to shun accumulation of private property and remain in public life as servants <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> <b>He</b> was the first railway minister who resigned from office following a major train accident as he felt moral responsibility.|$|E

Grauel ordered his assistant, one Neuman, to organize an execution. On July 8, 9, and 10, Grauel's men shot 100 men, almost entirely Jews, on each day. They were transported to the execution site from the Women's Prison in groups of 20.|$|E
