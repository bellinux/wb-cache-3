30|$|Logistic and taxonomic {{support for}} this joint study between Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (Kew) and Illinois College was {{facilitated}} by Kew Madagascar Conservation Centre (KMCC) and Parc Botanique et Zoologique de Tsimbazaza (PBZT). During the 5 -year project, more than 40 taxa spanning 24 genera were selected for study involving collection and movement of live material (roots, seeds) from Madagascar to labs in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA). Root samples were shared between the two partners to ensure that live material could be processed {{in a timely manner}} leading to the isolation of Rhizoctonia-like fungi from root pelotons. To facilitate the legal collection and international transport of orchid material from Madagascar to the UK (Kew) and USA (Illinois), a CITES permit was obtained which allowed three tubes, each containing seedlings and mature roots per species, to be collected. The rarity of plants in the wild necessitated further restrictions, namely that collections be limited to three each of juvenile and mature plants. Depending on the species and its availability, 1 – 5 roots per specimen were collected. These were accompanied by a <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificate</b> which was secured prior to departure from Madagascar. The CITES permit and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificate</b> were delivered by the Direction Generale des Forets (DGF Nanisana Antananarivo) and Service de la Quarantaine et de I’Inspection Nanisana, respectively. For import of root samples into the USA, an additional permit (PPQ 526) was obtained from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), as the US Government regards all orchid endophytes in the Rhizoctonia complex to be plant pathogens. Samples entering the UK were accompanied by a <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>Certificate</b> issued in Madagascar, and a UK Letter of Authority.|$|R
40|$|Intensive import/export {{quarantine}} {{operations were}} commenced in 1948 by the Forest Service with costs being {{met by the}} taxpayers. The first Regulations came in 1956 and contained a simple schedule of fees. These were extended in 1966 but still covered only sawn timber, box snooks, and timber in round form. In 1986 the Government decided that, under its "user-pays " policy, net funding for forestry services (including quarantine) would be reduced to zero over 5 years. New fee schedules were introduced in 1987 by the Ministry of Forestry. There was client resistance to paying for regulatory quarantine inspections. Some "national good " content was recognised by the Government. The impact of user-pays may initially have had some detrimental effect on import inspection effectiveness. Some countries do not need <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificates</b> for exports. Inspections ceased for these destinations and exporter costs were consequently reduced. At entry ports in Japan and Korea fumigation or some other form of sterilisation is automatically carried out. On the other hand, forest produce exported to Australia must meet very precise quarantine inspection standards, and some other countries demand a <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificate</b> based on the International Plant Protection Convention format. The introduction of user-pays also had an initial impact on forest health surveys. The Government may reorganise border control services...|$|R

PExD will support PPQ’s Phytosanitary Issues Management (PIM) Export Services (ES) with the task of entering export summariesfor foreign countries.

Once a subject has been identified, experts representing the member countries meet {{in order to develop}} s draft standard which is submitted to a wider country consultation before final approval. Industry participation in the entire process is encouraged. Examples of standards developed so far include standards for commodities such as potatoes, stone and pome fruit trees, grapevines, citrus and plants for planting; standards for the regulation of biocontrol agents, products of biotechnology and non-Apis pollinating insects; standards for other regulated articles such as wood packing materials and other generic standards such as accreditation of officials to issue <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificates.</b>|$|R

In a landmark case, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled on 5 July 1994 against the British practice of importing produce from Northern Cyprus based on certificates of origin and <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>certificates</b> granted by the de facto authorities. The ECJ decided that only goods bearing certificates of origin from the internationally recognized Republic of Cyprus could be imported by EU member states. The decision resulted in a considerable decrease of Turkish Cypriot exports to the EU: from $36.4 million (or 66.7% of total Turkish Cypriot exports) in 1993 to $24.7 million in 1996 (or 35% of total exports) in 1996. Even so, the EU continues to be the second-largest trading partner of Northern Cyprus, with a 24.7% share of total imports and 35% share of total exports.|$|R
