25|$|The {{consumption}} of wine by Parisians increased during the Second Empire, while the quality decreased. It was unusual {{for women to}} drink, but for both the workers and {{the middle and upper}} classes, wine was part of the daily meal. The number of debits de boissons, bars where wine was sold, doubled. <b>Ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> was produced by mixing several different wines of different qualities from different places in a cask and shaking it. The wine sold as ordinary Mâcon was made by mixing wine from Beaujolais, Tavel and Bergerac. The best wines were treated much more respectfully; in 1855, Napoleon III ordered the classification of Bordeaux wines by place of origin and quality, so that they could be displayed and sold at the Paris Universal Exposition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{major public}} festivals {{concerning}} wine production {{were the two}} Vinalia. At the Vinalia prima ("first Vinalia") of April 23, ordinary men and women sampled the previous year's vintage of <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> in Venus' name, while the Roman elite offered a generous libation of wine to Jupiter, {{in the hope of}} good weather for the next year's growth. The Vinalia Rustica of [...] August 19, originally a rustic Latin harvest festival, celebrated the grape harvest, and the growth and fertility of all garden crops; its patron deity may have been Venus, or Jupiter, or both.|$|E
2500|$|The euphemistic use of wine at this festival {{has been}} {{variously}} {{described as a}} substitution for milk and honey, relatively late in the cult's development; as a theologically absurdity; and as an ingenious justification for behaviours that would be considered unacceptable outside this specific religious sphere. Fauna's myths illustrate the potential of wine {{as an agent of}} sexual transgression; wine was thought to be an invention of Liber-Dionysus, who was present as the male principle in certain [...] "soft fruits", including semen and grapes; and <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> was produced under the divine patronage of Venus, the goddess of love and sexual desire. Its aphrodisiac effects were well known.|$|E
40|$|Since 1970 nearly all-Mediterranean {{countries}} of the EC had undertaken measures to regulate their domestic market for <b>ordinary</b> <b>wines,</b> {{in the context of}} constant fall in domestic demand for that product. This paper provides an empirical modelling framework for understanding the effect on the domestic demand for <b>ordinary</b> <b>wines</b> of the orientation price policy in the case of France. The result of a static demand co- integrating equation is compared with those obtained from alternative distributed lag and dynamic versions. It is shown that a non-static specification can result from a consideration of the effects in the short-run on demand responses of the price orientation mechanism. A restricted version of the static equation is tested for constancy using the Hansen's test of parameter instability. We reject parameter stability, which confirms the trend followed by the series of <b>ordinary</b> <b>wines</b> over the sample period and supports the use of alternative specification for the demand equation. Across specifications, demand for <b>ordinary</b> <b>wines</b> is well explained by own-price changes, the price of juice and expenditures, especially in the short run. We also find evidence of habit persistence and a significant difference between unobserved and actual farm to retail spreads. A structural parameter associated to the degree of influence of the price support policy is estimated. Its statistical significance leads to the main conclusion that in the short run the presence of price regulation reduces demand responses after a change in the retail prices of <b>ordinary</b> <b>wines.</b> common agricultural policy, wine market, structural change, co-integration...|$|R
25|$|Wine was a {{basic part}} of the Parisian diet, ranking with bread and meat. Fine wines arrived from Bordeaux, <b>ordinary</b> <b>wines</b> {{were brought to the}} city in large casks from Burgundy and Provence; lesser quality wines came from {{vineyards}} just outside the city, in Montmartre and Belleville. Beer consumption was small, was only eight percent of that of wine, and cider only three percent. The most common strong alcoholic beverage was eau-de-vie, with as much as twenty-seven percent alcohol. It was most popular among the working class Parisians.|$|R
50|$|Another {{explanation}} {{that has been}} offered is that Mayor Kir revived it during {{a year in which}} the <b>ordinary</b> white <b>wine</b> of the region was inferior and the creme de cassis helped to disguise the fact.|$|R
2500|$|Myrtle {{was thought}} a {{particularly}} potent aphrodisiac. The female pudendum, particularly the clitoris, {{was known as}} murtos (myrtle). As goddess of love and sex, Venus played an essential role at Roman prenuptial rites and wedding nights, so myrtle and roses were used in bridal bouquets. Marriage itself was not a seduction but a lawful condition, under Juno's authority; so myrtle was excluded from the bridal crown. Venus was also a patron of the ordinary, everyday wine drunk by most Roman men and women; the seductive powers of wine were well known. In the rites to Bona Dea, a goddess of female chastity, Venus, myrtle and anything male were not only excluded, but unmentionable. The rites allowed women to drink the strongest, sacrificial wine, otherwise reserved for the Roman gods and Roman men; the women euphemistically {{referred to it as}} [...] "honey". Under these special circumstances, they could get virtuously, religiously drunk on strong wine, safe from Venus' temptations. Outside of this context, <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> (that is, Venus' wine) tinctured with myrtle oil was thought particularly suitable for women.|$|E
2500|$|Fixed {{prices on}} goods were rare {{during the first}} Empire; almost every product or service was subject to bargaining. However, bread prices were set by the government, {{and the price of}} a loaf of four pounds ranged between fifty and ninety centimes during the Empire. A {{kilogram}} of beef, depending on quality, cost between 95 and 115 centimes; a liter of <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> from Macon, between 68-71 centimes. A pair of silk stockings for a woman cost 10 francs, a pair of a man's leather shoes cost 11 to 14 francs. The Emperor's famous hats, purchased at the hat maker Poupard, cost sixty francs each. A bath in a bath-house cost 1.25 francs, a haircut for a woman 1.10 francs, a consultation with a doctor cost 3-4 francs. The price of room for two persons on the third floor in the low-income Saint-Jacques neighborhood was 36 francs a year. The average rent of modest-income Parisians was about 69 francs a year; the wealthiest one-eighth of Parisians paid rents of more than 150 francs a year; in 1805 the sculptor Moitte, with a household of seven persons, paid annual rent of 1500 francs for an apartment with a grand salon and bedroom overlooking the Seine, two other bedrooms, dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and cave, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.|$|E
60|$|I {{have nothing}} more to say of Arezzo, except that, finding the <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> very bad, as black as ink, and tasting {{as if it had}} tar and vinegar in it, we called for a bottle of Monte Pulciano, and were {{exceedingly}} gladdened and mollified thereby.|$|E
50|$|Bolgheri {{became an}} internationally known region {{following}} {{an event in}} 1974 arranged by Decanter where a 6-year-old Sassicaia won over an assortment of Bordeaux wines.

40|$|Romania is well {{recognized}} for the wine consumption, vineyards {{and for its}} specific important varieties of grapes. Accordingly to the statistical data (EUROSTAT), in Romania the gross grape annual consumption for 2008 was 5. 532 kg / inhabitant and 25. 379 l wine / inhabitant. The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze by comparison certain types of wines from Romania in order to underline the influence of the raw material and technology on the total quality of the final product. For this, there were selected home made <b>wines,</b> <b>ordinary</b> <b>wines</b> and also superior wines, red and white. The investigated parameters were: alcoholic grade, total acidity and pH, total and reduced sugars, sulphur dioxide, superior alcohols content and also sensorial analysis of the wine samples...|$|R

60|$|But, when I {{was clear}} of the Custom House on the other side, and when I began to make the dust fly on the thirsty French roads, and when the twigsome trees by the wayside (which, I suppose, never will grow leafy, for they never did) guarded {{here and there a}} dusty soldier, or field labourer, baking on a heap of broken stones, sound asleep in a fiction of shade, I began to recover my {{travelling}} spirits. Coming upon the breaker of the broken stones, in a hard, hot, shining hat, on which the sun played at a distance as on a burning-glass, I felt that now, indeed, I was in the dear old France of my affections. I should have known it, without the well-remembered bottle of rough <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine,</b> the cold roast fowl, the loaf, and the pinch of salt, on which I lunched with unspeakable satisfaction, from one of the stuffed pockets of the chariot.|$|E

50|$|The {{wine was}} {{delivered}} in large barrels from vineyards in Beaujolais, Cahors, Burgundy, and the Touraine; {{they could be}} told apart because each region had a different {{size and shape of}} barrel. The wines were frequently mixed to make an <b>ordinary</b> table <b>wine.</b> These were the wines commonly served in homes, the taverns and less-expensive eating places of Paris. In 1818 the Halle took in and taxed 752,795 hectoliters of wine, or about one hundred liters per year for every resident of Paris.|$|R
2500|$|Vinalia urbana (April 23), a {{wine festival}} shared by Venus and Jupiter, {{king of the}} gods. Venus was patron of [...] "profane" [...] wine, for {{everyday}} human use. Jupiter was patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine, and controlled the weather on which the autumn grape-harvest would depend. At this festival, {{men and women alike}} drank the new vintage of <b>ordinary,</b> non-sacral <b>wine</b> in honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with this gift. Upper-class women gathered at Venus's Capitoline temple, where a libation of the previous year's vintage, sacred to Jupiter, was poured into a nearby ditch. Common girls (vulgares puellae) and prostitutes gathered at Venus' temple just outside the Colline gate, where they offered her myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches and asked her for [...] "beauty and popular favour", and to be made [...] "charming and witty".|$|R
60|$|The Fair {{wound up}} with a ball. Respecting the {{particular}} night of the week on which the ball took place, I decline to commit myself; merely mentioning that it was held in a stable-yard so very close to the railway, that it was a mercy the locomotive did not set fire to it. (In Scotland, I suppose, it would have done so.) There, in a tent prettily decorated with looking-glasses and a myriad of toy flags, the people danced all night. It was not an expensive recreation, the price of a double ticket for a cavalier and lady being one and threepence in English money, and even of that small sum fivepence was reclaimable for 'consommation:' which word I venture to translate into refreshments of no greater strength, at the strongest, than <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> made hot, with sugar and lemon in it. It was a ball of great good humour and of great enjoyment, though very many of the dancers must have been as poor as the fifteen subjects of the P. Salcy Family.|$|E
5000|$|Tokajské samorodné suché (samorodné {{derived from}} a Slovak word meaning [...] "the way it was grown", suché means [...] "dry"): Samorodné wine is set apart from <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine</b> {{in that it is}} made from bunches which contain a {{considerable}} proportion of botrytised grapes. Because of this, Samorodné is typically higher in extract than <b>ordinary</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E

25|$|Red wine {{may offer}} health {{benefits}} {{more so than}} white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin, and only red wine is fermented with skins. The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact with grape skins is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. <b>Ordinary</b> non-muscadine red <b>wine</b> contains between 0.2 and 5.8mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented with the skins, allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol. By contrast, a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins.|$|R
40|$|Very {{different}} commodity chains {{had been}} established over the centuries in France to produce and sell wines as diverse as champagne, fine old clarets, or <b>ordinary</b> table <b>wines.</b> The major shortages caused by the vine disease phylloxera after 1875 forced merchants to search for new sources of supply, often in foreign countries or through the production of artificial wines. When domestic production revived, however, the recovery was not accompanied by a noticeable reduction in these new supplies, {{with the result that}} prices, as well as growers' profitability, fell sharply {{after the turn of the}} twentieth century, strengthening the merchants' power in the various commodity chains. To overcome this situation, growers in three very different wine-producing areas, namely the Midi, Bordeaux, and Champagne, used their political influence to achieve government intervention in order to control fraud and establish regional appellations or producer cooperatives, which helped them win back some of their market power from merchants. ...|$|R
5000|$|Equally {{significant}} is a passage {{preserved in the}} writings of Teles, who tells how Metrocles as a young student of the Lyceum and the Academy could not keep up with the extravagant life-style requirements:When he was studying with Theophrastus and Xenocrates, although many things were being sent to him from home, he was in constant fear of dying from hunger and was always destitute and in want. But when he later changed over to Crates, he could feed even another person though nothing was sent from home. For in the former case he had to have shoes,... then a cloak, a following of slaves, and a grand house; for the common table he had to see that the breads were pure, the delicacies above the <b>ordinary,</b> the <b>wine</b> sweet, the entertainment appropriate, so that here there was much expense. For among them such a way of life was judged to be 'liberal.' ...|$|R

To speak frankly, the cider-making is the more picturesque sight of the two, and the new, sweet cider an infinitely better drink than the <b>ordinary,</b> unripe Tuscan <b>wine.</b> Such as it is, however, the latter fills thousands upon thousands of small, flat barrels, and, still growing thinner and sharper, loses the little life it had, as wine, and becomes apotheosized as a more praiseworthy vinegar.|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century some of the less {{developed}} countries of Southern Europe often faced major problems when they sought to increase their exports of primary products. Such problems were a consequence of the tariff policies implemented by a number of their trading partners. In this article we analyse the case of the Spanish exports of <b>ordinary</b> table <b>wine</b> during the period 1890 1935. The expansion of wine production outside Europe meant that some countries in the American continent raised their tariffs to protect national production, which caused serious damage to exporters. Much more serious was the discriminatory trade policy initiated by France in 1891 which gave priority to the tariff-free importing of Algerian wine, as against the high tariffs that had to be paid by other exporters. This policy, as well as protecting French production, aimed to support her colonial policy in Algeria and seriously affected Spanish exports, as shown by our data and the econometric analysis we have carried out. The Spanish response resulted in a greater penetration of other European markets, thanks to the competitiveness of Spanish wine, but this did not prevent a serious crisis in the sector. ...|$|R

2500|$|Wine {{played a}} major role in ancient Roman {{religion}} and Roman funerary practices, and was the preferred libation for most deities. The invention of wine was usually credited to Liber and his Greek equivalents, Bacchus (later Romanised) and Dionysus, who promoted the fertility of human and animal semen, and the [...] "soft seed" [...] of the vine. <b>Ordinary,</b> everyday, mixed <b>wines</b> were under the protection of Venus, but were considered profane (vinum spurcum), forbidden for use in official sacrifice to deities of the Roman State. A sample of pure, undilute strong wine from the first pressing was offered to Liber/Bacchus, in gratitude for his assistance. The remainder, known as temetum, was customarily reserved for Roman men and Roman gods, particularly Jupiter, king of the gods. It was, however, also an essential element of the secretive, nocturnal and exclusively female Bona dea festival, during which it was freely consumed but could only be referred to euphemistically, as [...] "milk" [...] or [...] "honey".|$|R
