5|$|Campbell is {{considered}} one of the greatest running backs in Texas Longhorns and college football history. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1990, along with fellow Heisman winner Jim Plunkett <b>of</b> <b>Stanford.</b> Campbell became the first Texas Longhorns football player to have his jersey retired by the University, his number 20 being retired in 1979. In 2000, an internet poll of Longhorns fans voted Campbell to Texas' All-Century team. He received the most votes, beating out recently graduated Ricky Williams.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, Stanford University {{professor}} Robert E. Swain proposed {{creating a}} research institute in the Western United States. Herbert Hoover, then a trustee <b>of</b> <b>Stanford</b> University, {{was also an}} early proponent of an institute, but became less involved with the project after he {{was elected president of}} the United States. The development of the institute was delayed by the Great Depression in the 1930s and World War II in the 1940s, with three separate attempts leading to its formation in 1946.|$|E

5|$|Besides the budget, another {{measure that}} failed to pass in the 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} {{the death penalty for}} juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case <b>of</b> <b>Stanford</b> v. Kentucky, wherein the court ruled that Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said he regretted his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because of concern about the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead <b>of</b> <b>Stanford.</b> Warner soon realized that he had made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20â€“12 in Warner's last game.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz <b>of</b> <b>Stanford</b> University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can be made into a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E

5|$|After Elliott Fitch Shepard's {{death in}} March 1893, Margaret donated the present church {{building}} and manse. The Spanish Renaissance-style church {{was designed by}} Augustus Haydel (a nephew <b>of</b> <b>Stanford</b> White) and August D. Shepard (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and of William Rutherford Mead). The two nephews later designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan. The church's cornerstone was laid on October 13, 1893. During construction of the building's foundation, workers found quicksand, though Shepard was intent on constructing the church there and had the construction workers dig 30 feet into the ground to find firm ground for the foundation. European workers {{were brought to the}} site to aide in the building's construction. The Italian Renaissance Revival building was of limestone delivered from Indiana by railroad, requiring a special track laid at Scarborough to accommodate the delivery. The completed church was dedicated on May 11, 1895 in memory of Elliott Fitch Shepard. It was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church. The dedication was attended by Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Chauncey Depew, William Sloane of W. & J. Sloane, William Seward Webb, H. Walter Webb, and James A. Burden II.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, John Mauchly {{made the}} first mention of binary search {{as part of the}} Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures {{regarding}} any computer-related topic. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary search that placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra <b>of</b> <b>Stanford</b> University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous search problems in computational geometry.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning that international trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block <b>of</b> <b>Stanford</b> University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H.
