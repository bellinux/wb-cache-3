5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut butter on a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|Despite pleas from Kate, Sayid {{sets off}} {{to explore the}} island's {{shoreline}} in self-imposed isolation, needing time {{to come to terms}} with his actions in torturing Sawyer, while Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) helps Shannon by making a eucalyptus salve to clear her bronchial passages. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) convinces Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) to move to the caves, because they made a deal that if Charlie found peanut butter, she would move; Charlie shares an imaginary jar <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> butter with her. Sawyer attempts to burn the letter he wrote, but he finds himself unable to go through with it.|$|E
5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented Snowflake Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> butter and Snowflake Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E

Aflatoxins are fungal secondary metabolites {{that have been}} associated with severe toxicological effects to human and animals, which can cause enormous economic loss to producers, handlers, processors and marketers <b>of</b> contaminated <b>peanuts.</b> Aflatoxin contamination <b>of</b> <b>peanuts</b> is unavoidable due to the varied factors in pre-harvest, harvesting, and post-harvest stages <b>of</b> <b>peanuts.</b> The review summarizes the factors influencing aflatoxin contamination in the whole supply chain <b>of</b> <b>peanuts...</b>|$|R

5|$|SR 3 {{begins at}} the {{junction}} with SR 36 south of the town <b>of</b> <b>Peanut</b> in Trinity County. SR 3 {{is also known as}} Bramlot Road from its southern terminus to Hayfork. This stretch of road through the Shasta-Trinity National Forest parallels the Hayfork River. Once SR 3 reaches the town of Hayfork, it travels along Hyampom Road east and snakes through the mountains to Douglas City and the junction with SR 299. From there, SR 3 runs concurrently with SR 299 north to the town of Weaverville. SR 3 then separates from SR 299, providing access to the Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area and Trinity Dam along Lewiston Lake.|$|E
25|$|Peanut {{butter is}} a food paste or spread made from ground dry roasted peanuts. It often {{contains}} additional ingredients that modify the taste or texture, such as salt, sweeteners or emulsifiers. Peanut butter is popular in many countries. The United States {{is a leading}} exporter <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> butter and itself consumes $800 million <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> butter annually.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} types <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> butter are crunchy (or chunky) and smooth. In crunchy peanut butter, some coarsely-ground peanut {{fragments}} are included to give extra texture. The peanuts in smooth peanut butter are ground uniformly, creating a creamy texture.|$|E
50|$|The {{industry}} {{continued to}} develop steadily with regulation by government and growers alike. Lobbying of the State and Commonwealth governments by the Board resulted in embargoes against the importation <b>of</b> <b>peanuts</b> and supportive legislation. In August 1930 the Queensland Government issued an Order-in-Council constituting a Peanut Marketing Board for 10 years to control all sales <b>of</b> <b>peanuts</b> produced in Queensland. Marketing problems were overcome finally {{with the passing}} in 1939 <b>of</b> The <b>Peanut</b> Industry Protection and Preservation Act by the Queensland government which ensured that the Board held control over the planting, grading, treatment and marketing <b>of</b> <b>peanuts</b> in Queensland through the health provisions of the Federal Constitution.|$|R

They kill Shark and Rectangle Businessman, but it is unknown if they are truly dead because the simulation in which most of the show takes place is probably taking place in another simulation. One of the purposes of the simulation seen in most of the show was to extract information from Fitz. The conclusion to episode 20 is ambiguous {{as to whether or not}} it is actually the end of the series, as some aspects of the plot remain unresolved– Golden Joe says [...] "I thought this was done," [...] to which Fitz replies, [...] "I thought so too.

500|$|Although red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} feed on a {{wide variety}} of native and introduced grains, the mainstay of their diet is eucalyptus seeds. There is a specific relationship between the species and larger-fruited species of gums. These vary across Australia but include the marri in Southwest Western Australia, Darwin woolybutt E. miniata across the north of the country, E. baxteri in Victoria and the bloodwood species Corymbia polycarpa and C. intermedia in Queensland. Cockatoos bite off branchlets with clusters of seed capsules, then hold them with their feet while chewing and harvesting seeds before littering the ground with debris. Among other seeds and nuts consumed are those of Acacia, Allocasuarina, Banksia, Grevillea and Hakea, as well as berries, fruits and various insects. Cockatoos have adapted to eating some introduced plants such as the doublegee (Emex australis). There is some evidence of consumption of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), wild turnip (Brassica tournefortii) and melon (Citrullus or Cucumis). Red-tailed black cockatoos have been implicated as agricultural pests <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> and other crops at Lakeland Downs in Far North Queensland. [...] Here the cockatoos, in flocks of up to several hundred birds, have learned to sever the peanut plants above ground level before pulling the peanuts out of the ground by their stems and shelling them. [...] They also damage electrical cables on pivot irrigators.|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} from captivity in 1953, Misch {{returned}} to what was then West Berlin. He arrived home on New Year's Eve 1953 to the house which was [...] from the Führerbunker. At the time, Misch's wife worked as a teacher in Neukölln. Misch struggled for several years with {{what to do with}} his life after captivity. He was offered various odd jobs, among others as a porter in a hospital and as a driver. Most of these job offers were through his wartime contacts, and required moving away from Berlin, which his wife refused to do. He finally obtained a loan backed by wealthy German philanthropists to buy out a painting and interior decorating shop from a retiree in Berlin. He ran this modest business successfully, and during the early Allied occupation of Berlin also became involved in the making <b>of</b> <b>peanut</b> butter for American troops. The business had been started by Misch's old friend, Adolf Kleinholdermann. This sideline business became so successful that Misch considered leaving his shop. His wife convinced him to remain in the painting and interior decorating business. In 1975, Gerda was elected to the parliament of West Berlin in which she served for several years. Years later Gerda developed Alzheimer's and died in 1998. Misch continued to manage his shop until his retirement at age 68 in 1985. [...] His memoir in German, Der letzte Zeuge (The Last Witness), was published in 2008. The English edition was published in 2014 with an introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse.|$|E
