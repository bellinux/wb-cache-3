2500|$|Liver {{transplantation}} {{to replace}} the diseased liver with a cadaveric liver or a living donor graft has historically low survival rates (20%-36%). During 1996–2001 the rate had improved to 61.1%, likely related to adoption of the Milan criteria at US transplantation centers. Expanded Shanghai criteria in China resulted in overall survival and disease-free survival rates similar to the Milan criteria. Studies from the late 2000 obtained higher survival rates ranging from 67% to 91%. If the liver tumor has metastasized, the immuno-suppressant post-transplant drugs decrease the chance of survival. Considering this <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> {{in conjunction with the}} potentially high rate of survival, some recent studies conclude that: [...] "LTx can be a curative approach for patients with advanced HCC without extrahepatic metastasis". For those reasons, and others, it is considered nowadays that patient selection is a major key for success.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two schools}} of thought on {{how to cope with}} risks raised by {{availability}} cascades: technocratic and democratic. The technocratic approach, championed by Kuran and Sunstein, emphasizes assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating risks according to <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> measures (e.g. expected costs, expected disability-adjusted life years (DALY)). The technocratic approach considers availability cascades to be phenomena of mass irrationality that can distort or hijack public policy, misallocating resources or imposing regulatory burdens whose costs exceed the expected costs of the risks they mitigate.|$|E

50|$|Errors of {{probability}} perception are {{also associated with}} the theory's predictions of contradictory relationships between risk perception and risky behavior.

Since gist processing develops after verbatim processing as people age, this finding lends explanation to the increase in risk-taking that occurs during adolescence.|$|E

40|$|Background. We {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the role of <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> status and subjective risk beliefs in influenza vaccination decisions during the recent rationing of influenza vaccine. Method. A random sample of 300 Americans, obtained through random-digit dialing, was interviewed regarding influenza vaccination practices and beliefs in September 2004 and again in March 2005. Results. One-half of individuals {{at high risk of}} influenza did not know that they were at high risk and, therefore, were not vaccinated. Respondents at high <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> {{were more likely to report}} having been vaccinated than respondents who were not at high <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> (36 % vs. 6 %, respectively; odds ratio, 8. 31; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 65 – 18. 88). However, a more powerful predictor of self-reported vaccination was subjective risk (64 % vs. 7 %, respectively; odds ratio, 24. 02; 95 % confidence interval, 12. 18 – 48. 09). Subjective risk fully mediated the relationship between <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> and vaccination. Other predictors of vaccination included physician recommendation, habit, prior vaccination intention, belief that the influenza vaccine is safe and effective, perceived likelihood of getting influenza, and trait neuroticism. Conclusion. Health communication efforts must be more effective in persuading adults with chronic illness and individuals in contact with persons at risk that they should be vaccinated against influenza.

Swedish data on respondents ’ subjective risk beliefs is used and compared with <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> estimates. The <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> {{is defined as the}} risk of the respondent’s own age and gender group, and it is found that low and high risk groups over- and underassess their risk levels, respectively.

As in their study, risk beliefs are updated in line with the Bayesian learning model, a relationship not statistically significant in this study, though. Regarding results of individual characteristics and risk beliefs in both studies, whereas, e. g., gender effects are robust, other results suggest a weak relationship between the perception of own road-mortality risk and individual characteristics.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{the fact}} that genetic {{counseling}} in oncology provides information regarding objective risks, {{it can be found}} a contrast between the subjective and <b>objective</b> <b>risk.</b> The aims of this study were to evaluate the accuracy of the perceived risk compared to the <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> estimated by the BRCApro computer model and to evaluate any associations between medical, demographic and psychological variables and the accuracy of risk perception. Methods 130 subjects were given medical-demographic file, Cancer and Genetic Risk Perception, Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale. It was also computed an objective evaluation of the risk by the BRCApro model. Results The subjective risk was significantly higher than <b>objective</b> <b>risk.</b> The risk of tumour was overestimated by 56 %, and the genetic risk by 67 %. The subjects with less cancer affected relatives significantly overestimated their risk of being mutation carriers and made a more innacurate estimation than high risk subjects. Conclusion The description of this sample shows: general overestimation of the risk, inaccurate perception compared to BRCApro calculation and a more accurate estimation in those subjects with more cancer affected relatives (high risk subjects). No correlation was found between the levels of perception of risk and anxiety and depression. Based on our findings, it is worth pursuing improved communication strategies about the actual cancer and genetic risk, especially for subjects at "intermediate and slightly increased risk" of developing an hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer or of being mutation carrier. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} between perceived risk {{of homeland security}} incidents and homeland security preparedness has received considerable support in policing literature. From a contingency theory perspective, organizations rationally respond to risks in their external environments by taking steps to prepare for homeland security incidents. In past studies examining homeland security preparedness levels, risk has typically been measured using agency executives ’ perceived likelihood of specific homeland security incidents occurring within their jurisdiction within a specified time range, and has largely ignored <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> factors. In other disciplines, researchers and govern-ment organizations consider three dimensions when assessing risk: threat, vulner-ability, and consequences. In the present study, the <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> factors of social vulnerability, experience with past hazards, and built environment vulnerability not only fail to predict risk perceptions but are also not associated with preparedness measures.

40|$|The {{distinction}} between subjective and <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> tolerance {{is illustrated by}} expected utility analyses of portfolios. Optimal portfolios were derived for one, 5, and 20 year investment horizons for 6 major financial asset categories. The important aspects of <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> tolerance are the proportion of an investor's total wealth (including human wealth) in financial assets, and the investment horizon. Even investors with very low subjective risk tolerance levels should have aggressive portfolios if their horizons are 20 years or more. Key Words: Risk tolerance, Portfolios, Investment In investing for long term goals, the allocation of asset categories in the portfolio {{is one of the}} most crucial decisions. Most people are not willing to take above average risks to obtain above average returns on their investments (Avery & Elliehausen, 1986). It is likely that many investors focus too much on short term volatility, especially for investing for retirement. Many financial planners stress the concept of the client’s risk tolerance, and give questionnaires to assess risk tolerance. Malkiel (1996, p. 401) stated that “The risks you can afford to take depend on your total financial situation, including the types and sources of your income exclusive of investment income. ” This article proposes that risk tolerance be into two parts: subjective risk tolerance based on the economic concept of risk aversion, and <b>objective</b> <b>risk</b> tolerance, based on Malkiel’s idea of the objective financial situation of the household, including the investment horizon for each goal. The expected utility of alternative portfolios is calculated. Optimal portfolios for various combinations of objective and subjective risk tolerance are identified...|$|E
