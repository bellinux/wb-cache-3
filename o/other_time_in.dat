5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger than at any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> history, and almost every usable horse of Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E
5|$|Ostracods, a {{class of}} small {{crustaceans}} that were prevalent in the upper Maastrichtian, left fossil deposits {{in a variety of}} locations. A review of these fossils shows that ostracod diversity was lower in the Paleocene than any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the Cenozoic. Current research cannot ascertain, however, whether the extinctions occurred prior to, or during, the boundary interval.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{spent his}} early adult years among the natives along the Tombigbee River, being {{initially}} {{employed by the}} French as an interpreter of the Choctaw language, but soon coming into the employ of the British and later the Spanish. Favre also understood the Chickasaw language, but at one point his translation was challenged by James Colbert (grandfather of Holmes Colbert), who had married into the Chickasaw tribe, replaced Favre as interpreter. which {{was not a problem}} earlier for Spain during the Treaty of Natchez in 1793, nor at any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the long history of his duties for France. Favre was said to be a confidante and personal friend of the celebrated Choctaw Indian chief Pushmataha. Genealogist Heitzmann relates that at one point Favre acted as the interpreter between Pushmataha and the military commanders Andrew Jackson and General Thomas Hinds.|$|E

5|$|Yorkshire {{finished}} second in the County Championship to Warwickshire in the 1951 season and second to Surrey in the 1952 season. However, in following season, Yorkshire dropped to equal twelfth, their worst ever finish at that time. In the following two seasons, the team were again runners up, Surrey winning on both occasions. Yardley scored more than 850 runs in each season, but only managed two more centuries. These were 183 not out against Hampshire in 1951, the highest innings of his career, and an unbeaten score of exactly 100 against Gloucestershire in his final season. His batting average was generally between 24 and 31, except in 1953 when in matches in England he averaged 36.53. Yardley used himself as a bowler more often in 1951 and 1952, delivering more overs than any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career in the latter year. He took 32 and 43 wickets respectively in each season, his highest two season totals, and taking five wickets in an innings on three occasions, having only done so twice before. However, he bowled less often during his final three seasons, with a subsequent drop in his tally of wickets. His only representative cricket, apart from annual matches at the Scarborough Festival for the Gentlemen against the Players and occasionally for T. N. Pearce's XI, was the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's in 1954.|$|E

25|$|McHale {{continued}} {{to come off}} the bench during first half of the 1984–1985 season, but moved into a starting role in February 1985 after Cedric Maxwell suffered a knee injury. On March 3 versus the Detroit Pistons McHale enjoyed his greatest scoring night, setting the Celtics' single-game scoring record with 56 points. Two nights later McHale scored 42 points against the Knicks, the only <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career he topped 40 points in a game. The 98 points in consecutive games is still a Celtics' record. Nine days after McHale had scored 56 points, Larry Bird established a new Celtics' single-game scoring mark by pouring in 60 points versus the Atlanta Hawks.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally it {{was thought}} that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8Ga, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy {{bombardment}} by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically, the Hadean Earth would have been far more active than at any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17×105 years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250×109 years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. Internal heating as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.|$|E
25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout generally {{declined in the}} second half of the 20th century due to angler overharvest, competition with exotic fishes, and overzealous egg collection. Populations rebounded in the park after the advent of catch-and-release-only fishing rules in the 1970s, but new and aggressive invaders are causing an increasing threat to these native fish and alarming park fisheries biologists. Nonnative lake trout, an effective fish predator, were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994. Throughout the west {{cutthroat trout}} populations preyed upon by introduced lake trout have typically declined, exhibited lower growth, or have disappeared. Aggressive lake trout control efforts by the National Park Service and no harvest limits have resulted in removing thousands of lake trout from Yellowstone Lake since 1994, including more than 12,000 in 2000. Still, the number of Yellowstone cutthroat trout monitored during the annual fall count in Yellowstone Lake was lower in recent years than at any <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the 25-year history of the monitoring effort. Whirling disease, which has been implicated in recent years in the decline of trout populations in many western states, was discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1998. So far, it is unclear which of these two nonnative invaders has been the greater factor in the decline of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, but there is no question they are causing it.|$|E

500|$|Although anti-Catholicism {{had been}} a {{consistent}} platform of the Klan, before leaving the organization, Evans renounced his anti-Catholicism and pronounced a [...] "new era of religious tolerance". In 1939, he said that [...] "in no <b>other</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> history has there been more need for all {{people who believe in}} the same Father and same Son to stand together." [...] That year, Evans also publicly expressed an interest in learning aspects of Judaism to better understand the Old Testament. Chester L. Quarles, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Mississippi, argues that Evans repudiated anti-Catholicism owing to his desire to fight unions and communism and his fear of having too many enemies at one time.|$|E

There is no direct evidence for the cause of the regression, but the explanation currently accepted as most likely, is that the mid-ocean ridges became less active and therefore sank under their own weight.|$|E
