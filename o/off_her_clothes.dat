5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
5|$|While {{under house}} arrest, Bhimsen smuggled {{a letter to}} the Resident Hodgson {{appealing}} him to intervene on his behalf, which Hodgson refused at that moment, but sought permission from his superiors to do so. Meanwhile, Bhimsen's third wife, Bhakta Kumari, happened to insult the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi, who upon hearing about this insult, was so angered that she order Bhakta Kumari to be removed from Bagh Durbar and put in a common jail. After this, a rumor started to spread around Kathmandu that Bhakta Kumari would be stripped <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and paraded through the streets of the city. This rumor also fell on Bhimsen's ears; and unable to bear such indignity, Bhimsen attempted suicide by slitting his throat with a khukuri on 28 July 1839. The news of this attempted suicide further angered the King and the Queen, who came to look at his body, and instead of feeling sympathy for the old minister and ordering immediate medical care, Bhimsen's blood soaked, unconscious body was ordered that same day to be dragged through the streets and dumped by the same bank of Bishnumati river, where Bhimsen had dumped the dead bodies of 45 people 33 years ago during the Bhandarkhal massacre. Bhimsen finally died nine days later, surrounded by vultures, jackals, and dogs, on 5 August 1939, at the age of 64. Since suicide was considered a grave crime, soldiers were stationed at his death spot so that his body would not be removed and given ordinary cremation rites; and his body was allowed to be devoured by scavenging animals. On the spot where Bhimsen drew his last breath, a Shiva temple by the name Bhim-Mukteshowr was later constructed by his nephew Mathabar Singh Thapa.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kier McFarlane, and its plot was inspired by 1968 film Barbarella. According to Minogue, {{she had been a}} [...] "massive" [...] fan of the film, and wanted to pay tribute to the film's lead actress Jane Fonda, who played the titular character. The video was shot in two days, where Minogue had been strapped with harnesses and wires; the majority of the shooting included wires pulling <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> during those particular sequences. The singer commented in her 2002 book [...] {{that it was one of}} her [...] "most painful shoots", and complained that she felt [...] "rigged" [...] into all sorts of [...] "contraptions". Minogue further complained about the 19 hours spent on both filming days, and revealed she cried during some of the shooting; she jokingly concluded in the book that she would never do another visual that required harnesses and water. Minogue's characteristics in the video were loosely inspired by the titular character of Barbarella, for which a large staff that helped with styling, hair styling and make-up was required.|$|E
500|$|The Valmiki Ramayana narrates: When all of Ravana's {{sons and}} warriors die, Ravana organizes a yajna ("fire sacrifice") to assure his victory. Rama sends {{a troop of}} monkeys headed by Hanuman and the monkey prince Angada to destroy this yajna. The monkeys create havoc in Ravana's palace, but Ravana {{continues}} the yajna. Angada drags Mandodari by her hair in front of Ravana. Mandodari pleads to her husband to save her and reminds him what Rama is doing for his wife. The enraged Ravana abandons the yajna and strikes Angada with his sword. With the yajna disturbed, Angada's purpose is served and he leaves Mandodari and escapes. Mandodari again implores Ravana to surrender Sita to Rama, but he refuses. Other Ramayana adaptations present more gruesome descriptions of the incident. The Krittivasi Ramayan narrates that the monkeys dragged Mandodari and tore <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes.</b> In Bicitra Ramayana, it is Hanuman who humiliates Mandodari. The Thai adaptation Ramakien narrates [...] a symbolic rape of Mandodari. Hanuman sleeps {{with her in the}} form of Ravana and destroys her chastity, which protects Ravana's life.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Love" [...] {{is a slow}} jam R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} electronic music; it lasts for a duration of three minutes and 19 seconds long. The instrumentation is provided by a keyboard, synthesizers, percussion and a drum machine. According to Nadeska Alexis of MTVs Rapfix, Brown sings in a falsetto tone, which she found to be reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush described the ballad as [...] "very Michael Jackson and neo-Bieber". JusMusic of Singersroom noted that [...] "Sweet Love" [...] is inspired by Silk's [...] "Freak Me" [...] (1993). Chris Brown – Sweet Love|work=Singersroom|date=2012-05-25|accessdate=2012-05-27}} Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun musically compared the song to Prince. The theme of [...] "Sweet Love" [...] revolves around sex. It contains lyrics about Brown asking his lover to take <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> {{so that they can}} have sex. During the chorus, he harmonizes: [...] "Oooh baby let's get naked / Just so we can make sweet love / All these sensations got me going crazy for you / Inside on top of you / Grinding inside and out of you / Baby I know what to do / Let's just take our clothes off".|$|E

500|$|Accepting Aradia as {{the source}} of this practice, Robert Chartowich points to the 1998 Pazzaglini {{translation}} of these lines, which read [...] "Men and Women / You will all be naked, until / Yet he shall be dead, the last / Of your oppressors is dead." [...] Chartowich argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland's mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause [...] "in your rites". There are, however, earlier mentions of ritual nudity among Italian witches. Historian Ruth Martin states that it was a common practice for witches of Italy to be [...] "naked with their hair loose around their shoulders" [...] while reciting conjurations. Jeffrey Burton Russell notes that [...] "A woman named Marta was tortured in Florence about 1375: she was alleged to have placed candles round a dish and to have taken <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and stood above the dish in the nude, making magical signs". Historian Franco Mormando refers to an Italian witch: [...] "Lo and behold: in the first hours of sleep, this woman opens the door to her vegetable garden and comes out completely naked and her hair all undone, and she begins to do and say her various signs and conjurations ...".|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times {{stated that}} [...] "Cabaret" [...] is a [...] "percolating bedroom jam that depicts sex {{as a form}} of at-home theater".

HitFix's Melinda Newman {{described}} the song as a [...] "loop-driven to getting down with your lady, who’s taking <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> as quickly as she can". According to Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine, in [...] "Cabaret", Timberlake compares the love to a burlesque and noted that the song resembles producer Timbaland's earlier work. Andy Kellman of Allmusic wrote that the song features Timbaland's signature sound and finds Timberlake proclaiming more [...] "clever/nauseating" [...] lyrics: [...] "If sex is a contest, then you're coming first"; [...] "'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we're laying in a manger." [...] The chorus is consisted of Timberlake singing [...] "It's a cabaret" [...] while being accompanied by Timbaland, who repeats [...] "Put on a show, get on the floor". According to Stern, in his part with a duration about two minutes, Drake raps raunchy and fast-talking lines, [...] "I’mma fuck you like we’re having an affair". Nick Krewen of Toronto Star wrote that Drake raps lines [...] "about a sexual tête-à-tête amidst a melee of scattershot rhythms".|$|E
500|$|While he {{was still}} on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third {{interview}} with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then [...] "without being asked a further question" [...] he stated, [...] "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." [...] Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while {{he was looking for}} his stash of beers. According to Webster, they walked to the saltbushes together, where he pulled <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and stuck a finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking her for a while before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he [...] "thought she would squeal on [...] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the judge did not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.|$|E

500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she smiled and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched out her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E
2500|$|By 1869, Yoshitoshi was {{regarded}} as one of the best woodblock artists in Japan. However, shortly thereafter, he ceased to receive commissions, perhaps because the public were tired of scenes of violence. By 1871, [...] Yoshitoshi became severely depressed, and his personal life became one of great turmoil, which was to continue sporadically until his death. He lived in appalling conditions with his devoted mistress, Okoto, who sold <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and possessions to support him. At one point they were reduced to burning the floor-boards from the house for warmth. It is said that in 1872 he suffered a complete mental breakdown after being shocked by the lack of popularity of his recent designs.|$|E

When they reached a secluded area, he threw the girl to the ground before tearing <b>off</b> <b>her</b> <b>clothes</b> and attempting intercourse, as Tkachenko remonstrated against his actions. When Chikatilo failed to achieve an erection, he forced mud inside her mouth to stifle her screams before battering and strangling her to death. As he had no knife, Chikatilo mutilated the body with his teeth and a stick; he also tore one nipple from Tkachenko's body with his teeth, before loosely covering her body with leaves, branches, and torn pages of newspaper. Tkachenko's body was found the following day.|$|E
