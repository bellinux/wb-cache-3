5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> good {{reaction}} of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E

However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E

5|$|The Thin Man gun-type {{design was}} at that time based on the fissibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron.

To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|E
