5|$|The Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park {{is located}} in Window Rock, Arizona, the capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> Nation. It is the only tribally owned zoological park in the United States and is notable among zoological {{facilities}} in that it labels its exhibits in a Native American Indian language. Having been operated by the Navajo Nation Parks & Recreation Department {{since its inception in}} the early 1960s, it became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife in September 2006.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much the lower half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> Formation.|$|E
5|$|The highway, now a spur {{route of}} US91 via its {{connection}} to US191, runs through Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, {{as well as}} the tribal nations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> Nation and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. The highway passes by two mountains considered sacred by Native Americans: Ute Mountain and an extinct volcanic core named Shiprock. Other features along the route include Mesa Verde National Park and Dove Creek, Colorado, the self-proclaimed pinto-bean capital of the world.|$|E
50|$|In 1890, a local rancher {{refused to}} pay <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> a fine <b>of</b> livestock. <b>The</b> <b>Navajos</b> tried to collect it, and whites in {{southern}} Colorado and Utah claimed that 9,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> were on a warpath. A small military detachment out of Fort Wingate restored white citizens to order.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological and {{historical}} evidence suggests <b>the</b> Athabaskan ancestors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> and Apaches entered the Southwest around 1400 CE. <b>The</b> <b>Navajo</b> oral tradition {{is said to}} retain references of this migration.|$|R

5|$|At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True {{was hired}} to handle the design and {{decoration}} of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> and Pueblo tribes of the region. Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist. With {{the assistance of the}} National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics. The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals— lizards, serpents, birds— and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas. In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True also reflected on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.|$|E
5|$|Lees Ferry is {{considered}} the official beginning of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River and {{is used as a}} fishing area and river rafting launch site. The main access is by Lees Ferry Road, which splits off from U.S. Route 89 at the hamlet of Marble Canyon, Arizona, on the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> Bridges. The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D. Lee's brief tenure at the site along with some remnants of the Charles H. Spencer. The area is managed by the National Park Service within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area as a historical site.|$|E
5|$|The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area {{includes}} nine known exposed formations, all {{visible in}} Zion National Park in the U.S. state of Utah. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation {{in that part}} of North America. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase, the formations exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments that range from the warm shallow seas of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations, streams and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations to the large deserts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajo</b> and Temple Cap formations and dry near shore environments of the Carmel Formation.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Storytelling {{is a way}} {{to teach}} younger members of {{indigenous}} communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder's study, Navajos were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> children <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos.</b> According to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life. In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.|$|R

50|$|Doniphan {{was eager}} to start south, but he first {{had to wait for}} Price to arrive. Kearny, and then Doniphan had tried to {{negotiate}} with <b>the</b> <b>Navajos,</b> together with <b>the</b> Ute tribe and Apaches, but had made little progress. After Price arrived with his force, Kearny, near <b>the</b> present-day border <b>of</b> Arizona and New Mexico, learned that <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> had attacked some sheepherders, killed them, and stolen their herd of 2,000 sheep. Kearny dispatched a message to Doniphan to attack <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> on October 2, 1846. Doniphan signed a peace treaty with the Utes, and then took three companies and headed west (toward present day Gallup) in pursuit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beginning in <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> 1864, around 9,000 Navajo men, women, and {{children}} were forced {{to embark on a}} trek of over 300 mi to Fort Sumner, New Mexico for internment at Bosque Redondo. The internment at Bosque Redondo was a failure for many reasons as the government failed to provide an adequate supply of water, wood, provisions, and livestock for 4,000-5,000 people. Large-scale crop failure and disease were also endemic during this time, as well as raids by other tribes and civilians. In addition, a small group of Mescalero Apaches, long enemies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos,</b> had been relocated to the area, resulting in conflicts. In 1868, a treaty was negotiated between <b>Navajo</b> leaders and <b>the</b> federal government allowing <b>the</b> surviving <b>Navajos</b> to return to a reservation on a portion of their former homeland. <b>The</b> <b>Navajos</b> were not provided with much protection; other enemies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> would swoop in and take Navajo women {{and children}} back to their camps and force them to work as slaves. While at Bosque Redondo, the government did not provide <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> with food or shelter, and some <b>Navajos</b> froze during <b>the</b> winter because <b>of</b> poor shelters that they had to make on their own.|$|R

Upon being assigned the territory Carleton set boundaries in which <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> would not engage in any sort of conflict. They were prohibited from trespassing onto lands, raiding neighboring tribes, and engaging in warfare with both the Spaniards and Americans. A majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navajos</b> were abiding by these requirements {{but it was a}} band of Navajo freelancing raiding parties that would break these rules, for which the entire tribe would soon be penalized. In <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> Carleton, he was unsuccessful and would enlist outside resources for aid.
