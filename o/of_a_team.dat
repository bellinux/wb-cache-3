40|$|The extant {{literature}} highlights {{that environmental}} conditions, during the creation phase, imprint on a start-up’s survival and growth. However, {{there are few}} studies that explore the composite nature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> founding <b>team’s</b> capabilities and networks, developed within this phase, and the contribution made to future performance. This paper uses the distinctive context of university spin-offs, where early stage ventures are fostered by institutional interventions, to analyse the influence that the capabilities and networks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> founding <b>team,</b> at incorporation, have upon the future performance of the spin-off. Based on data from 181 university spin-offs, this paper empirically demonstrates that the entrepreneurial capabilities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> founding <b>team,</b> augmented during the ‘creation’ phase, have {{a positive influence on}} the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spin-off during the ‘growth’ phase, and that the networks <b>of</b> <b>a</b> founding <b>team</b> indirectly affect <b>a</b> spin-off’s performance through the enhancement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>team’s</b> entrepreneurial capabilities...|$|R
