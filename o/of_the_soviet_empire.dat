25|$|The controversies {{surrounding}} Hilberg’s book {{were perhaps}} {{the main reason}} why its Polish translation was released only after the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>empire,</b> five decades after its original publication. The year Hilberg died, he refused an offer to have a shortened version published in translation, insisting that particularly in Poland, where {{so much of the}} Holocaust took place, only the full text of his work would suffice. The complete three-volume edition translated by Jerzy Giebułtowski was released in Poland in 2013. Dariusz Libionka from IPN, who led the book launch seminars in various cities, noted that the stories of defiance so prevalent in Poland can no longer be told without his perspective which includes the viewpoint of Holocaust bureaucracy. Reportedly, the last document Hilberg signed before his death was the release form allowing {{for the use of the}} word annihilation (as opposed to destruction) in the Polish title.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of strong {{nationalist}} and separatist movements inside the USSR's republics, Gorbachev tried to avert a dissolution of the Soviet Union in the post-Cold War era. A March 1991 referendum, boycotted by some republics, resulted in a majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the union as a renewed federation. Gorbachev's power was greatly diminished after Russian President Boris Yeltsin played a high-profile role in facing down an abortive August 1991 coup d'état attempted by Communist Party hardliners. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining twelve constituent republics emerged as independent post-Soviet states. The Russian Federation—formerly the Russian SFSR—assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and is recognized as the primary legal successor of the Soviet Union. In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated: [...] "The collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>empire</b> was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological and economic significance." ...|$|E

Bishop Batmalashvili himself was executed in 1937. Nevertheless, Zugger cites a report that by 1936 [...] "the Byzantine Catholic Church of Georgia had two communities, served by a bishop and four priests, with 8,000 believers", figures very similar to what elsewhere he gives as the 1929 situation.|$|R

30|$|Ukraine, Estonia, and Latvia have {{a shared}} history <b>of</b> leaving <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and {{becoming}} sovereign nations {{at about the}} same time. Because <b>of</b> this, <b>the</b> countries all have a Russian diaspora <b>of</b> about <b>the</b> same size (17 – 26 %). <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> leaving <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union meant that the Russians living in these countries changed status from being part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority in the union to being the largest an ethnic minority in the three countries (CIA World Fact Book, 2011). This change was not initiated by the Russians living in these countries and has led to tensions and conflicts between the new ethnic group and the new majority (Heleniak, 2004; Kolstø, 1996). For instance Kolstø (1996) argues that: “The collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unitary <b>Soviet</b> state has plunged its former citizens into a profound identity crisis. Particularly hard hit are the twenty-five million Russians living in the non-Russian successor states.” (Kolstø, 1996, p. 609). The Russian diasporas in the three countries has fought hard to maintain the memory and symbols <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> <b>empire,</b> but are left feeling increasingly forgotten and marginalized (Aasland, 1994; Heleniak, 2006; Kesküla, 2015; Melchior & Visser, 2011).|$|R
