40|$|Lake Malawi/Niassa is {{the second}} largest rift valley lake in Africa, with an area of 28 800 km 2, and an average and maximum depth of 292 m and > 700 m, respectively. The lake {{is well known for}} the great {{diversity}} of fish occurring in the inshore zone. However, the <b>offshore</b> <b>fish</b> community is poorly documented. To rectify this, regular sampling was undertaken over two years, using trawl and gillnets at six offshore locations. This paper reports on the species composition, spatial distribution and breeding biology of the dominant cichlids species from the offshore pelagic zone. Cichlids formed approximately 88 % of the <b>offshore</b> <b>fish</b> biomass. Most abundant were two species of zooplanktivores in the genus Diploturodon that made up 71 % of the <b>offshore</b> <b>fish</b> biomass. An undescribed species, given the cheironym D. 'bigeye', was mainly found at a depth of 220 m during the day, but moved into near surface waters at night when the moon was full. This species was absent from the shallow regions of the lake. The most abundant offshore species was D. limnothrissa, which was distributed evenly throughout the lake to depths of 220 m. A less common offshore zooplanktivore was Copadichromis quadrimaculatus that formed 5 %, of the biomass and was confined to the upper l 00 m of the water column. The main piscivores were in the genus Rhamphochromis and formed approximately 10 % of the <b>offshore</b> <b>fish</b> biomass. The two dominant taxa were R. longiceps and the 'large Rhamphochromis' group, and both were more common in the southern half of the lake. The former occurred mainly in the upper 100 m of the water column and the latter mainly at depths of 100 - 150 m. The length at maturity and fecundity for the dominant offshore species were estimated and seasonal breeding cycles determined from gonad activity and gonado-somatic indices...|$|R

25|$|Gillnetters â€“ On {{inland waters}} and inshore, {{gillnets}} can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which {{can have their}} wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For <b>offshore</b> <b>fishing,</b> or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is {{more a matter of}} the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.|$|E

According to estimates, about 1 million pounds of Bigeye tuna and 400,000 pounds of Yellowfin were fished from offshore operations from the region in 1995.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we develop and {{evaluate}} a macroalgal bioassay tool for monitoring the spatial extent of dissolved wastes loaded from <b>offshore</b> <b>fish</b> farms into the marine coastal ecosystem.

The bioassays were performed in three fish farms situated in different geographical locations (the Canary Islands, Murcia and Catalonia) and we test: the suitability of the different macroalgae species used in relation with their resistance to incubation and their sensitivity to fish-farm wastes and the most appropriate incubation depth (5 m or ~ 20 m) and incubation time (2, 4 or 6 days) to detect the spatial distribution of Î´N around fish farms. In general terms, the results showed a significant increment of Î´N values towards the fish cages with respect to the reference (initial) and control values for all the species of macroalgae tested except for the red algae from Canary Islands. The magnitude and shape of the reported spatial responses varied {{as a function of the}} experimental settings analyzed as well as a function of the nutrient regime characteristics of each coastal area. The spatial gradient was more consistent in the shallow part of the water column (5 m depth), than in the deeper part (~ 20 m) and was statistically significant after an incubation period of four days. These results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the method proposed, enabling the spatial extent of nutrients derived from fish farms to be assessed in an effective and simple manner, suitable for use in monitoring programs around <b>offshore</b> <b>fish</b> farms...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is to {{look more closely at}} the influence of anthropogenic nutrients on the recovery of Egypt 2 Ì† 7 s Nile Delta fishery since the mid- 19802 Ì† 7 s. Up to half of Egypt 2 Ì† 7 s fish production has come from four large coastal lagoons, which receive large amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) rich agricultural drainage. In Chapter 1, I provide some of the first evidence supporting a previously theoretical model that links increasing nutrient concentrations to fishery yields. Using data compiled from the literature, fish landings in the four lagoons increased with increased nutrients up to a peak at approximately 100 Î¼M dissolved inorganic nitrogen, beyond which they declined dramatically. In the second chapter, stable isotope data (Î´ 15 N, Î´ 13 C) from fish were compared among and within the lagoons. There was a strong positive correlation between mean Î´ 15 N values of fish and estimated water residence time among lagoons, suggesting that nitrogen cycle transformations are more important than primary source Î´ 15 N signatures in determining Î´ 15 N values of lagoon fish. In the third chapter, stable isotope values of <b>fish</b> from inshore, <b>offshore</b> of the delta, and west of the delta were determined. All <b>offshore</b> <b>fish</b> had heavier Î´ 13 C values than inshore fish, reflecting the incorporation of marine phytoplankton. In contrast, the Î´ 15 N values of the fish inshore and immediately offshore of the delta were similar, suggesting that the primary N sources were the same. <b>Offshore</b> <b>fish</b> from west of the delta were much lighter (about 5 â€°). As water moves from west to east in this region, the western fish represent unimpacted Î´ 15 N values while those offshore of the delta reflect anthropogenic N.
