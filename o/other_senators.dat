5|$|Caligula {{reviewed}} Tiberius's {{records of}} treason trials and decided, {{based on their}} actions during these trials, that numerous senators were not trustworthy. He ordered {{a new set of}} investigations and trials. He replaced the consul and had several senators put to death. Suetonius reports that <b>other</b> <b>senators</b> were degraded by being forced to wait on him and run beside his chariot.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee {{ruled that}} Cranston had acted {{improperly}} by {{interfering with the}} investigation by the FHLBB. He had received {{more than a million}} dollars from Keating, including $850,000 to the voter registration groups closely affiliated with him; he had done more arm-twisting than the <b>other</b> <b>Senators</b> on Keating's behalf; and he was the only senator officially rebuked by the Senate in this matter.|$|E

5|$|He read until 1 a.m., until {{with tears}} and sobs {{he said that}} he could no longer {{physically}} continue, the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll. Gravel ended the session by, with no <b>other</b> <b>senators</b> present, establishing unanimous consent to insert 4,100 pages of the Papers into the Congressional Record of his subcommittee. The following day, the Supreme Court's New York Times Co. v. United States decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in The Times and others resumed. In July 1971, Bantam Books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material The Times had published.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Morton {{was elected}} by the Indiana General Assembly {{to serve as a}} U.S. Senator. He {{resigned}} from his post as governor that same year and turned over the leadership of the state government to Lieutenant Governor Baker. In the U.S. Senate, Morton {{became a member of the}} foreign affairs committee and quickly grew to become a Republican leader. He was also made chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections. Because of his stroke, Morton always sat while delivering his speeches, but he was noted by <b>other</b> <b>senators</b> for his effectiveness in speaking and debating.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{joined the}} Business Executives Move for Vietnam Peace. By 1971, Shoup {{publicly}} endorsed the anti-war veteran group Vietnam Veterans Against the War. As Vietnamization had reduced {{the visibility of}} the anti-war movement, and Shoup's criticism was not as prominent in the public arena. Fulbright and <b>other</b> <b>senators</b> urged the White House {{to listen to his}} criticisms, but Shoup's broader critique of American society and militarism was seen as more extreme than other officers who had simply criticized the strategy of the war.|$|E

50|$|Due {{in large}} part to his presidential candidacy, McCain missed over half of his Senate votes in 110th Congress through early August 2007. This was more than any <b>other</b> <b>senator</b> except Tim Johnson, who was absent due to health reasons.|$|R
50|$|On October 15, 2015, Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago {{confirmed}} Senator Bongbong Marcos as {{her running}} mate.

5|$|The {{following}} day Kennedy and Clark {{drove into the}} Delta area, while the <b>other</b> <b>senators</b> flew back to Washington D.C. They were accompanied by Evers, Wright, Moore, Edelman, Carr, {{a dozen or so}} reporters from state and national newspapers and the Big Three television networks, and an assortment of U.S. Marshals, state highway patrolmen, and local police. That morning the senators reviewed anti-poverty programs underway in Greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers. After lunch, Kennedy's and Clark's motorcade traveled at speeds over 80mph down U.S. Route 61 to visit locations specifically selected by Wright and Moore.|$|E
5|$|Director George Lucas has a cameo as Baron Papanoida, a blue-faced alien in {{attendance}} at the Coruscant Opera House. Lucas' son Jett portrays a young Jedi-in-training named Zett Jukassa. Lucas' daughter Amanda appears as a character called Terr Taneel, seen in the security hologram; while his other daughter Katie plays a blue-skinned Pantoran named Chi Eekway, visible when Palpatine arrives at the Senate after being saved by the Jedi, and talking to Baron Papanoida at the Opera House (she also has a brief speaking role {{in one of the}} deleted scenes where Padm√© is meeting in secret with <b>other</b> <b>senators).</b> Christian Simpson appeared as a stunt double for Hayden Christensen. When Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Palpatine arrive via shuttle to the Senate docks after crash landing on Coruscant, the Millennium Falcon can be seen landing on one of the lower platforms as the shuttle approaches.|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two <b>other</b> <b>Senators,</b> traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|North Carolina: Sen. Terry Sanford (D-NC) {{became the}} third {{straight}} incumbent to lose this seat after one term when he was defeated by Democrat-turned-Republican Lauch Faircloth.

5|$|The prosecution's case {{continued}} on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton {{had attempted to}} discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton {{had told him that}} he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by <b>other</b> <b>Senators</b> that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography. Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted <b>other</b> <b>Senators</b> to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E
