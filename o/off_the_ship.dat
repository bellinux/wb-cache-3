5|$|Of the 332 {{people on}} board, 64 were rescued. Most {{of the crew}} and {{passengers}} were asleep {{at the time of}} attack and had little chance to escape. It was estimated that up to 200 people may have been alive at the time Centaur submerged. Several who made it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> later died from shrapnel wounds or burns; others were unable to find support and drowned.|$|E
5|$|She {{could carry}} five floatplanes and {{two to four}} regular, wheeled aircraft. The latter would {{have to return to}} land after launch, but the {{seaplanes}} would take off and land in the water alongside the carrier, lifted on and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> by the cranes. Her original complement of aircraft consisted of a Short Folder, two Wight Pushers, three Sopwith Type 807 seaplanes and two to four Sopwith Tabloid wheeled aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{deaths were}} {{attributed}} to Bertha, including six crew members of the Greek freighter Corazon who perished off the Canadian coast after their ship broke up. Another fatality was caused when one person fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> Patricia Star and into the Atlantic; the other two deaths were from two people drowning in north Florida. Damage to crops and a suspension bridge were reported from Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island; this damage totaled to $4.427million (1990CAD; $3.912million 1990USD, $ USD).|$|E
50|$|In 1881, <b>the</b> American <b>ship</b> Jamestown ran aground off Hafnir {{with no one}} aboard. Its {{cargo of}} timber was {{salvaged}} and sold <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ship's</b> anchor is on display outside the village church.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{them were}} slaves who ran away right after they got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships.</b> They refused to accept {{enslavement}} and often tried {{to find ways to}} go back to Africa.|$|R
60|$|The men obeyed, leaving four {{of their}} number in the boat to keep her <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship's</b> side. Under Harry's orders some of them manned the pumps, while others went to the windlass.|$|R
5|$|The crew {{notice that}} Geiger {{has set the}} ship to crash into an oil tanker {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin. Alex decides to stop the ship by diving {{underneath}} it and jamming the propeller with a steel cable. Geiger realizes Alex is trying to stop the ship, so he jams the cable winch while Alex is underwater, causing it to break <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and free the cable. Geiger takes Annie hostage and escapes with her on a boat from the ship's stern.|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> The vertical {{position of the}} wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain {{decided to make a}} turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E

50|$|To {{fulfill its}} missions, <b>the</b> Marines land <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> of <b>the</b> Brazilian Navy, be it using landing boats, amphibious {{vehicles}} or helicopters. For this they {{count on the}} support of the navy and/or sea and air support.|$|R
5000|$|On July 18, 1947, <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> , {{carrying}} 4,515 immigrants, {{was intercepted}} by the cruiser [...] and a flotilla of destroyers. She was rammed and boarded but the immigrants resisted the boarding, and {{had put up}} barriers and barbed wire to impede boarding. Two passengers and a crewman were bludgeoned to death, several dozen were injured, and <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> was taken over. The Exodus was towed to Haifa, where the immigrants were forced onto three deportation ships and taken to France. When <b>the</b> deportation <b>ships</b> docked in Port-de-Bouc, the passengers refused to disembark after the French government {{announced that it would}} only allow <b>the</b> immigrants <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships</b> if they consented. The immigrants were then taken to Germany, forcibly taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ships,</b> and sent back to DP camps.|$|R
5|$|Buchanan next turned Virginia on Congress. Seeing {{what had}} {{happened}} to Cumberland, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of Congress, ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on Congress. After an hour of unequal combat, the badly damaged Congress surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered Congress fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. Congress caught fire and burned {{throughout the rest of the}} day. Near midnight, the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.|$|E
5|$|The captain puts Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{in charge}} of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who has brought his girlfriend Katy Moore (Amy Adams) on the cruise with him, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their {{significant}} others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a life vest and jump <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> {{is struck by}} an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid as it should be. The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E
50|$|On June 29 Clough and {{supporters}} seized <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>off</b> Nevis. They took {{a number of}} prisoners aboard and had the crew sign their Articles. After sailing to Curacao to sell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship’s</b> cargo, they sailed up the American east coast in August to Sandy Hook to sell <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> itself.|$|R

5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated defense system. Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the final blow can be dealt, both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into the portal with both ships. The portal finally closes, leaving their home planet in peace and quiet.|$|E
5|$|On Voyager, {{the crew}} {{track down the}} source of the {{holographic}} transmission – a much larger ship. Seven is led out for the next Tsunkatse match, and discovers that the Hirogen himself is her opponent. As they start to fight, Voyager attacks the Tsunkatse vessel and destroys a localized shield generator. Torres transports Tuvok <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> but Seven isn't in the unshielded area of the ship. The Hirogen takes the advantage in the match, and Voyager weapons are taken offline. Janeway arrives in the Delta Flyer and destroys the Tsunktase ship's signal generators which broadcast the matches. Penk reroutes power to another transmitter, thus weakening his shields. As Seven takes her position to reluctantly kill the Hirogen, both are transported onto Voyager. Afterwards, Chakotay tells the Hirogen that they are en route to transfer him to a vessel of his species. The Hirogen thanks the crew and tells them that he plans to look for his son.|$|E
5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a way <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield.|$|E

5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon be taken <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|E
25|$|Amethyst {{returned}} home in July 1878 for a lengthy refit and was recommissioned in 1882 to return as the senior officer's ship for southeastern South America until she returned in late 1885 and was paid <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ship</b> was sold for scrap in November 1887.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to evacuate the}} remaining nine crew members {{was made in the}} early hours of 1 February.
