25|$|Modern organ {{transplantation}} in Iran dates to 1935, {{when the first}} cornea transplant in Iran was performed by Professor Mohammad-Qoli Shams at Farabi Hospital in Tehran, Iran. The Shiraz Nemazi transplant center, {{also one of the}} pioneering transplant units of Iran, performed the first Iranian kidney transplant in 1967 and the first Iranian liver transplant in 1995. The first heart transplant in Iran was performed 1993 in Tabriz. The first lung transplant was performed in 2001, and the first heart and lung transplants were performed in 2002, both at Tehran University. Iran developed the first artificial lung in 2009 to join five other countries in the world that possess such technology. Currently, renal, liver, and heart transplantations are routinely performed in Iran. Iran ranks fifth in the world in kidney transplants. The Iranian Tissue Bank, commencing in 1994, was the first multi-facility tissue bank in country. In June 2000, the Organ Transplantation Brain Death Act was approved by the Parliament, followed by the establishment of the Iranian Network for Transplantation <b>Organ</b> <b>Procurement.</b> This act helped to expand heart, lung, and liver transplantation programs. By 2003, Iran had performed 131 liver, 77 heart, 7 lung, 211 bone marrow, 20,581 cornea, and 16,859 renal transplantations. 82percent of these were donated by living and unrelated donors; 10percent by cadavers; and 8percent came from living-related donors. The 3-year renal transplant patient survival rate was 92.9%, and the 40-month graft survival rate was 85.9%.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of public}} policies, cultural, infrastructural and other factors, presumed consent or opt-out models {{do not always}} {{translate}} directly into increased effective rates of donation. The United Kingdom has several different laws and policies for the organ donation process, such as consent of a witness or guardian must be provided to participate in organ donation. In terms of effective organ donations, in some systems like Australia (14.9 donors per million, 337 donors in 2011), family members are required to give consent or refusal, or may veto a potential recovery even if the donor has consented. Some countries with an opt-out system like Spain (36 effective donors per million inhabitants) or Austria (21 donors/million) have high donor rates and some countries with opt-in systems like Germany (16 donors/million) or Greece (6 donors/million) have lower effective donation rates. The president of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation has acknowledged Spain's legislative approach is likely not {{the primary reason for}} the country's success in increasing the donor rates, starting in the 1990s. Looking to the example of Spain, which has successfully adopted the presumed consent donation system, intensive care units (ICUs) must be equipped with enough doctors to maximize the recognition of potential donors and maintain organs while families are consulted for donation. The characteristic that enables the Spanish presumed consent model to be successful is the resource of transplant coordinators; it is recommended to have at least one at each hospital where opt-out donation is practiced to authorize <b>organ</b> <b>procurement</b> efficiently.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of deceased-donor organs in the United States are allocated by federal contract to the <b>Organ</b> <b>Procurement</b> and Transplantation Network (OPTN), held since it {{was created by the}} Organ Transplant Act of 1984 by the United Network for Organ Sharing or UNOS. (UNOS does not handle donor cornea tissue; corneal donor tissue is usually handled by various eye banks.) Individual regional <b>organ</b> <b>procurement</b> organizations (OPOs), all members of the OPTN, are responsible for the identification of suitable donors and collection of the donated organs. [...] UNOS then allocates organs based on the method considered most fair by the scientific leadership in the field. The allocation methodology varies somewhat by organ, and changes periodically. [...] For example, liver allocation is based partially on MELD score (Model of End-Stage Liver Disease), an empirical score based on lab values indicative of the sickness of the person from liver disease. [...] In 1984, the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) was passed which gave way to the <b>Organ</b> <b>Procurement</b> and Transplantation Network that maintains the organ registry and ensures equitable allocation of organs.

2500|$|The United States has two {{agencies}} that govern <b>organ</b> <b>procurement</b> and distribution within the country. The United Network for Organ Sharing and the <b>Organ</b> <b>Procurement</b> and Transplant Network (OPTN) regulate <b>Organ</b> <b>Procurement</b> Organizations (OPO) {{with regard to}} procurement and distribution ethics and standards. OPOs are non-profit organizations charged with the evaluation, procurement and allocation of organs whithin their Designated Service Area (DSA). Once a donor has been evaluated and consent obtained, provisional allocation of organs commences. UNOS developed a computer program that automatically generates donor specific match lists for suitable recipients based on the criteria that the patient was listed with. OPO coordinators enter donor information into the program and run the respective lists. Organ offers to potential recipients are made to transplant centers to make them aware of a potential organ. The surgeon will evaluate the donor information and make a provisional determination of medical suitability to their recipient. Distribution varies slightly between different organs but is essentially very similar. When lists are generated many factors are taken into consideration; these factors include: distance of transplant center from the donor hospital, blood type, medical urgency, wait time, donor size and tissue typing. For heart recipients medical urgency is denoted by a recipients [...] "Status" [...] (Status 1A, 1B and status 2). Lungs are allocated based on a recipients Lung Allocation Score (LAS) that is determined based on the urgency of clinical need {{as well as the}} likelihood of benefit from the transplant. Livers are allocated using both a status system and MELD/PELD score (Model for End-stage Liver Disease/Pediatric End-stage Liver Disease). Kidney and pancreas lists are based on location, blood type, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing and wait time. When a recipient for a kidney or pancreas has no direct antibodies to the donor HLA the match {{is said to be a}} 0 ABDR mismatch or zero antigen mismatch. A zero mismatch organ has a low rate of rejection and allows a recipient to be on lower doses of immunosuppressive drugs. Since zero mismatches have such high graft survival these recipients are afforded priority regardless of location and wait time. UNOS has in place a [...] "Payback" [...] system to balance organs that are sent out of a DSA because of a zero mismatch.|$|E

40|$|The medicolegal {{problems}} related to the intoxications touch the daily practice in intensive care and emergency medicine. Physicians are often confronted {{with the problem of}} the refusal of care, in particular with the final phase of the stay in intensive care units: patients are not any more {{under the influence of the}} poisons and recovered their free will. On the medicolegal level, the doctor is out of balance between his obligation to carry help and the respect of the will of the patient, but it must bring an answer adapted to the needs for the patient. The information given to the patient takes here a paramount value, and a possible hospitalization under the constraint must be clearly justified. A toxic death must systematically lead to a declaration of suspect death, even if the suicide seems obvious. The prosecutor only has the role to declare that there was suicide, not the physician. If <b>organ</b> <b>procurements</b> are considered, it must be in agreement with the prosecutor, and be carried out according to a well standardized protocol.

2500|$|Organ donors may be living, brain dead, or dead via circulatory death. Tissue may be {{recovered}} from donors who die of circulatory death, {{as well as}} of brain death – up to 24 hours past the cessation of heartbeat. Unlike organs, most tissues (with the exception of corneas) can be preserved and stored for up to five years, meaning they can be [...] "banked". Transplantation raises a number of bioethical issues, including the definition of death, when and how consent should be given for an organ to be transplanted, and payment for organs for transplantation. Other ethical issues include transplantation tourism and more broadly the socio-economic context in which <b>organ</b> <b>procurement</b> or transplantation may occur.

[...] The interest {{over the life of}} the object includes an interest {{over the life of the}} individual who provided it as well. This has been documented by researchers examining the processes through which organ procurers select donors. As Sharp has indicated, [...] "through <b>organ</b> <b>procurement,</b> human bodies are commodified and codified following a relatively strict hierarchy of medical value and social worth". Age, race and ethnicity all play a role in the identification of ideal candidates. Organ receivers are also interested in obtaining information about donors. As Lock has mentioned, [...] "organ recipients worry about the gender, ethnicity, skin color, personality and social status of their donors, and many believe that their mode of being-in-the-world is radically changed after a transplant, thanks to the power of diffusing form the organ they have received".|$|E

50|$|Once donor {{preparation}} is accomplished, procurement can begin by utilizing {{the same standard}} techniques for all abdominal <b>organ</b> <b>procurements.</b> The team exposes the abdominal cavity and inserts two cannulae for the infusion of University of Wisconsin organ preservation solution into the aorta and inferior mesenteric vein. As the abdominal organs are cooled in situ, the surrounding tissue is dissected {{so that they may}} be quickly extracted. In the next step, the aorta is cross-clamped, cutting off blood supply to the organs. Once blood and oxygen supply to an organ is cut off, organ death will approach swiftly unless steps are taken to preserve them until transplant. Organs are therefore fully drained of blood, flushed with cool preservation solution, and removed from the body. In an isolated intestinal transplant, the colon will be detached from the small intestine. The cecum and ascending colon are devascularized, while care is taken to preserve major vasculature in the ileum. The jejunum will be separated from the duodenum while preserving the vasculature of the jejunum, ileum, mesentery, and the pancreas. If healthy, the pancreas can oftentimes be retrieved as an additional isolated procurement. The intestinal allograft, when ready to be extracted, is attached by the mesenteric , where the vessels converge out of the intestinal system. This pedicle will be stapled closed, and can be separated from the body via a transverse cut to create a vascular cuff. The complete intestinal allograft can then be removed and wrapped in a surgical towel. The protocols for combined liver and multivisceral procurements are far more complicated and meticulous than isolated intestine alone.|$|R

50|$|A major {{challenge}} facing the intestinal transplant enterprise is meeting {{the need for}} transplantable intestines, particularly in the United States {{where the majority of}} intestinal transplants take place. There exists a narrow timeslot between procurement and transplantation that any organ remains viable, and logistical challenges are faced regarding bringing organ and recipient together. During <b>procurement,</b> <b>organs</b> that are being recovered are cooled and perfused with preservation solution. This slows organ activity and increases the time they remain viable for transplant. Although chilling and perfusion may extend intestinal lifespans by several hours, failure is still imminent unless transplanted. This duration between the cooling of the <b>organ</b> during <b>procurement</b> and the restoration of physiological temperature during implantation is the cold ischemic time. Due to the sensitivity of the intestine to ischemic injury, many potential donor intestines are lost to the events following brain death and trauma. Furthermore, irreversible intestinal damage is seen after approximately only 5 hours of cold ischemia in the form of mucosal damage and bacterial translocation outside the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, ensuring cardiac survival and nearby donor-recipient proximity before procurement are essential so organs do not wait too long outside the body and without blood flow. Not only is there a lack of transplantable intestines, but a deficiency in the number of centers possessing the capability to carry out the complicated transplant procedure as well. , there were only 61 medical centers in the world capable of executing an intestinal transplant. Furthermore, many young, small children, particularly those weighing less than 5 kg, cannot find a transplant {{due to the lack of}} size-matched donors.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT&# 13; &# 13; The {{purpose of}} this study is to know and compare the {{stressors}} and the health condition of the nurses whose job is in the <b>organ</b> and tissue <b>procurement</b> transplantation. Seventeen nurses comprised the sample and they were from three <b>Organs</b> and Tissues <b>Procurement</b> Organizations (OPO), a governmental organization, in São Paulo- Brazil. Participants filled out two questionnaires. Job stress was assessed with the 39 -item scale. It is a Likert-type scale with 1 - 7 response options, " 1 " indicating no stressed and " 7 " indicating a strong stressed with the item. A higher score on the scale indicated a higher degree of job stress. Health problems were assessed by 54 - item questionnaire, with " 1 " indicating no problem and " 3 " indicating frequent problem. Stressors were classified as interpersonal relationship, nursing care, unit administration, knowledge and abilities; self perception and work conditions. The data from health condition could be: 0 to 42 as "good" health, 44 to 87 as "regular" and 88 to 130 as "bad". Fisher and Kruskal-Wallis correlation tests were used to analyse the data. Cronbach's alpha coefficients assessing internal consistency were 0. 9040. Questionnaires were distributed and collected by author, with anonymity being assured for each respondent. The majority of the respondents were female (51. 8 %), from 21 to 30 years old (70. 6 %) and had from 1 to 5 years as transplantation nurse (76. 5 %). The findings seemed to indicate that nurses were stressed. Stressors classified as "self perception" were the most stressed, and the range was from 5. 06 to 7. 0 and the less stressed items were approached by "interpersonal relationship" with the range of 3. 55. Associations statistically significant were observed: female and "work conditions" (p= 0. 024) that means that woman had more stress than man; more than 5 years after completed education had more stress and "self perception" (p= 0. 002); and who worked more than 5 years in OPO and "self perception" (p= 0. 011).
