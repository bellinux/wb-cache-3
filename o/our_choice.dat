25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{individual}} nonempty sets in the collection may {{make it possible to}} avoid the axiom of choice even for certain infinite collections. For example, suppose that each member of the collection X is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers. Every such subset has a smallest element, so to specify <b>our</b> <b>choice</b> function we can simply say that it maps each set to the least element of that set. This gives us a definite choice of an element from each set, and makes it unnecessary to apply the axiom of choice.|$|E

25|$|Steiner then {{argues that}} inner freedom is {{achieved}} when we {{bridge the gap}} between our sensory impressions, which reflect the outer appearance of the world, and our thoughts, which give us access to the inner nature of the world. Acknowledging the many influences on <b>our</b> <b>choice,</b> he points to the impact of our becoming aware of just these determinants. Outer freedom is attained by permeating our deeds with moral imagination. Steiner aims to show that these two aspects of inner and outer freedom are integral to one another, and that true freedom is only achieved when they are united.|$|E
25|$|James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, {{new head}} {{writers of the}} series, were {{reluctant}} to state whether or not Havins would be departing the soap opera. In their interview with TV Guide, the two remained ambiguous about the matter, though hinting at a recast. Barbara Esensten commented:It’s {{out there that we}} will probably lose her, and it certainly isn’t <b>our</b> <b>choice.</b> However, we’re still writing the show as if she’s not leaving. If we should have to recast Babe, we’ll help the actor take over the part by writing specifically for the new actor like what we did with the Greenlee recast. We saw some little things in Sabine Singh (Greenlee), so we wrote for her accordingly, but you get into real trouble when you completely change the character for a recast. Luckily, Jim and I don’t have any trouble separating the actor from a character because the latter is really paramount in our eyes.|$|E
500|$|Munsey's {{plan for}} the {{magazines}} was {{laid out in a}} note that appeared in the first four issues: [...] "This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years, demanding a second look at famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. [...] <b>Our</b> <b>choice</b> has been dictated by your requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." [...] The first issue included Ray Cummings' [...] "The Girl in the Golden Atom" [...] and A. Merritt's [...] "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. [...] Merritt's sequel, [...] "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by Virgil Finlay. [...] Finlay did many illustrations for Famous Fantastic Mysteries over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. [...] Frank R. Paul began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. [...] The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. [...] Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, Lawrence Stevens, or his son, Peter Stevens, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. [...] The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine {{one of the most popular}} of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels that made his reputation.|$|E

2500|$|According to Swinburne, since <b>our</b> <b>choice</b> {{of theory}} cannot be {{determined}} by data (see Underdetermination and Duhem-Quine thesis), we must rely on some criterion to determine which theory to use.

Also, we focused our cases on large urban centers. It would be valuable to verify whether the model would work well for startup ecosystems in smaller cities such as Boulder (CO, USA), São Carlos (Brazil), Trondheim (Norway), or Bolzano (Italy).|$|R
