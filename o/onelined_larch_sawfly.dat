40|$|Eastern larch (Larix laricina) {{and black}} spruce (Picea mariana) {{are the most}} {{dominant}} tree species in peatlands in Canada, however interactions between peatland hydrology and species-specific radial growth are poorly understood. This study investigates {{the relationships between the}} growth/hydrological response of eastern larch and black spruce across a topographical gradient within a peatland in Saskatchewan. Tree-ring analysis revealed that peatland hydrology is the main factor driving radial-tree growth. Black spruce {{on the edge of the}} fen showed a positive relationship to increased water-table level, while eastern larch in the fen revealed a negative correlation to water-table level rise. Further analysis illustrated that radial-tree growth response to hydrology is dependent on specific water-table levels according to species and micro-site. Identified thresholds indicated that only 8 cm of variability in water-table level can greatly affect the fen forest dynamics. Once the relationship between tree ring and hydrology was established, a multiple- species regression equation was derived from tree-ring data to reconstruct past water-table levels. Results indicated that eastern larch and black spruce are suitable proxies to reconstruct hydrological variability at the site. Eastern larch ring widths are not only subjected to change by hydrology, but they can also be altered by exposure to <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> outbreaks (Pristiphora erichsonii). Researchers have often been limited in their ability to draw accurate conclusions regarding the history of sawfly outbreaks in peatlands. Water-table level suppressions result in similar radial-growth patterns as when trees are defoliated by <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly,</b> making accurate diagnoses of <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> outbreak a challenge. In this study I investigated the relationship between sawfly outbreaks and peatland hydrology. Five outbreaks where identified using traditional dendroecological analysis. The last outbreak identified was found to be a result of hydrological growth suppression and not sawfly defoliation. Observations indicated that periods of low water-table level may lead to increased populations of <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> in northern Saskatchewan. I stress the necessity of using long-term hydrological analyses to accurately infer outbreak periods to distinguish them from water-table suppression...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of a portable and durable knockdown-type cage, designed for rearing <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> larvae in the field, is described. The cage described here was developed to facilitate recovery studies for the parasite Olesicampe (Holocremnus) sp. nr. nematorum (Tschek), released against the <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Pristiphora erichsonii (Hartig), in Manitoba and Saskatchewan (Muldrew 1967). Large quantities of sawfly cocoons were required {{from a series of}} locations surrounding the release points. These were obtained by collecting up to 200 mature larvae on each of three occasions at 12 -day intervals and rearing them on tamarack foliage in cages in the bogs until cocoons were spun in moist sphagnum moss. This procedure overcame the problems inherent in other methods of obtaining cocoons but it required a relatively large, transportable, and weatherproof cage strong enough to exclude small mammals. Additional features included in the design were adequate ventilation and drainage, protection 322 THE C"-) I. � I � IO(;IS I;arch 1967 FIG. 1.

One of the explanations of this apparent lack of interest in diseases of this tree species is the very important infestation by the <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Pristiphora Erichsonii Htg.), which, {{at the beginning of the}} present century, greatly reduced the best stands of larch in Northeast America.

40|$|Disturbances have {{a strong}} impact on tree stand {{dynamics}} across the world. In North America, the <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Pristiphora erichsonii) and larch casebearer (Cleophora laricella) are two non-native species of insects affecting tamarack across much of their native range. The majority {{of research on the}} effects of <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> on tamarack (Larix laricina) has been conducted in Canada with very little dendrochronological work in the United States along the geographical boundary of tamarack or on the effects of larch casebearer on radial growth. As a consequence, very {{little is known about the}} relationship between tamarack and these insects’ outbreaks in the United States. The traditional model of Ecological Amplitude in biogeography explains that species are limited along their southern border by species interaction, so it is very important to start to understand the relationship between predator and prey. At the Pigeon River State Fish and Wildlife Area in northern Indiana, tamarack are stressed and dying out on the landscape and local naturalists believe insect outbreaks are a potential factor. I use the traditional dendrochronological methods to develop and compare host and non-host chronologies from northern Indiana and central Michigan. I then compared these chronologies to each other, local climate variables, and insect outbreak information to better understand climate and outbreak signals in radial growth. I found that tamarack in Indiana showed a stronger negative response to temperature in Indiana than in Michigan which indicates warmer temperature play a role in limiting the southern margin of the species’ range. Tamarack also provided a good record of local insect outbreak events. Using outbreak information collected from local naturalists, I developed a tree ring outbreak signature for larch casebearer. Continued work along the southern boundary of the species will determine the combined impacts of multiple species specific predators as climate changes...|$|R
50|$|Many insect {{species are}} known to be {{destructive}} to tamaracks. The <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across Canada and the northern United States and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern Manitoba and northern Minnesota, however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the larch casebearer Coleophora laricella. The larch casebearer attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established.|$|R
40|$|During 1952 - 1956 a {{study was}} made of the loss of {{increment}} and the consequent financial losses caused by the 1941 - 1950 outbreak of the spinning <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Cephalcia alpina Klug) in Japanese larch and the 1950 - 1951 outbreak of the pine sawfly (Diprion pini L.) in Scots pine. Growth losses were compared for different degrees of defoliation. The financial losses were calculated and compared with the cost of control operations, to estimate how severe the insect attack must be to justify chemical control. Sample plots in the provinces of Drente, Gelderland and Overijssel showed that loss of increment increased with degree of defoliation. Losses of increment in Japanese larch were less on richer loamy soils than on sandy soils. It was presumed that low vigour of Japanese larch and Scots pine, probably indicated by small annual increment of the tree for a few years before an insect attack, favours this attack, and thus defoliation. This would mean that the method of calculating the loss of increment was incorrect. Further research was greatly needed. <p/...|$|R
40|$|With treeline {{position}} {{expected to}} expand northward, and upward, with climate change, there is increased attention towards understanding the mechanisms that control these patterns. Using a regional and broad scale approach, treeline dynamics, disturbance {{and response to}} recent climate warming were explored along an altitudinal gradient in the Mealy Mountains, Labrador (Canada), and across the circumpolar subarctic. To complement the western science approach to understanding climate change, a critique of modules taught to the Innu Guardians will be presented. At a regional scale in the Mealy Mountains, treeline dynamics {{over the past few}} centuries showed species-specific differences in when treeline was established and the relative rates of subsequent infilling and mortality. All tree species showed increased variability in recruitment correlations to climate across the treeline ecotone with black spruce (Picea mariana) showing consistently positive correlations, while larch (Larix laricina) shifted from strongly positive to negative and white spruce (Picea glauca) showing consistently negative correlations. Long-lived black spruce krummholz also showed significant recent increases in radial growth. Disturbance at treeline resulted in characteristic gap dynamics with low-levels of tree mortality attributed to porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) herbivory and small-scale outbreaks of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) and <b>larch</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Pristiphora erichsonii). These outbreaks occurred at lower magnitudes than observed {{in other parts of the}} boreal forest due to decreased tree density, supporting the Resource Concentration Hypothesis. Canopy gaps associated with windthrow did not have significantly different canopy structures but seedling densities of larch and black spruce, were significantly higher in exposed soil associated with windthrow disturbance. At broader spatial scales across circumpolar treeline, growth form and advancement were not significantly related to the extent of site warming but rather treeline advancement was predicted by diffuse, or 'gradual' treelines and closeness to the ocean. At the regional scale, it was expected that larch and black spruce would capitalize on warming temperatures, since these species are already exhibiting early signs of response. The frequency and magnitude of insect outbreaks is expected to increase with climate change and these data suggest that larch, and to a lesser extent, black spruce, will have enhanced regeneration dynamics. At broad spatial scales, ecological factors will continue to be significant drivers of treeline change until temperatures warm past a point where regeneration limitations, such as seed viability and establishment, are removed. Teaching and communicating climate change science illustrated the best results when taught in field conditions, while some difficulties were encountered in differentiating between short-term versus long-term change. Working with the Innu Environmental Guardians to develop a framework for detecting change in northern forests, helped to contextualize the western science approach to treeline research...|$|R

Eighteen tree ring width (TRW) chronologies were constructed at five alpine treeline sites across a 600 km long transect from the Labrador Sea to the Quebec border.

These results suggest that the radial growth response of each one of the tree species sampled is uniquely adapted to monthly and/or seasonal temperature and precipitation values during the growing season and, in some cases, to winter snowfall amounts. These climate sensitivities are also site-specific and indicative of a strong reliance on the proximity of the Labrador Sea.

The intensity and frequency of these insect outbreaks is also climate-dependent, and can be so severe as to mask the climate sensitivity in the larch trees.

The high degree of variability in the climate sensitivity of spruce trees across central Labrador is partly due to the effect of spruce budworm outbreaks on the radial growth of trees, but other site-specific factors such as moisture effects must also be contributing to the variability.
