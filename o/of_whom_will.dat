Tagalog is also spoken natively by inhabitants living on the islands, Marinduque, Mindoro, and Palawan. It is spoken by approximately 64 million Filipinos, 96% of the household population; 22 million, or 28% of the total Philippine population, speak it as a native language.|$|E
25|$|The Kelb tal-Fenek {{is usually}} taken out to hunt {{at night when}} there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the {{countryside}} and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting {{too far to the}} sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>will</b> come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret—"nemes"—may have its roots in the Greek word ''.|$|E

2500|$|The {{system has}} survived into the 21st century even though county cricketers are now {{reasonably}} well paid. The amounts raised generally vary {{from a few}} {{tens of thousands of}} pounds to low six figures. A few players (such as Graeme Hick [...] ) have made over three hundred thousand pounds. The amount that a player makes from his benefit depends on factors such as his personal popularity, contacts, social skills and fame {{at least as much as}} on his degree of financial need and the quality of his contribution to his club on the pitch. One aspect of this which attracts particular scepticism is that famous international cricketers, some <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>will</b> retire as millionaires in any case, tend to make more out of their benefit season than less well off players who have never played for their country, and who seem closer to the being the kind of [...] "deserving cause" [...] for whom benefits were first devised.

2500|$|The {{market for}} {{corporate}} control, where parties compete to buy controlling stakes in companies, {{is seen by}} some as an important, although perhaps limited, mechanism for the board of directors' accountability. Because individual shareholders {{may not be as}} likely to act collectively as a majority shareholder, the threat of a takeover when a company share price drops, heightens the prospect that a director is removed from office by an ordinary resolution under CA 2006 section 168. Since 1959 the UK has taken the approach that directors, particularly of public companies, should do nothing with the effect of frustrating a takeover bid, unless shareholders approve it by a majority {{at the time of the}} takeover. Rule 21 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers consolidates this now. Typical takeover defence tactics, routinely found in US corporate law, led by Delaware, include issuing extra shares to everyone but a takeover bidder to dilute their stake unless the bidder has the board's consent to buy shareholders' shares (a [...] "poison pill"), paying a takeover bidder to go away ("greenmail"), merely selling a key company asset to a friendly third party, or engaging in large share buyback schemes. In the US, defensive tactics must merely be employed in good faith, and be proportionate to the threat posed with regard to factors like the offer price, timing and effect on the company's stakeholders. Moreover, Delaware directors can often only be removed for a [...] "good reason" [...] (fought out in court) with a board classified into directors a third <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>will</b> be removable in any given year. This makes hostile takeovers very difficult, unless a bidder promises the incumbent board large golden parachutes in return for their consent. After much debate, the EU's newly implemented Takeover Directive decided to leave member states the option under articles 9 and 12 of whether to mandate that boards remain [...] "neutral".|$|E
