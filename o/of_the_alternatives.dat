The Blender technique allowed the Kepler team to rule out the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> including, notably, that of triple star systems. Blender then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if it is indeed caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E

A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. That is, as per the reductio ad absurdum reasoning, the statistically significant result should be highly improbable if the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. The rejection of the null hypothesis implies that the correct hypothesis lies in the logical complement of the null hypothesis. However, unless there is a single alternative to the null hypothesis, the rejection of null hypothesis does not tell us which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> might be the correct one.|$|E
25|$|The town's first station {{opened in}} 1881 and serving the Vestfold Line, was {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). With the planning of a private railway to Hvittingfoss during {{the last years of}} the 1890s, there arose a controversy over the location of a new station in Holmestrand. As both single parcels and whole wagon-loads would be transshipped between HVB and NSB, the two railway lines would necessarily have to be connected. Five proposals for lines were made, which would either give a common station for both railways in Holmestrand, or two separate stations. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> called for a common station, with the tracks either running via Gausen or the docks. A separate station was proposed either at the town square, with the connection line being built via Gausen or the docks. Alternatively, the station could be built at Gausen.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} {{function for}} <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> (nonphosphorylating) pathway is to stabilize <b>the</b> reduction state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ubiquinone pool (Qr/Qt), thereby avoiding {{an increase in}} free radical production. If the Qr/Qt were stabilized by <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway, then Qr/Qt should be less stable when <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway is blocked. Qr/Qt increased when we exposed roots of Poa annua (L.) to increasing concentrations of KCN (an inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytochrome pathway). However, when salicylhydroxamic acid, an inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway, was added at the same time, Qr/Qt increased significantly more. Therefore, we conclude that <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway stabilizes Qr/Qt. Salicylhydroxamic acid increasingly inhibited respiration with increasing concentrations <b>of</b> KCN. In <b>the</b> experiments described here <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> oxidase protein was invariably in its reduced (high-activity) state. Therefore, changes in <b>the</b> reduction state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> oxidase cannot account {{for an increase in}} activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> pathway upon titration with KCN.
