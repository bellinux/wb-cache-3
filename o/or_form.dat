5|$|Bacteria like archaea are prokaryotic – unicelluar, {{and having}} no cell nucleus or other membrane-bound organelle. Bacteria are microscopic, {{with a few}} {{extremely}} rare exceptions, such as Thiomargarita namibiensis. Bacteria function and reproduce as individual cells, but they can often aggregate in multicellular colonies.

5|$|Boletus pinophilus, {{commonly}} known as the pine bolete or pinewood king bolete, is a basidiomycete fungus of the genus Boletus found throughout Europe. For many years, Boletus pinophilus was considered a subspecies <b>or</b> <b>form</b> of the porcini mushroom B.edulis. In 2008, B.pinophilus in western North America were reclassified as a new species, Boletus rex-veris. Boletus pinophilus is edible, and may be preserved and cooked.|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed <b>or</b> <b>form</b> irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell is affected by the amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices.

5|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from Switzerland and the United States published a paper identifying the genetic cause of dominant white spotting in horses from the Franches Montagnes horse, Camarillo White Horse, Arabian horse and Thoroughbred breeds. Each of these dominant white conditions had occurred separately and spontaneously {{in the past}} 75 years, and each represents a different allele (variation <b>or</b> <b>form)</b> of the same gene. These same researchers identified a further seven unique causes of dominant white in 2009: three in distinct families of Thoroughbreds, one Icelandic horse, one Holsteiner, a large family of American Quarter Horses and a family of South German Draft horses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific proper (east of 140°W), sixteen {{tropical}} storms and eight hurricanes formed. Four of the hurricanes became major hurricanes by reaching Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

5|$|On May21, 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross <b>or</b> <b>form</b> in the Central Pacific. A day later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes. Below-average activity was expected {{as a result of}} either ENSO-Neutral or La Niña conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms <b>or</b> <b>form</b> blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E
5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting <b>or</b> <b>form</b> lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner <b>or</b> <b>form....</b> Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction {{for the purposes of this}} Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E

5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself <b>or</b> <b>form</b> loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has nocturnal {{habits and}} rests {{motionless}} {{for much of}} the day, often near vertical structures, in caves, or under ledges. It may be solitary, <b>or</b> <b>form</b> small to large groups. This ray is frequently shadowed by one or more jacks or cobia (Rachycentron canadum); these smaller fishes may feed on food stirred up by the ray's activities, or use the ray's body as cover for approaching their own prey. The round ribbontail ray hunts for bivalves, crabs, shrimps, and small bony fishes on the bottom. When feeding, it adopts a characteristic posture in which it presses the margin of its disc against the bottom and takes in water through its spiracles, which it blows through its mouth to uncover prey buried in the sediment. This species may fall prey to larger fishes such as sharks, and marine mammals. When threatened, it raises its tail over its back so that the spine faces forward, and waves it back and forth. Known parasites of this species include the monogenean Dasybatotrema spinosum, Dendromonocotyle pipinna, Neoentobdella garneri and N. taiwanensis, and the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the princely states were not uniformly {{enthusiastic}} about integrating their domains into independent India. Some, such as the rulers of Bikaner and Jawhar, were motivated to join India out of ideological and patriotic considerations, but others insisted {{that they had the}} right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, <b>or</b> <b>form</b> a union of their own. Bhopal, Travancore and Hyderabad announced that they did not intend to join either dominion. Hyderabad went as far as to appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the Portuguese to lease or buy Goa to give it access to the sea, and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its thorium reserves while asking for recognition. Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan. Bhopal attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the Muslim League to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress.|$|E
