5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> gravitationally bound {{stars that}} orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star {{system is a}} binary star, but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations {{with only a few}} stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E

5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; {{this is known as}} 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E

5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition <b>of</b> <b>two</b> (<b>or</b> <b>more)</b> names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E

5|$|Serotonin {{syndrome}} is typically {{caused by the}} use <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> serotonergic medications or drugs.

It occurs in about 15% of SSRI overdoses. It is a predictable consequence of excess serotonin on {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Onset of symptoms is typically within a day of the extra serotonin.|$|E
