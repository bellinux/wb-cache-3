5|$|Richard Edmund Neal {{was born}} February 14, 1949, in Worcester, Massachusetts, {{the oldest of}} three children. He and his two younger sisters were raised in Springfield by their mother, a housewife, and their father, a {{custodian}} at MassMutual. Neal's maternal grandparents were from Northern Ireland and his paternal grandparents were from Ireland. Neal's mother {{died of a heart}} attack when he was 13, and he was attending Springfield Technical High School when his father, an alcoholic, died. Neal and his two younger sisters moved in with their grandmother and later their aunt, forced to rely <b>on</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> checks as they grew up.|$|E
5|$|As the New Hampshire primary neared, Rockefeller {{began to}} attack Goldwater, {{claiming}} he supported a voluntary social security {{plan that would}} bankrupt the nation. Goldwater denied the charge. He campaigned in New Hampshire until the primary vote, spending approximately $150,000 as opposed to $250,000 by Rockefeller. Voters grew wary of Goldwater's stances <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>security,</b> Cuba, {{the military and the}} role of the Federal government, and were likewise turned off by Rockefeller's very public divorce. As a result, the electorate sought out other candidates. Surprisingly, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. won the primary with 35.5 percent as a write-in candidate while still serving in Vietnam and without making any public appearances in New Hampshire. Goldwater finished in second with 22.3 percent, followed by Rockefeller with 21.0 percent. Neither won any delegates from the primary. The chairman of the Florida GOP attributed the defeat to a divided campaign, which he also witnessed in his state, where party leaders such as Congressman William C. Cramer disagreed over a delegate slate.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2000 census (in which Manhattan Valley's census tracts are 187, 189, 191, 193, and 195), 48,983 {{people live}} in the community. Of the population, 44% are of Hispanic origin, 32% are African Americans, and 24% are Asians, whites, and other races. Fifty-five percent of the {{residents}} are of very low income (below 50% of the area's median family income, which is $13,854). The more affluent families reside West of Broadway (which is not Manhattan Valley) and East of Manhattan Avenue.

25|$|Unbalanced {{demographics}} and lopsided Employment-to-population ratio {{has resulted in}} extension of the retirement age, applied budgetary pressure <b>on</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> & welfare service systems (medicare, pensions), and accelerated rural depopulation. Increasing skill-erosion of the employable workforce due to technology evolutions is impacting all segments of value-addition. Stiff competition for market-access and ever-growing difficulties to retain market-shares in the global arena is impacting businesses {{who are unable to}} afford the sustained capital investment requirements for continuous product development, quicker time-to-market and superior customer management. Constraints linked to continuous skills-development and latencies in transforming legacy processes, technologies and infrastructure have had a direct impact on employment and market opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Because Connecticut was {{believed}} to be a Democratic stronghold, Connecticut's Senate seat was considered safe to remain as a Democratic seat by political analysts, but Lieberman's continued support for conservative and Bush administration policies made him vulnerable to a Democratic primary challenger. Lieberman's critics objected to what they call Lieberman's lack of commitment to the Democratic party; his opposition to affirmative action; his opposition to a Connecticut state law that would require Catholic hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims; his membership in the bipartisan Gang of 14; his support of Florida governor Jeb Bush in the Terri Schiavo case; his initial willingness to compromise <b>on</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> privatization; his alliances with Republicans; and his attacks on other Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Most Medicare Part B enrollees pay an {{insurance}} premium for this coverage; the standard Part B premium for 2013 through 2015 was $104.90 – $335.70 per month. The premium increased to over $120 {{a month in}} 2016 but only for those not <b>on</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> in 2015. A new income-based premium surtax schema has been in effect since 2007, wherein Part B premiums are higher for beneficiaries with incomes exceeding $85,000 for individuals or $170,000 for married couples. Depending {{on the extent to}} which beneficiary earnings exceed the base income, these higher Part B premiums are $139.90, $199.80, $259.70, or $319.70 for 2012, with the highest premium paid by individuals earning more than $214,000, or married couples earning more than $428,000.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) {{reported}} that growth for stock and commodities traders was forecast {{to be greater}} than 21% between 2006 and 2016. In that period, stock traders would benefit from trends driven by pensions of baby boomers and their decreased reliance <b>on</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security.</b> U.S. Treasury bonds would also be traded on a more fluctuating basis. Stock traders just entering the field suffer since few entry-level positions exist. While entry into this career field is very competitive, increased ownership of stocks and mutual funds drive substantial career growth of traders. Banks were also offering more opportunities for people of average means to invest and speculate in stocks. The BLS {{reported that}} stock traders had median annual incomes of $68,500. Experienced traders of stocks and mutual funds {{have the potential to}} earn more than $145,600 annually.|$|E
50|$|Several effects came {{together}} {{in the years following}} the 1972 amendments which rapidly changed the outlook <b>on</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> long-term financial picture from positive to problematic. By the 1970s, the phase-in period, during which workers were paying taxes but few were collecting benefits, was largely over, and the ratio of elderly population to the working population was increasing. These developments brought questions about the capacity of the long term financial structure based on a pay-as-you-go program.|$|R
