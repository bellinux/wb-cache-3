5|$|Bush entered {{office with}} the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 10,587, and the average peaked in October 2007 at over 14,000. When Bush left office, the average was at 7,949, {{one of the lowest}} levels <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} days <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> De la Rúa sent a bill to the Congress to request a federal {{intervention}} in Corrientes Province. The province had {{a high level of}} debt, and organizations of piqueteros blocked roads to make demonstrations. There were two interim governors disputing power. The bill was immediately approved. The intervenor selected for the work was Ramón Mestre.|$|E
50|$|The first President of the Association was The Duke <b>of</b> Hamilton, <b>his</b> <b>Presidency</b> ran between 1885 and 1894.|$|R

5|$|On Sunday {{afternoon}} {{and into the}} evening, Morgan, Perkins, Baker and Stillman, along with U.S. Steel's Gary and Henry Clay Frick, worked at the library to finalize the deal for U.S. Steel to buy TC and by Sunday night had a plan for acquisition. But one obstacle remained: the anti-trust crusading President Theodore Roosevelt, who had made breaking up monopolies a focus <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1792, {{with their}} {{relationship}} completely ruptured, Jefferson unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Washington to remove Hamilton, but Washington largely supported Hamilton's ideas, believing that they had led to social and economic stability. Dissonance over Hamilton's proposals also irrevocably broke the relationship between Washington and Madison, who had served as the president's foremost congressional ally {{during the first year}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b> Opponents of Hamilton and the administration won several seats in the 1792 Congressional elections, and Hamilton was unable to win Congressional approval of his ambitious economic proposals afterward.|$|E
5|$|Many {{friends and}} acquaintances came to visit the Houstons at Woodland, {{including}} members of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe who had allied with Houston during the Texas Revolution; he in return had assisted them in their being granted a reservation in east Texas. Throughout the last years <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> Houston had made numerous efforts for the Republic {{to find common ground}} with the various tribes, asserting their right to own land. Many tribes had come to respect him as their friend.|$|E
50|$|Rodgers {{retired from}} the Navy upon the {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> college <b>presidency</b> on 20 November 1911.|$|R

5|$|Nasser made Egypt fully {{independent}} of British influence, {{and the country}} became a major power {{in the developing world}} under his leadership. One of Nasser's main domestic efforts was to establish social justice, which he deemed a prerequisite to liberal democracy. During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned. By the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country and substantial resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{appointed}} {{two women}} {{to serve on}} the Supreme Court {{in the first two years}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Presidency.</b> He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring Associate Justice David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009, becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent. Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.|$|E
5|$|President Obama {{continued}} the drone strikes that President George W. Bush started during his presidency in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. Obama also ordered drone strikes in Libya in 2011, the Philippines in 2012, and Syria in 2014. Obama left about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 US troops in Iraq, 503 US troops in Syria, 133 US troops in Pakistan, 106 US troops in Somalia, 7 US troops in Yemen, and 2 US troops in Libya {{at the end}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E

50|$|Other {{important}} relics include accessories from Dr Sun's early years, {{an announcement}} of the election results <b>of</b> <b>his</b> provisional <b>presidency,</b> the imperial edict of Emperor Xuantong's abdication, and Dr Sun's inscription to Huang Xing.|$|R
2500|$|Jones {{believed}} that his primary calling was helping his father administer Bob Jones College. [...] Administration per se {{seems to have}} held little interest for him; at least his autobiography contains virtually no mention <b>of</b> <b>his</b> college <b>presidency.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Anglo-American {{immigrants}} {{residing in}} newly-independent Texas overwhelmingly desired immediate annexation by the United States. But, despite his {{strong support for}} Texas independence from Mexico, then-President Andrew Jackson delayed recognizing the new republic until the last day <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency</b> to avoid raising the issue during the 1836 general election. Jackson's political caution was informed by northern concerns that Texas could potentially form several new slave states and undermine the North-South balance in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Residence Act {{authorized}} {{the president to}} select a specific site along the Potomac for the permanent seat of government. It also authorized him to appoint three commissioners to survey and acquire property for the federal city. Washington announced his selection of a site on January 24, 1791, and planning for the new city began afterward. Washington personally oversaw this effort through the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b> In September 1791, the commissioners named the nascent city Washington, in the president's honor, and the district Columbia, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency). According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|During early 2008 Álvaro Uribe's {{approval}} rating hit 81%, {{one of the}} highest popularity levels <b>of</b> <b>his</b> entire <b>presidency.</b> In June 2008, after Operation Jaque, Uribe's approval rate rose to an unprecedented 91%. In May 2009 his popularity had dropped to 68%.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{he did so}} as Governor <b>of</b> Virginia, during <b>his</b> <b>Presidency</b> Jefferson {{refused to}} issue proclamations calling for days of prayer and thanksgiving. In a letter to Samuel Miller dated January 23, 1808, Jefferson stated: ...|$|R
50|$|He first {{ran for the}} {{presidency}} in 1889 but was defeated by José Joaquín Rodríguez. He took up the challenge of running for president in the 1901 elections, which he consequently won. This was his second presidential bid and 1902 saw the start <b>of</b> <b>his</b> only <b>presidency.</b>|$|R
5|$|Continuing a theme <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> in 2006 Mosley {{called for}} Formula One {{manufacturers}} to develop technology relevant to road cars. In recent years, {{a large proportion}} of the enormous budget of Formula One has been spent on the development of very powerful, very high-revving engines, which some say have little applicability to road cars. Mosley has announced a 10-year freeze on the development of engines, which would allow manufacturers to spend more of their budgets on environmentally friendly technology such as the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS) introduced in 2009. In July 2008, he sent a letter to the Formula One teams, in which he called for the teams to propose future sporting regulations to address specific issues including reduced fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} years <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency</b> at Nintendo, Iwata would often forego media appearances, unless new {{hardware}} was being announced, {{in order to}} spend more time programming. However, his attitude towards this changed, and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo's public relations. Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media, and he shared insights on Nintendo's employees, games, and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks. Inspiration for this series, which began in September2006, stemmed from Iwata's background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers. These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace. They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo: openness to discuss some of {{the inner workings of the}} company.|$|E
5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b> In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E
50|$|Ingersoll {{became the}} Naval War Colleges 31st {{president}} on 13 August 1957, bringing a broad background in post-World War II planning and leadership in unified commands to the college. During <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> he oversaw the changeover of the college's wargaming from manual to computerized processes, and on 13 November 1958, the Naval Electronic Warfare Simulator (NEWS) was commissioned in Sims Hall. He also {{served on the}} Civil War Centennial Commission while at the college, beginning in the autumn <b>of</b> 1957. <b>His</b> <b>presidency</b> concluded on 30 June 1960.|$|R
25|$|Looking at {{the annual}} average {{unemployment}} rates {{for each of the}} eight years of Bush's presidency, the average of all eight figures, and thus <b>of</b> <b>his</b> entire <b>presidency,</b> is 5.26%, with a low of 4.6% for the years of 2006 and 2007, and a high of 6.0% for 2003.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{graphical}} lifespan timeline of Presidents of the United States. Forty-four {{people have}} served as President of the United States since the office came into existence in 1789. They are listed in order of office (Grover Cleveland is listed in the order <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first <b>presidency).</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls, Truman instructed his Secretary of Commerce, Charles W. Sawyer, {{to take control of}} a number of the nation's steel mills in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions for the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major separation-of-powers decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). The 6–3 decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|Reagan spoke {{frequently}} at rallies with {{a strong}} ideological dimension; in December 1945, he was stopped from leading an anti-nuclear rally in Hollywood by pressure from the Warner Bros. studio. He would later make nuclear weapons a key point <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> specifically his opposition to mutual assured destruction, and he built on previous efforts to limit {{the spread of nuclear}} weapons. In the 1948 presidential election, Reagan strongly supported Harry S. Truman, appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in Los Angeles. However, in the early 1950s, as his relationship with actress Nancy Davis grew, he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 as well as Richard Nixon in 1960.|$|E
50|$|Hilary Richard Wright Johnson (June 1, 1837 - 1901) {{served as}} the 11th President of Liberia from 1884 to 1892. He was elected four times. He served as Secretary <b>of</b> State before <b>his</b> <b>presidency,</b> under the {{administration}} of Edward James Roye.|$|R
50|$|Herman Van Rompuy {{was also}} {{appointed}} {{as the first}} President of the Euro Summit, and this for the same term <b>of</b> office as <b>his</b> <b>Presidency</b> <b>of</b> the European Council. The Euro Summit meetings are to take place {{at least twice a}} year.|$|R
50|$|At the 1932 state election, Taylor {{defeated}} the sitting CPNP member, Jim Kerr {{for the seat}} <b>of</b> Enoggera. <b>His</b> extreme left wing beliefs though were a concern to the executive <b>of</b> the party, <b>his</b> <b>presidency</b> <b>of</b> the Australian-Russian Medical Aid to Soviet Russia Association in Queensland being particular concern.|$|R
