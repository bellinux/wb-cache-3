5|$|R.H. Brandling of Middleton Lodge gave land on Town Street <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> {{a church}} and parsonage in 1845. St Mary's Church was built in 1846 to designs by R. D. Chantrell, who also {{designed}} Leeds Parish Church. The church and its lych gate are designated Grade II listed buildings. The church originally had a tall spire which was taken down because of mining subsidence in 1939. There is a tradition that local miners gave either a week's wages or a week's work towards the cost of its construction.|$|E
5|$|International Speedway Corporation (ISC) {{was founded}} as Bill France Racing, Inc. (later Daytona International Speedway Corporation) in 1953 and in 1957 the company signed a {{contract}} {{for the use of}} land <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> Daytona International Speedway, one of the world's first superspeedways. A decade later, France decided to build another superspeedway, this time on a 2,000-acre (8km²) site near Talladega, Alabama and after its completion Talladega Superspeedway became NASCAR's fastest track. These two tracks were the fastest on the series schedule until the advent of restrictor plates in 1988. In 1968, the company assumed its current name to reflect its more ambitious scope. Two years later, ISC created the Motor Racing Network, a play-by-play radio network for NASCAR races, with MRN's first race coverage coming at the 1970 Daytona 500.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese {{established}} an institute to train female schoolteachers for the Anglican schools in Brighton {{and the rest}} of Sussex in Black Lion Street in The Lanes (the ancient heart of the town) in April 1842. This was done in association with the National Society for the Education of the Poor in the Principles of the Established Church. More space was soon needed, so in 1854 it found a site {{on the west side of}} Ditchling Road <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a larger college. Ditchling Road, which ran across Ditchling Beacon to Ditchling village and then on to Cuckfield and eventually London, became a turnpike in 1770 and was thereafter one of the main north–south routes into and out of Brighton. The chosen site was on the north side of Viaduct Road, which was built to link Ditchling and London Roads and which formed the northern edge of Brighton's ecclesiastical parish and municipal borough until 1873.|$|E

5|$|The hermitage is {{believed}} to have been founded by Phrin las rgya mtsho (d. 1667), who was the regent of Tibet from 1665 to his death. He was a student of the Fifth Dalai Lama and requested his permission to build a hermitage for eight to sixteen monks in the foothills above his native Nyangbran and invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to perform a “site investigation” (sa brtag) to determine the most auspicious location <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the monastery. The Dalai Lama made the treasure (gter) discovery of the self-arisen stone image of the Buddha that is still located in Chupzang’s lower temple. However, the initial hermitage fell into ruin and the official founding of the monastery is credited to Phrin las rgya mtsho's nephew, Sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, in around 1696.|$|E
5|$|Although Fillmore {{had retired}} from the {{legislature}} after the 1831 session, he did not remain absent from politics for long. In 1832, {{he ran for the}} House of Representatives, and was elected. The Anti-Masonic presidential candidate, former Attorney General William Wirt, won only Vermont as President Jackson easily gained re-election. At the time, Congress convened its annual session in December, and so Fillmore had to wait {{more than a year after}} his election to take his seat. Fillmore, Weed, and others had realized that opposition to Masonry was too narrow a foundation <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a national party, and assembled the broad-based Whig Party from National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs were initially united by their opposition to Jackson, but became a major party by expanding their platform to include support for economic growth through rechartering the Second Bank of the United States and federally funded internal improvements including roads, bridges, and canals. Weed joined the Whigs before Fillmore, and became a power within the party; his anti-slavery views were stronger than Fillmore's (who, though he disliked slavery, deemed the federal government without power over it), and closer to those of another prominent New York Whig, William H. Seward of Auburn, who was also seen as a Weed protégé.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{directors are}} allowed to freely interpret the base mythology when they create their games. When referring to this freedom, Tabata has compared the mythos and the concept behind it to Greek mythology; a mythology with common themes and deities, but featuring a large variety of unrelated stories. Toriyama conceived a story for Final Fantasy XIII set primarily around the mythos' deities and their direct relations to the world. Tabata and Nomura both focused more on the human side of the story. Tabata chose to portray the divine elements from a historical standpoint in Type-0, while Nomura created a modern-day setting similar to contemporary Earth in XV, referring far less to the mythos' terminology. Nomura was also appointed as the main character designer for all entries in the subseries. In a 2007 interview, Hashimoto compared the planning of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series to film franchises such as Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings: an expansive brand <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> multiple Final Fantasy titles planned in advance. The development of all games connected to the mythos was handled by Square Enix 1st Production Department. A trademark for Final Fantasy Haeresis XIII hinted at another entry, but the trademark expired in 2011 and the company did not renew.|$|E

25|$|The Texans are the {{youngest}} franchise in the NFL, having only been {{competing in the}} NFL since 2002.

25|$|Ybor’s {{idea was}} to build a {{modified}} company town.

60|$|The form of {{the little}} mass of rock <b>on</b> <b>which</b> they had <b>to</b> <b>build</b> was very unfavourable. Not only was it small--so small that the largest circle which it was {{possible}} to draw on it was only twenty-five feet six inches in diameter, but its surface sloped so much as to afford a very insecure foundation for any sort of building, even if the situation had been an unexposed one.|$|R

25|$|The Qissa-i Sanjan {{is a tale}} of {{the journey}} of the Parsis to India from Iran. It says they fled for reasons of {{religious}} freedom and they were allowed to settle in India thanks to the goodwill of a local Hindu prince. However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a fire temple.|$|E

Their grandfather advised them to watch for omens from the gods, so each stood on his hill and watched for birds. Remus was the first to see six vultures flying, but Romulus saw twelve, and therefore the Palatine Hill was made the beginning of the city, and Romulus was chosen king. Remus was affronted, and when the mud wall was being raised around the space intended for the city, he leapt over it and laughed, whereupon Romulus struck him dead, crying out, [...] "So perish all who leap over the walls of my city." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{caused the}} sand under Port Royal to liquefy and flow out into Kingston Harbour. The water table was generally only two feet down before the impact, {{and the town}} was built on a layer of some 65 feet of water-saturated sand. This type of area did not provide a solid foundation <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> an entire town. Unlike the Spanish before them, the English had decided to settle and develop the small area of land, even while acknowledging that the area was nothing but “hot loose sand”.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the first}} two days of having landed at Sullivans Cove, shelter was {{provided}} for all of the Europeans through the erection of tents. With the winter approaching, the establishment of permanent shelters was of top priority, but took much longer than desired. The difficulty in obtaining timber from the thick forests, and establishing clearings <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> proved worse than first believed. A lack of saws, axes and other cutting tools made this process even harder. A shortage of building materials beset the colony, and local manufacture of timber products was slower than had been hoped.|$|E

50|$|Observation of {{time-dependent}} asymmetries in {{the production}} of certain flavor-symmetric final states (such as J/Ψ K) was an easier way to detect CP violation in B mesons, both theoretically and experimentally. An asymmetric accelerator, one in which the electrons and positrons had different energies, was necessary to measure the time difference between B0 and 0 decays. CESR and CLEO submitted a proposal <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a low energy ring in the existing tunnel and upgrade the CLEO II detector with NSF funding. SLAC also submitted a proposal <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a B factory with DOE funds. The initial designs were first reviewed in 1991, but DOE and NSF agreed that insufficient funds were available <b>to</b> <b>build</b> either facility and a decision <b>on</b> <b>which</b> one <b>to</b> <b>build</b> was postponed. The proposals were reconsidered in 1993, this time with both facilities competing for DOE money. In October 1993, it was announced that the B factory would be built at SLAC.|$|R
