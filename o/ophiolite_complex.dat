2500|$|Several studies {{support the}} {{conclusion}} that ophiolites formed as oceanic lithosphere. Seismic velocity structure studies have provided most of the current knowledge of the oceanic crust’s composition. For this reason, researchers carried out a seismic study on an <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complex</b> (Bay of Islands, Newfoundland) {{in order to establish}} a comparison. The study concluded that oceanic and ophiolitic velocity structures were identical, pointing to the origin of ophiolite complexes as oceanic crust. [...] The observations that follow support this conclusion. Rocks originating on the seafloor show chemical composition comparable to unaltered ophiolite layers, from primary composition elements such as silicon and titanium to trace elements. Seafloor and ophiolitic rocks share a low occurrence of silica-rich rocks; those present have a high sodium and low potassium content. The temperature gradients of the metamorphosis of ophiolitic pillow lavas and dykes are similar to those found beneath ocean ridges today. [...] Evidence from the metal-ore deposits present in and near ophiolites and from oxygen and hydrogen isotopes suggests that the passage of seawater through hot basalt in the vicinity of ridges dissolved and carried elements that precipitated as sulfides when the heated seawater came into contact with cold seawater. The same phenomenon occurs near oceanic ridges in a formation known as hydrothermal vents. [...] The final line of evidence supporting the origin of ophiolites as seafloor is the region of formation of the sediments over the pillow lavas: they were deposited in water over 2nbsp&km deep, far removed from land-sourced sediments.|$|E

40|$|The Shetland complex exemplifies a {{class of}} olivine-rich, platiniferous <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes</b> {{generated}} by unusually high degrees of hydrous melting in a supra-subduction zone setting. In this environment the crystallization of abundant olivine from unusually picritic magmas has produced an exceptionally thick sequence of crustal dunite cumulates. Significant Pt + Pd concentrations (1 - 4 ppm) occur where such sulphide-bearing dunites are spatially associated with podiform chromite concentrations. In the area north of Balta Sound the chromitites appear to lie in distinct stratigraphic zones. A detailed programme of lithogeochemical and soil-rock interface geochemical exploration was undertaken, which culminated in diamond drilling and the successful intersection of three stratiform horizons of sulphide-bearing dunites and associated precious-metal mineralization. Cryptic geochemical layering is described at scales from 200 m to less than 1 cm.

40|$|Studying the <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes</b> using {{multispectral}} {{remote sensing}} satellite data are interesting {{because of high}} diversity of minerals {{and the source of}} podiform chromitites. This research developed an approach to discriminate lithological units and detecting host rock of chromitite bodies within ophiolitic complexes using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite data. Three main <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes</b> located in south of Iran have been selected for the study. Spectral transform techniques, including minimum noise fraction (MNF) and specialized band ratio were employed to detect different rock units and the identification of high-potential areas of chromite ore deposits within ophiolitic complexes. A specialized band ratio (4 / 1, 4 / 5, 4 / 7) of ASTER, MNF components and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) on ASTER and Landsat TM data were used to distinguish ophiolitic rock units. Results show that the specialized band ratio was able to identify different rock units and serpentinized dunite as host rock of chromitites within ophiolitic complexes, appropriately. MNF components of ASTER and Landsat TM data were suitable to distinguish ophiolitic rock complexes at a regional scale. The integration of SAM and Feature Level Fusion (FLF) used in this investigation discriminated the ophiolitic rock units and prepared detailed geological map for the study area. Accordingly, high potential areas (serpentinite dunite) were identified in the study area for chromite exploration targets. The approach used in this research offers the image processing techniques as a robust, reliable, fast and cost-effective method for detecting serpentinized dunite as host rock of chromitite bodies within vast <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes</b> using ASTER and Landsat TM satellite data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{summarize}} the present knowledge on bioalteration of basaltic glass from pillow lava rims of former oceanic crust, {{based on the}} study of four <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes.</b> These complexes range i age from Late Cretaceous to Mid-Proterozoic, and their metamorphic grades vary from non-metamorphosed to low greenschist- to low amphibolite-facies metamorphism. In the non-metamorphosed volcanic part of <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes,</b> in which undevitrified glass is till present inpillow lava rims and/or hyaloclastites, biogenerated textures are common. These textures (termed granular and tubular) are similar to those found i volcanic glass of recent to old (170 Ma) in situ ocean floor, and mimic microbes in terms of size and shape. In the metamorphic and completely recrystallized ex mples, the textural evidence of bioalteration is generally obliterated, although it may still be visible in little-deformed volcanic domains of low-grade greenschist-facies metamorphism. Where biogener-ated textures are present, element mapping invariably reveals the presence of organicarbon, and sometimes nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus. Carbon-isotope signatures (~ 13 C) in the pillow lava rims from all four investigated ophiolites show lower values than those of the adjacent crystalline parts. This phenomenon may be attributed to bio-induced fractionation o...|$|R
40|$|All six PGE {{have been}} {{recorded}} as concentrated at parts per million (ppm) {{in a number of}} <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes.</b> Occurrences of PGE concentrations in ophiolites are common in podiform chromitite where Os, Ir and Ru may be concentrated to give negative slope chondrite normalised patterns. If sulphur saturation of the magma occurred during chromite crystallisation then Pt and Pd + Rh will also be concentrated in the chromitite giving positive chondrite normalised patterns. PGE-rich <b>ophiolite</b> <b>complexes</b> are those where there has been sufficient mantle melting, in a subduction zone, to extract the PGE at a critical melting interval. Too much melting will dilute this melt with PGEbarren melt and too little melting will not extract the PGE. The Scottish Shetland ophiolite is an example in which all 6 PGE have been concentrated in base metal sulphide-bearing podiform chromitite. It is proposed that if all the PGE are concentrated in podiform chromitite then they crystallised from one PGE-rich melt that was close to sulphur saturation. Exploration for PGE within ophiolites is likely to be enhanced by growing evidence that there is a link between chromite composition and PGE concentration...|$|R
