40|$|Memory leak is {{unrecoverable}} {{software bug}} that causes performance degradation and re- liability issues to software applications. Although memory management systems exist in modern Object Oriented Language to reclaim unused memory store, memory leak can still happen, {{and continue to}} exhaust memory resource. In Java, where there is garbage col- lection for releasing unused objects, memory leaks manifest itself {{in the form of}} unused <b>object</b> <b>retention.</b> Since Java Programming language allocates objects on heap, the lifetime of an object deviates from the stack discipline, which can be a challenge in detecting Java memory leak. In this thesis, we propose a collaborative approach in detecting Java memory leaks through verifying Object Lifetime Specification at runtime. We designed a runtime verifier that leverages Java Virtual Machine technologies to monitor and extract annotated infor- mation from the user application, and use that information to verify against Java Virtual Machine events to detect unintentional <b>object</b> <b>retention</b> in the Java application under test. We implemented our runtime verifier with Maxine Virtual Machine, an open source, meta-circular virtual machine developed by Oracle Lab, and conducted experiments and DaCapo benchmark to evaluate its accuracy and performance efficiency. The results show that the runtime verification tool successfully identifies junk objects for different semantic cases proposed in this thesis with certain runtime overhead. Through the research and experimental results, we further make implications on how to improve the performance overhead associated with current design and implementation methods in detecting unused <b>object</b> <b>retention,</b> which in the long term constitute memory leak and performance bug...|$|E

Many hydraulic structures (reservoirs, retentions, tunnels, etc.) have been built since the middle of 20 th century in order to protect polje against floods.

40|$|Damage to the {{hippocampus}} has {{been implicated in}} the permanent loss of memory in patients with medial temporal lobe resections. In two previous studies, it was established that bilateral ablations of {{the hippocampus}} in the monkey impaired performance on an associative learning task and on an <b>object</b> discrimination <b>retention</b> task. The two objectives {{of the present study}} were to assess the long term effects of hippocampal resections in the monkey and to extend the analysis of the effects of these resections to recognition memory. Therefore, the performance of monkeys with either hippocampal ablations or fornix transections, sustained 5 years earlier, was compared (1) on a concurrent discrimination task-a previously unencountered associative learning task-and (2) on a nonmatching-to-sample recognition task with either delays interposed between the presentation of the sample object and the recognition trial or with lists of either l-, 3 -, 5 -, or lo-object samples. Significant impairment on both tasks was found after hippocampal, but not after fornix, damage. Though monkeys in the hippocampal group were impaired on both delays and lists, the impairment was more severe on the lists, with abnormal sensitivity to pro- and retroactive interference as a possible source of difficulty.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Retrograde and {{anterograde}} object-recognition {{memory was}} assessed in rats with cytotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation (HPC), using a paradigm {{based on the}} natural tendency of rats {{to spend more time}} exploring novel objects than familiar objects. The rats were allowed to explore a sample object for 5 min/day on 5 consecutive days, either 5 weeks or 1 week before surgery. After surgery, retrograde recognition was assessed by comparing {{the amount of time spent}} exploring the sample versus a novel object in a free-choice situation. Control rats spent more time exploring the novel object than the sample objects from both presurgery time periods, whereas rats with HPC lesions did not discriminate between the novel objects and sample objects from either presurgery time period. Despite their deficits on the retrograde recognition test, the rats with HPC lesions performed like control rats on anterograde recognition tests, displaying a strong exploratory preference for novel objects over sample <b>objects,</b> with <b>retention</b> delays of either 15 min or 24 h. The findings suggest that extrahippocampal circuitry is capable of supporting object recognition, but only if the HPC does not participate in encoding the original encounter with the object. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|The {{effects of}} fornix lesions were {{examined}} in an object recognition memory test based on spontaneous exploration. In the standard condition an object (A) was presented in the sample phase and then presented again in the test phase alongside a new object (B). Both fornix-transected (Fx) and control (Co) rats spent more time exploring the new object than the familiar <b>object</b> after <b>retention</b> delays of 1 min and 15 min. In two configural conditions designed to test sensitivity to reconfigured stimuli, the original sample (A) was now either re-presented alongside its rearranged version (∀), or the re-arranged version itself (∀) was presented with a new object (B). In the first configural condition, both the Co and Fx rats spent more time exploring the reconfigured sample (∀) than the original version of the sample (A) following a delay of 1 min, but not 15 min. In the second configural condition, both Co and Fx rats spent more time exploring the new object (B) than the reconfigured version of the sample (∀) following a delay of 15 min but not 1 min.

Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 40, 2281 - 2288. doi: 10. 1037 /a 0038141 There {{has been much}} recent interest {{in the loss of}} visual short-term memories over the passage of time. According to decay theory, visual representations are gradually forgotten as time passes, reflecting a slow and steady distortion of the memory trace. However, this is controversial and decay effects can be explained in other ways. The present experiment aimed to reexamine the maintenance and loss of visual information over the short term. Decay and temporal distinctiveness models were tested using a delayed discrimination task, in which participants compared complex and novel <b>objects</b> over unfilled <b>retention</b> intervals of variable length. Experiment 1 found no significant change in the accuracy of visual memory from 2 to 6 s, but the gap separating trials reliably influenced task performance. Experiment 2 found evidence for information loss at a 10 -s retention interval, but temporally separating trials restored the fidelity of visual memory, possibly because temporally isolated representations are distinct from older memory traces. In conclusion, visual representations lose accuracy at some point after 6 s, but only within temporally crowded contexts. These findings highlight the importance of temporal distinctiveness within visual short-term memory...|$|R

40|$|Rationale Cannabidiol, {{the main}} nonpsychotropic {{constituent}} of Cannabis sativa, possesses {{a large number}} of pharmacological effects including anticonvulsive, sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective, as demonstrated in clinical and preclinical studies. Many neurodegenerative disorders involve cognitive deficits, and this has led to interest in whether cannabidiol could be useful in the treatment of memory impairment associated to these diseases. Objectives We used an animal model of cognitive impairment induced by iron overload in order to test the effects of cannabidiol in memory-impaired rats. Methods Rats received vehicle or iron at postnatal days 12 - 14. At the age of 2 months, they received an acute intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or cannabidiol (5. 0 or 10. 0 mg/kg) immediately after the training session of the novel object recognition task. In order to investigate the effects of chronic cannabidiol, iron-treated rats received daily intraperitoneal injections of cannabidiol for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, they were submitted to <b>object</b> recognition training. <b>Retention</b> tests were performed 24 h after training. Results A single acute injection of cannabidiol at the highest dose was able to recover memory in iron-treated rats. Chronic cannabidiol improved recognition memory in iron-treated rats. Acute or chronic cannabidiol does not affect memory in control rats. Conclusions The present findings provide evidence suggesting the potential use of cannabidiol for the treatment of cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Further studies, including clinical trials, are warranted to determine the usefulness of cannabidiol in humans suffering from neurodegenerative disorders.

In this study, we investigated the effects of vortioxetine on the period length of PER 2 ::LUC expression, circadian behavior, and episodic memory, using tissue explants from genetically modified PER 2 ::LUC mice, locomotor activity rhythm monitoring, and the object recognition test, respectively. Incubation of tissue explants from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of PER 2 ::LUC mice with 0. 1  μM vortioxetine increased the period length of PER 2 bioluminescence. Monitoring of daily wheel-running activity of Sprague–Dawley rats treated with vortioxetine (10  mg/kg, s. c.), alone or in combination with the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist flesinoxan (2. 5  mg/kg, s. c.) or the 5 -HT 7 receptor antagonist SB 269970 (30  mg/kg, s. c.), just prior to activity onset revealed significant delays in wheel-running behavior. The increase in circadian period length and the phase delay produced by vortioxetine were abolished {{in the presence of the}} 5 -HT 7 receptor partial agonist AS 19.

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar os efeitos de diferentes doses de cetamina na memória de longa duração no modelo de reconhecimento de novo objeto e analisar os níveis de BDNF no hipocampo dos ratos após injeção intraperitoneal (i. p.) de cetamina. Ratos Wistar machos adultos foram treinados em uma tarefa de reconhecimento de novo objeto e a retenção da memória foi avaliada 24 h após o treino. A administração pós-treino de cetamina prejudicou de forma dose-dependente a retenção da memória de reconhecimento. Experimentos controle mostraram que a cetamina não afetou a memória quando administrada 6 h após o treino ou 24 h antes do treino. Para a dosagem dos níveis de BDNF no hipocampo dorsal, os animais foram treinados e imediatamente receberam salina ou 20 mg/kg de cetamina e foram sacrificados 3 h mais tarde.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the utility of}} computer assisted instruction with more conventional interpersonal tuition for teaching word recognition skills to mentally retarded adults. A second aspect of the research was to evaluate acquisition, retention, and transfer of learning using two common methods of instruction; these were errorless discrimination (word-focus only) and paired associate learning (picture-word focus). Recognition of words {{was selected as the}} experimental task on the basis that this was a practical academic area that traditionally involves large amounts of teaching time, primarily within the realm of drill and practice procedures. The sample comprised 52 subjects who were drawn from three special education facilities in Palmerston North, New Zealand (a Special School, and two Vocational Training Centres). Subjects were screened initially on tests of visual perception and letter discrimination to ensure that they possessed requisite skills to benefit from participation in training. Pre-testing was carried out to determine whether subjects were able to recall or recognize any of the words to be taught. All subjects entering the experiment knew two or less of 16 words selected for inclusion in the training programmes. Subjects were randomly assigned to computer assisted instruction or individual tuition groups with 26 persons placed in each group. Within each group, subjects were again randomly allocated to receive errorless discrimination or paired associate modes of instruction. This 2 X 2 classification resulted in 13 subjects being placed in each subgroup. Two modules each containing eight words were used for training. Both the individual instruction and computer groups were given a total of 10 training sessions, or five sessions for each of the two modules. A modified microcomputer was interfaced with a sound-on-slide projector to provide both audio and visual instruction. Parallel teaching programmes were developed for administration by computer or individual tuition. The first programme (errorless discrimination) required subjects to select target words from a series of increasingly complex word discriminations with no picture cues provided. A second teaching method (paired associate learning) involved the pairing of pictures and words. Subjects were instructed to select target words from a list of printed items that matched referent photographs. Thirteen senior special education students (Teachers College Graduates) carried out the individual training while the experimenter supervised the computer based programmes. Progress in training was assessed by comparing pre- and post-test performance on Word Recognition (verbal labelling), Word Identification (pointing on cue), and Picture-Word Matching. Transfer of learning was evaluated using situational tests requiring that subjects match printed words with real life <b>objects.</b> Tests of <b>retention</b> were conducted four weeks after completion of training. A repeated measures design was used with counterbalancing to control for possible confounding effects of list order (Modules). The findings revealed that both computer assisted instruction and interpersonal tuition resulted in very similar learning outcomes with regard to acquisition, retention, and transfer of learning. No reliable {{differences were found between the}} two groups or modes of instruction in terms of training method. It was advanced that some common features of programmed instruction (e. g. active participation, self-pacing, over-learning, and immediate feedback) may have accounted for these equal gains in performance. In respect to the question of the potential utility of microprocessor technology in special education, this research points to the efficacy of computer assisted instruction for drill and tutorial practice. Specifically, the computer provides a highly structured learning experience that has the potential to assist retarded learners in organising input materials. Evidence from this study suggests that computer related learning environments give the adult learner considerably more control of the teaching situation, and provide consistent reinforcement that is not so readily administered through conventional forms of instruction. Finally, it was proposed that the relatively impersonal, though highly interactive, nature of the computer may avoid the triggering of perceptions of failure that can impede performance of handicapped learners.
