5|$|The main role of NAD in {{metabolism}} is {{the transfer}} of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by {{a large group of}} enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone <b>oxidoreductase</b> catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q. However, these enzymes are also referred to as dehydrogenases or reductases, with NADH-ubiquinone <b>oxidoreductase</b> commonly being called NADH dehydrogenase or sometimes coenzyme Q reductase.|$|E
5|$|In mammals, this {{metabolic}} pathway {{is important in}} beta oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids and choline, as it accepts electrons from multiple acetyl-CoA dehydrogenases. In plants, ETF-Q <b>oxidoreductase</b> is also important in the metabolic responses that allow survival in extended periods of darkness.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an <b>oxidoreductase</b> enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E

5|$|Mycena purpureofusca {{has been}} {{investigated}} for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and printing processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The fungus mycelium produces high levels of laccase, an <b>oxidoreductase</b> enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due {{to their ability to}} break down various recalcitrant compounds. M.purpureofusca laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.|$|E
5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite <b>oxidoreductase</b> to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite <b>oxidoreductase</b> to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMitochondria {{from various}} organisms, {{especially}} plants, fungi and many bacteria contain so-called alternative NADH:ubiquinone <b>oxidoreductases</b> that catalyse the same redox reaction as respiratory chain complex I, {{but do not}} contribute to the generation of transmembrane proton gradients. In eucaryotes, these enzymes are associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, with their NADH reaction site facing either the mitochondrial matrix (internal alternative NADH:ubiquinone <b>oxidoreductases)</b> or the cytoplasm (external alternative NADH:ubiquinone <b>oxidoreductases).</b> Some of these enzymes also accept NADPH as substrate, some require calcium for activity. In the past few years, the characterisation of several alternative NADH:ubiquinone <b>oxidoreductases</b> on the DNA and on the protein level, of substrate specificities, mitochondrial import and targeting to the mitochondrial inner membrane has greatly improved our understanding of these enzymes.

5|$|Succinate-Q <b>oxidoreductase,</b> {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E

25|$|The {{paradigm}} of toxicological assessment of benzene is shifting towards {{the domain of}} molecular toxicology as it allows understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms in a better way. Glutathione seems {{to play an important}} role by protecting against benzene-induced DNA breaks and it is being identified as a new biomarker for exposure and effect. Benzene causes chromosomal aberrations in the peripheral blood leukocytes and bone marrow explaining the higher incidence of leukemia and multiple myeloma caused by chronic exposure. These aberrations can be monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes to assess the effects of benzene along with the hematological tests as markers of hematotoxicity. Benzene metabolism involves enzymes coded for by polymorphic genes. Studies have shown that genotype at these loci may influence susceptibility to the toxic effects of benzene exposure. Individuals carrying variant of NAD(P)H:quinone <b>oxidoreductase</b> 1 (NQO1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX) and deletion of the glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) showed a greater frequency of DNA single-stranded breaks.|$|E
