40|$|As many {{chemotherapy}} regimens induce follicular depletion, fertility preservation {{became a}} major concern in young cancer patients. By maintaining follicles at the resting stage, gonad-otropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) were proposed as an ovarian-protective option during chemotherapy. However, their efficacy and mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated. Mice were dosed with cyclophosphamide (Cy, 100 – 500 mg/kg i. p) to quantify follicular depletion and evaluate apoptosis at different times. We observed a dose-depen-dent depletion of the follicular reserve within 24 hours after Cy injection with a mean follicu-lar loss of 45 % at the dose of 200 mg/kg. Apoptosis occurs in the granulosa cells of growing follicles within 12 hours after Cy treatment, while no apoptosis was detected in resting folli-cles suggesting that chemotherapy acutely affects both resting and growing follicles through different mechanisms. We further tested the ability of both GnRH agonist and antagonist to inhibit <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycles,</b> follicular growth and FSH secretion in mice and to protect ovarian reserve against chemotherapy.

This is highlighted most obviously in mutant mouse models whereby deletion or mutation of single genes results not only in disrupted circadian rhythmicity, but also compromised male and female reproductive function. In this review, we discuss the presence of circadian clocks in female and male reproductive tissues and the role these clocks play in the generation of <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycles,</b> ovulation, sperm generation, implantation and the maintenance of pregnancy. Given the increased incidence of shiftwork and international travel which disrupt circadian rhythmicity, and the increasing prevalence of reproductive technologies whereby early embryo development occurs without external time cues, it is important for us to consider the role of circadian rhythms in fertility.

In order to evaluate the morphological, morphometric and histomorphometric features of ovaries, uterus and uterine tubes (UTs) characteristics of prepubertal gilts at different <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> stages, reproductive tracts from 48 animals immediately after slaughter were obtained. After, the structures were dissected and removed, and the ovaries were used for classification of <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> stage of each gilt in follicular phase (FP) and luteal phase (FL). Then, morphometric evaluations of ovaries, UTs, uterine horns and uterine body were performed. Besides that, medial segments of UTs and uterus were fixed in Bouin solution, processed and included in paraffin, when histological sections of 5. 0 micrometers (µm) were obtained and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. Histomorphometric analyzes using image capture system and specific software were performed. Afterwards, data were submitted to Student's t test for assessment the statistical differences (P 0. 05) between morphometric parameters of ovaries, UTs and uterus of gilts in FP and LP. Likewise, in respect to the placement of reproductive structures, both in the <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> stages, as in the general average, {{there was no difference}} (P> 0. 05). Regarding the histomorphometric variables, gilts classified in FP presented a higher (P< 0. 05) height of glandular and UT epithelium compared to animals in LP.

The probability of ejaculation is affected by various physiological and social factors, for example reproductive state of male and female and operational sex-ratio. In this paper, we present quantitative and qualitative data on patterns of sexual behaviour in a captive group of hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas), a species with a polygynous–monandric mating system. We observed more than 700 copulations and analysed factors that can affect the probability of ejaculation. Multilevel logistic regression analysis and Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) model selection procedures revealed that the probability of successful copulation increased as the size of female sexual swellings increased, indicating increased probability of ovulation, and as the number of females per one-male unit (OMU) decreased. In contrast, occurrence of female copulation calls, sex of the copulation initiator, and previous male aggression toward females did not affect the probability of ejaculation. Synchrony of <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycles</b> also had no effect (most likely because the sample size was too small). We also observed 29 extra-group copulations by two non-adult males.

40|$|The {{anatomical}} {{location of}} the mare´s corpus luteum prevents manual examination and therefore {{makes it impossible to}} assess it via transrectal palpation. Merely the corpus haemorrhagicum is located in the fossa ovarica initially, but due to its soft consistency it might mistakenly be identified as preovulatoric follicle. Consequently a dominant but non-ovulatoric follicle of the first wave of follicular growth is frequently exploited unsuccessfully for artificial insemination, because of not diagnosing an existing corpus luteum. The sonographic examination of the equine ovaries enhances the reliability of the examination and diagnoses. Corpora lutea can be detected in most instances by ultrasonic imaging of the <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> of the mare. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine if the conversion-processes of the corpora lutea can be detected and assigned to the corresponding stages of <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> by ultrasonic imaging. Furthermore it should have been checked if it is possible to objectify ultrasonic images of corpora lutea by grey scale measurement and if usable data for an enhanced cycle diagnosis can be obtained from this technique. For the realisation of this work were 53 mares of warmblood breed, heavy draught breed and trotter horses available. The mares were examined every five days from ovulation on. If case of gravidity having been diagnosed on examination day 15 or 20, a further examination followed in order to confirm the result on day 35 after ovulation. When no gravidity had been detected, the mares have been included in the investigations again at the time a new <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> startet. The results from the ultrasonic imaging have been recorded on a digital videotape recorder and stored on a personal computer for a subjective assessment and objective evaluation. The subjective assessment concluded following results: 1. The follicle can be well displayed by ultrasonic imaging at the time of ovulation, allowing to make reliable diagnosis when palpatoric results are indistinct. A newly developed corpus haemorrhagicum and corpus luteum can be easily identified, especially if good documentations on former findings are at hand. 2. Depending on the length of <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> and the season signs of a beginning luteolysis can be recognized by ultrasonic imaging. It is a very helpful method to find signs for a newly expected <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle.</b> 3. The images of corpora lutea contain a high variability. Throughout the <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> heavy deviations can be detected. To get revealing information about the correlation between the sonographic image and the functional characteristics, additional research will have to be done. The objective evaluation by grey scale measurement gave following results: 1. A grey scale measurement can be conducted if the corpus luteum has been definitively identified. 2. The grey scale measurement allows to make observations of the grey scale value development of the equine corpus luteum. The differences in the grey scale value of corpora lutea can be detected for a mare population. Single values of each animal can not be related to a distinct state or event in the <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle.</b> 3. Compared to formerly taken measurements at the expected time of luteolysis an intense decrease in the grey scale value can be seen as a sign for the regression of a corpus luteum. This decrease often corresponds to a change in the ultrasonographic image of a corpus luteum. 4. The results, classified into the various breeds, indicate a similar trend in the grey scale measurement of the corpus luteum. However, differences between the breeds do occur once in a while, especially concerning the values of the heavy draught...|$|E

For this stage parabasal and intermedial cells, erythrocytes and leukocytes are typical in the cytological smear of vagina. Estrus is the period of sexual willingness. In this period matured follicle burst and subsequent egg ovulation. In this cytology smear dominating superficial squamous cells are typical for this period. There can observed erytrocytes. In initial period of estrus too large intermediate cells often appear. In the next period, metestrus, the corpus luteum is gradually developing. Cytology smear from vagina is characterized by the presence of large numbers of neutrophils, typical are parabasal and small intermediate cells. In anestrus manifests luteal activity of the corpus luteum. Vaginal cytology is characterized by finding parabasal, small intermediate cells and leukocytes. Vaginal cytology is a simple, quick, noninvasive and inexpensive procedure that allows us to identify the stage of the reproductive cycle of bitches and to diagnose some pathologic conditions of the genital tract (hormonal dysfunctions, inflammatory or neoplastic diseases). More than other domestic animals vaginal cytologic changes are expressed in the bitch which correlate with each phase of the estrous cycle...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 26 Brown Swiss cows {{were used to}} compare the {{synchronization}} and superovulatory response of follicle stimulating hormone treated cows that were synchronized with progesterone+oestradiol valerate or benzoate. Control cows (n = 8) were superstimulated with follicle stimulating hormone using twice daily injections with decreasing doses from day 10 – 13 after determined reference oestrus. Cows in treatment groups were received either ear implant (n = 9) containing norgestomet+oestradiol valerate or progesterone releasing intravaginal device (n = 9) containing progesterone+oestradiol benzoate, at random stage of the <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle,</b> for 9 days. Seven days after the implant and progesterone releasing intravaginal device insertion, follicle stimulating hormone was injected as described in the control group. There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups for superovulation responses. In conclusion, both protocols synchronized the <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycle</b> in follicle stimulating hormone treated cows and, any of the protocols evaluated in this study can be used as a pretreatment for superstimulation started on the seventh day of the implant or progesterone releasing intravaginal device insertion in Brown Swiss cows...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine first age reproduction characteristics of indigenous Kıvırcık, Sakız and Gökçeada sheep breeds and growth performances of ewe lambs which have been kept in Bandırma Sheep Research Station (BSRS). The data of reproduction characteristics of ewes and growth characteristics of lambs were collected on 15 Kıvırcık, 8 Sakız and 10 Gökçeada ewes, and on 16 Kıvırcık, 12 Sakız and 11 Gökçeada lambs, respectively. After the lambs completed their fifth month ages, estrus detection was carried out with a teaser ram twice a day with 12 hour intervals. For the Kıvırcık, Sakız and Gökçeada lambs, the first oestrus weights were 37. 93, 33. 35 and 29. 75 kg; first oestrus ages were 315, 320 and 337 days; oestrus durations were 30. 99, 25. 85 and 20. 28 hours and the duration of the <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycles</b> were 16. 59, 19. 91 and 17. 76 days, respectively. The birth weights of Kıvırcık, Sakız and Gökçeada lambs were found to be 3. 64, 3. 91, 3. 28 kg; the weaning weight (WW), 31. 01, 25. 44 and 23. 67 kg, the six month live weight (SMLW), 32. 87, 26. 95 and 24. 15 kg, the yearling live weight (YLW), 39. 01, 30. 95 and 30. 27 kg and the average daily weight gain (ADWG), 0. 271 0. 257 and 0. 202 kg, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the effects of heat stress and feed {{restriction}} on hormonal secretion (progesterone, oestradiol- 17 beta, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin and cortisol) in Holstein heifers. Ten pubertal heifers were divided into two groups of five (A and B) and housed in climatic chambers. After a pre-experimental period, the heifers were synchronised for oestrus and monitored for three (group B) or four (group A) consecutive <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycles</b> (OC). In the first OC, both groups were maintained under thermal comfort (TC) and fed on an ad libitum basis. In the second OC, group A was maintained under TC whereas group B was exposed to high air temperatures (HAT); both groups were fed on an ad libitum basis. In the third OC and until day 17 of the fourth OC, group A was kept under TC and fed a restricted diet (the same ration ingested by group B under HAT). At the end of HAT exposure, group B was removed from the study. Exposure to HAT caused development of ovarian cysts in two heifers, an increase in plasma concentrations of prolactin, a decrease in concentrations of cortisol and progesterone, and a 23 % reduction in dry matter intake. Feed restriction did not modify any of the parameters considered. Results of this study indicated that the effects of HAT on the above parameters are not altered by a reduction in feed intake.

40|$|Background: The {{pregnancy}} rate during in-vitro fertilization (IVF) following progesterone supplement {{still remains}} very low at around 20 %. Objective: To investigate {{the effects of}} peanut oil itself on the endometrial receptivity, the pregnancy success rate and fertility during the peri-implantation time in hyper stimulated and normal rats. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six adult Sprague Dawley rats with at least four regular <b>oestrus</b> <b>cycles</b> were randomly divided into 4 groups: two groups were hyper stimulated by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and treated with progesterone or with peanut oil; the two other groups were not hyper stimulated and treated with saline solution or peanut oil. On day 5. 5 of pregnancy, the uterine horns were removed and blood was collected for histomorphometric and serum progesterone evaluation. 12 rats were allowed to continue the presumed pregnancy to term. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and student t-test were {{used to compare the}} means of morphometric and radioimmunoassay data between groups. p-values less than 0. 05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The mean values of morphometric parameters and serum progesterone varied significantly between the groups (ANOVA, p< 0. 0001). The lowest values of progesterone parameters were observed in the hyperstimulated groups that did not deliver pups; both hyperstimulated groups had deleterious luminal epithelium with varying degrees of mucosal projections. There were isolated decidualised zones observed in hyper stimulated peanut oil group, whereas peanut oil group had the highest number of implantation sites and deliveries. Conclusion: The results show that hype stimulation reduces the endometrial receptivity, while peanut oil increases endometrial receptivity, pregnancy rates and fertility by triggering decidualisation...|$|R
