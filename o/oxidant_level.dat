40|$|BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial {{dysfunction}} {{may lead}} to increased oxidative stress and consequent changes in cell spreading. Here, we describe and validate a novel method for simultaneous quantification of these two parameters. METHODS: Human skin fibroblasts were loaded with 5 -(and- 6) -chloromethyl- 2 ', 7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (CM-H(2) DCF), and its oxidative conversion into CM-DCF was monitored {{as a function of}} time by video-rate confocal microscopy and real-time image averaging. Cell size was determined after binarization of the acquired images. RESULTS: At the lowest practical laser output, CM-DCF formation occurred with zero order kinetics, indicating that [CM-H(2) DCF] was not rate-limiting and that the rate of [CM-DCF] formation (V(CM-DCF)) was a function of the cellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>level.</b> Analysis of fibroblasts of a healthy control subject and a patient with a deficiency of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the first complex of the oxidative phosphorylation system, revealed a significant increase in cellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>level</b> in the latter cells that was, however, not accompanied by a change in cell spreading. Conversely, chronic treatment with 6 -hydroxy- 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethylchroman- 2 -carboxylic acid (Trolox), a derivative of vitamin E, markedly decreased the <b>oxidant</b> <b>level</b> and cell spreading in both control and patient fibroblasts.

Pretreatment of ECs with ascorbate accumulated {{a large amount of}} ascorbate inside the cells and consequently decreased both intracellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>level</b> and iNOS induction. These effects of ascorbate were abolished in the presence of exogenous superoxide generated by xanthine oxidase/xanthine plus catalase but were not altered when N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester was applied to inhibit nitric oxide synthesis.

These results indicate that ascorbate inhibits iNOS expression in ECs by an antioxidant mechanism independent of both NFκB activation and the reported negative feedback effect of nitric oxide...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Matrix {{metalloproteinase}} 9 (MMP- 9) degrades {{basement membrane}} type IV collagen and is expressed during cellular migration and invasion. Here {{we show that}} v-Ha-Ras overexpression in rat kidney epithelial cells (REC) caused upregulation of MMP- 9 gene expression in part by increasing cellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels.</b> v-Ha-Ras mediated the production of superoxide in Ras-transfected cells, which was associated with upregulated MMP- 9 gene expression. Conversely, v-Ha-Ras expression decreased steady-state levels of mRNAs from tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP- 1), an inhibitor of MMP- 9; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1), which indirectly activates MMP- 9 by increasing plasmin levels; and collagen IV, a substrate of MMP- 9 and {{a major component of}} basement membrane. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that Ras overexpression enhanced NF-kB, but not AP- 1 DNA binding to motifs in the MMP- 9 gene promoter. The Ras-induced increase in NF-kB DNA binding could be inhibited by treatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine and glutathione monoester, suggesting that intracellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> can mediate MMP- 9 transcription. Our findings identify an important role for Ras in the regulation of MMP- 9 expression, and suggest that increased superoxide production can upregulate MMP- 9 expression and thus contribute to malignan...|$|R

Material and Method: The oxidative stress index was calculated by measuring plasma total antioxidant level and total <b>oxidant</b> <b>level</b> in 35 infants {{between the ages of}} 3 and 6 months. The study approved by the ethics committe (14. 10. 2009 - 10 / 7). Results: No significant differences were observed between the two groups in respect of age, gender, plasma total antioxidant status and total oxidant status. Plasma total antioxidant levels were higher in the breast-fed group than the formula-fed group (p= 0. 004).

The pollution of O 3 was serious in the city. The daily maximum 1 h means (O 3 _ 1 -hr max) reached 157 ± 55, 161 ± 54, 120 ± 50, and 178 ± 75 μg/m 3 corresponding to an excess over the standard rates of 21 %, 27 %, 10 %, and 40 % in 2008 – 2011, respectively.

Recently, Tat {{has been found}} to activate the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK 1, SAPK) MAP kinase in lymphoid cells. We found that purified Tat rapidly activated JNK 1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and ECV- 304 cells, and coculture of ECV- 304 cells with Tat-transfected HeLa cells resulted in persistent activation of JNK 1. In addition, lower doses of Tat potentiated TNFα-induced JNK 1 activation, although higher doses paradoxically diminished JNK 1 activation by TNFα. Treatment of ECV- 304 cells with Tat acutely increased intracellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels,</b> and Tat-induced <b>oxidant</b> activity was decreased by two structurally distinct NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium and apocynin. Both oxidase inhibitors and the thiol antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine decreased Tat-induced JNK 1 activation in parallel with reduction in <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels.</b> Activation of JNK 1 by Tat was also inhibited by cytochalasin B, suggesting that Tat signaling was dependent upon intact cytoskeletal function. Indeed, JNK 1 activation by Tat was associated with actin microfilament rearrangement.

40|$|Objective: In this research, {{long-term}} exercise-trained and untrained rats underwent exhausting exercise. We compared muscle damage, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) - {{a product}} of the muscle cell myoblast and satellite cells in response to muscle injury -,free oxygen radicals that have been reported to be responsible for this damage and, antioxidant levels in both groups. Materials and Methods: After exhausting exercise, trained and untrained rats were sacrificed by taking blood intracardiacally, just after exhaustion, one day and three days following exhaustion. Muscle damage was examined by light microscopy; the immune reactivity of the muscles was examined by IL- 6 immunohistochemical evaluation and malondialdehite. Glutathione peroxidase levels of the muscles were assessed spectrophotometrically. Results: After exhaustion, the muscle damage was found to be higher in the untrained group than in the trained group. Maximum muscle damage, IL- 6 immunoreactivity and <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> emerged one day after exhaustion in both trained and untrained groups. The drop of oxidants, increase in antioxidants and the visualized regeneration process in histological samples appeared more significantly on day three after the exhaustion in trained animals compared to untrained animals. Three days after exhaustion, IL- 6 and <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> were found to decrease, and especially in the trained group, it approached approximately to the level of controls. In the acutely running untrained group, although IL- 6 involvement decreased, plasma <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> were still found to be significantly higher and antioxidant levels were lower compared to that in controls. Conclusion: This experiment revealed that the muscles of the exercise-trained rats were more resistant to this type of destructive muscle contraction than untrained rats. The IL- 6 levels did not prominently increase just after the exhaustion but one day after exhaustion which made us think that the pro-inflammatory factors might have been suppressed by another agent - most probably by cortisol - {{in the beginning of the}} muscle damage and increased after the diminishing effects of these agents.

40|$|Ambient ozone, as a {{secondary}} air pollutant in the troposphere, is {{a major threat to}} human health, plants and the environment. In order to develop effective air quality policy to minimise ozone pollution, it is important to gain a quantitative understanding of the chemical factors that drive tropospheric ozone production. There are a number of limitations and uncertainties in the current models and indirect methods used to estimate chemical ozone production rates. Here, an Ozone Production Rate (OPR) instrument is developed to fulfil the demand of accurately measuring ambient ozone production rates in the atmosphere. This prototype system aims to directly measure the in situ oxidant (Ox: O 3 + NO 2) production rate p(Ox) in ambient air. This thesis describes the OPR experimental methodology, instrument properties and system characteristics. Two field deployments (London and India) are comprehensively discussed, and correction approaches are implemented to improve measurement accuracy. The field measurement results indicated the measured p(Ox) levels could be used to interpret modelled Ox production rates, and changes in ambient <b>oxidant</b> <b>level.</b> The OPR system could be a useful tool to determine the balance between advection and chemical production in controlling local ozone levels, and hence support ozone control policy...|$|E

Contrary to prior studies, tropospheric mean OH in our ensemble shows little change at the LGM relative to the preindustrial (0. 5 ± 12 %), despite large reductions in methane concentrations.

Key parameters controlling the tropospheric oxidative capacity over glacial-interglacial periods include overhead stratospheric ozone, tropospheric water vapor, and lightning NO x emissions. Variability in global mean OH since the LGM is insensitive to fire emissions. Our simulations are broadly consistent with ice-core records of Δ 17 O in sulfate and nitrate at the LGM, and CO, HCHO, and H 2 O 2 in the preindustrial.

40|$|Cancer {{cells with}} the ability to {{metastasize}} have also an ability to adapt and survive in new surroundings. This is connected to their ability to alter the balance between and the level of oxidants and antioxidants within the cell. To understand how cancer cells do this, a panel of cancer cells were examined with respect to genes that can affect the oxidant production. These cells had been isolated from patients with epithelial carcinoma in skin and/or mouth. The results showed that cancer cells from different patients have different sets of the enzyme system NADPH oxidase (NOX) that regulates a substantial part of the oxidant production of the cells. All cell lines were found to express mRNA for two or more NOX core proteins and several of the regulatory subunits, thus indicating that all cell lines have the potential to produce oxidants by the NOX systems upon adequate activation. However, no consistent pattern of expression was identified among the cell lines derived from the same type of cancer. Using two cancer cell lines, it was shown that the NOX system affects the expression of the enzyme γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). This enzyme is of importance for the ability of cancer cells to produce the antioxidant glutathione. The results showed that by regulating the level of oxidants, the NOX system as well as the mitochondria also changes the level of GGT. This shows that cancer cells not only increase the <b>oxidant</b> <b>level</b> as part of the ability to metastasize but also the level of antioxidants as part of their defence against the oxidants.

The increase in KLF 2 -promoter activity in p 66 shc-knockout MEFs is dependent on a myocyte enhancing factor- 2 A (MEF 2 A) -binding sequence in the core KLF 2 promoter. Short-hairpin RNA-induced knockdown of p 66 shc in endothelial cells also stimulates KLF 2 mRNA and protein expression, as well as expression of the endothelial KLF 2 target gene thrombomodulin. MEF 2 A protein and mRNA are more abundant in p 66 shc-knockout MEFs, resulting in greater occupancy of the KLF 2 promoter by MEF 2 A. In endothelial cells, the increase in KLF 2 and thrombomodulin protein by shRNA-induced decrease in p 66 shc expression is partly abrogated by knockdown of MEF 2 A. Finally, knockdown of KLF 2 abolishes the decrease in the cellular reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide observed with knockdown of p 66 shc, and KLF 2 overexpression suppresses cellular hydrogen peroxide levels, independent of p 66 shc expression. These findings illustrate a novel mechanism by which p 66 shc promotes cellular oxidative stress, through suppression of MEF 2 A expression and consequent repression of KLF 2 transcription. —Kumar, A., Hoffman, T.

40|$|Induction of {{glutathione}} S-transferase Ya and NAD(P) H:quinone reductase {{gene expression}} {{by a variety}} of chemical agents is mediated by regulatory elements, EpRE and ARE, composed of two adjacent AP-l-like binding sites and activated by Fos/Jun heterodimeric complex (AP- 1). Recent studies show that chemical induction of glutathione S transferase Ya and quinone reductase gene expression is associated with an induction of c-fos and c-jun gene expression and AP- 1 binding activity. In this report we present evidence that the AP- 1 binding activity and the expression of chloramphenicol acetyitransferase activity from an EpRE Ya-cat gene construct are induced by an increase in intracellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels.</b> We observe that lowering the glutathione levels with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of 3,-glutamylcysteine synthetase, or diamide, a thiol-oxidizing agent, stimulates both basal and chemical-inducible expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity from EpRE Ya-cat and the AP. ...|$|R

40|$|The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt pathway {{is a key}} {{component}} in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} participation of the PI 3 K/Akt pathway and its outcome on different molecular targets such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) and Forkhead box-O (FoxO) transcription factors during mild oxidative stress triggered by iron overload. The exposure of mouse hippocampal neurons (HT 22) to different concentrations of Fe 2 + (25 - 200 μM) for 24 h led us to define a mild oxidative injury status (50 μM Fe 2 +) in which cell morphology showed changes typical of neuronal damage, with increased lipid peroxidation and cellular <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> but no alteration of cellular viability. There was a simultaneous increase in both Akt and GSK 3 β phosphorylation. Levels of phospho-FoxO 3 a (inactive form) increased in the cytosolic fraction of cells treated with iron in a PI 3 K-dependent manner. Moreover, PI 3 K and Akt translocated to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress. Iron-overloaded cells harboring a constitutively active form of Akt showed decreased <b>oxidants</b> <b>levels.</b> Indeed, glutathione (GSH) synthesis under oxidative stress conditions was regulated by activated Akt. Our results show that activation of the PI 3 K/Akt pathway during iron-induced neurotoxicity regulates multiple targets such as GSK 3 β, FoxO transcriptional activity and glutathione metabolism thus modulating neuronal response to oxidative stress.

' (Manuscript) 3. Chandra Ravuri, Gunbjørg Svineng and Nils-Erik Huseby: 'Upregulated expression of γ-glutamyltransferase {{as a consequence of}} mitochondrial uncoupling. ' (Manuscript) Cancer cells with the ability to metastasize have also an ability to adapt and survive in new surroundings. This is connected to their ability to alter the balance between and the level of oxidants and antioxidants within the cell. To understand how cancer cells do this, a panel of cancer cells were examined with respect to genes that can affect the oxidant production. These cells had been isolated from patients with epithelial carcinoma in skin and/or mouth. The results showed that cancer cells from different patients have different sets of the enzyme system NADPH oxidase (NOX) that regulates a substantial part of the oxidant production of the cells. All cell lines were found to express mRNA for two or more NOX core proteins and several of the regulatory subunits, thus indicating that all cell lines have the potential to produce oxidants by the NOX systems upon adequate activation. However, no consistent pattern of expression was identified among the cell lines derived from the same type of cancer. Using two cancer cell lines, it was shown that the NOX system affects the expression of the enzyme γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). This enzyme is of importance for the ability of cancer cells to produce the antioxidant glutathione. The results showed that by regulating the level of oxidants, the NOX system as well as the mitochondria also changes the level of GGT. This shows that cancer cells not only increase the <b>oxidant</b> <b>level</b> as part of the ability to metastasize but also the level of antioxidants as part of their defence against the oxidants. The high level of oxidants is apparently part of the aggressive properties of cancer cells and can be an important element in new treatment regimes. Kreftceller som har evne til spredning har også evne til å tilpasse seg og overleve i nye omgivelser. Dette har bla sammenheng med at de kan endre balansen mellom og nivåene av oksidanter og antioksidanter inne i cellen. For å kunne forstå hvordan kreftcellene gjør dette ble et panel av kreftceller undersøkt mht gener som kan påvirke oksidant produksjonen. Disse kreftcellene ble isolert fra pasienter med plateepitelkarsinomer i hud og/eller munnhule. Resultatene viste at kreftceller fra ulike pasienter har ulike sett med enzymsystemet NADPH oksidase (NOX) som regulerer en vesentlig del av cellenes oksidant produksjon. Alle cellelinjene uttrykte mRNA for minst to NOX kjerne proteiner og flere av deres regulatoriske proteiner, som indikerer at alle cellelinjene har et potensial til å produsere oksidanter gjennom NOX systemet etter tilstrekkelig aktivering. I et mindre antall krefttyper ble det også vist at NOX systemet påvirker et enzym med navn gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). Dette enzymet har stor betydning for cellenes evne til å produsere antioksidanten glutation. Funnene viste at NOX enzymene og mitokondriene gjennom å regulere oksidant nivået, også endret cellens nivå av GGT. Dette viser at kreftcellene både kan øke nivået av oksidanter som ledd i evnen til spredning, og dessuten av antioksidanter som del av cellenes eget forsvaret mot oksidantene. Det høye oksidantnivået kan ha sammenheng med kreftcellenes aggressive egenskaper, og vil være et viktig ledd i nye behandlingsopplegg...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to study}} the effect of Αl on Zea mays plants. More specificly were investigated at a morphological, cytological and physiological level two maize inbred lines with different Al tolerance. Seed germination experiments indicated that low concentrations οf Al did not influence substantially the germination process {{either of the two}} inbred lines. On the contrary, the high concentrations of Al had a negative affect upon (particularly in the sensitive inbred line) the seed germination and the indicator of tolerance elongation of root of plants. Concurrently at the biochemical level the concentration of Al in the nutritious solution was positively correlated with the concentration of Al, proline, the carbohydrates, the lipid peroxidation (malondialdeyde) H 2 O 2, in the root and in the shoot-leaves. However the tendency of the distribution of all the parameters in the tissues of the tolerant and sensitive inbred line appeared to be different. Specifically the tolerant maize line seem to endure low level of lipid peroxidation and to accumulate higher levels of carbohydrates and proline which are related to the osmoregulation and the membrane stabilization. These observations suggest an efficient metabolism system in the tolerant maize line VA- 22 during Al stress. Nevertheless, in both of the two inbred lines, the accumulation of Al in the roots appeared to be higher compared to the transport of the metal in the upper parts of plants. As far as the toxic effect of high concentrations of Al is concerned a negative correlation with the elements K, Mg, Fe and Mn became apparent. Generally, low concentrations of Al did not influence the uptake and transport of nutritious elements from roots to shoots-leaves, in the tolerant inbred line. Likewise, the tolerant line retained larger concentrations of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K+, measured in roots and in shootsleaves, compared to the sensitive inbred line A 4 / 67. From the cytological results it was realised that the concentration of 60 mM Al for 24 hours did not cause serious damage in the root. In particular, it was observed increase of vacuoles (vacuolization) and shrink of cellular membrane. In regard to the the electrophoretic studies, it appeared that the concentration of 240 mM Al on the third day caused the appearance of one of low molecular weight DNase only in the ensitive inbred line. Also it appeared one low molecular weight DNase in the concentration of 360 mM Al on the fifth day and only in the sensitive inbred line. Serious differences were observed between the two inbred lines after 24, 48 and 72 hours of exposure to aluminium. More specific in the tolerant inbred line there was an increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes (there were found increased SOD and POX activity in the roots, contrary to the sensitive inbred line where a reduction in the activity of SOD and POX enzymes was observed). Μοre specificly the anionic POD isoforms profiles and the SOD isoforms profiles showed that in the Al-tolerant maize plants the anionic POD isoforms A 2 and A 4 and the SOD isoforms SOD 1 and SOD 2 were induced by increased Al-stress. It seemed that in the Al tolerant maize line, the anionic POD isoforms A 2 and A 4 and the SOD isoforms SOD 1 and SOD 2 were required for adaptation as the <b>oxidant</b> <b>level</b> increased by the increased Al stress. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that Al toxicity may be mediated by oxidative stress, and that the better protection of the Al tolerant maize roots from Al-induced oxidative damage results, at least partially, from the increased activity of their antioxidative system. Thus, the ability of tolerant inbred line to increase the antioxidant activity of the system with aim to limits the cellular damage can be a mechanism that leads to the Al tolerance. Εlectrophoretic analysis of phosphatases and esterases isoforms had different electrophoretic pattern in both enzymes. In the tolerant inbred line appeared six esterases isoforms (EST 1, EST 4, EST 5, EST 6, EST 7, EST 8) and four phosphatases isoforms (ACP 1, ACP 2, ACP 5, ACP 6) while in the sensitive inbred line appeared five esterases isoforms (EST 4, EST 5, EST 6, EST 7, EST 8) and five phosphatases isoforms (ACP 3, ACP 4, ACP 6, ACP 7, ACP 8). Specificly the activity of phosphatases and esterases isoforms in the tolerant inbred line increased especially in the highest Αl concentration (480 μΜ), but on the contrary in the sensitive line the activity of those enzymes decreased in this concentration.

Model calculations and comparison with records of parameters influencing UV-driven postdepositional processing of snow nitrate suggest that the observed variability in GISP 2 δ 15 N(NO 3 −) over major climate transitions is primarily driven by changes {{in the degree of}} postdepositional loss of snow nitrate. Estimates of the fractional loss of snow nitrate is (16 – 23) % in the Holocene and (45 – 53) % in the glacial period, suggesting a (41 [*]±[*] 32) % lower nitrate depositional flux to Greenland during the glacial period relative to the Holocene...|$|R

In our study we assessed serum <b>oxidant</b> and antioxidant <b>levels</b> in an HIV- 1 -infected population treated with HAART, and compared them with those of untreated HIV- 1 patients and HIV- 1 -negative subjects. The study included 116 HIV- 1 -infected patients (86 HAART-treated and 30 untreated), and 46 HIV-negative controls. Serum <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> were significantly higher in the HIV- 1 treated group as compared to untreated and control groups. In addition, a decrease of serum total antioxidant status was observed in the HIV- 1 treated group. To be noted is that patients who rigorously follow antiretroviral therapy (optimal HAART adherence) have significantly higher oxidative status {{than those who do}} not closely follow the therapy (poor HAART adherence). Analysis of variance revealed no significant further increase in oxidative status in HIV- 1 -infected patients taking antiretroviral and other drugs with the exception of psychiatric drugs (e. g. anxiolytics or antidepressants). Taken together, our results indicate that HAART may affect oxidative stress in HIV- 1 -infected patients and suggest that antiretroviral therapy {{plays an important role in}} the synergy of HIV infection and oxidative stress.

40|$|Elevated <b>levels</b> of <b>oxidants</b> in {{biological}} {{systems have been}} historically referred to as oxidative stress, a choice of words that perhaps conveys an imbalanced view of reactive oxygen species in cell and tissues. The term stress suggests a harmful role, whereas a contemporary view is that oxidants are also crucial {{for the maintenance of}} homeostasis or adaptive signaling that can actually limit injury. This regulatory role for oxidants is achieved in part by them inducing oxidative post-translational modifications of proteins which may alter their function or interactions. Such mechanisms allow changes in cell <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> to be coupled to regulated alterations in enzymatic function (i. e. signal transduction), which enables redox signaling. In this review we focus on the role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα (PKG) disulfide dimerisation, an oxidative modification that is induced by oxidants that directly activates the enzyme, discussing how this impacts on the cardiovascular system. Additionally, how this oxidative activation of PKG may coordinate with or differ from classical activation of this kinase by cGMP will also be considered...|$|R

The lung is continuously exposed to endogenous and exogenous oxidants (cigarette smoke, mineral dust, ozone, radiation).

A potential role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of diffuse lung diseases (particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) has been demonstrated. Increased <b>oxidant</b> <b>levels</b> and decreased antioxidant defences can contribute to the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other diffuse lung diseases. The growing number of papers on the different aspects of oxidant/antioxidant imbalance in diffuse lung diseases in the last decade reflects increasing interest in this topic and suggests that specific DLDs may be characterized by specific patterns of oxidation and antioxidant responses. The study of oxidative stress can provide insights into etiopathogenesis and favour the discovery of new treatments.
