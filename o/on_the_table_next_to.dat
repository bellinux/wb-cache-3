500|$|John is also {{surprised}} to discover that Sherlock is in a relationship with Mary's bridesmaid, Janine. Sherlock tells John that he is dating her because she is Magnussen's personal assistant, and he uses their relationship to assist him with breaking into Magnussen's office in London. Inside, Sherlock and John find an incapacitated Janine, and Sherlock happens upon Mary holding Magnussen at gunpoint. Mary shoots Sherlock, who harnesses all his mental powers to stay conscious. He is taken to hospital. In his mind palace, Sherlock fades away, {{at the same time in}} the real world Sherlock dies on the operating table in pre-op preparation. In the mind palace, Moriarty convinces Sherlock that he's letting John down by dying, which convinces the mind palace Sherlock to wake up and escape. [...] At this time, in the real world, Sherlock's heart begins to beat again. [...] The surgeons attempt to help revive him, by giving him oxygen. Sherlock wakes up in surgery and mouths [...] "Mary". [...] Mary comes into the hospital and is met by John, who says that Sherlock had survived surgery. Mary visits the dazed and severely injured Sherlock and warns him not to denounce her. John nonetheless begins to suspect something after he finds that Sherlock replaced John's chair in the Baker Street flat and left a bottle of Mary's perfume <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E
2500|$|The crucifix, {{painting}} of the Crucifixion and the glass orb are not mentioned by Ripa, and Vermeer changed some of the iconography that Ripa gave: Instead of Ripa's suggestion that Faith hold the chalice and rest her hand on a book, Vermeer put them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her. According to Arthur Wheelock, a University of Maryland academic and curator of a Vermeer exhibit at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, this is [...] "an assemblage that gives the image a Eucharistic character {{not found in the}} text." [...] By putting the golden chalice against the dark background of the painting's frame and the dark crucifix against the gilt-leather backdrop, the elements are given a greater prominence in the painting. Wheelock, citing his fellow academic at the University of Maryland, Quint Gregory, believes the slight overlapping of the chalice and the gold backdrop of the crucifix [...] "may symbolically suggest the essential role of the Eucharist in bridging the physical and spiritual realms", a very Catholic idea. Selena Cant calls the fact that the book, chalice and crucifix together represent the Catholic Mass.|$|E

40|$|The Australian Shuffle {{consists}} of placing {{a deck of}} cards onto a table according to this rule: put <b>the</b> top card <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> card <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the deck, and repeat until all the cards have been placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> A natural question is “Where was the very last card placed located in the original deck?” Card trick magicians have known empirically for years that the fortieth card from the top of a standard fifty-two card deck is the final card placed by this shuffle. The moniker “Australian” comes from putting every other card “Down Under”. We develop a formula for the general case of N cards, and then extend that generalization further to cases involving the discard of k cards before or after putting one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the deck. Finally, we discuss the connection of the Australian Shuffle and its generalizations to the famous Josephus problem...|$|R
