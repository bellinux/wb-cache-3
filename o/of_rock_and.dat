Musically, it combines elements <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> pop. Critical reception for the album by critics were mixed. Autobiography has sold more than five million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton's mantle, enveloping a core <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> metal. There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day. The heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist beneath the surface of Europa. If liquid water is present in Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E

5|$|Certain Christian groups, {{most notably}} those in some King James Only denominations, {{consider}} all types <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> metal music to be opposition to their faith, regardless of lyrical content or {{the lifestyles of}} the band members. However, fans and artists see metal as another genre of music, parallel to such genres as blues, classical, jazz, punk, and hip-hop. Bands such as Showbread and Antestor believe that the instrumentation of the music is simply a medium of art, while the person creating the music {{as well as the}} lyrics being presented provide the message. Therefore, Christian metal is created when Christians compose metal music in a way that reflects their faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E

More recent American creations include hip hop and house music. American pop stars such as Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna have become global celebrities, as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, and Beyoncé as well as hip hop artists Jay-Z, Eminem and Kanye West.

5|$|For Marquee Moon, Verlaine {{and fellow}} guitarist Richard Lloyd {{abandoned}} contemporary punk rock's power chords in favor <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> jazz-inspired interplay, melodic lines, and counter-melodies. Verlaine's lyrics combined urban and pastoral imagery, references to lower Manhattan, themes of adolescence, and influences from French poetry. He also used puns and double-entendres {{to give his}} songs an impressionistic quality describing the perception of an experience rather than its specific details.|$|E

The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.|$|E

5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the initial impact <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> <b>and</b> roll on {{mainstream}} American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence {{and sought to}} market more conventionally acceptable recordings. Electric musical instruments (particularly guitars) and amplification were becoming more affordable, allowing young musicians to form small groups to perform in front of local audiences of their peers; and in some areas there was a breakdown, especially among radio audiences, of traditional black and white markets, with more white teenagers listening to and purchasing R records.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a mound and an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop <b>of</b> <b>rock,</b> <b>and</b> could have acted as a motte.|$|E
