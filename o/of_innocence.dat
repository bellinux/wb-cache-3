5|$|Songs of Experience is {{the second}} studio album by American {{composer}} and producer David Axelrod, released in October 1969 by Capitol Records. It was composed, arranged, and produced by Axelrod, who worked with session musicians such as guitarist Al Casey, drummer Earl Palmer, and conductor Don Randi. As with his 1968 debut album Song <b>of</b> <b>Innocence,</b> Axelrod composed musical interpretations of English poet William Blake's Songs <b>of</b> <b>Innocence</b> and of Experience, an 18th-century illustrated collection of poems.|$|E
5|$|Song <b>of</b> <b>Innocence</b> is an {{instrumental}} jazz fusion record that incorporates elements of classical, rock, funk, pop, and theatre music. It {{is arranged for}} bass, drums, and string instruments, written in the rock idiom with tempos centered on rock-based patterns by Palmer. Axelrod used contrast in his orchestral compositions and interspersed the album's euphoric psychedelic R form with dramatic, harrowing arrangements to reflect the supernatural themes found in Blake's poems. The music's reverent, psychedelic overtones evoke their themes <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> and spirituality.|$|E

It was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles with an orchestra and a variety of studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer.|$|E

5|$|Innocence began {{production}} in 2006 at Alfa System {{as the next}} main entry in the Tales series. Developed parallel to the DS spin-off title Tales of the Tempest, {{the goal was to}} include all the series' main gameplay and narrative elements despite the limited medium. The character designs were done by Mutsumi Inomata, while the music was composed by series newcomer Kazuhiro Nakamura. Extensive voice acting was included using CRI Middleware's Kyuseishu Sound Streamer compression algorithm. After release, it was decided to remake Innocence for the Vita, using platform-specific gameplay functions, redone voice work and music, and new characters. Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia created the opening theme songs for both versions <b>of</b> <b>Innocence.</b> Both versions have been positively received in Japan, and Western opinions on the two versions <b>of</b> <b>Innocence</b> have been mostly positive.|$|E
5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{frequently}} {{commented on the}} recurring theme in Britten's operas from Peter Grimes onward of the isolated individual at odds with a hostile society. The extent to which this reflected Britten's perception of himself, pacifist and homosexual, in the England of the 1930s, 40s and 50s is debated. Another recurrent theme is the corruption <b>of</b> <b>innocence,</b> most sharply seen in The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
5|$|To placate {{physical}} retailers {{affected by}} the digital exclusivity period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs <b>of</b> <b>Innocence</b> that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and music streaming services for five weeks; the iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs <b>of</b> <b>Innocence</b> + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalog deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because {{it would not have been}} available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, this ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.|$|E

River Street became home to many antique stores. Developers began buying the old buildings and adapting them to contemporary uses.|$|E
5|$|A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept, which fused American jazz with European classical music. Axelrod supported his Baroque orchestrations {{on the album}} with rhythms and melodies from rock, R, and pop music. The album's suite is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than Song <b>of</b> <b>Innocence.</b> Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish folk song elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger Gerald Wilson.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 2014, {{a visual}} {{companion}} to the album, Films <b>of</b> <b>Innocence,</b> was unveiled. Inspired by political murals of Northern Ireland, U2 enlisted 11 urban artists {{to create their}} own art films, each interpreting a different song from the album.

5|$|Whistler {{created the}} {{painting}} {{in the winter of}} 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. The White Girl shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory <b>of</b> <b>innocence</b> and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{creative}} stagnation and {{a backlash}} following their documentary/double album, Rattle and Hum (1988), U2 reinvented {{themselves in the}} 1990s through a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, Achtung Baby (1991), and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band integrated influences from alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music into their sound, and embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, Pop (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 is the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour in history. The group's thirteenth album, Songs <b>of</b> <b>Innocence</b> (2014), was released at no cost through the iTunes Store, but received criticism for its automatic placement in users' music libraries.|$|E
