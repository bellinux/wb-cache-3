5|$|Shortly {{after being}} congratulated by George W. Bush for his victory, Harper rebuked US Ambassador David Wilkins for criticizing the Conservatives' plans to assert Canada's {{sovereignty}} over the Arctic <b>Ocean</b> <b>waters</b> with armed forces.

5|$|The <b>ocean</b> <b>waters</b> became calmer {{during the}} night and the Tusk was able to {{approach}} the Cochino. All of the crew, {{with the exception of}} Commander Benitez and two of the crew who perished during the ordeal, boarded the Tusk. Finally, the crew members of the Tusk convinced Benitez to board the Tusk, which he did two minutes before the Cochino sank off the coast of Norway.|$|E
5000|$|Deep <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> (DOW) is {{the name}} for cold, salty water found deep {{below the surface of}} Earth's <b>oceans.</b> <b>Ocean</b> <b>water</b> differs in {{temperature}} and salinity. Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters; in polar regions, the upper layers of <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> are cold and fresh. [...] Deep <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> makes up about 90% of the volume of the <b>oceans.</b> Deep <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> has a very uniform temperature, around 0-3 °C, and a salinity of about 3.5% or as oceanographers state as 35 ppt (parts per thousand).|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{distinctly}} different layers of <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> - Surface Sea <b>Water,</b> Deep <b>Ocean</b> <b>Water</b> (DOW) and Very Deep <b>Ocean</b> <b>Water.</b> Each layer remains separate and autonomous from the others, moving at different speeds and directions from different kinetic forces and having different temperatures, densities and life form status.|$|R
50|$|Another factor {{mentioned}} by the HCDOP is {{the influence of}} the <b>ocean</b> <b>water.</b> The <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> that enters Hood Canal is like most estuaries: fresh, warm water flows out at the surface and is replaced by cold, salty water at depth. The cold, salty <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> that enters Hood Canal comes into Puget Sound from the open ocean and has not recently been in contact with the atmosphere. As a result, this water is initially somewhat depleted in oxygen.|$|R
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's <b>ocean</b> <b>waters.</b> A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and silky sharks are common in the Mona Passage.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of English {{soldiers}} by ship, and naval battles on the seas, areas used for salt water fishing became perilous, and lay dormant {{for much of the}} war. In addition, many of the fishing vessels were converted into warships. Before the war, there was often talk about the excess of lobsters and cod off the shores of New England. This seemed to change during and after the war, due to the vast numbers of ships and artillery entering the <b>ocean</b> <b>waters.</b> Once lobster harvesting and cod fishing was reestablished, most fishermen found that the lobster and cod had migrated away from the shores.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter, Florida early on October 16, {{still as a}} Category1 hurricane. It turned to the north, {{remained}} a hurricane despite little convection, {{then turned to the}} northeast in response to an approaching upper-level trough. Just offshore, Irene moved parallel to the coastlines of South Carolina and North Carolina on October 17. On October 18, as it interacted with very warm <b>ocean</b> <b>waters</b> and the upper level trough, Irene rapidly intensified, reaching peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) with a pressure of 952mbar, a Category 2 hurricane. Despite its strength, the circulation was very asymmetrical, and the convection was not particularly organized. The hurricane continued to accelerate to the northeast, steadily weakening until becoming extratropical on October 19 to the south of Newfoundland. The extratropical storm continued to the northeast until becoming absorbed by another, larger extratropical storm late that same day.|$|E
50|$|The strait's shallow depths lend to {{warm water}} {{temperatures}} in summer months, with some areas reaching 25°C, or 77°F. Consequently, the strait is reportedly {{home to the}} warmest <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> temperatures in Canada, {{and some of the}} warmest <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> temperatures on the Atlantic coast north of Virginia.|$|R

40|$|The {{retention}} of 239 Pu and 241 Am on six commercially available extraction chromatographic resins was investigated {{to determine the}} effect of matrix constituents commonly found within sea and <b>ocean</b> <b>water</b> on their uptake. It was found that the {{retention of}} 239 Pu and 241 Am on almost all of the resins from either nitric acid or hydrochloric acid system was not significantly affected by matrix constituents in artificial <b>ocean</b> <b>water.</b> However, the retention of 241 Am on DGA resin from nitric acid was found to be reduced by over two orders of magnitude in the presence of artificial <b>ocean</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R
5|$|Otis began {{gradually}} entering cooler <b>ocean</b> <b>waters,</b> {{although the}} National Hurricane Center noted {{in one of}} its discussions on the system that the environment was still warm enough to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105mph (165km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low-level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{prominent}} in the <b>ocean</b> <b>waters</b> surrounding Hilton Head Island, the stingray serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers. Small stingrays inhabit the quieter, shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf, typically buried beneath {{a thin layer of}} sand. Stingrays are a type of demersal, cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline. Typically, stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon, a situation often ending in a stingray injury, where the stingray punctures the human with its poisonous barb. While these injuries are extremely painful, they are not usually life-threatening {{as long as they are}} properly attended to by a medical professional. One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore. This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided; in 2009, 121 people were treated for stingray injuries.|$|E

25|$|In other species, {{environmental}} conditions cause neoteny, {{as in the}} northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile), where higher altitude is correlated with greater neotenic tendencies, perhaps to help conserve energy as mentioned above.

25|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of AFRICOM, responsibility for U.S. military operations in Africa was divided across three unified commands: United States European Command (EUCOM) for West Africa, United States Central Command (CENTCOM) for East Africa, and United States Pacific Command (PACOM) for Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>waters</b> and islands off the east coast of Africa.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{characteristics}} are {{because of the presence}} of the cold Humboldt Current that flows north from Peru and Chile.

25|$|<b>Ocean</b> <b>waters</b> {{that are}} {{exceptionally}} clear contain little food. Areas of high productivity {{tend to be}} somewhat turbid from plankton blooms. These attract the filter feeding plankton eaters, which in turn attract the higher predators.

25|$|Scientists at {{a meeting}} of the American Geophysical Union on December 13, 2007, {{revealed}} that NASA satellites observing the western Arctic showed a 16% decrease in cloud coverage during the summer of 2007 compared to 2006. This would have the effect of allowing more sunlight to penetrate Earth's atmosphere and warm the Arctic <b>Ocean</b> <b>waters,</b> thus melting sea ice and contributing to the opening the Northwest Passage.|$|E
25|$|Because of its size, {{there is}} {{significant}} variation in climate across the state. Low rainfall and hot summers are typical for the inland west, a monsoonal 'wet' season in the far north, and warm subtropical conditions along the coastal strip. Inland and in southern ranges cooler temperatures are experienced, especially at nights. The climate of the coastal strip is influenced by warm <b>ocean</b> <b>waters,</b> keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.|$|E
