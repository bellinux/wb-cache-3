5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep.

Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics <b>on</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public began calling NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start <b>on</b> <b>time.</b> These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start <b>on</b> <b>time.</b> The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that any planar graph {{contains}} at most O(n) complete subgraphs. We extend this to an exact characterization: G occurs <b>O(n)</b> <b>times</b> as a subgraph of any planar graph, if and only if G is threeconnected. Even more generally, G occurs <b>O(n)</b> <b>times</b> as a subgraph of the K b,c -free graphs, b # c, if and only if G is c-connected; G occurs <b>O(n)</b> <b>times</b> as a subgraph of the K a -free graphs if and only if G is (a - 1) -connected. Our results use a simple Ramsey-theoretic lemma that may be of independent interest. 1 Introduction It follows from the sparsity of planar graphs that each such graph contains at most O(n) complete subgraphs K 3 and K 4 [6]. All cliques in a planar graph can be listed by an algorithm with <b>O(n)</b> worst-case <b>time</b> complexity [3, 4, 6]. Enumeration of subgraphs has a number of uses, including a recent application in testing inscribability [5]. These results naturally raise the question of determining which other planar graphs occur <b>O(n)</b> <b>times</b> as subg [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Experiments and {{observations}} show that Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity <b>on</b> <b>time</b> known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently gravitational waves.|$|E
