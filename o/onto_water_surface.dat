Since the 70 s, numerous studies address dry deposition of aerosol over <b>water</b> <b>surfaces</b> through measurments both in experimental flume devices and over large <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> areas such as lakes or oceans.

Classical measurement techniques, namely pressure sensors, present major drawbacks in the determination of impact loads because of their intrusive nature. In this paper, we propose a method to determine the impact loads on rigid bodies during water entry, based on high-speed particle image velocimetry. The method consists of two steps: firstly, an automated procedure is developed to determine the velocity field from high-speed images during water impact. Secondly, the unsteady pressure field is estimated from the velocity fields, using a Poisson-based solver. The method is validated on a rigid wedge slamming experiment and the results are compared with results from computational fluid dynamics simulations (performed with the software LS-Dyna) and from the literature...|$|R

30|$|Following a subaerial eruption, primary tephra grains are transported {{through the}} air before falling <b>onto</b> the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> and {{settling}} through the water column to the sea floor. During the transportation process, grain separation can occur, potentially resulting {{in the formation of}} normal and/or reverse grading structures in marine tephra beds. For example, large pumice grains might remain afloat on the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> for extended periods, settling later, and thus forming the upper part of a tephra bed. Large pumice grains might also be transported by ocean currents, forming a drift pumice layer distal to the main tephra distribution. Examples of drift pumices occur on marine terrace deposits along the Japan Sea coastline (Toyokura et al. 1991; Shiraishi et al. 1992). Explosive submarine volcanism has produced tephra beds (e.g., Yuasa 1995; Chun et al. 2007; Allen et al. 2010). In addition, some marine tephra beds have been deposited by primary pyroclastic material flowing from onshore volcanoes into nearby oceans (e.g., Allen et al. 2012; Schindlbeck et al. 2013; Kutterolf et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|Gerrids are aquatic {{predators and}} feed on invertebrates, mainly spiders and insects, that fall <b>onto</b> the <b>water</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Water</b> striders are {{attracted}} to this food source by ripples produced by the struggling prey. The water strider uses its front legs as sensors for the vibrations produced by the ripples in the water. The water strider punctures the prey item's body with its proboscis, injects salivary enzymes that break down the prey's internal structures, and then sucks out the resulting fluid. Gerrids prefer living prey, though they are indiscriminate feeders {{when it comes to}} terrestrial insect type. Halobates, which are found on open sea, feed off floating insects, zooplankton, and occasionally resort to cannibalism of their own nymphs. Cannibalism often occurs, but helps to control population sizes and restrict conflicting territories. During the non-mating season when gerrids live in cooperative groups, and cannibalism rates are lower, water striders will openly share large kills with others around them. Some gerrids are collectors, feeding off sediment or deposit surface.|$|R

The bat revealed flexibility in foraging mode and caught prey in the air (aerial hawking) and from the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> (trawling). M. macrophyllum was constrained in finding food very near to and within clutter. As echolocation was the prime sensory mode used by M. macrophyllum for detection and localization of food, the bat might have been unable to perceive sufficient information from prey near clutter as background echoes from the water plant increasingly overlapped with echoes from food. The importance of echolocation for foraging is reflected in a stereotypic call pattern of M. macrophyllum that resembles other aerial insectivorous and trawling bats with a pronounced terminal phase (buzz) prior to capture attempts. Our findings contrast studies of other phyllostomid bats that glean prey very near or from vegetation, often using additional sensory cues, such as prey-produced noise, to find food and that lack a terminal phase in echolocation behavior.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method to}} solve the problem of symmetric rigid contour entering water vertically at a given time-dependent speed is presented. The method is based upon the so-called generalised Wagner model. Within this model the body boundary condition is imposed on the actual position of the entering surface, the free-surface boundary conditions are linearised and imposed on the pile-up height, which is determined as part of the solution. The hydrodynamic pressure is given by the non-linear Bernoulli equation. The hydrodynamic pressures which are below the atmospheric value are disregarded. The conformal mapping of the flow region onto the lower half-plane is used. The velocity potential of the flow is given in analytical form once this mapping is known. The conformal mapping is calculated numerically. The obtained results are validated with respect to the known solutions for wedge and circular cylinder. The novelty and practical importance of the present approach are due to a special accurate treatment of the flows and the pressures close to the contact points between the entering body and <b>water</b> free <b>surface.</b> This special treatment is required for reliable prediction of the hydrodynamic pressure along the wetted part of the contour during its impact <b>onto</b> the <b>water</b> <b>surface</b> and the subsequent entry. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
