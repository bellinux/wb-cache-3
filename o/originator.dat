5|$|Simon Stevin is {{credited}} with introducing the decimal system into general use in Europe. Twentieth-century writers such as Bigourdan (France, 1901) and McGreevy (United Kingdom, 1995) credit the French cleric Gabriel Mouton (1670) as the <b>originator</b> of the metric system.|$|E
5|$|He is {{recognized}} as an <b>originator</b> of the social science fiction genre in Polish science fiction, known in Poland as the sociological speculative fiction (fantastyka socjologiczna).

25|$|As {{mortgage}} <b>originators</b> {{began to}} distribute {{more and more}} of their loans through private label MBSs, GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage <b>originators.</b> Competition between the GSEs and private securitizers for loans further undermined GSEs' power and strengthened mortgage <b>originators.</b> This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{with respect}} to the <b>originators</b> of {{subprime}} loans, many may have suspected that the borrowers {{would not be able to}} maintain their payments in the long run and that, for this reason, the loans were not going to be worth much. Still, because there were many buyers of these loans (or of pools of these loans) willing to take on that risk, the <b>originators</b> did not concern themselves with the potential long-term consequences of making these loans. After selling the loans, the <b>originators</b> bore none of the risk so there was little to no incentive for the <b>originators</b> to investigate the long-term value of the loans.|$|R
40|$|Financial reform {{legislation}} passed by Congress in 2010 requires mortgage <b>originators</b> to retain some loss exposure on the mortgages they securitize. Recent research compares {{the performance of}} mortgage-backed securities for different types of issues in which <b>originators</b> retain different degrees of loss exposure. The findings suggest that retention of even modest loss exposure by <b>originators</b> reduces moral hazard and is associated with significantly lower loss rates on these securities.

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} proponents of the strategy of splitting eights is Ed Thorp, who developed the strategy on an IBM 704 {{as part of an}} overall blackjack strategic theory published in Beat the Dealer: A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One in 1962. Thorp was the <b>originator</b> of the card counting system for blackjack.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{publication}} of From Bakunin to Lacan in 2001, {{there have been several}} attempts to develop an account of postanarchism that, while retaining many of Newman's specific conceptions of the anarchistic qualities of radical post-structuralist thought, would take postanarchist theory beyond academic discourse and into broader and more diverse environments, as the <b>originator</b> of postanarchism, Hakim Bey, had intended.|$|E
5|$|Today, such a {{position}} is often adopted by interpreters of Wittgenstein such as Peter Hacker. However, Hilary Putnam, the <b>originator</b> of functionalism, has also adopted {{the position that the}} mind–body problem is an illusory problem which should be dissolved according to the manner of Wittgenstein.|$|E
50|$|Scotsman Guide is {{the name}} of two United States trade/B2B {{magazines}} published monthly by Scotsman Guide Media in Bothell, Washington. One magazine is geared to U.S. residential mortgage <b>originators,</b> and one is geared to U.S. commercial mortgage <b>originators.</b>|$|R

5|$|A Dandie Dinmont Terrier {{is a small}} Scottish {{breed of}} dog in the terrier family. The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a {{distinctive}} topknot of hair on the head. A character in Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering has lent the name to the breed, with Dandie Dinmont thought {{to be based on}} James Davidson, who is credited as being the <b>originator</b> of the modern breed. Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} <b>originator</b> of the {{principle}} of nonviolence, {{he was the first to}} apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of a massive companion brings many other possibilities. If Eta Carinae A was rapidly stripped of its outer layers, {{it might be a}} less massive WC- or WO-type star when core collapse was reached. This would result in a type Ib or type Ic supernova {{due to the lack of}} hydrogen and possibly helium. This supernova type is thought to be the <b>originator</b> of certain classes of gamma ray bursts, but models predict they occur only normally in less massive stars.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} off-balance sheet versus on-balance sheet securitizations on the <b>originator's</b> credit risk in the default swap (CDS) market across the recent business cycle from 2002 to 2009. I find that on-balance sheet securitizations demonstrate greater effects on the <b>originator's</b> CDS premium than off-balance sheet securitizations in the business cycle. While off-balance sheet securitizations’ effects on the <b>originator's</b> CDS premium become significantly stronger after 2007 when the economy declines, on-balance sheet securitizations’ effects on the <b>originator's</b> CDS premium do not experience a significant change {{with the onset of}} the recession. The results suggest that the CDS market views <b>originators</b> as having greater probabilities not to honour their implicit guarantees for off-balance sheet securitizations during the economic downturn. The results also indicate that on balance sheet and off-balance sheet securitizations have distinctly different risk properties. It would be beneficial to investors if regulations take into considerations the changing credit risks of off-balance sheet securitizations and the different structures of asset securitizations...|$|R

5|$|After Hardy's client Adam Cole {{defeated}} Jay Briscoe {{to become}} the Undisputed Ring of Honor World Champion, Cole presented Jay Briscoe's custom made world championship belt (Briscoe claimed to still be the Ring of Honor champion as he forfeited the title due to injury and never officially lost it) to Hardy as a show of appreciation, Hardy re-branded the belt as the Ring of Honor Iconic (Innovative Creator and <b>Originator</b> of a New-Found Industry Champion) Championship, however, the title has not been sanctioned as an official championship by Ring of Honor. On June 22, 2014 at Best in the World, Hardy and Michael Bennett were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers in a no disqualification tag team match. In July, Hardy opted out of his ROH contract {{and went back to}} TNA.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August Nansen and Johansen boarded Jackson's {{supply ship}} Windward, and sailed for Vardø where they {{arrived on the}} 13th. They were greeted by Hans Mohn, the <b>originator</b> of the polar drift theory, {{who was in the}} town by chance. The world was quickly {{informed}} by telegram of Nansen's safe return, but as yet there was no news of Fram. Taking the weekly mail steamer south, Nansen and Johansen reached Hammerfest on 18 August, where they learned that Fram had been sighted. She had emerged from the ice north and west of Spitsbergen, as Nansen had predicted, and was now on her way to Tromsø. She had not passed over the pole, nor exceeded Nansen's northern mark. Without delay Nansen and Johansen sailed for Tromsø, where they were reunited with their comrades.|$|E
5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the <b>originator</b> of the conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E

50|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that the GSEs—due to their large size and market power—were far more effective at policing underwriting by <b>originators</b> and forcing underwriters to repurchase defective loans. By contrast, private securitizers have been far less aggressive and less effective in recovering losses from <b>originators</b> on behalf of investors.|$|R

5|$|George Johnstone Stoney {{introduced}} the term electron in 1891. John Stewart Bell was the <b>originator</b> of Bell's Theorem and a paper concerning {{the discovery of}} the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly and was nominated for a Nobel prize. The astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell, from Lurgan, County Armagh, discovered pulsars in 1967. Notable mathematicians include Sir William Rowan Hamilton, famous for work in classical mechanics and the invention of quaternions. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth's contribution of the Edgeworth Box remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while Richard Cantillon inspired Adam Smith, among others. John B. Cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000-digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite Fermat number in 2003. John Lighton Synge made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician John Nash as one of his students. Kathleen Lonsdale, born in Ireland and most known for her work with crystallography, became the first female president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.|$|E
5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern with the {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the <b>originator</b> of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the <b>originator</b> of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction of sentences that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{remained}} relatively unknown {{outside of the}} borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering was published. Scott had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirkshire and had learned of the prowess {{of these types of}} specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote Guy Mannering, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named Pepper and Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson, who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats. Davidson's dogs came {{from a variety of sources}} including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families. Davidson documented his breeding, and he has been accepted as the <b>originator</b> of the modern breed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>originator</b> of {{the idea}} for Operation Cobra is disputed. According to Montgomery's {{official}} biographer, the foundation of Operation Cobra was laid on 13 June. Planning was immensely aided by detailed Ultra intelligence which supplied up-to-date decodes of communications between Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, the German armed forces high command) and Hitler's generals. Montgomery's plan at that time called for the U. S. First Army to take Saint-Lô and Coutances and then make two southward thrusts; one from Caumont toward Vire and Mortain and the other from Saint-Lô toward Villedieu and Avranches. Although pressure was to be kept up along the Cotentin Peninsula towards La Haye-du-Puits and Valognes, the capture of Cherbourg was not the priority. With the capture of Cherbourg by VII Corps (Lieutenant-General Lawton Collins) on 27 June, Montgomery's initial timetable was soon outdated and the thrust from Caumont was never adopted.|$|E
5|$|Each {{flag of the}} National Olympic Committees {{represented}} {{was brought}} on stage by an athlete representative. Following Olympic tradition, the flag of Greece entered first as the <b>originator</b> of the games, and the flag of Singapore entered last as the host nation. The flag ceremony {{was followed by the}} singing of the Games theme song and remarks by Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee. The Singapore Games were then officially declared opened by S.R. Nathan, the President of Singapore. The Olympic flag was brought on stage by eight Olympians—Tan Howe Liang, Yelena Isinbayeva, Yang Yang, Tan Eng Liang, Frankie Fredericks, Patricia Chan, Tao Li and Sergey Bubka—and handed to eight Singaporean youth athletes before it was raised with the singing of the Olympic Hymn in Greek by the Singaporean singers. The Olympic Oath was taken on behalf of all athletes by Caroline Pei Jia Chew, on behalf of all judges by Syed Abdul Kadir, and on behalf of all coaches by David Lim Fong Jock. Finally, a boat {{in the shape of a}} phoenix carried the Youth Olympic Flame across Marina Bay and was passed between six Singaporean youth athletes in a relay.
