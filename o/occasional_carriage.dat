50|$|As of July 2015, {{there are}} no {{regularly}} scheduled H sets on the Northern or Eastern regions, or anywhere at all on weekends, though <b>occasional</b> <b>carriage</b> shortages see these sets filling in for other services. Quite often, H sets fill in on Geelong & Shepparton runs, resulting in first class and buffet facilities being unavailable.|$|E
50|$|In {{the winding}} {{up of the}} company the line between Nelson and the port, {{including}} the passenger operation, was sold in June 1872 as a going concern to Moses Crewdson by Levien. With the mining operation gone the line was essentially passenger only, with only the <b>occasional</b> <b>carriage</b> of goods {{on the line for}} Crewdson. The line was still subject to the provisions of the Dun Mountain Railway Act.|$|E
50|$|Following World War II, the VR and SAR {{agreed that}} a major upgrade of The Overland service was needed. At the time, the train was formed using a handful of E type carriages, perhaps with the <b>occasional</b> {{air-conditioned}} <b>carriage</b> taken from Victoria's fleet.|$|R
50|$|Bombardier Talent 2 {{electric}} {{multiple units}} have been operated on Regionalbahn line 20 by Abellio Rail Mitteldeutschland since 13 December 2015. DB Regio operated the service until 12 December 2015 with class 182 locomotives and Halberstädter Mitteleinstiegswagen (Halberstädt central-entry carriages) {{as well as}} <b>occasional</b> double-deck <b>carriages.</b> The RB 78 service is operated by Burgenlandbahn (a brand of DB Regio) with class 672 diesel multiple units and the Regional-Express 30 service to Magdeburg is operated with class 146 locomotives with double-deck carriages.|$|R
50|$|Pedestrians {{account for}} the {{majority}} of traffic over the bridge, but other forms of traffic include motor vehicles, trams, buses and bicycles, as well as an <b>occasional</b> tourist-orientated horse-drawn <b>carriage.</b> The destination of pedestrian traffic is two way, with many commuters parking at the Arts Centre and going to work in the CBD, as well as visitors to the Melbourne Arts Precinct on the Southbank side.|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of a phenotyping method (PhP typing) for the identification of clonal groups, and a genotyping method (PCR) for the identification of virulent strains of E. coli were used {{in order to obtain}} insight into diarrheal disease morbidity and epidemiology of diarrheagenic E. coli strains in children in León, Nicaragua. Fecal samples from 381 children aged 0 - 5 years suffering from diarrheal disease and 145 healthy children of the same age were analyzed. Besides, a cohort of 20 healthy infants aged 0 - 12 months were followed by repeated sampling (8 samples per infant). All samples were analyzed by a multiplex PCR (EAEC, ETEC; EPEC, EHEC, EIEC markers) on the primary streak and from the 282 positive samples 2, 164 E. coli isolates were analyzed by single-colony PCR, and from all samples, eight E. coli isolates were phenotyped; totally 4, 753 E. coli isolates were analyzed. Our main results are:  Diarrheagenic E. coli (DEC) positive samples were found at high rates in infants aged 3 - 60 months (Paper I), but were rare in infants below 3 months of age (Paper IV). Thus, colonization by DECs seem to start early in life and increase with age.  The phenotypic diversities among all isolates from diarrheal cases and from healthy children were equal and high, thus giving indication that no large outbreak of DEC diarrhea occurred during the time period studied (Paper II)  EAEC and EPEC could not be correlated to diarrhea, whereas ETEC and EHEC were significantly more common in diarrheal cases (Papers I, II, and III).  ETEC estA and EHEC were only found in diarrheal cases, and isolates positive for these DEC types belonged to a few PhP types that could represent pathogenic clones (Paper III)  DEC positive isolates seldom dominated the fecal E. coli flora, but for all DEC types, except for EAEC, a high proportion of DEC positive isolates in the fecal E. coli flora seemed to be correlated to diarrhea. Thus, a low proportion of DEC in the fecal E. coli flora may not be of significance for development of diarrhea, but may represent <b>occasional</b> <b>carriage</b> of virulence gene(s) by normal flora strains (Paper III).  Newborns were found to rapidly exchange their E. coli strains during their first year of life. Colonization by single DEC positive isolates was rarely correlated to diarrheal disease (Paper IV). Our findings suggest that there are certain stable types or clones of diarrheagenic E. coli that can circulate in a population, and have the possibility to colonize the intestine and to dominate the E. coli flora, thereby causing diarrhea. These are the true DECs. However, the virulence genes are promiscuous and may spread to the E. coli bacteria of the normal flora, whereupon these scarce gene markers are detected by the sensitive PCR test in samples from both healthy and diseased individuals, without necessarily having a pathogenic role. Thus, the obtained information on the distribution of DEC pathotypes and their diversities may be used to optimize the use of today s diagnostic tools, which in turn might affect treatment approaches and vaccine development strategies...|$|E
60|$|The {{silence of}} the quiet street in which he lived was only {{disturbed}} by the <b>occasional</b> rolling of <b>carriage</b> wheels, and by dance-music from the house {{of one of his}} neighbours who was giving a ball. He sat at his writing-table, thinking. Honest self-examination had laid out the state of his mind before him like a map, and had shown him, in its true proportions, the new interest that filled his life.|$|R
