5|$|In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors is ironic because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis of the director, Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control <b>of</b> <b>Fury</b> 161 exempts Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant review that Andrews was a petty but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|The Christians {{responded to}} these {{actions of the}} central {{government}} with a fresh wave <b>of</b> <b>fury</b> against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air.

When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E

25|$|The {{martial arts}} films starred by Bruce Lee, {{including}} the 1971 The Big Boss (唐山大兄) and Fist <b>of</b> <b>Fury</b> (精武門) the following year, were sensational.
