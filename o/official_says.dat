2500|$|On 15 September 1896, {{three weeks}} after the bank raid, Ottoman {{authorities}} organized a massacre in the town of Egin, in the eastern province of Harput. Egin was chosen as the target because the leader of the bank raiding party, Papken Siuni, was a native of the town. According to a report by the French Ambassador, Ottoman troops killed [...] "upwards of 2000 Armenians" [...] in Egin, including [...] "many women and children". A report by the British Consul at Harput, citing figures supplied by an Ottoman <b>official,</b> <b>says</b> that 1500 were killed, including 200 women and children. Of the 1500 houses located in the Armenian quarter of Egin, 980 were pillaged and burned. According to another report by the British Consul at Harput, the pretext used to attack the town's Armenian quarter was an [...] "indirect order" [...] from the Sultan that [...] "the Armenians of Egin were set to cause trouble and that the local authorities should 'take the necessary action'". The same report said that there was no revolutionary movement whatever, and the victims had given no offense. A few pistols and revolvers were found in the ruins of the burnt houses. In protest against all the massacres, the representatives of the major powers addressed an insulting letter to the sultan.
