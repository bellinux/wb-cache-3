It focuses on the basic {{patterns}} of the attitudes of youngsters with regard to social limits, defined as rules, laws, norms and environmental expectations, and on the connection between these attitudinal reactions and rearing at home, in the classroom or in (residential) institutions for youth care (Rink, 1999).

In 2000, LSCI was introduced at the Orthopedagogical Observation and Treatment Centre, a school and day unit for 60 children with emotional and behavioural disorders affiliated with the Department of <b>Orthopedagogy</b> at Ghent University (Belgium). The particular position of orientation towards 'therapeutic environments' in the department's history has encouraged the integration of LSCI in the daily activities of the departments' school (Broekaert et al., Int J Ther Communities 30 (2) : 122 - 145, 2009). In 2003, LSCI was implemented and studied in several Flemish Institutes. Positive effects were found on school results, attendance in the classroom and number of conflicts. In this article, the reflections of the caretakers are taken into account. Analyses of these reflections resulted in 4 major themes: content of job and tasks, the youth in the centre, working with the youth in the centre, and cooperation with colleagues and other teams. The results of this analysis will be discussed...|$|E
