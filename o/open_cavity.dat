40|$|The {{modes of}} {{oscillation}} and radiated acoustic fields of compressible flows over <b>open</b> <b>cavities</b> are investigated computationally. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved directly (no turbulence model) for two dimensional <b>open</b> <b>cavities</b> with laminar boundary layers upstream.

The results show a bifurcation from a shear layer mode, for shorter cavities and lower Mach numbers, to a wake mode for longer cavities and higher Mach numbers. The shear layer mode is well characterized by Rossiter modes and these oscillations lead to intense upstream acoustic radiation dominated by a single frequency. The wake mode is characterized instead by a large-scale vortex shedding with Strouhal number nearly independent the Mach number. The vortex shedding causes the boundary layer to periodically separate upstream of the cavity. Acoustic radiation is more intense, with multiple frequencies present.

50|$|Within the cell, {{the process}} of GroEL/ES {{mediated}} protein folding involves multiple rounds of binding, encapsulation, and release of substrate protein. Unfolded substrate proteins bind to a hydrophobic binding patch on the interior rim of the <b>open</b> <b>cavity</b> of GroEL, forming a binary complex with the chaperonin. Binding of substrate protein in this manner, in addition to binding of ATP, induces a conformational change that allows association of the binary complex with a separate lid structure, GroES. Binding of GroES to the <b>open</b> <b>cavity</b> of the chaperonin induces the individual subunits of the chaperonin to rotate such that the hydrophobic substrate binding site {{is removed from the}} interior of the cavity, causing the substrate protein to be ejected from the rim into the now largely hydrophilic chamber. The hydrophilic environment of the chamber favors the burying of hydrophobic residues of the substrate, inducing substrate folding. Hydrolysis of ATP and binding of a new substrate protein to the opposite cavity sends an allosteric signal causing GroES and the encapsulated protein to be released into the cytosol. A given protein will undergo multiple rounds of folding, returning each time to its original unfolded state, until the native conformation or an intermediate structure committed to reaching the native state is achieved. Alternatively, the substrate may succumb to a competing reaction, such as misfolding and aggregation with other misfolded proteins.|$|E

50|$|The false {{codling moth}} {{presents}} {{a problem to}} the citrus industry. All stages of fruit development of citrus are susceptible to a false codling moth infestation. Eggs are laid {{on the surface of}} the fruit. After emerging from the egg the larvae burrow into the rind. In citruses such as the orange the skin around the point of penetration develops a brown discoloration. The bored hole itself will also show signs of stress, excreting a brown substance. Once the fruit has been penetrated it is no longer a marketable item, and once compromised, the incidence of disease and mold increases. The <b>open</b> <b>cavity</b> is a point of entry for other pests and pathogens. Often fruits afflicted early in development prematurely drop.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate bone regeneration in defects created in the mastoids of rats, using hydroxyapatite, to see how much of the cavity we could reduce. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve rats Wistar-Furth were used. A 0. 5 x 0. 5 cm bone defect was created in both temporal bones of the rats, and filled with 15 micrograms of hydroxyapatite. The left side was used as control. The animals were slaughtered 40 days afterwards and histology analyses were carried out.

5000|$|Glycogen {{branching}} enzyme {{belongs to the}} α-amylase family of enzymes, which include α-amylases, pullulanas/isoamylase, cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGT), and {{branching enzyme}}. [...] Shown by x-ray crystallography, glycogen branching enzyme has four marginally asymmetric units each that are organized into three domains: an amino-terminal domain, involved in determining {{the length of the}} chain transfer, a carboxyl-terminal domain, involved in substrate preference and catalytic capacity, and a central (α/β) barrel catalytic domain. The amino-terminal domain consists of 128 residues arranged in seven β-strands, the carboxyl-terminal domain with 116 residues also organized in seven β-strands, and the (α/β) barrel domain with 372 residues. While the central (α/β) barrel domain is common in members of the α-amylase family, numerous variations exist between the various barrel domains. Additionally, there are striking differences between the loops connecting elements of the secondary structure among these various α-amylase members, especially around the active site. In comparison to the other family members, glycogen binding enzyme has shorter loops, which result in a more <b>open</b> <b>cavity,</b> favorable to the binding of a bulkier substrate such as branched sugar.
