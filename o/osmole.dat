There were no changes in the concentrations of these <b>osmoles</b> (specifically myoinositol, sorbitol, betaine, glycerophosphorylcholine [GPC], phosphocreatine, glutamine, glutamate, and taurine) in rats with acute (2 h) hypernatremia (serum Na 194 +/- 5 meq/liter). With severe (serum Na 180 +/- 4 meq/liter) chronic (7 d) hypernatremia, the concentrations {{of each of these}} <b>osmoles</b> except sorbitol increased significantly: myoinositol (65 %), betaine (54 %), GPC (132 %), phosphocreatine (73 %), glutamine (143 %), glutamate (84 %), taurine (78 %), and urea (191 %).

50|$|A {{solution}} {{is said to}} be isotonic when its effective <b>osmole</b> concentration is {{the same as that of}} another solution. In biology, the solutions on either side of a cell membrane are isotonic if the concentration of solutes outside the cell is equal to the concentration of solutes inside the cell. In this case the cell neither swells nor shrinks because there is no concentration gradient to induce the diffusion of large amounts of water across the cell membrane. Water molecules freely diffuse through the plasma membrane in both directions, and as the rate of water diffusion is the same in each direction, the cell will neither gain nor lose water.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, the <b>osmole</b> (Osm or osmol) is a non-SI unit of {{measurement}} that defines the number of moles of solute {{that contribute to the}} osmotic pressure of a solution. The term comes from the phenomenon of osmosis, and is typically used for osmotically active solutions. For example, a solution of 1 mol/L NaCl corresponds to an osmolarity of 2 osmol/L. The NaCl salt particle dissociates fully in water to become two separate particles: an Na+ ion and a Cl− ion. Therefore, each mole of NaCl becomes two osmoles in solution, one mole of Na+ and one mole of Cl−. Similarly, a solution of 1 mol/L CaCl2, gives a solution of 3 osmol/L (Ca2+ and 2 Cl−).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>osmole</b> gap is used {{routinely}} as {{a screening}} test {{for the presence of}} exogenous osmotically active substances, such as the toxic alcohols ethylene glycol and methanol, particularly when the ability to measure serum concentrations of the substances is not available. The objectives of this study were: 1) to measure the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>osmole</b> gap for screening for ethylene glycol and methanol exposure, and 2) to identify whether a recently proposed modification of the ethanol coefficient affects the diagnostic accuracy. Methods Electronic laboratory records from two tertiary-care hospitals were searched to identify all patients for whom a serum ethylene glycol and methanol measurement was ordered between January 1, 1996 and March 31, 2002. Cases were eligible for analysis if serum sodium, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, ethanol, ethylene glycol, methanol, and osmolality were measured simultaneously. Serum molarity was calculated using the Smithline and Gardner equation and ethanol coefficients of 1 and 1. 25 mOsm/mM. The diagnostic accuracy of the <b>osmole</b> gap was evaluated for identifying patients with toxic alcohol levels above the recommended threshold for antidotal therapy and hemodialysis using receiver-operator characteristic curves, likelihood ratios, and positive and negative predictive values. Results One hundred and thirty-one patients were included in the analysis, 20 of whom had ethylene glycol or methanol serum concentrations above the threshold for antidotal therapy. The use of an ethanol coefficient of 1. 25 mOsm/mM yielded higher specificities and positive predictive values, without affecting sensitivity and negative predictive values. Employing an <b>osmole</b> gap threshold of 10 for the identification of patients requiring antidotal therapy resulted in a sensitivity of 0. 9 and 0. 85, and a specificity of 0. 22 and 0. 5, with equations 1 and 2 respectively. The sensitivity increased to 1 for both equations for the identification of patients requiring dialysis. Conclusion In this sample, an <b>osmole</b> gap threshold of 10 has a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 1 for identifying patients for whom hemodialysis is recommended, independent of the ethanol coefficient applied. In patients potentially requiring antidotal therapy, applying an ethanol coefficient of 1. 25 resulted in a higher specificity and positive predictive value without compromising the sensitivity. </p...|$|E

Urine composition was compared {{to that in the}} excised papillary tip in rats treated with DDAVP while on a normal or a low electrolyte diet; half the rats were given a urea load. Studies were also carried out in humans who were water restricted for 12 to 16 hours and given DDAVP. One group had a high rate of NaCl excretion induced by a thiazide diuretic, while the other group consumed a low salt diet to decrease the rate of excretion of electrolytes. Urea (3 mmol/kg) was ingested after the control urine samples were collected. On the high salt protocols, the urine flow rate was directly proportional to the rate of excretion of electrolytes (‘non-urea’ osmoles) and there was no change in the ‘non-urea’ osmolality despite large changes in Na and Cl excretion rates. After urea was administered, there was no change in urine flow rate, ‘non-urea’ osmolality, or ‘non-urea’ <b>osmole</b> excretion rate, whereas the urinary urea concentration, urine osmolality and the rate of excretion of urea were higher. The papilla of the salt-loaded rats had a similar urea concentration to that in the urine. In contrast, in the low electrolyte excretion protocols, the sum of the concentrations of ‘non-urea’ osmoles in the urine was much lower than that in the excised papilla, and the converse applied to urea. Similar changes were observed in the composition of the urine in human subjects with high and low rates of excretion of electrolytes.

During the developmental period examined the water content of the cotyledons decreased from ≈ 80 % “stage 1 ” to ≈ 55 % “stage 2 ”. When assayed in an isotonic medium (400 <b>osmoles</b> per cubic meter) the influx capacity per gram fresh weight for sucrose was almost constant during this developmental period. The influx could be analyzed into a saturable component (Km ≈ 9 moles per cubic meter; Vmax ≈ 150 nanomoles per minute per gram fresh weight) and an unsaturable component (ki ≈ 0. 5 nanomoles per minute per gram fresh weight [per mole per cubic meter]). Incubation in a hypotonic medium reduced the sucrose influx in stage 1 cotyledons, up to 80 % reduction at 0 milliosmole (medium without mannitol), but had no effect on sucrose uptake by stage 2 cotyledons. Reduced uptake in a hypotonic medium (100 <b>osmoles</b> per cubic meter) could be attributed to a lowering of the Vmax from 150 to 36 nanomoles per minute per gram fresh weight.

Methods Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected from non-Hispanic white sibships in Rochester, MN. Height, weight, blood pressure, serum creatinine, and cystatin C were measured. Diet was assessed using the Viocare food frequency questionnaire. Effects of demographics and dietary elements on urine osmolality and volume were evaluated in bivariate and multivariable models, as well as models that included dietary interactions with age, sex, and weight. Results Samples were available from 709 individuals (mean age 66 [*]±[*] 9  years, 59  % female). Across the age spectrum, males had higher urine osmolality (~ 140  mOsm/kg, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and total <b>osmole</b> excretion (~ 270  mOsm, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) compared to females. For any given urine volume, males had a consistently higher urine osmolality (~ 140  mOsm/kg, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). In multivariable models, urine osmolality declined with age and water intake and remained higher in males than females. Urine osmolality positively associated with weight and animal protein intake. Higher urine volume associated with larger water intake. An interaction revealed that greater body weight was associated with larger changes in urine osmolality as oxalate intake increased (p[*]=[*] 0. 04).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesThomas SchermerhornTonicity is {{property}} {{of a solution}} that {{is defined as the}} total effective (impermeable) <b>osmole</b> concentration that drives fluid movement across a semipermeable membrane via osmosis. Tonicity is related to but distinct from solution osmolality, which is a summation of all solute concentrations, regardless of the solute membrane permeability. In the mammalian body, tonicity is tightly regulated at both a cellular and systemic level; tonic derangements cause rapid change in cell and tissue volume leading to significant dysfunction. Input from the central nervous, circulatory, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and urinary systems are integral to osmoregulation, so many diseases in veterinary medicine are associated with tonicity disorders. However, because the homeostatic mechanisms that control tonicity overlap with those regulating electrolyte and acid-base balance as well as hydration and vascular volume, tonic consequences of disease can be difficult to isolate. Understanding of disease-associated changes in tonicity is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the tonic contributions of many solutes that accumulate in disease are unknown. Additionally, direct assessment of tonicity is difficult because tonicity is not just a physiochemical property, but it implies a physiologic effect. Thus, simple summation of <b>osmole</b> concentrations is an inadequate measurement of tonicity. The following report includes three studies investigating various aspects of tonicity as it applies to veterinary patients. Chapter 2 reports a study that examines the tonic effects of ketoacids and lactate using two different in vitro red blood cell assays. Results demonstrated that the ketoacids, beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, behave as ineffective osmoles while the tonic behavior of lactate is variable, implying a more complex cellular handling of this anion. Two additional studies examine whether the mean corpuscular volume difference (dMCV) is a novel clinical marker for hypertonicity in dogs. Results of separate retrospective (Chapter 3) and prospective (Chapter 4) studies provide evidence that dMCV is a useful clinical marker for hypertonicity in dogs...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that lactose is the major <b>osmole</b> in the milk of many mammalian species, and hence {{that the amount of}} water secreted is approximately proportional to the amount of lactose secreted. It is envisaged that reduction of the amount of lactose synthesised would allow a reduction of the amount of water in milk. This thesis studied the regulation of lactose synthesis in the mammary glands of goats by altering the flux of glucose and other intermediates of lactose synthesis. The consequent effects were determined by measuring the levels of various metabolites in milk. The mechanism of the reduction of milk yield brought about by twenty-four hour fasting in goats was explored by looking for perturbations in some of these parameters measured. Also, known differences between certain bovine genetic groups in water secretion were investigated by measurements in milk of trace metabolites involved in lactose synthesis. It was intended to further substantiate the paradigm that availability of glucose within mammary secretory cells of ruminants normally regulates lactose synthesis during midlactation.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the pathophysiology of cerebral edema occurring during treatment of diabetic coma, {{the effects of}} hyperglycemia and rapid lowering of plasma glucose were evaluated in normal rabbits. During 2 h of hyperglycemia (plasma glucose= 61 mM), both brain (cerebral cortex) and muscle initially lost about 10 % of water content. After 4 h of hyperglycemia, skeletal muscle water content remained low but that of brain was normal. Brain osmolality (Osm) (343 mosmol/kg H 2 O) {{was similar to that}} of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (340 mosmol/kg), but increases in the concentration of Na+, K+, Cl-, glucose, sorbitol, lactate, urea, myoinositol, and amino acids accounted for only about half of this increase. The unidentified solute was designated “idiogenic osmoles”. When plasma glucose was rapidly lowered to normal with insulin, there was gross brain edema, increases in brain content of water, Na+, K+, Cl- and idiogenic <b>osmoles,</b> and a significant osmotic gradient from brain (326 mosmol/kg H 2 O) to plasma (287 mosmol/kg). By similarly lowering plasma glucose with peritoneal dialysis, increases in brain Na+, K+, Cl-, and water were significantly less, idiogenic <b>osmoles</b> were not present, and brain and plasma Osm were not different. It is concluded that during sustained hyperglycemia, the cerebral cortex adapts to extracellular hyperosmolality primarily by accumulation of idiogenic <b>osmoles</b> rather than loss of water or gain in solute. When plasma glucose is rapidly lowered with insulin, an osmotic gradient develops from brain to plasma. Despite the brain to plasma osmotic gradient, there is no net movement of water into brain until plasma glucose has fallen to at least 14 mM, at which time cerebral edema occurs...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which urine is concentrated in the mammalian kidney remains incompletely understood. Urea is the dominant urinary <b>osmole</b> in most mammals and may be concentrated a 100 -fold above its plasma level in humans and even more in rodents. Several facilitated urea transporters have been cloned. The phenotypes of mice with deletion of the transporters expressed in the kidney have challenged two previously well-accepted paradigms regarding urea and sodium handling in the renal medulla but have provided no alternative explanation for the accumulation of solutes that occurs in the inner medulla. In this review, we present evidence supporting {{the existence of an}} active urea secretion in the pars recta of the proximal tubule and explain how it changes our views regarding intrarenal urea handling and UT-A 2 function. The transporter responsible for this secretion could be SGLT 1, a sodium-glucose cotransporter that also transports urea. Glucagon may have a role in the regulation of this secretion. Further, we describe a possible transfer of osmotic energy from the outer to the inner medulla via an intrarenal Cori cycle converting glucose to lactate and back. Finally, we propose that an active urea transporter, expressed in the urothelium, may continuously reclaim urea that diffuses out of the ureter and bladder. These hypotheses are all based on published findings. They may not all be confirmed later on, but we hope they will stimulate further research in new directions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Functional bladder {{capacity}} (FBC) {{and urine}} output are important {{variables in the}} management of incontinence and nocturnal enuresis. The lack of reference ranges for FBC vs. age, and the arbitrarily defined time-windows for measuring urine output, impede the clinical use of these variables in children. To solve these impediments, we had 26 girls and 28 boys, between 6 and 12 years of age, collect, measure, time, and sample every voiding, using 72 -h frequency-volume charts; all samples were analysed for osmolality and creatinine concentration. Voided volumes show a very wide range (10550 ml) and a subset that is significantly larger than all other voidings: early morning voidings (EMV). The individual maximum voided volume (MVV) belongs to the category of EMV in 74 % of the children. MVV, the measure for FBC, fits the 595 % centiles that have been published for cystographic bladder capacity for age in normal children; all other voiding are mostly below the 5 % centile. Voided volume plotted vs. corresponding urine output rate shows that, with output rates below 50 ml/h, rest-phase bladder filling always results in significantly larger voidings (EMV) than activity-phase bladder filling. Two circadian rhythms seem to be involved, one for urine output, and another for inhibition of bladder contractility. With hourly population averages of individual urine and <b>osmole</b> output rates plotted on a time scale, circadian patterns appear; these patterns are masked when urine output is collected in blocks of 6, 8, or 12 h. Both plots are promising tools for studying the pathophysiology of voided volume vs. urine output, e. g. in children with nocturnal enuresis...|$|E
40|$|Hypokalemia {{is not an}} {{isolated}} disease but an associated finding in a vast number of different diseases; it poses a great challenge in correct diagnosis and proper management. Hypokalemia usually arises from a shift of potassium (K+) into cells and/or a net loss of K+. Besides a detailed history and physical examination, measurement of K+ excretion rate with freshly-voided and/or 24 -hour urine and assessment of blood acid-base status can help discriminate between the various causes of hypokalemia. In patients with a low rate of K+ excretion, hypokalemia can be due to an acute shift of K+ into cells, intestinal/sweating K+ loss, or prior renal K+ excretion. In patients with a high rate of K+ excretion, there may be either increased flow rate or increased K+ secretion, seen with fast sodium (Na+) or slow chloride (Cl−) disorders, in the cortical collecting ducts (CCD). An increased flow rate in the CCD arises from increased <b>osmole</b> excretion (whether solutes or electrolytes). Patients with fast Na+ disorders have a high extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and thus high blood pressure associated with a state of high mineralocorticoid activity. Measurement of renin activity, aldosterone, and cortisol levels in plasma helps distinguish between the causes. Patients with slow Cl− disorders usually have low to normal ECF volume and blood pressure and are usually associated with abnormal acid-base states. In patients with metabolic alkalosis, urine Na+ and Cl− excretion rate reveal the basis for renal Na+ wasting and distinguish it from non-renal Na+ loss. In patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, an assessment of the ammonium excretion rate (NH 4 +) separates those with renal tubular acidosis (low NH 4 + excretion) from those with other causes. The treatment of hypokalemia depends on the degree and timing of hypokalemia, clinical manifestations, underlying causes, and potential risks from associated conditions...|$|E

ResultsUrine flow, urinary and plasma Na, K, urea, and osmolality were stably different on low and high hydration regimens. At baseline, there were significant or borderline significant correlations of plasma and urine osmolality with glomerular filtration rate (GFR; inulin clearance) only in the low hydration regimen. GFR was higher in the low than the high hydration regimen at all time points. The difference was significant at baseline (19. 2 %) and at 90 to 180 minutes after the meal (14. 4 %). After the meal, GFR increased significantly over baseline values only in the high hydration regimen (30. 0 % at peak time). Urinary excretion of Na, urea, and <b>osmoles</b> was lower in the low than the high hydration regimen at all time points: The difference was significant for Na (at baseline) and <b>osmoles</b> (all time points).
