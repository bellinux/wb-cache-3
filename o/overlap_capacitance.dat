50|$|The aluminum-gate MOS process technology, {{developed}} in the mid-sixties, started with the definition and doping of the source and drain regions of MOS transistors, followed by the gate mask that defined the thin-oxide region of the transistors. With additional processing steps, an aluminum gate would then be formed over the thin-oxide region completing the device fabrication. Due to the inevitable misalignment of the gate mask {{with respect to the}} source and drain mask, it was necessary to have a fairly large overlap area between the gate region and the source and drain regions, to ensure that the thin-oxide region would bridge the source and drain, even under worst-case misalignment. This requirement resulted in gate-to-source and gate-to-drain parasitic capacitances that were large and variable from wafer to wafer, depending on the misalignment of the gate oxide mask with respect with the source and drain mask. The result was an undesirable spread in the speed of the integrated circuits produced, and a much lower speed than theoretically possible if the parasitic capacitances could be reduced to a minimum. The <b>overlap</b> <b>capacitance</b> with the most adverse consequences on performance was the gate-to-drain parasitic capacitance, Cgd, which, by the well-known Miller effect, augmented the gate-to-source capacitance of the transistor by Cgd multiplied by the gain of the circuit to which that transistor was a part. The impact was a considerable reduction in the switching speed of transistors.|$|E

Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are the basic blocks of the circuits used in such devices and need to operate above 100 [*]MHz to efficiently treat signals in RF systems and address pixels in high resolution displays. Beyond {{the choice of the}} semiconductor, i. e., silicon, graphene, organics, or amorphous oxides, the junctionless nature of TFTs and its geometry imply some limitations which become evident and important in devices with scaled channel length.

40|$|The {{international}} technology roadmap for semiconductors {{predicts that}} downscaling {{of the dimensions}} of electronic devices will continue according to Moore's law for the next 10 to 15 years. However, device scaling is {{getting more and more}} complicated due to physical limitations. Novel device architectures are needed to overcome these problems. Vertical transistors could be one potential solution since the channel length is independent from the device layout. In this thesis, novel concepts to reduce parasitic behaviour in vertical single and surround gate MOSFETs are presented. This includes a novel fillet local oxidation (FILOX) process, optimisations of the pillar, a pillar top insulator and the incorporation of polySiGe into the source of a vertical MOS transistor. Calculations based on industry layout rules at the l 00 nm technology node for vertical and lateral devices are presented. For the optimised minimum geometry single gate vertical MOSFET incorporating FILOX with optimised pillar structure, the gate/drain capacitance is 40 % and the gate/source <b>overlap</b> <b>capacitance</b> 60 % of that of a minimum dimension lateral MOS device. For optimised surround gate transistors the <b>overlap</b> <b>capacitance</b> is 20 % and 5 % of that of a lateral transistor. These calculations demonstrate the potential of optimised vertical MOS transistors. Pillar capacitors incorporating the FILOX process have been fabricated and a reduction in the measured capacitance is obtained by a factor of 1. 4 and 5. 6 for structures with nitride top and nitride top and FILOX, respectively. Device simulations confirm the measured reduction in capacitance. The extracted oxide thickness on the pillar sidewall is 9. 3 nm for the fabricated structures, which agrees within a factor of 1. 18 with the simulated oxide thickness on the sidewall. Kinks in CV measurements have been investigated and explained by the formation of an inversion layer underneath the field oxide.
