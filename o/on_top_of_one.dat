The mutineers managed to win over a few more tirailleurs from the 5th and 6th {{companies}} of the battalion, and even managed to raise {{the flag of the}} VNQDĐ <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the buildings. They managed to capture the armoury and proclaimed victory. The leaders of the uprising sent a patrol into the centre of the town to exhort the populace to join the insurrection, falsely claiming that they had already eliminated the entire French officer corps.|$|E

5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} from Raw was a Last Man Standing match, where {{the goal is}} to {{incapacitate}} the opponent long enough for a 10-count. In his third match of the night, Triple H defended his WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Both men fought extensively outside the ring, both taking advantage of the match stipulations, where there are no countouts or disqualifications. At one point, both men were positioned <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> of the broadcast tables, where Orton attempted an RKO on Triple H, who countered the move and sent Orton through another of the broadcast tables. Triple H followed this by striking Orton with the steel steps. The men returned to the ring, and Orton performed a DDT and an RKO on Triple H, both onto a steel chair. The competitors returned to the outside of the ring again, and Triple H struck Orton with a chair. They returned {{to the top of the}} broadcast table, and Triple H attempted a Pedigree through the table on Orton, who countered into an RKO onto the table. The referee began a count and reached ten before Triple H could rise; in result, Orton won the match and subsequently regained the WWE Championship.|$|E

25|$|When fetal {{hemoglobin}} production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA).

These defective red blood cells have a greater tendency to stack <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> another and block blood vessels.

25|$|In {{many parts}} of ancient India, the {{inscriptions}} were carried out in smoke-treated palm leaves. This tradition dates back to over two thousand years. Even after the Indian languages were put on paper in the 13th century, palm leaves where considered a preferred medium of writing owing to its longevity (nearly 400 years) compared to paper. Both sides of the leaves were used for writing. Long rectangular strips were gathered <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> another, holes were drilled through all the leaves, and the book was held together by string. Books of this manufacture were common to Southeast Asia. The palm leaf was an excellent surface for penwriting, making possible the delicate lettering used {{in many of the}} scripts of southern Asia.|$|E
