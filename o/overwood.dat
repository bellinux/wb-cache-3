40|$|Although {{damping-off}} {{is known}} to cause considerable loss before and after emergence of seedlings in forest nurseries, little is known of its role in seedling mortality after direct seeding in artificial regeneration of mixed eucalypt forests. Findings reported in this thesis {{are the result of}} a survey for the presence of damping-off fungi in soils and dying seedlings, and tests of their pathogenicity to a range of eucalypts found in the Wombat State Forest of Victoria. This study was carried out in conjunction with a research programme established by the Victorian Department of Conservation, Forests and Lands to determine which factors govern the successful establishment of E. obliqua and E. radiata in three seed-bed types under five levels of <b>overwood.</b> Propagule counts for Pythiaceous fungi in burnt and unburnt soils from field experiment, plots prior to sowing indicated that the inoculum level was low and differed with levels of <b>overwood</b> retained following site preparation in summer (Chapter 2). Baiting the soils with E. sieberi cotyledons, apples or directly sowing E. sieberi seed in samples of the field soil showed that both burnt and unburnt soils were variably infested with Pythium spp., Fusarium spp., and Cylindrocarpon destructans. A small portion of the seed to be sawn in the field plots without any fungicidal pre-treatment was found to harbour a range of fungi, sane of which had the potential to inhibit germination of the eucalypts sown on the plots (Chapter 3). The fungi having this ability were however not isolated from damped off seedlings in the experimental plots. Field studies showed that the proportion of germinated seedlings killed as a result of damping-off was lower than that attributable to frost heave, droughting following freezing and insect damage (Chapter 4). Damping-off was found to be widespread over the entire study site and the rate of damping-off to differ with seed-bed type. <b>Overwood</b> density did not affect the disease level. Although Pythium spp. were responsible for most deaths, Cylindrocarpon destructans and Fusarium spp. also caused some mortality. Pathogenicity tests (Chapter 5) confirmed that the fungi associated with seedling mortality in the field can cause significant pre- and post-emergence damping-off in a range of eucalypts found at the study site. The fungi differed in their pathogenicity to the eucalypts and sane induced feeder root necrosis after the two leaf stage of seedling development. No differences in susceptibility to post-emergence damping-off were found between the tree species sown on the plots and others of economic importance in the forest. The overall findings and their implications for direct sowing as a management option in future field regenerations are discussed in Chapter 6.

40|$|The {{eucalypt}} {{species of}} the evergreen savanna forest in monsoonal Australia have a population structure characterized by mature trees, an abundance of short stems in the ground layer and low densities of saplings. Other common trees of these forests, such as the broadleaved species, are almost exclusively represented by these short woody sprouts. The distinctive structure of the eucalypt forests begs {{the question as to}} how these forests are perpetuated. This study seeks to examine tree regeneration in the eucalypt forests of Melville Island in the wet-dry tropics of Australia. The first part of the thesis adresses the influence of the physical environment on regeneration by examining edpahic influences on vegetation structure, growth rates and fire response. The second part of the thesis concentrates on the evergreen eucalypts forests and examines possible causes for the supression of woody sprouts. An attempt was made to define the soil moisture conditions across the range of savanna types. However, elucidating the relationship between edaphic conditions and vegetation patterns is difficult because of the effect of rockiness and soil texture on root penetration. It is reasonably certain that evergreen eucalypts are excluded from one intensively studied site because a clay layer impedes root growth. This low forest is dominated by semi-deciduous eucalypts and the growth of all woody sprouts is slower than in the tall forest. Despite less vigorous growth, broadleaved tree species, such as Terminalia ferdinandiana and Planchonia careya, occupy the mid-canopy at this site. It is suggested that the tall evergreen eucalypts, Eucalyptus miniata, Eucalyptus nesophila and Eucalyptus tetrodonta, suppress the growth of other tree species. <b>Overwood</b> suppression is evident within the tall forest. Tree seedlings grew more rapidly under killed trees than live <b>overwood.</b> Furthermore, clearfelled sites develop saplings although the replacement of the tree canopy occurs sporadically. Few eucalypt saplings developed in an extensive experiment designed to examine the influence of eucalypt and wattle trees and herbage on tree regeneration. The saplings of two tree species were weakly associated with natural canopy gaps. The saplings of three other species had no such association. It is suggested that underground organs of middleage and with well developed root systems are the most likely to become trees. Underground organs are extensively damaged by termites, and relief from this form of herbivory may contribute to the accession of saplings. It is demonstrated that moisture conditions, below 50 cm, are generally adequate for tree growth throughout the year. This helps to explain why the new growth of woody sprouts after fire, occurs during the driest months. These ground layer stems stop growing when water is abundant during the wet season. The hypothesis that competition for moisture provides the mechanism of <b>overwood</b> suppression is difficult to equate with these facts. The hypothesis that competition for nutrients controls the suppression of young trees is not supported by an experiment where woody sprouts showed no response to fertilizing. Patterns of insect abundance and damage levels indicate that the growth of woody sprouts is not tuned to the activities of phytophagous insects. There was no relationship between stem height and levels of insect damage. Furthermore, experimental protection of plants using pesticide did not increase growth. Thus, it seems that suppression of tree stems cannot be attributed to insects. Shredded Eucalyptus tetrodonta leaves suppressed seedlings of the same species when applied to pots in a nursery experiment. It is suggested that allelopathic interactions may be important for suppressing regeneration. Relief from fire is another factor that contributes to tree regeneration. However, the effect of this agent on forest structure seems dependent on certain site conditions. The development of tree saplings in a rocky eucalypt forest after longterm fire protection contrasts with limited sapling development in another fire protected forest on deep soil. Many features of the regeneration process remain unclear but this thesis provides sufficient evidence to postulate a comprehensive model describing a common regeneration strategy in tropical eucalypt forest...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{hardwood}} {{species were}} tested as underplants under Pinus elliottii plantations on the coastal lowlands of south-east Queensland. The species tested were: Flindersia brayleyana (F. Muell) (Queensland maple), F. australis (R. Br.), (crow's ash), Swietenia macrophylla (King) (American mahogany), Grevillea robusta (A. cunn) (southern silky oak), Elaeocarpus grandis (F. Muell) (silver quandong), F. ifflaiana (F. Meull) (Cairns hickory) and Ceratopetalum apetalum (D. Don) (coachwood). Most species (except E. grandis) established successfully but slowly. Underplants suffered 9 - 16 % mortality during thinning of the overstorey. By 2004 when aged c. 38 years, four underplanted species; F. brayleyana, S. macrophylla, F. ifflaiana and E. grandis, had attained predominant heights of 20 m and mean diameter at breast height of 25 cm or better. The presence of underplants increased total site productivity {{by up to}} 23 % {{and did not have}} any detrimental effect {{on the development of the}} <b>overwood.</b> This experiment has demonstrated that some rainforest species will survive and grow healthily as underplants in exotic pine plantations plus produce small merchantable logs within a 38 year rotation. The results also indicated the importance of correct species selection if an underplanting option is to be pursued as some species have been a complete failure (notably G. robusta) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Restoring {{natural fire}} regimes and diverse ground cover to planted or old-field origin {{southern}} pine stands typically requires a substantial reduction in overstory density. While maintaining full canopy cover (CC) {{is consistent with}} maximizing fiber production, this approach does not allow sufficient light to reach the forest floor to accomplish a broader set of objectives. The relationship between stand basal area (BA) and CC {{has been used to}} regulate the <b>overwood</b> in shelterwood seed cuttings and is worth exploring for other purposes. Two factors potentially complicating the use of BA as a proxy for CC are: (1) the dynamic relationship between stem diameter and crown size and (2) species-level differences. Data collected as part of a regional inventory (Forest Inventory and Analysis Forest Health Monitoring plots) were used to construct regression models of crown projection area (CPA) for the four most common southern pines (Pinus taeda, PITA; P. elliottii, PIEL; P. echinata, PIEC; P. palustris, PIPA). Species, stem diameter, and live-crown ratio were all identified as important predictor variables (P < 0. 05). Relative to a stated objective of achieving 50 percent CC there were some substantial differences in the amount of BA suggested for retention in stands of different average diameter (5 - to 18 -inch d. b. h, PITA 46 to 70 square feet per acre; PIEL 46 to 64; PIEC 47 to 71; PIPA 50 to 74); the differences among species were somewhat less dramatic. There was a clear tendency for relatively small stems, e. g., < 10 inch d. b. h., to have larger crowns per unit stem diameter, implying a given CC could be achieved with less BA. Species shade tolerance also appeared to influence crown-stem allometry, with the more shade-tolerant species tending to provide a given amount of CC with less BA. Both factors, species, and average tre...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was made to}} determine the managemental practices of Ryukyu-Matsu in the mixed forest of the pine and broad-leaved trees. The author reviewed various literatures that published in the Ryukyus on the management Of Ryukyu-Matsu forests and discussed in the historical viewpoint, and described the results of This research. 1. Points that have been considered for its management are as follows. a. For the reviewal of plant growth, importance should {{be attached to the}} seed-shedding and natural sprouting, but artificial planting should be considered. b. Trees are better to be closely planted, and broad-leaved trees including soil improving trees are better to be mixed. c. Shelter belts are better to be established and gap clear cutting is to be practiced. d. Final age of the trees is to be 25 - 40 years. 2. The data of this investigation were taken from two stands in Oku National Forest. Where are about 50 species of broad-leaved trees mixed with the pine trees as the underwood. The ages of the pine trees range from 23 to 38 years, and those of the broad-leaved trees. from 18 to 38 in the stand 1; and in the stand 2, those of the pine trees from 24 to 39, and those of the broad-leaved trees from 15 to 36. The average number age of the pine trees in 33 years and the average area age of the broad-leaved trees in 32 years. The number of the pine trees in the stand I in 940, and that of the broad-leaved trees In 4200; and in the stand 2, that of the pine trees in 530, and that of the broad-leaved trees 7450. The volume of the pine trees per ha in the stand I is 120 m^ 3, and that of the broad- Leaved trees in 90 m^ 3; and in the stand 2,that of the pine tree is 90 m^ 3, and that of the broad-leaved trees is 210 m^ 3. 3. As the result of the investigation, the following practices are suggested. a. In Oku National Forest, shelter belts should be made principally, in the directions of north-east, east and south-east. b. The number of the pine trees should be increased, and useful species including soil improving trees of broad-leaved trees as the underwood should be encouraged to grow. To improve the forest in that way, useful broad-leaved trees should be artificialy planted without relying upon regeneration by sprouts of advancely grown trees. And tending of trees after regeneration should be actively done. c. Poor trees of the pine are just living and the increment of growth of them are not recognized. Therefore, the age of those in the mixed forests with broad-leaved trees should be limited to certain short period to produce overwoods. d. The final age of the pine is considered that 20 - 40 years are proper. Especially for the production of pulp wood, the final age of the pine is best considered to be 2025 years. If coppice with standard system is to be practiced, it is best considered to give 40 years for final age of the <b>overwood</b> (the pine) and 20 years trees. Forests where Ryukyuan bamboos are growing, the growth of trees is kindered; therefore, efforts for the control of them should be made...|$|E
