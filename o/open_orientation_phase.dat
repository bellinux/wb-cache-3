However, {{there is a}} lack of information about the factors that influence the duration of the <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> or the percep-tion of the relationship. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to identify factors that influenced the progress of the therapeutic relationship during the <b>orientation</b> <b>phase.</b> The correlations be-tween demographic variables and the progress in the relationship, specifically the length of time in the <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> and the quality of the therapeutic relationship, were examined. STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data was conducted The original study used a prospective, longitudinal panel design. The study used a nonprobability, purposive sample of 124 newly formed nurse-client dyads. Data were collected multiple time points. RESULTS: Variables related to a shorter <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> included longer nurse-client meetings, more total time in such meetings, and shorter previous client hospitaliza-tions.

40|$|Many project {{groups have}} a hard time meeting their deadlines. This {{research}} addresses this issue by studying group perceptions and group self-regulatory actions that may impede or foster the timeliness of group projects. Longitudinal data were collected from 22 student project groups developing a business solution in a field assignment. Using a questionnaire, we measured perceived time pressure, group potency, planning, and reflexivity, as well as the project's progress at three points during the 13 -week working period: {{at the start of the}} project, just after the <b>orientation</b> <b>phase,</b> and finally after the execution phase and the project deadline. Our findings suggest that the effect of time pressure on progress is moderated by group potency. Furthermore, there were differential effects of planning and reflexivity in the <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> and the execution phase. Execution planning and reflexivity did not appear to be very useful for progress in the <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> of the project.

50|$|The <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> is {{initiated}} by the nurse. This is the phase during which the nurse and the patient become acquainted, and {{set the tone for}} their relationship, which will ultimately be patient centered. During this stage, it is important that a professional relationship is established, as opposed to a social relationship. This includes clarifying that the patient is the center of the relationship, and that all interactions are, and will be centered around helping the patient. This phase is usually progressed through during a highly impressionable phase in the nurse-client relationship, because the <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> occurs shortly after admission to a hospital, when the client is becoming accustomed to a new environment and new people. The nurse begins to know the patient as a unique individual, and the patient should sense that the nurse is genuinely interested in them. Trust begins to develop, and the client begins to understand their role, the nurse's role, and the parameters and boundaries of their relationship.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} an algorithm for learning the essential graph of a Bayesian network. The {{basis of the}} algorithm is the Maximum Minimum Parents and Children algorithm developed by previous authors, with three substantial modifications. The MMPC algorithm is {{the first stage of}} the Maximum Minimum Hill Climbing algorithm for learning the directed acyclic graph of a Bayesian network, introduced by previous authors. The MMHC algorithm runs in two phases; firstly, the MMPC algorithm to locate the skeleton and secondly an edge <b>orientation</b> <b>phase.</b> The computationally expensive part is the edge <b>orientation</b> <b>phase.</b> The first modification introduced to the MMPC algorithm, which requires little additional computational cost, is to obtain the immoralities and hence the essential graph. This renders the edge <b>orientation</b> <b>phase,</b> the computationally expensive part, unnecessary, since the entire Markov structure that can be derived from data is present in the essential graph. Secondly, the MMPC algorithm can accept independence statements that are logically inconsistent with those rejected, since with tests for independence, a `do not reject' conclusion for a particular independence statement is taken as `accept' independence. An example is given to illustrate this and a modification is suggested to ensure that the conditional independence statements are logically consistent. Thirdly, the MMHC algorithm makes an assumption of faithfulness. An example of a data set is given that does not satisfy this assumption and a modification is suggested to deal with some situations where the assumption is not satisfied. The example in question also illustrates problems with the `faithfulness' assumption that cannot be tackled by this modification. Comment: 55 page...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{technological}} approach of Knowledge Management (KM) is greatly shared, without awareness, when elaborating KM initiative’s strategy, we can confuse {{the notions of}} information and knowledge, and disregard the importance of individual’s tacit knowledge used in action. Therefore, to avoid misunderstanding during the strategic <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> of a general KM initiative development, it is fundamental to clearly distinguish the notion of information from the notion of knowledge. Further, we insist on the importance to integrate the individual {{as a component of}} the Enterprise’s Information and Knowledge System (EIKS). In this paper, we argue that Knowledge cannot be considered as an object such as data are in digital information systems. Consequently, we propose an empirical model enabling to distinguish the notions of information and knowledge. This model shows the role of individual’s interpretative frameworks and tacit knowledge, establishing a discontinuity between information and knowledge. This pragmatic vision needs thinking about the architecture of an Enterprise’s Information and Knowledge System (EIKS), which must be a basis of discussion during the strategic <b>orientation</b> <b>phase</b> of a KM initiative.

40|$|Increasing {{automation}} necessitates operators monitoring appropriately (OMA) {{and raises}} {{the question of how to}} identify them in future selections. A normative model was developed providing criteria for the identification of OMA. According to this model, the monitoring process comprises distinct monitoring <b>phases</b> (<b>orientation,</b> anticipation, detection and recheck) in which attention should be focused on relevant areas. The current study tests the normative model on the basis of eye tracking. The eye-tracking data revealed increased concentration on relevant areas during the <b>orientation</b> and anticipation <b>phase</b> in comparison to the other phases. For the assessment of monitoring behaviour in the context of personnel selection, this implies that the anticipation and <b>orientation</b> <b>phases</b> should be considered separately as they appear to be more important in the context of monitoring than the other phases.
