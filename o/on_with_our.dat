25|$|From {{the late}} 1990s the {{organization}} {{tried to move}} the higher authority for converting the metal yard (Kalwar Patti, the original Gunpowder factory from the 18th century) to a permanent park {{under the control of}} this organization. With the help of some other important dignitarias ultimately in the initial years of this decade the dream came true though the present committee negotiating with the authority for having the independent charge of maintaining this park. We are hopeful to have all the charge of this park soon and to keep <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> tradition longer.|$|E

500|$|By then, revolutionary {{examples}} also {{inspired the}} prisoners of Darnytsia to proclaim {{their own political}} goals, and openly demand the union of Transylvania with Romania. Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that {{once and for all}} that we [...] cannot carry <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> lives within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state. [...] For the sake of this ideal, we throw in the balance all of what we have, our lives and fortunes, our women and children, our descendants' life and happiness. And we never will stop, lest we vanquish or perish." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Garin, [...] "we {{have some}} crabs [...] who don't like our state to grow, who don't like us {{having a great}} event, whose own related {{interests}} {{are more important than}} those of the community. Unfortunately, you can't do anything against this kind of people, except get <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> own job." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{celebrate}} Johnson's 100th birthday, May 8, 2011, Sony Legacy released Robert Johnson: The Centennial Collection, a re-mastered 2-CD set of all 42 of his {{recordings and}} two brief fragments, one of Johnson practicing a guitar figure {{and the other}} of Johnson saying, presumably to engineer Don Law, [...] "I wanna go <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> next one myself." [...] Reviewers commented that the sound quality of the 2011 release was a substantial improvement on the 1990 release.|$|E
2500|$|... "Scotland {{had lost}} both Tests against the All Blacks {{earlier in the}} season but the second, in Auckland, had been close: the Blacks just sneaked home by 21-18. Perhaps that persuaded people that, in the light of our Test series win over the French, we were favourites. Whoever made public that {{sentiment}} did us scant favour. We were lulled into {{a false sense of security}} and yet, on the day, we were also intimidated because we didn't play our natural game, preferring instead to sit back and wait for them to come at us. Also, we didn't kick well that day, particularly Michael Lynagh. I hardly saw the ball, and when I did I was clobbered. Not feeling the ball in my hands destroys me anyway; I cannot take it. That day we were more afraid of making a mistake, worrying about who we were playing against, rather than getting <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> own game. And when we did run it we were totally predictable. The Blacks knew the ball would head out to me when it was shifted, and so whenever I got it they hammed me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not very desperate, Quashy," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "it {{was only}} my bad Spanish which made Manuela laugh. If {{you had been}} here to {{interpret}} we might have got <b>on</b> better <b>with</b> <b>our</b> philosophical discourse." ...|$|R

60|$|We {{have lived}} a {{disturbed}} life lately; too much {{coming and going}} even with agreeable people. There has been no time for work. In Rome it must be different, or we shall get <b>on</b> poorly <b>with</b> <b>our</b> books, I think. Robert seems, however, by his account, {{to be in an}} advanced state already....|$|R

40|$|The {{hierarchical}} structure of real-life data dominated applications limits the exploration space for high level optimisations. This limitation is often overcome by function inlining. However, {{it increases the}} basic block code size, which causes a significant growth of instruction cache misses and thus performance slow-down. This effect has been confirmed <b>on</b> experiments <b>with</b> <b>our</b> applications...|$|R

30|$|The second {{method is}} based on using the fixed point {{algorithm}} in Section 2.5. 2 in a feedback loop as described in Section 2.6. 2. In [10] we compared an eigenvalue correction method based <b>on</b> bootstrapping <b>with</b> <b>our</b> implementation of the method developed by Karoui. In the next experiment we repeat the comparison but we also include the iterative feedback algorithm.|$|R
60|$|We went <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> apples. For one thing, we {{were not}} wanted; for another, there was no fire in the little parlour, and the gentlemen both seemed to be enjoying the bright one that was burning on the hearth.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I have {{no means}} except a small {{allowance}} {{which is so}} tied up that it's difficult to borrow anything on it; but it's at your disposal, {{as far as it}} goes. Suppose we keep <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> prospecting." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} generalize {{the work of}} Régis Dupont for {{computing}} modular polynomials in dimension 2 to new invariants. We describe an algorithm to compute modular polynomials for invariants derived from theta constants and prove under some heuristics that this algorithm is quasi-linear in its output size. Some properties of the modular polynomials defined from quotients of theta constants are analyzed. We report <b>on</b> experiments <b>with</b> <b>our</b> implementation...|$|R
