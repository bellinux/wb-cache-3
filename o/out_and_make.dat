A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic.

25|$|The North Carolina Sounds occupy most of {{the coast}} from Cape Lookout (North Carolina) to the Virginia border. With their eastern borders marked by the Outer Banks, they were almost ideally located for raiding Northern {{maritime}} commerce. Cape Hatteras, the easternmost point in the Confederacy, is {{within sight of the}} Gulf Stream, which moves at a speed of about 3 knots (1.5m/s) at this latitude. Ships in the Caribbean trade would reduce the time of their homeward journeys to New York, Philadelphia, or Boston by riding the stream to the north. Raiders, either privateers or state-owned vessels, could lie inside, protected from both the weather and from Yankee blockaders, until an undefended victim appeared. Watchers stationed at the Hatteras lighthouse would then signal a raider, which would dash <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a capture, often being able to return the same day.|$|E

25|$|The band {{maintained}} a 120-piece block into the 1970s, when director Paul Droste expanded the band first to 160, {{and then to}} 192 members by adding another row of Sousaphones, creating a full row of snare drums, and adding tenor duo-toms to the row of bass drums and cymbals. Women were admitted into the band starting in 1973, {{after the passage of}} the 1972 Title IX legislation. Today, approximately 20–25% of the band's members are women each year. By the mid-1970s, a limitation on the maximum number of years one could be in the Marching Band was imposed. Prior to this, there were people who had spent nearly a decade playing and marching with the band. Some of these band members were gainfully employed graduates of the university, who would continue to pay fees to try out for band. A decision was reached to limit the band to 5 years, 6 under extenuating circumstances and director approval. This allowed for more new students to try <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> the band, and also allowed for a better spirit of competition for the 225 total spots in the band.|$|E

500|$|Badmotorfinger {{has been}} {{classified}} by various critics as grunge, alternative metal, heavy metal and hard rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic {{said that the}} songwriting on the album [...] "takes a quantum leap in focus and consistency". He added, [...] "It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences, but it attacks with scientific precision." [...] Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the [...] "Heavy Metal White Album". Cornell said, [...] "I think there's songs on the new record which are almost more commercially viable because they have that memorable feel to them, and I think if anyone expected us to come <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> something more commercial than Louder Than Love, then I'm glad that they were surprised." [...] Cornell also added that the album was more representative of how the band was live. Shepherd contributed the song [...] "Somewhere" [...] and collaborated on the musical composition of several other songs on the album. Thayil said that Shepherd's contributions helped make the album [...] "faster" [...] and [...] "weirder".|$|E
500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> entertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{songs such as}} [...] "Overcome" [...] and [...] "Suffocated Love" [...] {{dealt with}} themes of [...] "sexual {{paranoia}} and male dread of intimacy", the rest of Maxinquaye explored the psychological tolls of the British recreational drug culture, which Reynolds said served as a [...] "temporary utopia" [...] for a generation of users who otherwise lacked a [...] "constructive outlet for its idealism". He felt the album's cover art, featuring rusting metal surfaces, represented the cultural decline explored in the music's themes. Tricky drew on Rastafarian ideas about end time for the record, although unlike adherents to that movement he did not disassociate himself from [...] "Babylon", or the degenerate qualities of Western society, writing lyrics such as [...] "my brain thinks bomb-like/beware of our appetite" [...] on [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner". He later told Reynolds, [...] "I'm part of this fuckin' psychic pollution... It's like, I can be as greedy as you. The conditioned part of me says 'yeah, I'm gonna go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> money, I'm going to rule my own little kingdom.'" [...] Christgau deemed the album's songs [...] "audioramas of someone who's signed on {{to work for the}} wages of sin and lived to cash the check", while O'Hagan said Tricky's [...] "impressionistic prose poems" [...] were written from the deviant perspective of the urban hedonist: [...] "Maxinquaye is the sound of blunted Britain, paranoid and obsessive... This was the inner-city blues, Bristol style".|$|E
500|$|Around {{the release}} of the film, Disney {{executive}} David Hoberman was quoted, [...] "I hope Nightmare goes <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> a fortune. If it does, great.

500|$|The Beetons {{decided to}} revamp The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, {{particularly}} the fashion column, which the historian Graham Nown describes as [...] "a rather drab piece". They travelled to Paris in March 1860 to meet Adolphe Goubaud, {{the publisher of}} the French magazine Le Moniteur de la Mode. The magazine carried a full-sized dress pattern outlined on a fold-out piece of paper for users to cut <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> their own dresses. The Beetons came to an agreement with Goubaud for the Frenchman to provide patterns and illustrations for their magazine. The first edition to carry the new feature appeared on 1 May, six weeks after the couple returned from Paris. For the redesigned magazine, Samuel was joined as editor by Isabella, who was described as [...] "Editress". As well as being co-editors, the couple were also equal partners. Isabella brought an efficiency and strong business acumen to Samuel's normally disorganised and financially wasteful approach. She joined her husband at work, travelling daily by train to the office, where her presence caused a stir among commuters, most of whom were male. In June 1860 Isabella and Samuel travelled to Killarney, Ireland, for a fortnight's holiday, leaving their son at home with his nurse. The Beetons enjoyed the sightseeing, although on the days it rained, they stayed inside their hotel and worked on the next edition of The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. Isabella was impressed with the food they were served, and wrote in her diary that the dinners were [...] "conducted in quite the French style".|$|E
