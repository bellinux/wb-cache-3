40|$|AbstractAn {{oriented}} graph G→ {{is said to}} have an efficient dominating set S if S is a set of vertices of G→ and for each vertex v of G→, either v is in S and v is adjacent to no other vertex in S, or v is not in S but is adjacent from precisely one vertex of S. Not every {{oriented graph}} has an efficient dominating set and some oriented graphs may have more than one efficient dominating set. Barkauskas and Host [Finding efficient dominating sets in oriented graphs, Congr. Numer. 98 (1993) 27 – 32] showed that the problem of determining whether or not an oriented graph has an efficient dominating set is NP-complete. For a tree T, each orientation of T can give rise to at most one efficient dominating set. Yue [The number of efficient dominating sets in <b>oriented</b> <b>trees,</b> to appear] determined the number of efficient dominating sets among all unlabeled <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> of order p for each p up to 150, and the asymptotic behavior for the number of efficient dominating sets in unlabeled <b>oriented</b> <b>trees.</b> In this paper, combinatorial enumeration techniques are used to derive the exact formulas for the number of efficient dominating sets among all labeled rooted <b>oriented</b> <b>trees.</b> These formulas are used to find the number of efficient dominating sets among all labeled rooted <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> of order p for each p up to 45. Finally, the asymptotic formulas for the number of efficient dominating sets among all labeled rooted <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> are also determined...|$|R

40|$|Min {{ordering}} of a digraph $H$ {{plays an important}} role in deciding the existence of a list homomorphism to $H$. For reflexive <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> $T$, there exists a concrete forbidden induced subgraph characterization to have a min ordering. For irreflexive <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> $T$, the existence of a min-ordering turned out to be somewhat harder, as there are many types of obstructions to its existence. In this thesis, we first review the existing results for list homomorphism problems $LHOM(H) $ for digraphs and graphs. Second, for a specific subclass of irreflexive <b>oriented</b> <b>trees,</b> we present a concrete forbidden induced subgraph characterization to have a min ordering and to have an obstruction called invertible pair ($I$-$pair$) and digraph asteroidal triple ($DAT$). Moreover, for this subclass of irreflexive <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> $T$, we show that if $T$ contains one of the forbidden obstructions, then the problem $LHOM(T) $ is $NP$-complete, and is polynomial otherwise.

40|$|Digraphs H {{for which}} the list {{homomorphism}} problem with template H (LHOM(H)) is in logspace (L) was characterized by Egri et al. (SODA 2014) : LHOM(H) is in L {{if and only if}} H does not contain a circular N (assuming L is different from NL). Undirected graphs for which LHOM(H) is in L can be characterized in terms forbidden induced subgraphs, and also via a simple inductive construction (Egri et al., STACS 2010). As a consequence, the logspace algorithm in the undirected case is simple and easy to understand. No such forbidden subgraph or inductive characterization, and no such simple and easy-to-understand algorithm is known in the case of digraphs. In this paper, in the case of <b>oriented</b> <b>trees,</b> we refine and strengthen the results of Egri et al.

40|$|Abstract. For a digraph H, the Constraint Satisfaction Problem with {{template}} H, or CSP(H), is {{the problem}} of deciding whether a given input digraph G admits a homomorphism to H. The CSP dichotomy conjecture of Feder and Vardi states that for any digraph H, CSP(H) is either in P or NP-complete. Barto, Kozik, Maróti and Niven (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc, 2009) confirmed the conjecture for a class of <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> called special triads. We generalize this result, establishing the dichotomy for a class of <b>oriented</b> <b>trees</b> which we call special polyads.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} four optimization problems that generalize the well-known subset sum problem. Given a node-weighted digraph, select {{a subset of}} vertices whose total weight does not exceed a given budget. Some additional constraints need to be satisfied. The (weak resp.) digraph constraint imposes that if (all incoming nodes of resp.) a node $x$ belongs to the solution, then the latter comprises all its outgoing nodes (node $x$ itself resp.). The maximality constraint ensures that a solution cannot be extended without violating the budget or the (weak) digraph constraint.

This is a generalisation of a similar result for directed paths by Chvátal and by Gyárfás and Lehel, and answers a question of Yuster. In general, it is tight up to a constant factor.
