This is based on the overall vein structure and small uniformly sized teeth, although it is the only Tertiary member of section Macrantha to be unlobed.|$|E

However the numerous teeth {{and structure of the}} areolar venation are very similar to the modern species A. spicatum. [...] Wolfe and Tanai note that the apparent two-lobed structure may be an aberration and A. alaskense may have typically been three-lobed.|$|E
