Beyond Washington, the three trains then operated separately, with several additional Washington-to-Chicago Pullman sleeping cars {{added to the}} Capitol Limited, along with a twin-unit dining car, two Strata-Dome dome cars, club car, and a flat-end <b>observation</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

25|$|June 8, 1941: A second {{lightweight}} train {{consisting of}} six coaches, a baggage-mail car, a tavern lunch-counter car, and a round-end <b>observation</b> <b>car</b> {{is added to}} the line.

25|$|The sitting car {{compartment}} style accommodation {{offered by}} the Spirit of Progress, while exceptionally comfortable by 1937 standards for a 3¾ hour journey to Albury, was less than luxurious by 1962 standards for a 13¾ hour overnight journey to Sydney. Key features of the original Spirit of Progress consist, including the dining car and <b>observation</b> <b>car,</b> {{were not included in}} the new standard gauge service, decreasing its amenity and prestige.|$|E
25|$|The El Capitan {{debuted in}} February 1938 with two all-lightweight {{consists}} manufactured by the Budd Company. Each included a baggage-dormitory-coach, two coaches, a lunch counter-dining car, and coach-observation car. The baggage-dormitory-coach {{had a small}} baggage area forward, followed by bunks for the train's crew and 32 coach seats. Both coaches seated 52 and featured men's and women's restrooms at opposite ends. In the <b>observation</b> <b>car</b> the restrooms were located forward, followed by 50 coach seats. During periods of high demand additional cars were added from the Scouts pool. The Santa Fe also employed its experimental pendulum car.|$|E

50|$|The <b>observation</b> <b>cars</b> had a {{distinctive}} 'beaver tail' shape. They ran {{in this form}} until the Second World War when the train's coaches were put in store. In 1948 various vehicles returned to service as general passenger stock, but they never ran as a full set again - the <b>observation</b> <b>cars</b> were transferred to the West Highland line in 1956. Their original observation end was found to give limited views, so British Railways rebuilt them with a more angled end and added larger windows, running in this form from 1959 to 1968. Both the <b>observation</b> <b>cars</b> have survived and are being restored by Railway Vehicle Preservations Ltd, which intends to restore one to its original condition, the other as rebuilt.|$|R
25|$|After Dietrichson breaks his leg, Phyllis {{drives him}} {{to the train station}} for his trip to Palo Alto for a college reunion. Neff is hiding in the {{backseat}} and kills Dietrichson when Phyllis turns onto a deserted side street. Then, Neff boards the train posing as Dietrichson and using his crutches. He makes his way to the last car, the <b>observation</b> <b>car,</b> and steps outside to the open platform to supposedly smoke a cigarette. A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks.|$|E
25|$|During 1996, the {{original}} TranzAlpine <b>observation</b> <b>car</b> was thoroughly overhauled and air-conditioning installed, and this car, {{along with the}} two former Lynx Express cars and the car with luggage space, were permanently assigned to this train. The backpackers' car was later replaced by the only former Southerner (later Northerner) car to escape rebuilding as a panorama car or scrapping. It was fitted with 47 of {{the same type of}} Addington seat that it had had in the mid to late 1980s, all seats facing toward the two centre tables, one {{on both sides of the}} aisle of the car, and became the new backpackers' car. The former Connoisseur car, thoroughly refurbished the year before with air conditioning installed, assumed regular duty. The Lynx Express baggage van and later the first of the NIMT baggage vans were also allocated to this service. Later, the second backpacker car had air conditioning installed, and in late 2003, was transferred north for the Overlander or Wairarapa Connection'.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} was a [...] presidential odyssey. In a personal {{appeal to the}} nation, Truman crisscrossed the U.S. by train; his [...] "whistle stop" [...] speeches from the rear platform of the <b>observation</b> <b>car,</b> Ferdinand Magellan, came to represent his campaign. His combative appearances, such as those at the town square of Harrisburg, Illinois, captured the popular imagination and drew huge crowds. Six stops in Michigan drew a combined half-million people; a full million turned out for a New York City ticker-tape parade.|$|E

500|$|Between 1937 and 1958, the Royal Blue was {{equipped}} with air-conditioned coaches, parlor cars with private drawing rooms, a lounge car for coach passengers, a full dining car serving complete meals, and a flat-end <b>observation</b> <b>car</b> with a [...] "cafe-lounge" [...] {{bringing up the rear}} of the train. Beginning in mid-August 1947, onboard telephone service was provided, making the B (along with the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad) one of the first three railroads in the U.S. to offer telephone service on its trains, using a forerunner of cell phone technology.|$|E
500|$|Also {{introduced}} was a twin-unit {{dining car}} and a mid-train lounge car, such as Harbor Rest, [...] described by a PRR brochure as [...] "cheerful, spacious ... richly appointed for leisure with deep, soft carpets ... latest periodicals are in the libraries." [...] The February 1956 Official Guide listed the westbound Broadway Limited (train 29) consist as having fourteen cars normally assigned: nine sleeping cars between New York and Chicago, one additional sleeping car from New York continuing through to Los Angeles on the Santa Fe's Super Chief, the twin-unit dining car, lounge car, and <b>observation</b> <b>car.</b> The train departed New York at 6:00p.m. Eastern Standard Time and arrived at Chicago the following morning at 9:00a.m. Central Time.|$|E
500|$|The train's {{engineer}} {{sat in a}} small compartment in {{the nose}} of the train, {{directly in front of the}} prime mover.

The third and final carbody in the train, as originally built, was configured as half coach (40-passenger seats) and half <b>observation</b> <b>car</b> (12 passenger seats). As built, the train had 72 seats and could carry 50,000 pounds (22.7 tonnes) of baggage and express freight. This train's official christening occurred on April 18, 1934, at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|The Pennsylvania Special {{was one of}} nine express trains the Pennsylvania {{operated}} between New York City and Chicago. On November 14, 1912 the Pennsylvania renamed it the Broadway Limited, {{to avoid}} confusion with the similarly-named Pennsylvania Limited. The name, though spelled as [...] "Broadway", honored the Pennsylvania's four-track [...] "broad way" [...] main line. In the heavyweight era the Broadway Limited was an extra-fare, all sleeper (no coach service) train with an open-platform <b>observation</b> <b>car</b> at the end, such as Continental Hall and Washington Hall. The scheduled running time was 20 hours until it was reduced to 18 hours in 1932. Further reductions took place between 1932 and 1935, with the final heavyweight running time at 16 hours, 30 minutes.|$|E
