50|$|Administrative {{data are}} small data {{and are a}} type of big data. They are {{collected}} by governments or other organizations for non-statistical reasons to provide <b>overviews</b> <b>on</b> registration, transactions, and record keeping. They evaluate part of the output of administrating a program. Birth and death records, regulating the crossing of people and goods over borders, pensions, and taxation are examples of administrative data. These type of data are used to produce management information, like registration data in a cost effective way. This enables administration data, when turned into indicators, to show trends over time and reflect real world information. The management of this information includes the Internet, software, technology, telecommunications, databases and management systems, system development methods, information systems, etc. Managing {{the resources of the}} public sector is a complex routine. It begins with the collection of data, then goes through the hardware and software that stores, manipulates, and transforms the data. Public polices then are addressed, including organizational policies and procedures.|$|E
