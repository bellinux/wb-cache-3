2500|$|Wallenda {{says that}} the high-wire {{performance}} is not a daredevil act or a mere stunt, but rather an athletic feat requiring great physical training. [...] "I see a stunt as somebody who gets in a barrel and goes over the edge and hopes they don't hit a rock," [...] he said commenting on his walk across Niagara Falls. [...] "What I do is very calculated. I train {{a long time for}} it and I consider it more of an art. I guess I don't get offended by [...] calling it a stunt, but to me it's more of an art than anything." [...] He aims to be [...] "over-prepared" [...] for every event he does, training six hours a day, six days a week. He does ten hours of weight training and five hours <b>of</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercise</b> each week. [...] Even so, he says wire walking is primarily a mental skill.|$|E

In this randomized control trial, we examined the effect <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> <b>exercise</b> on SE among female adolescents living with no natural family. Materials and Methods. The sample consisted of all female adolescents aged 13 to 19 years (n: 72) who were covered by Isfahan Welfare organization. Participants were assigned into intervention and control groups by matched random sampling. Intervention included 8 weeks <b>of</b> <b>aerobics</b> <b>exercise.</b> Coppersmith SE inventory was administered before and after intervention as well as after one month follow-up. Results. No significant difference was seen between pre-SE scores of intervention (32. 7 ± 8. 4) and control (33. 0 ± 6. 7) groups (t=. 16, P=. 87). A significant difference was obtained in post-SE scores (40. 2 ± 5. 7 versus 34. 7 ± 6. 8, t= 3. 58, P=. 001) and in one month follow-up scores (36. 4 ± 5. 2 versus 33. 0 ± 5. 2, t= 2. 25, P=. 03).
