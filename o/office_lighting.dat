40|$|Purpose: The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) {{recommends}} {{researchers to}} investigate {{a wide variety of}} behavioural and health outcomes. However, researchers often investigate only a part of occupational health (OH) in relation to light. A literature study (2002 – 2017) regarding the relationship between <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions and OH was performed to identify gaps and methodological issues. Method: The OH outcomes investigated in this paper were grouped according to the International Classification of Diseases and analysed per category: physical and physiological health, mental health, eye health, sleep parameters and visual comfort. Results: Findings from the literature study (20 eligible papers) showed that all OH aspects were mostly but not exclusively measured subjectively. Furthermore, most studies investigated only a fraction of <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> parameters and OH aspects. Conclusions: It seems that Correlated Colour Temperature (CCT) and illuminance mainly correlate with OH. However, this may also be explained by gaps and methodological issues in studies described in eligible papers. Based on the literature study, an overview was composed elucidating gaps and methodological issues of <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> and OH studies.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were to explore {{different approaches to}} improve energy efficiency and colour quality, {{and to find out}} the subjective preference of LED <b>office</b> <b>lighting.</b> Four approaches (optimization of LED spectra, lighting retrofitting, hue-heat hypothesis, and smart indoor lighting control) were studied for energy efficiency and colour quality improvement. Two experiments, one in lighting booths and the other in an office room, were conducted to examine subjective preferences. In the optimization of LED spectra, simulation work and subjective preference studies conducted in lighting booths suggested that preferred complex LED spectra (realized with 9 to 11 different types of LEDs) found in previous user acceptance studies can be optimized both for efficiency and cost without sacrificing the colour quality of the light. The lighting retrofitting case study showed that by replacing T 8 fluorescent luminaires with LED luminaries, and the LED luminaries with inbuilt control systems, energy savings of up to 38 % and 68 % respectively, can be achieved with improvement of lighting quality and user satisfaction. The experiment conducted to test the hue-heat hypothesis using different correlated colour temperatures (CCTs) of white light did not provide support for the existence of a general correlation between CCT and thermal sensation or thermal comfort and indicated that people felt thermally more comfortable in an indoor workplace at the CCT of 4000 K than at the CCT of 2700 K or 6200 K. A methodology to incorporate data from lighting studies relating colour quality to comfort and productivity to the building automation system has been proposed and demonstrated. The subjective preferences in terms of illuminance and CCT and the CCT preference of three ethnic groups (Asian, European, and African) for LED <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> were investigated in an office room. Nine different lighting situations (combining 300 lx, 500 lx, and 750 lx with 3000 K, 4000 K, and 5000 K) were compared. The combination of 750 lx with 4000 K was statistically significantly preferred over the other combinations for LED <b>office</b> <b>lighting.</b> It was also found that the CCT of 4000 K was preferred over the CCT of 3000 K for <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> at 300 lx, 500 lx, and 750 lx. The results indicated that the impression of brightness, the feeling of stimulation, and the impression of spaciousness in office room increases with increased CCT. The study also showed that for <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> the European group prefer the CCT of 4000 K, and with the Asian and African groups the preference between 4000 K and 5000 K depends upon illuminance levels...|$|E

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the optimal <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> use with different types of lighting controls to achieve energy savings and provide visual comfort for individuals. Design/methodology/approach– A case study and field measurements were carried out in 18 single-occupancy offices in Sweden where six different lighting controls were investigated. Occupancy and daylight hours were key issues for determining the lighting use. For each office, occupancy patterns, use of a ceiling luminaire, energy usage and perceptions of <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> in the spring-summer and autumn-winter were established. Findings– The use of luminaires varied among the occupants and could be habitual. Though the study yielded positive results concerning the potential for manual or daylight dimming with occupancy switch-off controls to increase optimal lighting use, combining dimming controls with manual on/off controls is rather effective if occupants generally sit in their offices most of the day. Research limitations/implications– Precise comparisons of the performances of the different controls were limited due to the offices’ different window orientations; thus, measurements in identical offices are desirable. The small sample size limited analyses of lighting use and the personal perceptions of lighting quality. Practical implications– Apart from the contribution to simulation techniques, the findings imply that <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> controls should be selected taking individuals’ behavioural patterns and perceived lighting quality into consideration. Originality/value– This paper describes an approach to determine the use of lighting controls and provides a basis for establishing optimal lighting use for individuals with regard to occupancy and daylight availability...|$|E

40|$|Two mock-up office rooms, {{one with}} a spectrally {{tuneable}} LED lighting system {{and the other with}} a fluorescent lamp (FL) lighting system were built for user acceptance studies for <b>office</b> <b>lighting.</b> One room was illuminated with six LED luminaires and the other with six FL luminaires. Each LED luminaire has 480 LEDs (20 different LED types and 24 of each type). Each FL luminaire has eight fluorescent lamps, four with a correlated colour temperature of 4000 K and four of 6500 K. User acceptance studies in the office environments were conducted with 40 observers, each observer having 16 sessions (six LED spectral power distributions (SPDs) þ two FL SPDs and two illuminances (500 lux and 300 lux)). The observers performed office-related tasks while being totally immersed in one of these lighting conditions. The objective {{of this study was to}} verify previous results obtained in small-scale booth experiments and to further study peoples’ preferences for LED <b>office</b> <b>lighting.</b> The small-scale experiments showed that LEDs with a higher value of reference-based colour metrics (such as colour quality scale (CQS) colour preference scale) and with a higher value of area-based or volume-based metrics (such as CQS gamut area scale or gamut area index) were preferred by the observers. The office room study of the present work validated the findings of the earlier experiments but now in an <b>office</b> <b>lighting</b> environment. Furthermore, the observers preferred 4000 K to 6500 K at a light level of 500 lux and the light level of 500 lux over 300 lux.
