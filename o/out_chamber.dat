40|$|The new {{synchrotron}} radiation facility of the MAX IV Laboratory {{is under construction}} and expected to deliver the first light beam in 2016. To cope with the small aperture, the intense photon bombardment and the low-pressure requirement, most of the beam pipes for the 3 -GeV ring {{are going to be}} coated with Ti-Zr-V non-evaporable getter (NEG) thin films. To take advantage from the experience acquired during the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a collaboration between CERN and MAX IV Laboratory has been set up. The choice of the extruded Cu tubes, the preliminary surface treatments, the coating configuration and the performance validation of the small-diameter vacuum chambers have been addressed. In parallel, an intense development has been tackled at CERN for the coating of vacuum chambers where photon and electron beams circulate in separate pipes. The most important results of the collaboration are presented and future perspectives pointed <b>out.</b> <b>CHAMBER</b> DESIGN In order to meet specific requirements, most of the vacuum chambers for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring are small aperture tubes manufactured from Oxygen Free copper with addition of Silver (OFS). The tubes were extruded with two different internal diameters: 22 and 27 mm with 1 mm wall thickness. After the extrusion process they were cut in 3 m and 4 m long pieces respectively. Most of the vacuum chambers are bent by 1. 5 or 3 degrees with 19 m bending radius whereas a few vessels employ an antechamber of small vertical aperture to allow for extraction of the {{synchrotron radiation}} to the beamlines [1]. All the chambers are foreseen to be NEG-coated. Due to their novel geometry, this is a challenging process that required validation. All needed trials and measurements were performed at CERN...|$|E

Many bats roost alone, using small cavities in the wood, but colonies of {{over a hundred}} individuals are not uncommon. Although they generally use natural cavities or crevices, they have also been reported to chew out burrows within the wood using their sharp incisor teeth. Such burrows consist of hollowed <b>out</b> <b>chambers</b> connected by narrow tunnels up to several metres in length. They typically spend {{only a few weeks}} at any given roosting site, before moving on, although individual roosts may be reused repeatedly {{over the course of several}} decades.|$|R

That son grows up as Tom Driscoll, while the real Tom grows up as the slave known as Chambers. Rowena Cooper comes from the North and falls in love with Chambers. Chambers is accused of murder and the eccentric lawyer Pudd'nhead Wilson looks for details. He uses fingerprints to uncover the real killer, but during his investigation he figures <b>out</b> <b>Chambers</b> and Tom were switched as infants.|$|R
