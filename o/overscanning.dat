This feature allowed for the image being displayed on the television screen to be zoomed into, by <b>overscanning</b> the raster of the CRT so that {{the middle of the}} image would be displayed.|$|E
50|$|Virtually all {{the designs}} and {{patterns}} on the card have some significance. Along the top (see above) are 95% saturation colour-bars in descending order of luminance—white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, blue and black. There are triangles {{on each of the}} four sides of the card to check for correct <b>overscanning</b> of the picture. Standard greyscale and frequency response tests are found on the left and right respectively of the central picture. On the updated Test Card J, the X on the noughts-and-crosses board is an indicator for aligning the centre of the screen.|$|E
50|$|Different {{video and}} {{broadcast}} television systems require differing amounts of <b>overscan.</b> Most figures serve as recommendations or typical summaries, as {{the nature of}} <b>overscan</b> is to overcome a variable limitation in older technologies such as cathode ray tubes.|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of the bias frame of the STIS SITe 1024 x 1024 CCD, including its serial and parallel <b>overscan</b> regions, are described. <b>Overscan</b> regions are listed for all supported binning factors. There are {{significant differences in the}} (2 -D) behavior of the bias level in the sensitive region of the STIS CCD with respect to that found in the serial and parallel <b>overscan</b> regions, resulting in the necessity of an additional 2 -D zero level correction. Flat fields taken with the (operational) amplifier D show an amplifier non-linearity: the bias level of a given row is found to be dependent on the signal in that row. Analysis of the right-hand side <b>overscan</b> region of flat field images shows that the bias value is depressed with respect to the nominal bias value by an amount proportional to the mean signal in the row. The dependence on signal level depends on the binning in the X direction of the CCD. The maximum dependence is found in the case of unbinned data, where the <b>overscan</b> bias level is depressed by 1 electron per (average) row signal of roughly 1380 electrons. For the majority of science observations, we recommend to perform <b>overscan</b> subtraction by a smooth, low-order fit to the bias level in the left-hand serial <b>overscan.</b> Such a fit will be insensitive to the “depression problem”, since only a few rows will be affected in case of scientific observations. Observers will be able to estimate the effect of the “depression problem ” from the parallel (virtual) <b>overscan</b> in raw, full-frame CCD images...|$|R

50|$|Some Professional video {{broadcast}} monitors display information on screen, the current video signal format, {{they might be}} receiving i.e.: standard definition formats like 576i, 480i or high definition formats like 720p or 1080p. They also have mechanical buttons to toggle common aspect ratios like (4:3 or 16:9), and underscanning or <b>overscanning</b> a picture to see lines in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of video, and check if subtitles in VBI were inserted properly or not. Modern broadcast grade professional monitors also have safe area grid generators, to help position television graphics, lower thirds, within their respective areas i.e. graphics safe, title safe or action safe.|$|E
40|$|Overranging or <b>overscanning</b> {{increases}} the dose delivered to patients undergoing helical Computed Tomography examinations. In {{order to reduce}} it, nowadays most of the multidetector tomographs close the X-ray beam aperture at the scan extremes. This technical innovation, usually referred to as dynamic or adaptive collimation, also influences the overranging assessment methods. In particular, the film free approach proposed in previous studies is not suitable for these modern tomographs. The present study aims to introduce a new method of estimating overranging with real time dosimetry, even suitable for tomographs equipped with adaptive collimation. The approach proposed {{is very easy to}} implement and time saving because only a pencil chamber is required. It is also equivalent in precision and in accuracy to the film based one, considered an absolute benchmark. Comment: 5 figures, 3 table...|$|E
40|$|Noninvasive {{coronary}} angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure {{associated with this}} technique, however, is high and concerns in {{the widespread use of}} CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of {{coronary angiography}} using 320 -row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive <b>overscanning</b> and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320 -row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320 -row CT. Noteworthy, 320 -row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320 -row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320 -row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320 -row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320 -row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0. 001, R = 0. 81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (− 3. 1 ± 24. 4 %; P = 0. 08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3. 1 ± 2. 3 vs. 6. 5 ± 4. 2 mSv; P < 0. 05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 ± 51 vs. 65 ± 42 ml, P < 0. 05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320 -row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy...|$|E
50|$|The {{vertical}} display resolutions for HAM8 are {{the same}} as for HAM6. The horizontal resolution can be 320 (360 with <b>overscan)</b> as before, doubled to 640 (720 with <b>overscan)</b> or even quadrupled to 1280 pixels (1440 with <b>overscan).</b> The AGA chipset also introduced even higher resolutions for the traditional planar display modes.

Microsoft's HOS uses the horizontal <b>overscan</b> instead of the vertical to transmit low-speed program-associated data at 6.4 kbit/s, which is slow enough to be recorded on a VCR without data corruption.

50|$|Critics often {{argue that}} windowboxing of this ratio is {{unnecessary}} {{due to the}} image loss caused by <b>overscan</b> being negligible.

40|$|Developments in {{additive}} manufacturing technology are serving {{to expand the}} potential applications. Critical developments are required in the supporting areas of measurement and in process inspection to achieve this. CM 247 LC is a nickel superalloy that is of interest for use in aerospace and civil power plants. However, {{it is difficult to}} process via selective laser melting (SLM) as it suffers from cracking during rapid cooling and solidification. This limits the viability of CM 247 LC parts created using SLM. To quantify part integrity, spatially resolved acoustic spectroscopy (SRAS) has been identified as a viable non-destructive evaluation technique. In this study, a combination of optical microscopy and SRAS was used to identify and classify the surface defects present in SLM-produced parts. By analysing the datasets and scan trajectories, it is possible to correlate morphological information with process parameters. Image processing was used to quantify porosity and cracking for bulk density measurement. Analysis of surface acoustic wave data showed that an error in manufacture {{in the form of an}} <b>overscan</b> occurred. Comparing areas affected by <b>overscan</b> with a bulk material, a change in defect density from 1. 17 % in the bulk material to 5. 32 % in the <b>overscan</b> regions was observed, highlighting the need to reduce <b>overscan</b> areas in manufacture...|$|R
