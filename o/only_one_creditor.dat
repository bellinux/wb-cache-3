40|$|The-trustee in {{bankruptcy}} may have occasion to recover money or property {{for the benefit}} of the creditors of the bankrupt, either upon the ground that the property was transferred, or the money paid, in fraud of creditors or that the same constituted a preference of <b>one</b> <b>creditor</b> over the others. There are three sections of the Bankruptcy Act 2 ̆ 7 pertinent to these problems. Section 60 provides for the recovery of preferences obtained by <b>one</b> <b>creditor</b> within the next preceding four months from the filing of the petition {{in bankruptcy}}. The theory here, of course, is to distribute the assets of the bankrupt equitably among all the creditors rather than to permit <b>one</b> <b>creditor</b> to obtain a greater share than his fellows. The recovery is supposed to be allowed solely by reason of the principle of equitable distribution. However, if the creditor can show that upon reasonable grounds he was ignorant of the fact that a preference would be effected at the time he received the preference, he will not be liable therefor. This is a practical compromise, to avoid embarrassing and unfair results to a creditor who has taken what he thought he was entitled to take, in payment of a bona fide debt and in ignorance of the fact that other creditors would not obtain payment of their claims...|$|R

2500|$|The Insolvency Act 1986 section 238 only catches {{depletion}} of a company's total assets, {{rather than simply}} preferring <b>one</b> <b>creditor</b> {{at the expense of}} others. To deal with this issue, section 239 allow avoidance preferences that entail a [...] "desire to prefer" [...] <b>one</b> <b>creditor</b> over another. This test is hard to fulfill. In Re MC Bacon Ltd, a company gave a floating charge to Natwest bank in return for a continued overdraft as its business declined. Millett J held the company had not desired to prefer the bank. It had no special affection for its bank, and only agreed to the charge to prolong survival of the business. By contrast, in Re Agriplant Services Ltd Jonathan Parker J held it was an unlawful preference for Agriplant Services Ltd to pay £20,000 due on a leasing contract for earth moving equipment to a company. This was mainly because Agriplant's major shareholder Mr Sagar, had guaranteed that Agriplant's liability, and so repayment absolved Mr Sagar's liabilities above other creditors. Similarly in Re Conegrade Ltd, the Lloyd J held that when two directors of a small engineering company caused the company to sell them a property for £125,000, to then be leased back to Conegrade Ltd, the dominant purpose must have been to give them as creditors a preference over others. Thus, it was void.|$|R

50|$|Debt is {{a problem}} if the {{interest}} payments are greater than the debtor can afford. Debt consolidation typically involves borrowing from one lender (typically a bank), {{at a low rate}} of interest, sufficient funds to repay a number of higher interest rate debts (such as credit cards). By consolidating debts, the debtor replaces many payments to many different <b>creditors</b> with <b>one</b> monthly payment to <b>one</b> <b>creditor,</b> thereby simplifying their monthly budget. In addition, the lower interest rate means that more of the debtor's monthly payment is applied against the principal of the loan, resulting in faster debt repayment. It may be necessary to have a co-signor or other security, such as a car, if the borrower's credit is not sufficient on their own.|$|R
