5|$|Supplies and {{materials}} {{of all kinds}} poured in: 2,157 carloads of electrical equipment, 1,219 of heavy equipment, 5,389 of lumber, 1,407 of pipe and fittings, 1,188 of steel, 257 of valves, and 11 of welding electrodes. The racetracks required 85,000 vacuum tubes. Where possible, <b>off-the-shelf</b> components were used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique. Two purchasing departments were established, one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment, and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies.|$|E
5|$|To {{keep costs}} down while {{ensuring}} sufficient longevity, Sega opted to create the platform from popular <b>off-the-shelf</b> components. The first model to be developed was actually the SC-3000, a computer version with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial <b>off-the-shelf</b> computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some <b>off-the-shelf</b> standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) {{drafted a}} Qualitative Material Requirement (QMR) for an interim, {{commercial}} <b>off-the-shelf</b> (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) cruise speed and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army could determine the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial <b>off-the-shelf</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} operational {{capability of the}} E-3 radars' electronic countermeasures, and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with <b>off-the-shelf</b> digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{parliament}} first authorized approximately 871million Swiss francs {{to build}} 100Mirage IIIS under license. But this procurement was soon crushed under massive budget overruns {{and the government}} asked for an additional CHF 576million. The cost overruns {{were the result of}} fitting U.S. electronics to the French platform, installing hardpoints for moving the aircraft inside of the caverns by cranes, structural reinforcements for jet-assisted takeoffs, and other extras to improve the <b>off-the-shelf</b> Mirage IIIC. The wish to procure the Mirage IIIS was also boosted by the possibility that the Swiss could acquire aircraft-delivered nuclear weapons, either from France or by producing them themselves.|$|E
5|$|As part of Lockheed's submission, {{the firm}} offered a formal {{guarantee}} of a 20 per cent workshare on all future export sales of its Orion 2000 while simultaneously lobbying for the United States Navy to also procure the type. Loral {{stated that it}} believed that its bid to refurbish stored P-3s was the most cost-effective submission; however, there was public controversy over whether Loral possessed the necessary technical information on the airframe, claims to which Loral strongly refuted. In May 1996, {{it was reported that}} bidders were considering self-funding their own early development costs in order to compensate for alleged funding shortfalls within the MoD's procurement budget; it was claimed that these funding shortfalls were due to differences between the original specification, which had envisioned as an <b>off-the-shelf</b> procurement without much in terms of development, and the increasingly extensive nature that the programme had progressively taken on.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{doubled the}} Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit to 3litres for the 1966 season and suitable engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm Repco, {{which had never}} produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 engine blocks from the defunct American Oldsmobile F85 road car project, and other <b>off-the-shelf</b> parts. Consulting and design engineer Phil Irving (of Vincent Motorcycle fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive, but the light and reliable cars ran at the front {{from the start of}} the season. At the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux, Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former teammate, Bruce McLaren, has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name (cf Surtees, Hill and Fittipaldi Automotive). In 1967, the title went to Brabham's teammate, New Zealander Denny Hulme. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Brabham's desire to try new parts first. The Brabham team took the Constructors' World Championship in both years.|$|E

25|$|Ajeya MK1 – Indian {{version of}} the T-72M1. In {{parallel}} with buying various T-72M <b>off-the-shelf</b> from the Soviet Union, India also launched production at a domestic heavy engineering plant in Avadi.|$|E
25|$|It {{was first}} tested {{standalone}} {{and then as}} the primary of a two-stage thermonuclear device during Operation Redwing. It was weaponized as the Robin primary {{and became the first}} <b>off-the-shelf,</b> multi-use primary, and the prototype for all that followed.|$|E
25|$|Seven <b>off-the-shelf</b> {{civilian}} lightplanes {{were tested}} at Eglin AFB in 1966 {{to fulfill the}} forward air control (FAC) mission as replacements the Cessna O-1 Bird Dog, with the Cessna 337 Super Skymaster selected to fulfill the mission.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{delays and}} growth in program costs forced its {{cancellation}} on 16 October 2008, when the Department of Defense failed to certify {{the program to}} Congress. The ARH-70 was touted as having been built with <b>off-the-shelf</b> technology, the airframe being based on the Bell 407.|$|E
25|$|High-speed {{multimedia}} radio (HSMM) is {{the implementation}} of wireless data networks over amateur radio frequencies using commercial <b>off-the-shelf</b> (COTS) hardware such as 802.11 access points. Only licensed amateur radio operators may use amplifiers and specialized antennas to increase the power and coverage of the 802.11 signal.|$|E
25|$|The {{full-duplex}} capability makes SPI {{very simple}} and efficient for single master/single slave applications. Some devices use the full-duplex mode to implement an efficient, swift data stream for {{applications such as}} digital audio, digital signal processing, or telecommunications channels, but most <b>off-the-shelf</b> chips stick to half-duplex request/response protocols.|$|E
25|$|Few {{organizations}} have a completely homogenous, seamless system environment. There is typically {{a mix of}} ERPs or multiple instances of one ERP, mainframe systems, <b>off-the-shelf</b> applications, and legacy systems—all of which may contain valuable data. Technology is available to access all of this data to gain a complete picture.|$|E
25|$|The XMQR-13A Ballistic Missile Target System (BMTS) was an unguided target rocket {{developed}} by the United States Army during the 1960s, intended {{for use in the}} development of missile defense systems. Utilising <b>off-the-shelf</b> parts in four different configurations, the BMTS was utitised in a series of launches in the late 1960s supporting tests of several missile systems.|$|E
25|$|The SETI Net station {{consists}} of <b>off-the-shelf,</b> consumer-grade electronics to minimize cost {{and to allow}} this design to be replicated as simply as possible. It has a 3-meter parabolic antenna that can be directed in azimuth and elevation, an LNA that covers the 1420MHz spectrum, a receiver to reproduce the wideband audio, and a standard personal computer as the control device and for deploying the detection algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with its}} large {{delivery}} vans, for smaller routes, the company utilizes brown-painted delivery vehicles based on <b>off-the-shelf</b> production vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect and Dodge Grand Caravan) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play {{a huge part}} in the potential profitability of package delivery companies like DHL and FedEx.|$|E
25|$|France: India and France have {{concluded}} a $8.7bn (7.8bn euros; £6.7bn) G2G agreement regarding {{the acquisition of}} Dassault Rafale fighter jets to equip the Indian Air Force. On 23 September 2016, Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian signed the contract for the <b>off-the-shelf</b> procurement of 36 Rafales in a deal which includes an option for 18 extra aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Some {{current and}} future therapy methods {{include the use of}} virtual reality and video games for {{rehabilitation}}. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating patients to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not. Many clinics and hospitals are adopting the use of these <b>off-the-shelf</b> devices for exercise, social interaction, and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home.|$|E
25|$|The MetroCard {{does have}} a {{magnetic}} stripe, but both the track offsets and the encoding differ from standard Magstripe cards. It is a proprietary format developed by the contractor Cubic. <b>Off-the-shelf</b> reader/writers for the standard cards are useless, and even hypothetically could work only with both physical and software modification. Some have had partial success decoding it using audio tape recorder heads, laptop sound cards, and custom Linux software.|$|E
25|$|Modified {{digital cameras}} can detect some ultraviolet, {{all of the}} visible {{and much of the}} near {{infrared}} spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350nm to 1000nm. An <b>off-the-shelf</b> digital camera contains an infrared hot mirror filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400nm to 700nm.|$|E
25|$|The era of {{inflation}} targeting—i.e. maintaining inflation within a band—has perhaps begun in Egypt more recently. Country experiences show that inflation targeting is a best-practice strategy for monetary policy. While the monetary policy appears {{more responsive to}} inflationary pressures recently in Egypt, {{it is noted that}} there is no core inflation measure and the Central Bank of Egypt takes targeting decisions based on the inflation rate released by the CAPMAS consumer price index <b>off-the-shelf.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are strong}} network {{effects in the}} initial choice of rail gauge, and in gauge {{conversion}} decisions. Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers usually choose a standard rail gauge so they can use <b>off-the-shelf</b> rolling stock. Although a few manufacturers make rolling stock that can adjust to different rail gauges, most manufacturers make rolling stock that only works {{with one of the}} standard rail gauges.|$|E
25|$|Technician Perspective (Tool Components) - Subcontractors {{work from}} shop plans that specify {{the details of}} parts or subsections. These {{correspond}} to the detailed specifications that are given to programmers who code individual modules without being concerned with the overall context or structure of the system. Alternatively, they could represent the detailed requirements for various commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), government <b>off-the-shelf</b> (GOTS), or components of modular systems software being procured and implemented rather than built.|$|E
25|$|The Yamaha YZ450F won the AMA Supercross Championship {{two years}} in a row, in 2008 with Chad Reed, and 2009 James Stewart. Yamaha was the first to build a {{production}} monoshock motocross bike (1975 for 250 and 400, 1976 for 125) {{and one of the first}} to have a water-cooled motocross production bike (1977 in works bikes, 1981 in <b>off-the-shelf</b> bikes). Yamaha's first Motocross competition four-stroke bike, the YZ400F, won the 1998 USA outdoor national Championship with factory rider Doug Henry.|$|E
25|$|Montres Tudor SA has designed, {{manufactured}} {{and marketed}} Tudor watches since 6 March 1946. Rolex founder Hans Wildorf conceived of the Tudor Watch Company {{to create a}} product for authorized Rolex dealers to sell that offered the reliability and dependability of a Rolex, but at a lower price. The number of Rolex watches was limited by the rate that they could produce in-house Rolex movements, thus Tudor watches were originally equipped with <b>off-the-shelf</b> movements while using similar quality cases and bracelets.|$|E
25|$|The WC {{was popular}} in the Great Depression for its good value, {{affordable}} price, and frugal design elements. Two factors that lowered its cost of manufacture, and thus its sales price, were that it was made partially from <b>off-the-shelf</b> components, and that its steel channel iron frame eliminated the need for large, heavy castings for the transmission and rear end (as were often used in tractors of the era). Its power was ample for the time and class, allowing it to pull a two-bottom plow.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the three Maritime Reconnaissance variants, two further Nimrod types were developed. The RAF operated {{a small number of}} the Nimrod R1, an electronic intelligence gathering (ELINT) variant. A dedicated airborne early warning platform, the Nimrod AEW3 was in development from late 1970s to the mid-1980s; however, much like the MRA4, considerable problems were encountered in development and thus the project was cancelled in 1986 in favour of an <b>off-the-shelf</b> solution in the Boeing E-3 Sentry. All Nimrod variants had been retired by mid-2011.|$|E
25|$|According to the BAe 146's chief designer, Bob Grigg, {{making the}} {{aircraft}} {{as easy to}} maintain as possible and keeping operators' running costs {{as low as possible}} were considered high priorities {{from the start of the}} design process. Grigg highlighted factors such as design simplicity, using <b>off-the-shelf</b> components where possible, and the internal use of firm cost targets and continuous monitoring. British Aerospace also adopted a system of cost guarantees between component suppliers and the operators of the BAe 146 in order to enforce stringent requirements.|$|E
25|$|Meyer became {{director}} when Gropius {{resigned in}} February 1928, {{and brought the}} Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings {{in the city of}} Dessau, and the Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB Trade Union School) in Bernau bei Berlin. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of <b>off-the-shelf</b> architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.|$|E
25|$|Probst {{laid out}} full {{plans for the}} Bantam prototype, known as the BRC or Bantam Reconnaissance Car, in just two days, working up a cost {{estimate}} the next. Bantam's bid was submitted, complete with blueprints, on July 22. While much of the vehicle could be assembled from <b>off-the-shelf</b> automotive parts, custom four-wheel drivetrain components were to be supplied by Spicer. The hand-built prototype was completed in Butler, Pennsylvania, and driven to Camp Holabird, Maryland, for Army testing September 21. The vehicle met all the Army's criteria except engine torque.|$|E
