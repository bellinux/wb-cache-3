5000|$|Apart {{from the}} [...] "Balance Sheet Mechanism" [...] {{described}} above, the lending channel can also dry up for reasons exogenous to the borrower’s credit worthiness. For instance, banks may become {{concerned about their}} future access to capital markets {{in the event of}} a negative shock and may engage in precautionary hoarding of funds. This would result in reduction of funds available in the economy and a slowdown in economic activity. Additionally, the fact that most financial institutions are simultaneously engaged in lending and borrowing can give rise to a Network effect. In a setting that involves multiple parties, a gridlock can occur when concerns about counterparty credit risk result in failure to cancel out <b>offsetting</b> <b>positions.</b> Each party then has to hold additional funds to protect itself against the risks that are not netted out, reducing liquidity in the market. These mechanisms may explain the ‘gridlock’ observed in the interbank lending market during the recent subprime crisis, when banks were unwilling to lend to each other and instead hoarded their reserves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There are {{two phases}} to the polar {{alignment}} problem. First one must quantify the alignment error for each axis. Once alignment error is known the mount must {{be adjusted to}} correct for this error. Often the adjustment amount must be estimated based on {{the magnitude of the}} error. This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} most mount manufacturers do not provide or calibrate the altitude and azimuth axes with high precision scales. This article will show a simple method utilizing a calculated star <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> to make the mount adjustment. The star <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> is calculated based on the known celestial coordinates of a reference star and the alignment error such that pointing the telescope at this coordinate and adjusting the mount to recenter the reference star will bring the mount into close alignment. This method is called “star <b>offset</b> <b>positioning</b> ” and should greatly reduce the amount of time to perform the alignment procedure. Overview In Measuring Polar Axis Alignment Error [1] we discussed various methods to measure the polar alignment error. If the mount were designed with encoders on the altitude and azimuth adjustment axes, or if these were calibrated with an accurate visual scale, the adjustment to th...|$|R

For example, {{changes in the}} auditory flutter rate induce changes in the apparent flicker rate of a flashing light (Shipley, 1964). In the present study, we investigated whether auditory information would affect the perceived <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object. In Experiment 1, a visual object moved {{toward the center of}} the computer screen and disappeared abruptly. A transient auditory signal was presented at different times relative to the moment when the object disappeared.

In Experiment 2, we presented the transient auditory signal to either the left or the right ear. The results showed that the perceived offset shifted backward more strongly when the auditory signal was presented to the same side from which the moving object originated. In Experiment 3, we found that the perceived timing of the visual offset was not affected by the spatial relation between the auditory signal and the visual offset. The present results are interpreted as indicating that an auditory signal may influence the <b>offset</b> <b>position</b> of a moving object through both spatial and temporal processes...|$|R

40|$|Negligible pricing {{frictions}} in {{underlying asset}} markets can become greatly magnified when using no-arbitrage arguments to price derivative claims. Amplification {{occurs when a}} replicating portfolio contains partially <b>offsetting</b> <b>positions</b> that lever up exposures to primary market frictions, and can cause arbitrarily large biases in synthetic return moments. We show theoretically and empirically how synthetic dividend strips, which {{shed light on the}} pricing of risks at different horizons, are impacted by this phenomenon. Dividend strips are claims to dividends paid over future time intervals, and can be replicated by highly levered long-short positions in futures contracts written on the same underlying index, but with different maturities. We show that tiny pricing frictions can help to reproduce a downward-sloping term structure of equity risk premia, excess volatility, return predictability, and a market beta substantially below one, consistent with empirical evidence. Using more robust return measures we find smaller point estimates of the returns to shortterm dividend claims, and little support for a statistical or economic difference between the returns to short- versus long-term dividend claims...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from basic}} {{financial}} mathematics, we cover the mathematics of pricing swaptions, options on interest rate swaps. We then continue {{to the topic}} of obtaining an approximately pure volatility exposure. This exposure to volatility, which in practice enables us to trade volatility according to our perceptions of the market, is obtained by buying or selling swaptions and appropriate amounts of the underlying interest rate swap contract. Taking <b>offsetting</b> <b>positions</b> in the underlying contract is called hedging and is covered in depth. We note that hedging can primarily be done in two ways, and discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each of them. After deriving the value formulas for such a swaption strategy aimed at isolating volatility exposure we end with a discussion on the transition from theory to practice. We find that this way of trading volatility is conceptually simple, but that pre-trade profitability analysis is difficult due to the sometimes poor availability of the sophisticated data needed to simulate such a swaption strategy. Despite the possible limitations in the data necessary to translate this theory into an experimental setup, this thesis serves as a good basis for further research on the profitability of a volatility trading strategy using interest rate swaptions...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the high}} level of {{systemic}} risk in farming, crop insurance has failed to be provided by the market without government involvement. Currently, in addition to subsidy support the Federal government aids the crop insurance industry by providing reinsurance services to crop insurance companies. This means that the government will reimburse insurers for a large portion of their losses in years when indemnities to farmers are high. In exchange, portions of firms 2 ̆ 7 profits are paid to the government when indemnities are below premiums;This study measures the level of risk accepted by the government in its role as reinsurer for the crop insurance market. This is accomplished by means of a Monte Carlo simulation in which random correlated draws are made for county and farm yields. These are then used to calculate indemnity levels for the crop year.

After rapid growth, the outstanding volume of CDS fell sharply … … reflecting concerns about counterparty risks … The notional amount of outstanding credit default swaps (CDS) 2 grew rapidly from the market’s beginnings in the mid- 1990 s to a peak of almost $ 60 trillion at the end of 2007, 3 but then declined sharply to just over $ 30 trillion at the end of the first half of 2010 (Graph 1, left-hand panel). This feature argues that the decline did not occur because CDS lost some of their appeal in the light of the recent financial crisis. Indeed, trading volumes have continued to rise. New trade volumes at the major CDS dealers were almost twice as high in the first nine months of 2010 as in the same period in 2007, according to Markit.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} policy case for {{restrictions}} on the deduction of interest expense as a necessary background to {{an assessment of the}} Department of Finance 2 ̆ 7 s recent proposal to establish the reasonable expectation of profit (REOP) standard as a statutory requirement for the recognition of losses. The author argues that the proposed statutory standard is defensible as a response to straddle transactions whereby taxpayers combine a borrowing and an asset acquisition with roughly offsetting expected cash flows. These transactions are profitable solely because of the tax benefit that they generate through the inconsistent tax treatment of the expected cash flows associated with the <b>offsetting</b> <b>positions.</b> In the tax policy context, straddle transactions have no desirable consequential attributes and should not be tolerated. With some suggested fine-tuning, the department 2 ̆ 7 s proposed statutory REOP standard can provide a target-effective response that should deter straddles. However, in addressing non-straddle transactions that are perceived to have consequential atributes comparable to those of straddle transactions, the proposed standard is hopelessly underinclusive (but also overinclusive in some respects). The author suggests that if the policy problem presented by an unrestricted interest expense deduction is considered to extend to a range of non-straddle transactions, deductibility restrictions patterned on the investment interest and passive loss rules in the United States are the only defensible response. However, as he points out, much of the controversy in the literature regarding interest deductibility restrictions focuses on the policy arguments for restrictions in the context of non-straddle transactions. Straddle transactions present a much clearer case for restrictions {{along the lines of the}} proposed statutory REOP standard...|$|E

40|$|This chapter assesses how {{market risk}} {{management}} techniques {{may have contributed}} to the benign financial environment of recent years, and whether seemingly prudent behavior by individual firms, reacting to similar market risk systems, could serve to amplify market volatility in periods of stress beyond what would otherwise have occurred. Based on simulations and observed risk management practice, there are grounds for believing that this could be the case. Results of the simulations suggest that, in a period of stress, having a variety of risk models is more stabilizing than uniformity. Perhaps more important, however, is the presence of a variety of types of financial institutions with differing investment horizons and risk appetites, as well as the scope to take <b>offsetting</b> <b>positions</b> when prices overshoot and “fire sales ” occur. From 2002 to early 2007, the decline in volatility in the global economy and financial markets was reflected in lower measures of market risk, which encouraged firms to increase their risk-taking, thereby enhancing market liquidity and resulting in even lower levels of volatility (Figure 2. 1). Conversely, shocks in an environment of heightened risk-taking could result in a rapid deterioration of such a benign environment, as reductions in risky positions lead to rising volatility and asset correlations, a reduction in market liquidity, and a further retrenchment in risk-taking. 1 As similar market risk measurement techniques spread across more institutions, the question arises as to whether the potential for reinforcing behavior has increased, given that past and current episodes of stress indicate that many financial institutions react by following the basic tenets of their risk management systems by selling risky assets, calling in higher-quality collateral, and increasing margin requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{elevators}} {{often use}} paper markets {{to mitigate the}} risk of (or hedge) their cash grain positions, as well as establish a profit margin through basis trading. Typically, merchandisers use futures or forward contracts to perform these transactions. However, in order to liquidate a cash grain position, grain transportation must be arranged in order to deliver the grain to the buyer. For elevators located along the Mississippi River system selling to Gulf export elevators in New Orleans, that mode of grain transportation is most likely river barge. Contracts for barges are bought and sold by grain merchants either directly with barge lines or through private brokers, and barge contract freight rates fluctuate daily based on supply and demand. Many elevators attempt to mitigate barge freight price risk by forward contracting barges. Unlike typical forward contracts, however, these barge contracts are {{for the purchase of}} a service, grain transportation, rather than a commodity such as the grain itself. The question that this study seeks to answer is whether a systematic pricing bias exists in this market that creates a forward contracting cost to either party (buyers or sellers). Results show that a cost of forward contracting barge freight exists at three months out, but the magnitude and the party incurring the cost varies by season. An additional important price discovery and risk management “paper market” also exists in the form of CIF NOLA (cost of insurance and freight, to port of New Orleans) basis bids, traded through brokers. These bids function similar to traditional forward contracts, however, like a futures market, firms can offset their forward contractual obligations by <b>offsetting</b> <b>positions</b> in a liquid off-exchange paper market. Analysis shows that this liquidity, coupled with a good institutional balance of long and short market participants mostly removes the pricing bias commonly found in forward contracting in corn and soybeans, although a small risk premium still exists in wheat and especially sorghum...|$|E
40|$|Credit derivatives, some of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments is the financial industry, have experienced significant growth recently. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether the use of credit derivatives, either buying or selling, has an effect on banks’ loan pricing behaviour. Minton et al. (2009) propose that the net buyers of credit protection save capital and thus should be able to make loans at rates that are below the rates offered by competitors who do not utilize credit derivatives. In addition, Hirtle (2009) investigates the relationship between credit derivatives and their effects on bank lending activities. She does not find a strong association between the use of credit derivative and the supply of loans and proposes that banks are using credit derivatives mainly to provide longer maturity and lower spread loans rather than to increase the volume of loans. In contrast to previous studies, our study investigates the relation between loan prices, measured by the interest and fee income per dollar of loans, and the use of credit derivatives at BHCs. We propose that if BHCs use credit derivatives to hedge credit exposures, they would charge a lower loan rate to the borrowers since CDs enable banks to transfer the credit risk away from the lenders. However, if credit derivatives are used for purposes other than managing credit exposure, these instruments might not have any impact on loan pricing. Another goal of our study is to investigate the relationship between loan prices and the use of credit derivatives for trading purpose. We expect that during the years when BHCs are net sellers of credit derivatives, they take these positions because they have good quality loans and they are willing to take additional risk. In this case, they would report lower income per dollar of loans. However, if banks sell CDs as part of their speculative strategy, their use of credit derivatives might not have any impact on loan prices. Thus, banks would charge a rate that is similar to other banks with the same level of risk. Another goal of our study is to find, for both users and non-users of credit derivatives, how the interest and fee income generated by the BHCs is affected by the risk of default of their clients. We expect that as the risk of default increases, the prices on loans would increase as well. Banks take additional risk in exchange for higher return. Our final goal of this study is to investigate whether the use of CDs affects the supply of funds or loan rates differently for different types of loans banks hold in their portfolios. Our findings suggest that the loan prices of users of CDs are significantly less than the loan prices of nonusers. This finding may suggest that users are more efficient, competitive and diversified than nonusers and thus can afford to charge a lower rate to their clients. The result may also suggest that BHCs that are using CDs generally have lower risk loan portfolios and these portfolios are generating lower income per dollar of assets. Among the users group, we observe that as the volume of CDs purchased increases the prices of loans also increase. This suggests additional usage of CDs allows users to accept risky loans that they would not accept in the absence of CDs. They are initiating these high-risk loans to generate higher interest and fee income and at the same time they are using more CDs to hedge these risky loans. Our study also finds a significant and positive relationship between the risk of default and BHCs loan prices. Our study further investigates the users of credit derivatives during the years when these banks use CDs and the years when they do not use CDs. We find that the loan prices are marginally lower for the years when CDs are used. In particular, we find a significant decrease in prices during the years when these banks are sellers of CDs. However, we do not find any significant impact on loan prices during the years when they buy CDs. This result suggests that CD-active BHCs that buy CD protection are doing so to reduce some excessive risk they have taken without demanding a high rate to compensate for this risk. Finally, we find that the years when BHCs report both CDs bought and CDs sold, they charge a loan price that is similar to the years when these banks do not report any position in the CDs market. Perhaps the BHCs that report simultaneously CDs bought and CDs sold are selling CDs to generate income and hedging their positions through buying <b>offsetting</b> <b>positions.</b> Our analysis also suggests that the impact of the use of derivatives varies depending on whether the loans are real estate, consumer, commercial and industrial, agricultural, or foreign loans...|$|E
