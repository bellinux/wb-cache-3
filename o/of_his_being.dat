5|$|In August 1942 Briskin's duties at Columbia {{were divided}} between Harry Cohn and Sydney Buchman, in {{anticipation}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>being</b> {{called up to}} active duty in the army. Briskin was called to active duty by September, with Buchman resigning his position as President of the Screen Writers Guild to handle Briskin's responsibilities at Columbia. While on active duty, Columbia continued to keep Briskin under contract, although at a reduced salary of $300 per week. One of Briskin's roles in the Army Signal Corps was recruiting industry personnel to serve as cameramen and photographers for the army. In a report lamenting the loss of talent from Hollywood to the armed services, Briskin {{was one of four}} producers cited, along with Darryl Zanuck, Hal Roach, and John Hay Whitney. In late March 1943 Briskin suffered a heart attack while on active military service. Briskin received a medical discharge from the Army Signal Corps in May 1944. During his military service, Briskin was awarded the Legion of Merit. In July 1944, Briskin returned to Columbia, detaching from the army with the rank of lieutenant colonel. Shortly after his return to civilian life, Briskin parted ways with Columbia in September 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested {{for the murder of}} an elderly widow. Rumours had been circulating since 1935 regarding the frequency <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>being</b> named in patients' wills (132 times between 1946 and 1956) and the gifts he was given (including two Rolls Royces). Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers, but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which gripped the nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck off for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he is thought to have killed up to 163 patients in the Eastbourne area.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to avoid}} relegation {{at the end}} of his first part-season, McLeish led the team back to the Premier League at the first attempt in 2009, then guided them to a 12-game unbeaten run, a club record in the top division, and a ninth-place finish, their best since 1959. McLeish led Birmingham to their first major trophy in 48 years, by beating Arsenal in the 2011 League Cup Final, then took them back to the second tier. Amid rumours <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>being</b> {{favourite}} for Aston Villa's managerial vacancy, McLeish resigned by email in June 2011. His successor, former Newcastle United manager Chris Hughton, led the club into the Europa League group stage, narrowly failed to qualify for the knockout rounds, and reached the play-off semi-finals. With the club in financial turmoil and under a transfer embargo, Hughton left for Premier League Norwich City. Lee Clark, dismissed by Huddersfield Town earlier in 2012, led Birmingham to a mid-table finish in his first season. They escaped relegation to the third tier on goal difference via Paul Caddis's stoppage-time equaliser at Bolton Wanderers in the last match of 2013–14, but continuing poor form, with only one home league win in more than a year, brought Clark's dismissal in October 2014.|$|E

5|$|Ælfric {{was the son}} of an earl of Kent {{and became}} a monk of Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). He was very likely Abbot of Abingdon before {{becoming}} Abbot of St Albans Abbey around 975, although some historians do not believe that he held the office of Abbot at Abingdon. Although the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis, or History of the Church of Abingdon, names Ælfric as abbot, the abbatial lists do not record him as such. Indirect corroboration <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>being</b> abbot at Abingdon is a grant of land to Ælfric personally (instead of to the office he held) while he was archbishop that had previously been unjustly taken from Abingdon. This land was to revert to Abingdon after Ælfric's death.|$|E

Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>being</b> and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis. In later issues, this seems to have been ignored, however, with writers treating Doctor Doom the way they have always before in terms of power, the arc later retroactively being said to have been a dream had by Valeria Richards.|$|E
