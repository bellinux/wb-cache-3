Simulation of <b>oxygen</b> <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> allows testing how the past {{variability}} of these isotopes in water can be interpreted.

In this study, we present the validation of the model results for present day climate against global database for <b>oxygen</b> <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> in carbonates. The limitation of the model together with the processes operating in the natural environment reveal the complexity of use the continental calcite 18 O signal of speleothems for a data-model comparison exercise. On the contrary, the reconstructed surface ocean calcite δ 18 O signal in i LOVECLIM does show a very good agreement with late Holocene database (foraminifers) at the global and regional scales. Our results indicate that temperature and the isotopic composition of the seawater are the main control on the fossil δ 18 O signal recorded in foraminifer shells and that depth habitat and seasonality play a role but have secondary importance. We argue that a data-model comparison for surface ocean calcite δ 18 O in past climate, such as the last glacial maximum (≈ 21 000 yr), could constitute an interesting tool for mapping the potential shifts of the frontal systems and circulation changes throughout time. Similarly, the potential changes in intermediate oceanic circulation systems in the past could be documented by a data (benthic foraminifers) -model comparison exercise whereas future investigations are necessary in order to quantitatively compare the results with data for the deep ocean...|$|R

Here, we present a new record of the early Oligocene climate transition from the subtropical South Atlantic Ocean.

The macromolecular and stable isotopic composition of these benthic foraminiferal organic liningswas characterized {{to evaluate their}} potential use as paleoclimate proxies. Using Curie point pyrolysis–GC–MS (Py–GC–MS) we show that benthic foraminiferal organic linings consist of protein and polysaccharides, bound together in a complex macromolecular structure. Both chitin derivatives and traces of guaiacols and syringols, usually assigned to lignin are found. Although the five species of benthic foraminifera all contain chitin derivatives and proteins, the relative contribution of these compounds tends to vary considerably. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>stable</b> isotopic analyses of the organic linings of the benthic foraminiferal species Ammonia tepida indicates that ∂ 18 OOL values {{are in line with}} fractionation between seawater and organic matter.

The discriminatory power of <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> (δ 13 C, δ 18 O) in otoliths of yearlings (age- 1) was high, with 91 % of individuals classified correctly (based on cross-validated classification) to eastern and western nurseries.

High-quality reservoirs are mainly distributed in Type I and Type II mixed siliciclastic–carbonate sediments, and the dominant pore types include residual primary intergranular pores and intrafossil pores, feldspar dissolution pores mainly developed in Type II sediments.

Abundant intrafossil pores were formed by bioclastic decay, and secondary pores due to feldspar dissolution further enhance reservoir porosity. Mechanical compaction was inhibited by the precipitation of pore-lining dolomite formed during early stage, and oil emplacement has further led to the preservation of good reservoir quality.|$|E

Injection from shallowly (< 400 m; < 1300 ft) buried Paleocene and Eocene unconsolidated sandstones occurred {{at the end of the}} Eocene, probably in response to earthquake activity. Liquid oil was already present in the parent sands prior to injection and leaked from the injectites to the seabed. Upward-migrating oil and basinal brines mixed with downward-invading mixed meteoric-marine pore fluids in the injectites, causing extensive biodegradation of the oil. Biodegradation of oil provided the driver for early carbonate cementation in injectites, causing diminished reservoir quality. However, early carbonate cementation also sealed off the injectites as potential escape routes for petroleum from the underlying parent sands. Oil (and gas) continued to migrate into the reservoir (parent) sands upon increased burial, causing a mixing of high-API oil with the early charged, extensively biodegraded low-API oil.

Abrupt change in carbon and <b>oxygen</b> <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> was recognized at Core M 5 - 5 at about 6400 a BP, which was likely due to the intrusion of the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) extension into the Bohai Sea. At Core M 7 - 4, sediments between 5900 and 6600 a BP (150 - 260 cm depth) became coarse-grained, containing rich garnet, high manganese content, and nil autogenic pyrite, indicating a very dynamic sedimentary event during which the ambience was transformed from reductive to oxidative, and sedimentation boosted. Meanwhile, the YSWC had invaded into the Bohai Sea indicated by rich planktonic foraminifera in this event. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Current Martian {{conditions}} {{restrict the}} presence of liquid water due to low temperatures (approx 210 K), a thin atmosphere (approx 7 mb), and intense UV radiation. However, past conditions on Mars may have been different with {{the possibility that the}} ancient Martian climate was warm and wet with a dense CO 2 atmosphere. The cycling of carbon on Mars through atmospheric CO 2 and carbonate minerals is critical for deciphering its climate history. In particular <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes</b> contained in carbonates can provide information of their origin and formation environment as well as possibly hinting at the composition of global reservoirs such as atmospheric CO 2. Martian meteorite ALH 84001 contains widely studied carbonate rosettes that have been dated to approx. 3. 9 Ga and have been used to interpret climatic conditions present at that time. However, there is mount-ing evidence for multiple episodes of carbonate formation in ALH 84001 with potentially distinct isotopic compositions. This study seeks to tease out these different carbonate assemblages using stepped phosphoric acid dissolution and analysis of carbon and triple <b>oxygen</b> <b>stable</b> <b>isotopes.</b> In addition, we report SIMS analyses of the delta O- 18 several petrographically unusual carbonate phases in the meteorite...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stable</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>isotope</b> ratios (δ 18 O) {{can be used}} as an {{indicator}} of past climate variability as well as a predictor variable within climate forecasting models. Subtle changes in the Earth’s climate and weather systems can be detected and predicted through the composition of water molecules within water masses. Environmental changes influence the fractionation of water molecules which can, in turn, cause subtle variations in <b>stable</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>isotope</b> ratios. Fluctuations in temperature and salinity due to environmental changes can alter oxygen isotope fractionation so that δ 18 O can be used to trace oceanic water masses. This capstone will review the recent literature on the formation, movement, and <b>stable</b> <b>isotope</b> composition of distinct water masses in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Mediterranean Sea. These sites were chosen primarily due to their impact on ocean circulation within the North Atlantic Ocean. The water masses in these three basins each have distinct physical characteristics that identify them. Knowledge of these water masses in conjunction with δ 18 O can provide evidence of historic atmospheric events, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. The <b>stable</b> <b>oxygen</b> <b>isotope</b> ratio can be a potential indicator for future climatic episodes, monitoring of marine resources, and commercial development...|$|R
