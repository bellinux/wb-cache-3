5|$|As governor, Seward {{incurred}} considerable {{personal debt}} not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{had to live}} beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also {{because he could not}} pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.|$|E
5|$|For {{services}} unknown, he {{was rewarded}} with a consulship early in Vespasian's reign in 71. This was a remarkable honour, not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> held this office early under the new regime, {{but also because it}} was an ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making him one of the few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian. After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) and his sons Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was so confident of his control and that no one was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on continued use of the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner wanted to keep the house <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> believed the current renters would have nowhere else to go if they were forced to leave.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is the remarkable, sole {{survivor}} of the once powerful Uchiha clan of Konoha. At age seven, he survived the massacre of his entire clan {{at the hands of}} his brother, Itachi Uchiha, who spared his life <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> deemed Sasuke unworthy to kill. When first assigned to Team 7, Sasuke is antisocial, superior and unwilling to cooperate with his team members, Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, but he eventually concedes that they are useful. Sasuke awakens his Sharingan, the inherited ability of the Uchiha clan to see through illusions (genjutsu), which allows him to see and learn imperceptible movements at a super-human rate. As time passes, Sasuke seeks out very strong opponents in order to convince himself that he is growing physically.|$|E
5|$|The Brotherhood then {{returned}} for tag team action with consecutive losses to RybAxel and the Usos; after the latter loss on April 21, dissension was teased between the brothers when Cody shoved Goldust and left by himself. After that, more tension was built up when Cody began frequently losing singles matches while Goldust frequently won; Goldust notably scored wins over Alberto Del Rio and Curtis Axel, two opponents which Cody lost to. When Cody managed {{a win over}} Damien Sandow in May, it was <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> resorted to cheating. The team disbanded at Payback on June 1 when they lost to RybAxel, with Cody telling Goldust {{to look for a}} new partner, after he felt he was the weak link in the team. Cody then attempted to find a new tag team partner for Goldust, such as Sin Cara or R-Truth, but the new teams still lost their tag matches.|$|E

5|$|This {{interpretation}} is corroborated by the different rhetoric {{and actions of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath and his followers, {{as reported in the}} sources: the former was ready and willing to compromise with the Umayyads, and continued to fight <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had no alternative, while the great mass of his followers, motivated by discontent against the Umayyad regime couched in religious terms, were far more uncompromising and willing to carry on the struggle until death. Al-Hajjaj himself seems to have been aware of the distinction: in suppressing the revolt, he pardoned the Quraysh, the Syrians, and many of the other Arab clans, but executed tens of thousands among the mawālī and the Zutt of the Mesopotamian Marshes, who had sided with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from one}} guest {{appearance}} for Barbados {{in a friendly}} match early in 1939, Constantine did not play first-class cricket after 1935 until the West Indies toured England in 1939. Constantine had deliberately not signed a league contract in 1939, to be available for the tour. However, he was unhappy with the playing strength of the touring team and the £600 he was offered in wages. He believed that the captain, Rolph Grant (younger brother of Jackie), was unqualified for the job and had been appointed <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was white. Constantine captained the side in one match, but was reprimanded by the West Indies board for not pursuing a win. The West Indies lost the three-match Test series 1–0 against a very strong England side, although critics judged the overall playing record of the team to be good. In the three Tests, Constantine scored 110 runs at 27.50 and took 11 wickets at 29.81, including five for 75 in the final Test.|$|E
5|$|As Moratti {{prepared}} to make wholesale changes at the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £7.5million. He became manager Bruce Rioch's first signing at Arsenal and broke the club's transfer fee record set at £2.5million. Bergkamp's arrival at the club was significant not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was an established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him, but also {{because he was a}} major contributor to Arsenal's return to success after much decline in the mid-1990s. On the opening day of the 1995–96 league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough. He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club's next six league matches, prompting ridicule by the national press. On 23 September 1995, Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against Southampton at Highbury. Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and 11 goals, helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the UEFA Cup by scoring the winner against Bolton Wanderers {{on the final day of}} the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{referendum}} was {{the last}} phase in the power struggle between Bảo Đại and his prime minister. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm and had frequently attempted to undermine him, having appointed him <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a conduit to American aid. At the time, the country {{was going through a}} period of insecurity, as Vietnam had been temporarily partitioned {{as a result of the}} 1954 Geneva Accords that ended the First Indochina War. The State of Vietnam controlled the southern half of the country, pending national elections that were intended to reunify the country under a common government. Still, the Vietnamese National Army was not in full control of southern Vietnam; the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects ran their own administrations in the countryside supported by private armies, while the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate controlled the streets of Saigon. Despite interference from these groups, Bảo Đại, and even French officials, Diệm managed to subdue the private armies and consolidate government control over the country by mid-1955.|$|E
5|$|The regular Football League {{returned}} {{in time for}} the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and was a major contributor to 30 of the club's 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United {{on the final day of}} the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this was <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he still lived in the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Baden-Powell was {{assigned}} to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War, and it was here (in June, 1896) that he first met and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell's woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in Scouting for Boys. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well-known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and it was here that Baden-Powell acquired his Kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and to call them together in training courses.|$|E
