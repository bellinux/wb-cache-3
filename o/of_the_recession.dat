40|$|The {{paper is}} a study of a {{business}} <b>recessions.</b> On <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual financial crisis, which has broad international influence, many questions about possibilities of efficient solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic <b>recessions</b> have been opened. In the economics history is possible to find many examples of business recessions and more or less successful solution methods. Each recession has several analogical characters with other <b>recessions.</b> <b>The</b> similarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> is utilized in this study as the base for fuzzy model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business <b>recessions.</b> <b>The</b> fuzzy logic is very useful tool for modeling, because absolute as well as relative quantitative indicators {{can be used in}} the model. <b>The</b> fuzzy model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business <b>recession</b> is based on <b>the</b> data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American's <b>recessions</b> and also covers the data about the Japanese crisis and one example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czech business <b>recession.</b> <b>The</b> model was utilized for research <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recessions' similarities and for <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future business <b>recessions...</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{contrasting}} {{the period}} after <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> with earlier years, the paper conducts {{a test of}} structural change brought by the severe 2007 Great <b>Recession.</b> <b>The</b> most noticeable change is an upward shift in <b>the</b> baseline probability <b>of</b> entering unemployment and a downward shift in <b>the</b> odds <b>of</b> finding jobs. However, <b>the</b> cyclical volatility <b>of</b> transitioning into unemployment declined for immigrant workers in the period marked by <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession,</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> adverse economic conditions experienced beyond <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> affected all workers negatively, whereas the differential responsiveness dampened for immigrant workers.|$|R
5|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> {{which began}} in 1893, and which {{continued}} through 1896, ruined many Americans. Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25%. The task of relieving the jobless fell to churches and other charities, {{as well as to}} labor unions. Farmers went bankrupt; their farms were sold to pay their debts. Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation; others killed themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{price of}} {{collectible}} cars collapsed {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> over the six-year period from 1989–94; for example, a highly collectible Ferrari 250 GTO sold for just $3.5 million in 1994, an $11.1 million loss from its sale price in 1989. The Jaguar XJ220 had attracted {{a significant number of}} speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 and enthusiasm for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight, allowing large profits to be made over a short period of time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} income distribution and <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> economic crises, where the severity {{is measured by the}} length and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recessions.</b> Using an extensive panel dataset on income distribution and employing an event study framework, we find significant evidence that there is a negative association between <b>the</b> prevailing degree <b>of</b> income inequality and <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recessions.</b> In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> high income countries that have bad income distribution, however, recessions are observed to be longer than the average. This observation is likely to result from <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strong status-quo bias <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financially powerful income groups and the available means to redistribute towards the poor so as to help mitigate the pressures for reforms to improve income distribution via creative destruction. <b>The</b> longer period <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> observed in developed countries than in less developed countries in <b>the</b> aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> is in support <b>of</b> this argument. <b>The</b> findings also reveal that recessions tend to be longer during <b>the</b> decade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s than <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period studied. The evidence regarding the corrective effect on <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> accommodative fiscal or monetary policy stance, measured by <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government and the inflation rate, is observed to be only barely significant on average. Wirh regard to <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> on income distribution, the evidence in the paper indicates that the post-crises income distribution worsens significantly with the length but improves with <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding <b>recession.</b> We also note that, in addition to the persistence effect, <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> monetary discipline worsens income distribution in the postcrises period significantly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hydrograph {{recession}} constants {{are required}} in rainfall-runoff models, base flow augmen-tation studies, geohydrologic investigations and in regional low-flow studies. <b>The</b> <b>recession</b> portion <b>of</b> a streamflow hydrograph {{is shown to}} be either an autoregressive process or an integrated moving average process, depending upon <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assumed model errors. Six different estimators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base flow <b>recession</b> constant are derived and tested using thousands of hydrograph recessions available at twenty-three sites in Massachusetts, U. S. When hydrograph recessions are treated as an autoregressive process, unconditional least squares or maximum likelihood estimators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base-flow <b>recession</b> constant are shown to exhibit significant downward bias due to <b>the</b> short lengths <b>of</b> hydrograph <b>recessions.</b> <b>The</b> precision <b>of</b> estimates of hydrograph recession constants is shown to depend heavily upon assumptions regarding <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model errors. In general, regression procedures for estimating hydrograph recession parameters are generally preferred to the time-series alternatives. An evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical significance <b>of</b> estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baseflow <b>recession</b> con-stant is provided by comparing regional regression models which relate low-flow statistics to three independent variables: drainage area, basin slope and <b>the</b> baseflow <b>recession</b> constant. As anticipated, approximately unbiased estimators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baseflow <b>recession</b> constant provide significant information regarding <b>the</b> geohydrologic response <b>of</b> watersheds...|$|R

5|$|Siting of the Ålgård Line from Ganddal to Ålgård {{started in}} 1920. The final cost {{estimate}} was NOK2.82 million {{and the plan}} was passed by Parliament on 20 July 1921, with construction commencing on 21 December. The construction was organized by Just Broch and led by Olaf Bakke. Between 200 and 250 people worked on the line during construction. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession,</b> the railway works were seen as way to create jobs. Most of the workers came from Stavanger and nearly all had families to support. The first train to operate on the line went from Stavanger on 20 December 1924, with the official opening by Minister of Labour Lars Oftedal taking place when it reached Ålgård. The line became the last state-owned railway in Norway to be opened with narrow gauge.|$|E

Throughout 2008, {{a number of}} fiscal measuresincluding a £145 tax cut for basic rate (below £34,800 pa earnings) tax payers, a temporary 2.5% cut in Value Added Tax (VAT), £3billion worth of spending brought forward from 2010 and a £20billion Small Enterprise Loan Guarantee Schemewere introduced. The cost of these measures, {{most of which were}} announced in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report, was about £20billion excluding counting loan guarantees. Further measures worth £5billionincluding training for the young unemployed and a car scrappage scheme which offered a £2,000 subsidy for the purchase of a new car in exchange for the scrapping of a car more than 10 years oldwere announced in the 2009 budget.|$|E

25|$|Voter {{approval}} of the convention center bond levy was critical to winning investor participation {{in the rest of}} the Garden Gateway development.

But with the onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Recession</b> of 1958, Celebrezze believed voters would turn down both proposals. To save the convention center, he suggested postponing the courthouse levy. Judges reacted with outrage, attacking the convention center bond levy as unnecessary. Council reaction was poor as well, with a majority of Cleveland City Council members agreeing that the convention center bond issue was now dead because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>recession.</b>|$|E

30|$|Panel B {{shows the}} test results for changes in {{unemployment}} exit rates from the two sub-sample periods. For all workers, the change in <b>the</b> base probability <b>of</b> moving from unemployment to employment is estimated to have declined (from 0.58 to approximately 0.46) in the post- 2007 period, meaning that the adverse economic conditions experienced beyond <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> dampened their chance <b>of</b> becoming rehired. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclicality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unemployment exit transition becomes less pronounced after <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession.</b> For both periods, parameter estimates show that people {{are less likely to}} become re-employed in response to a weak demand. 25 However, <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> that response declines after <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession,</b> accounting for <b>the</b> positive coefficient on the business cycle variable (shown by Recession*Unemployment). With <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession,</b> however, immigrant-native responsiveness to the business cycle measure is not observed to be structurally affected (shown by Recession*Unemployment*Immigrant). Nor do immigrant workers demonstrate a different cyclical sensitivity in periods of falling unemployment.|$|R
