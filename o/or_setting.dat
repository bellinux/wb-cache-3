5|$|Nan's {{experiences}} eventually reveal serious faults of {{the society}} she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in The Seattle Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession <b>or</b> <b>setting,</b> remaining malleable {{until the end of}} the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising <b>or</b> <b>setting.</b> Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E
5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson.

Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters <b>or</b> <b>setting,</b> but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by up to}} three artificially intelligent squadmates, who may be given tactical orders such as holding a position, taking cover or rushing enemies. Squadmates may be commanded as a group or individually; for example, one half of a squad {{may be used to}} distract enemies while the other half attacks an objective. Each squad member specializes in weapons, reconnaissance, repairs, demolitions or electronics. Those in the latter four categories may be given special commands, such as repairing a teammate's armor <b>or</b> <b>setting</b> explosive charges. During missions, squad members radio in enemy sightings and status assessments.|$|E
5|$|The tengu's {{unpleasant}} image {{continued to}} erode in the 17th century. Some stories now presented {{them as much}} less malicious, protecting and blessing Buddhist institutions rather than menacing them <b>or</b> <b>setting</b> them on fire. According to a legend in the 18th-century , a tengu {{took the form of}} a yamabushi and faithfully served the abbot of a Zen monastery until the man guessed his attendant's true form. The tengu's wings and huge nose then reappeared. The tengu requested a piece of wisdom from his master and left, but he continued, unseen, to provide the monastery with miraculous aid.|$|E
5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is bright enough {{to be seen in}} a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon <b>or</b> <b>setting.</b> As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Sihanaka culture {{traditionally}} {{adhered to}} a wide variety of fady, some of which are still respected to varying degrees by more traditional families to the present day. Many of their fady in the early 1900s were documented by historian Van Gennep. The most absolute fady and the only one that was seemingly practiced by all Sihanaka was a prohibition against working in a paddy field on Tuesdays; sub-groups among the Sihanaka also practiced other taboos associated with particular days of the week, such as not leaving the house or not cleaning floor mats on certain days. A fady was placed on consumption of any new or foreign products, including Western medicines. Another common fady was a taboo against watching the rising <b>or</b> <b>setting</b> of the sun, staring at anything red, or falling asleep at sunset.|$|E
5|$|The game's ending changes {{depending}} on whether the player has a radio beacon to call for extraction, and when the nuclear device is set to explode. Forgetting to set the bomb, <b>or</b> <b>setting</b> it to explode at any time past the awakening of the dreaming god, results in Earth's destruction. The device's detonation before the player reaches a minimum safe distance results in a pyrrhic victory. The most favorable endings are achieved by leaving the pyramid with a beacon for evacuation at least twenty game minutes before the device is set to go off; if the game ends with enough time for the player to escape on foot, the player survives without a beacon.|$|E
5|$|The park is {{the most}} visited during {{the spring and summer}} months, when it is open between 8:00 and 19:00 (7:00pm) local time. In autumn and winter, it closes at 17:00 (5:00pm). Admission at the {{entrance}} must be paid. Camping, lighting fires, <b>or</b> <b>setting</b> up overnight shelters are strictly forbidden within the limits of the national park {{in order to protect the}} surrounding ecosystem. The park can be reached from the city center of Kuşadası via several dolmuş (share taxis) that regularly shuttle the route to the closest town of Güzelçamlı. Recently, there have also been ferry boat services operating back and forth between Kuşadası and Güzelçamlı, in turn providing easier access to the park for visitors. Each year, around 700,000 foreign and domestic tourists visit the park.|$|E

Transported with two other supporting characters thirty years into the future, the protagonist finds the Earth ruined by a demon invasion, which is now the stage for an escalating conflict between the Order of Messiah and the Ring of Gaea, conflicting cults who wish to bring about kingdoms for their respective patron deities (YHVH and Lucifer). The story is influenced by moral decisions the protagonist makes, aligning him either with the Order, the Ring of Gaea, <b>or</b> <b>setting</b> him up as an independent agent.|$|E
5|$|Understanding the Massey Lectures {{were part}} of the Canadian culture, Gopnik, who was born in Philadelphia but lived in Montreal between the ages of 10 to 25, wanted a topic that would be {{relevant}} to Canadians but also have universal appeal: winter.
