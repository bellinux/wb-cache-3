The first chapter studies {{the rate of}} long-term unemployment, which spiked during the Great Recession. To help explain this, I exploit the systematic and counter-cyclical differences in unemployment duration across occupations. This heterogeneity extends {{the tail of the}} unemployment duration distribution, which is necessary to account for the observed level of long-term unemployment and its increase since 2007. This chapter introduces a model in which unemployment duration and occupation are linked; it measures the effects of occupation-specific shocks and skills on unemployment duration. Here, a worker will be paid more for human capital in his old occupation but a bad shock may make those jobs scarce. Still, their human capital partly ``attaches'' them to their prior occupation, even when searching there implies a longer expected duration. Hence, unemployment duration rises and becomes more dispersed across occupations. Redistributive shocks and business cycles, as in the Great Recession, exacerbate this effect. For quantitative discipline, the model matches data on the wage premium to occupational experience and the co-movement of occupations' productivity. The distribution of duration is then endogenous. For comparison's sake, if a standard model with homogeneous job seekers matches the job finding rate, then it also determines expected duration and understates it. That standard model implies just over half of the long-term unemployment in 1976 - 2007 and almost no rise in the recent recession. But, with heterogeneity by occupation, this chapter nearly matches long-term unemployment in the period 1976 - 2007 and 70 % of its rise during the Great Recession. The second chapter studies the link between wage growth and the match of a worker's <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills.</b> The notion here is that if human capital accumulation depends on match quality, poor matches can have long-lasting effects on lifetime earnings. I build a model that incorporates such a mechanism, in which human capital accumulation is affected by imperfect information about one's self. This informational friction leads to matches in which a worker accumulates human capital more slowly and has weaker earnings growth. To get direct evidence, the chapter pieces together two sets of data on the skills used by an occupation and the skills a worker is particularly good at. Data on occupations describes occupations by the intensity with which they use many dimensions of workers' knowledge, skills and abilities. To pair, we have data on tests taken by respondents in a panel that tracks occupations and earnings. The test designers created a mapping between their tests and the occupational descriptors, which allows us to create two measures. The first measure of match quality is just the dot product between the dimensions of workers' skills and utilization rate of these skills by occupations. The second measure mismatch relative to an optimal matching computed using the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable pairs. In both, worse matches have significantly slower returns to occupational tenure. With the most conservative estimate, plus or minus one standard deviation of mismatch affects the return to occupational tenure by 1 % per year...|$|E

Based on cross-sectional and synthetic cohort analysis using the 1973 - 2000 Current Population Surveys, estimates are obtained for men and women on the returns to schooling and the investment intensity, length, and returns from post-school training. Although the shapes of wage-experience profiles differ substantially across <b>occupations</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> groups, evidence supports the theoretical prediction that rates of return are equivalent across alternative investment paths.

Three important social variables include gender, race, and ethnicity, which, at the least, have an intervening effect on social status and stratification in most places throughout the world. Additional variables include those that describe other ascribed and achieved characteristics such as <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> levels, age, education level, education level of parents, and geographic area. Some of these variables may have both causal and intervening effects on social status and stratification. For example, absolute age may cause a low income if one is too young or too old to perform productive work.

A reduced form two-way probit model is developed which analyzes worker choice between the public and the private sectors, along with a three-way probit model which breaks this down" to a choice between private, federal and state-local jobs. Significant differences in the relationship between selection probabilities and worker characteristics are found between these three sectors and these differences are shown to vary in interesting ways across occupations. These results make it possible to characterize the type of individual who is most likely to be attracted to a job in the private, federal or state-local sectors and provide a more complete understanding of how workers perceive and respond to existing sectoral employment differences.

40|$|While {{scholarship}} on migration has been thriving for decades, {{little attention has}} been paid to professionals from Europe and America who move temporarily to destinations beyond âthe Westâ. Such migrants are marginalised and depoliticised by debates on immigration policy, and thus there is an urgent need to develop nuanced understanding of these more privileged movements. In many ways, these are the modern-day equivalents of colonial settlers and expatriates, yet the continuities in their migration practices have rarely been considered. The New Expatriates advances our understanding of contemporary mobile professionals by engaging with postcolonial theories of race, culture and identity. The volume brings together authors and research from across a wide range of disciplines, seeking to evaluate the significance of the past in shaping contemporary expatriate mobilities and highlighting postcolonial continuities in relation to people, practices and imaginations. Acknowledging the resonances across a range of geographical sites in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, the chapters consider the particularity of postcolonial contexts, while enabling comparative perspectives.

The results indicated that some 38 â 64 % of employed Australians were below minimal competence (at Level 1 or Level 2) in one of the four skill areas of prose literacy, document literacy, numeracy or problem-solving skills. A pattern of greatest need was identified amongst two occupational groups, namely, machinery operators/drivers and labourers. There was also a clear occupational hierarchy in the area of problem-solving skills that was considered to reflect a social bias since it was inconsistent with the three other skill areas. The findings also highlight pockets of social disadvantage and inequality with many labourers outperforming managers and professionals. It was concluded that the pattern of performance across <b>occupations</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> levels was statistically and significantly different than chance. 174 James A.

At the same time, many experts have presented evidence of a STEM worker surplus. The literature tends to lean heavily in one direction or the other: one side proclaims an impending STEM crisis and the other side asserts a STEM surplus. This paper tries to reconcile the âSTEM Crisisâ vs. âSTEM Surplusâ debate by segmenting the STEM labor market into different industries, <b>occupations,</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> levels.

Our findings indicate a significant heterogeneity in the STEM labor market. While the academic sector is generally oversupplied, the government and government-related sector has shortages in specific areas such as nuclear engineering, materials science, and electrical engineering, as well as cybersecurity and intelligence. The private sector also has specific shortages for positions such as petroleum engineers, data scientists, and software developers. At the same time, there are surpluses for graduates in areas such as chemistry and physics. The demand and supply also vary according to location and U. S. citizenship.

40|$|Abstract Background Educational {{qualifications}} <b>and</b> literacy <b>skills</b> {{are highly}} related. This {{is not surprising}} as it is one aim of educational systems to equip individuals with competencies necessary {{to take part in}} society. Because of this relationship educational qualifications are often used as a proxy for âhuman capitalâ. However, from a theoretical perspective, there are many reasons why this relationship is not perfect, and to some degree this is due to third variables. Thus, we want to explore the net relationship between educational attainment (harmonized according to the International Standard Classification of Education, ISCED) <b>and</b> literacy <b>skills,</b> <b>and</b> how much <b>skills</b> vary within education levels across countries. Methods We use data from 21 countries from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies 2012. This paper compares the literacy skills of adults who achieved different levels of educational attainment across countries. Â Given the high degree of educational differentiation in most countries, we do this using a more differentiated educational attainment variable than what is commonly used. Â  In our analyses we firstly adjust for factors that are likely to affect access to education and the acquisition of educational qualifications <b>and</b> literacy <b>skills,</b> such as parental education and language and migration background. In a second step, we also take into account factors affecting skill development after initial formal education, such as <b>occupation</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> use at home. Results We firstly find a high degree of heterogeneity of skills across countries for equivalent education categories. Secondly, we find skill similarities for equivalent education categories classified at different broad education levels, sometimes even breaking the hierarchical order of âhigher education entails higher competenciesâ. Conclusion We conclude that ISCED levels cannot be taken as a cross-nationally comparable proxy for human capital in terms of literacy <b>skills,</b> <b>and</b> that education has to be harmonized in a substantively more meaningful way in future adult literacy surveys...|$|R
