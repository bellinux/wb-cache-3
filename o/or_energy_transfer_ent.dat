The photophysical {{properties of the}} three arrays, along with individual donor and acceptor chromophores, were investigated by UV−vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetimes, and density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure modeling. Comparison of the UV−vis absorption spectra and frontier molecular orbitals from DFT calculations of the three arrays with ZnTPP, ZnTTrzlP, and Trzl-BODIPY shows that the electronic structure of the chromophores is essentially unperturbed by the 1, 2, 3 -triazole linkage. Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations on the Dyad reproduce the absorption spectra in THF and show no evidence of excited state mixing of the donor and acceptor. The BODIP...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A new azido {{functionalized}} 4, 4 -difluoro- 4 -bora- 3 a, 4 a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) {{has been}} synthesized to achieve spectral complementarity to a Zn(II) tetraphenylethynyl porphyrin (ZnTPEP). Mixed multilayer films were assembled on glass and quartz up to 10 bilayers thick in a layer-by-layer (LbL) fabrication process using copper(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cyclo-addition (CuAAC) to couple these two dyes {{together with a}} tris-azido linker. By varying the amount of BODIPY in the CuAAC reaction solutions for the azido linker layers, we achieve tunable doping of BODIPY within the porphyrin films. We are able to demonstrate linear film growth and determine thickness by X-ray reflectivity (XRR). XRR data indicated that lower BODIPY loading leads to higher porphyrin content and slightly thicker films. Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of the mixed multilayer films show efficient quenching of the BODIPY singlet and enhanced ZnTPEP emission, suggesting efficient <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> (<b>EnT).</b> The ease of fabrication and tunability of these films may serve as potential light harvesting arrays for molecular-based solar cells...|$|R

40|$|Three porphyrin-fullerene dyads, {{in which}} a diyne bridge links C 60 with a â-position on a tetraarylporphyrin, have been synthesized. The free-base dyad was prepared, {{as well as the}} {{corresponding}} Zn(II) and Ni(II) materials. These represent the first examples of a new class of conjugatively linked electron donor-acceptor systems in which ð-conjugation extends from the porphyrin ring system directly to the fullerene surface. The processes that occur following photoexcitation of these dyads were examined using fluorescence and transient absorption techniques on the femtosecond, picosecond, and nanosecond time scales. In sharp contrast to the photodynamics associated with singlet excited-state decay of reference tetraphenylporphyrins (ZnTPP, NiTPP, and H 2 TPP), the diyne-linked dyads undergo ultrafast (< 10 ps) singlet excited-state deactivation in toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and benzonitrile (PhCN). Transient absorption techniques with the ZnP-C 60 dyad clearly show that in toluene intramolecular <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> (<b>EnT)</b> to ultimately generate C 60 triplet excited states is the dominant singlet decay mechanism, while intramolecular electron transfer (ET) dominates in THF and PhCN to give the ZnP¥+/C 60 ¥- charge-separated radical ion pair (CSRP). Electrochemical studies indicate that there is no significant charge transfer in the ground states of these systems. The lifetime of ZnP¥+/C 60 ¥- in PhCN was 40 ps, determined by two different types of transient absorption measurement in two different laboratories.

Competing meta-analyses of the ganzfeld database are reviewed, 1 by R. Hyman (1985), a skeptical critic of psi research, and the other by C.

Neodymium (Nd) and ytterbium (Yb) are excellent infrared LSC materials: inexpensive, abundant, efficient, and spectrally well-matched to high-performance silicon solar cells. These rare earth ions are reasonably transparent to their own radiation and capable of generating high optical concentrations. Neodymium's and ytterbium's disadvantage is their relatively poor absorption overlap with the visible spectrum. Transition metals such as chromium (Cr), titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V) have broadband absorption covering the visible and near-infrared and can efficiently sensitize neodymium and ytterbium through a non-radiative <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> process. Chromium, titanium, and vanadium containing glasses were fabricated using a custom designed glass making furnace.

Glasses containing Cr or V co-doped with Nd <b>or</b> Yb demonstrated <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from the transition metal to the rare earth, a fundamental step toward integration into a LSC.
