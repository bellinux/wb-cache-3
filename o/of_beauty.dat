5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E
5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer is still a respecter of form, still a devotee <b>of</b> <b>beauty,</b> still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.|$|E

5|$|American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball. Kevin Spacey stars as Lester Burnham, a 42-year-old advertising executive {{who has a}} midlife crisis when he becomes infatuated with his teenage daughter's best friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). Annette Bening co-stars as Lester's materialistic wife, Carolyn, and Thora Birch plays their insecure daughter, Jane. Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper, and Allison Janney also feature. The film is described by academics as a satire of American middle-class notions <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> and personal satisfaction; analysis {{has focused on the}} film's explorations of romantic, and paternal love, sexuality, beauty, materialism, self-liberation, and redemption.|$|E

5|$|Leonard Robinson {{argues that}} the {{popularity}} of Musidora reflects a change in art buyers. As the Industrial Revolution took hold, the primary market for art {{was no longer a}} privately educated landed aristocracy who had been taught the Classics and were familiar with ancient mythology, but the emerging middle class. These new buyers lacked the classical education to understand the references in history paintings, but could appreciate Musidora as a skilful execution and as a work <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> in its own right.|$|E

The Wall Street Journal ran a correction, corroborated by The New York Times, that she was a resident of Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn at the time. Hagan had lived in six different Brooklyn neighborhoods between her arrival in 2008 and her Miss America victory in 2013, including Sunset Park and Williamsburg.|$|E

5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions <b>of</b> <b>beauty,</b> he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E

5|$|The Lucy {{poems are}} {{a series of}} five poems {{composed}} by the English Romantic poet William Wordsworth (1770–1850) between 1798 and 1801. All but one were first published during 1800 in the second edition of Lyrical Ballads, a collaboration between Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge that was both Wordsworth's first major publication and a milestone in the early English Romantic movement. In the series, Wordsworth sought to write unaffected English verse infused with abstract ideals <b>of</b> <b>beauty,</b> nature, love, longing and death.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{reflect on the}} nature <b>of</b> {{mathematical}} <b>beauty,</b> and examine the connections between mathematics and the arts. I employ Plutarch’s distinction between the intelligible and the sensible, to compare the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> mathematics with the <b>beauties</b> <b>of</b> music, poetry and painting. While the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> mathematics is almost exclusively intelligible, and the <b>beauties</b> <b>of</b> these arts primarily sensible, it is {{pointed out that the}} latter share with mathematics a certain kind <b>of</b> intelligible <b>beauty.</b> The paper also contains reflections on the formal <b>beauty</b> and timelessness <b>of</b> mathematics, <b>beauty</b> as richness flowing from simplicity, form and content in mathematics, and mathematics and fiction. It concludes with some remarks on the question <b>of</b> why mathematical <b>beauty</b> is so little appreciated by non-mathematicians...|$|R

5|$|The Third of May {{references}} {{a number}} of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas. Pictorial artifice {{gives way to the}} epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary Romantic painters—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions <b>of</b> <b>beauty,</b> as is evident in Théodore Géricault's Raft of the Medusa (18181819) and Eugène Delacroix's 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People.|$|E
5|$|The {{action in}} the book moves from Newby's life in the fashion {{business}} in London to Afghanistan. On the way Newby describes his very brief training in mountaineering in North Wales, a stop in Istanbul, and a nearly-disastrous drive across Turkey and Persia. They are driven out to the Panjshir Valley, where they begin their walk, with many small hardships described in a humorous narrative, supported by genuine history of Nuristan and brief descriptions of the rare moments <b>of</b> <b>beauty</b> along the way. Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in an antique grammar book, are exploited to comic effect.|$|E
