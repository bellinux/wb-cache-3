5000|$|The government's {{response}} was to appoint a Royal Commission <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860.

The location of the forts would enable interlocking arcs of fire from their guns. It was originally intended that the forts would form part {{of a line of}} defences running all the way to Chatham, but the rest of this chain was never built. Shornemead was regarded as being in a particularly strategic location as it commanded river bends at which ships would have to slow down, making them more vulnerable.|$|R
