5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, breast cancer culture tends to {{overlook}} men {{with breast cancer}} and women who do not fit the white, middle-class archetype. African-Americans involved with breast cancer organizations <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> like their role {{is to be the}} token minority.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} victims of {{domestic}} violence to leave the relationship is crucial for preventing further abuse. In traditional communities, divorced women <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> rejected and ostracized. In order to avoid this stigma, many women prefer to remain in the marriage and endure the abuse.|$|E

Pagans <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> a duty to protect the Earth through activism, and support causes such as rainforest protection, organic farming, permaculture, animal rights and so on.

25|$|Western {{designers}} <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> {{the need}} to tinker with the proa. They are attracted by the minimalist nature and amazing speeds that proas are capable of (they may still be the fastest sailboats per dollar spent for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made. James Wharram was greatly influenced by the Proa design.|$|E
25|$|This is {{frequently}} {{a source of}} political friction as the committees are naturally dominated by swimming officials who do not necessarily share or understand {{the concerns of the}} diving community. Divers <b>often</b> <b>feel,</b> for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities. Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.|$|E
25|$|Children {{living in}} mixed {{immigration}} status households live with fear of deportation threats of parents or themselves. They <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> scared, sad {{and worried about}} possible separation. This can be traumatic and have negative effects on the children’s well-being. As a result, children may interpret their reality as depriving and cruel. They may process their experiences with a consciousness that mirrors that of their undocumented parents, even though many are U.S. born citizens {{with all of the}} benefits rights, and privileges that U.S. citizenship carries.|$|E

25|$|Woodall and Constantine {{have been}} parodied many times on comedy {{impression}} programmes. Alistair McGowan's Big Impression took to spoofing their personalities on What Not to Wear, as did 2DTV who made cartoon versions of Woodall and Constantine giving Santa Claus a makeover, where they stripped {{him of his}} red suit and added a casual shirt and trousers. Avid Merrion's Bo' Selecta! took to portraying them as lesbians. In an interview, despite being lampooned on Bo' Selecta!, they commented that the portrayal was a compliment as they <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> women's breasts during makeovers on their show.|$|E
25|$|There are {{distinct}} and notably large differences between Borderline and C-PTSD {{and while there}} are some similarities – predominantly in terms of issues with attachment (though this plays out in completely different ways) and trouble regulating strong emotional effect (<b>often</b> <b>feel</b> pain vividly), the disorders are completely different in nature – especially considering that C-PTSD is always a response to trauma rather than a personality disorder. In addition, C-PTSD is not a personality disorder – rather it is often a case of survival reactions to trauma becoming a fundamental aspect of the personality, in response to living with a personality disordered individual.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{surrounding}} body image can be examined through, body negativity, and body positivity. Negative body image {{consists of a}} disoriented view of one’s shape; whereby they <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteems, suffers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses. Positive body image on the other hand, {{is described as a}} clear true perception of one’s figure. In addition to celebrating and appreciating the body, it also requires an understanding that an individual’s appearance does not reflect their character or self worth.|$|E

25|$|While {{cases of}} HIV and AIDS in women have {{stabilized}} internationally, Chile {{has seen a}} rise in HIV/AIDS infection. Societal beliefs about traditional women's roles as mothers leads to women being less likely to use contraceptives, increasing the opportunity for disease. Chilean women also <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> subordinate to men due to these traditional belief systems, making women less likely to negotiate {{for the use of}} condoms. In 2007, 28 percent of people with HIV/AIDS in Chile were women. Numbers of women living with HIV is lower than those with AIDS. A study by Vivo Positivo showed that 85 percent of women living with HIV/AIDS reported that they had little to no education or information about HIV/AIDS until diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous version of the cricket cap in the modern setting is the baggy green cricket cap of the Australian cricket team, for which the players and fans of Australia hold a degree of reverence. The cap is treated {{with a degree of}} mysticism, and players who have long careers often refuse to replace the {{original}} one they receive as they <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> the cap is a lucky talisman. This sometimes results in players who have long careers wearing their cricket caps in quite a tattered state. The Australian side has long worn their baggy cricket cap, rather than alternatives such as a sun hat, for the first session of each match as a symbol of team solidarity.|$|E
25|$|Racing cyclists {{often have}} gears {{with a small}} {{relative}} difference of around 7% to 10%; this allows fine adjustment of gear ratios to suit the conditions and maintain a consistent pedalling speed. Mountain bikes and hybrid bikes often have gears with a moderate relative difference of around 15%; this allows for a much larger gear range while having an acceptable step between gears. 3-speed hub gears may have a relative difference of some 33% to 37%; such big steps require a very substantial change in pedalling speed and <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> excessive. A step of 7% corresponds to a 1-tooth change from a 14-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket, while a step of 15% corresponds to a 2-tooth change from a 13-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket.|$|E

25|$|Freudian analysts {{claim that}} all sons {{feel they are}} in {{competition}} with their father and <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> in a battle against the father. This is well represented in Greek mythology as Chronos, {{the father of the}} gods, is in constant war with his children should they contradict him. This dominant patriarchal attitude still has roots in society today as men are viewed to be heads of families. (Sigmund Freud referred to this as Oedipus complex.) Freudian psychologists claim that the risk the son runs is that in some cases it is more difficult to win the battle against the father than to lose the battle against the father. This is because a common result of winning the battle against the father is that the son suffers tremendous guilt.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot of different people at parties or <b>Often</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background and Know how to captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E
25|$|Global {{justice is}} the {{paramount}} to global security, because injustice {{can lead to}} feelings of anger, humiliation, and alienation, which can undermine human dignity. Al-Rodhan argues that humans are primarily driven by emotional self-interest and that protecting humans’ emotional needs is fundamental to human well-being and human dignity. When people {{feel that they have}} been the victim of unjust decisions, they may try and seek justice by less conventional means such as violence. This, in turn, can promote insecurity. Therefore, justice and not just military power, is essential to maintaining global security. Some obstacles might however arise. Al-Rodhan identifies the disparity in power that exists between states in the current global order as a major obstacle in achieving global justice. Calls for greater global justice are thus likely to continue from disadvantaged societies because they <b>often</b> <b>feel</b> that they are unjustly subjected to the rules set by more powerful players. However, dominant states that benefit from the current status quo are unlikely to want to alter established institutions or governance structures.|$|E
