5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk <b>on</b> <b>down</b> the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. As the bus drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E
5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so <b>on</b> <b>down</b> the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E

50|$|Punting {{following}} a three-and-out is unlike a turnover <b>on</b> <b>downs.</b> Punting after a three-and-out allows a team {{the opportunity to}} set their opposition farther back in field position. On a turnover <b>on</b> <b>downs</b> there is no punt, and the opposing team takes over possession of the ball at the spot of field where the 4th down attempt failed.|$|R

500|$|Penn did {{not have}} a first down in the first half, as the Tech defense played well. Hill scored a {{touchdown}} in the third quarter on a 27-yard run through the line. Penn's only scoring opportunity was in the third quarter. After another Al Hill touchdown and the kickoff return, Penn worked five complete forward passes in quick succession (one 23 yards) to reach Tech's 6-yard line. The Tech defense responded, and Penn turned the ball over <b>on</b> <b>downs.</b> <b>On</b> first <b>down,</b> Carpenter threw Penn back for a 6-yard loss and a pass was incomplete <b>on</b> second <b>down.</b> <b>On</b> third <b>down,</b> Penn's quarterback dropped back to pass Carpenter and William Higgins tackled him on the 25-yard line. <b>On</b> fourth <b>down,</b> Penn came out in a [...] "freak formation" [...] and its pass was incomplete. In the fourth quarter, Judy Harlan had a 65-yard interception return for a touchdown.|$|R

25|$|Just before daybreak at {{the depth}} of the dark and rain, the waiting women {{and all the rest of}} the wakefull town heard the great crash as the booms burst, and the cry of the whistle {{signaled}} the men's defeat.

25|$|Turner {{went on to}} form Green River with vocalist/guitarist Mark Arm, drummer Alex Vincent and bassist Jeff Ament. Gossard {{was asked}} to join Green River {{in order to allow}} Arm to {{concentrate}} exclusively on singing. By the time the band finished the recording of its debut EP, Come <b>on</b> <b>Down,</b> Turner decided to leave the group, citing his distaste with Ament and Gossard's heavy metal leanings. He was replaced by Ament's former Deranged Diction bandmate, Bruce Fairweather.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Stradlin {{recorded}} his sixth album, Like a Dog, with guitarist Rick Richards, drummer Taz Bentley, and bassist JT Longoria. It was originally {{scheduled for a}} late 2003 release, with just under one thousand promo copies made. However, the album was not released until October 2005, when Stradlinâ€”prompted by a fan petitionâ€”made it available through internet order. The following year, Stradlin re-released Ride On, River, <b>On</b> <b>Down</b> the Road, and Like a Dog through iTunes.|$|E
25|$|In December 1999, Stradlin's third solo album, Ride On, was {{released}} on the Universal Victor label in Japan. It featured the same line-up as his previous release. To promote the album, Stradlinâ€”with McKagan, Richards, and Bentleyâ€”played four shows in Japan the following April. With the addition of keyboardist Ian McLagan, the group recorded two more albums: River, which {{was released}} in May 2001 on Sanctuary, and a second Japan-only release, <b>On</b> <b>Down</b> the Road, which followed in August 2002 on JVC Victor.|$|E
25|$|The great {{advantage}} {{of this approach is}} the efficiency and low cost involved in settling large volumes of trades. The inconvenience is that the issuing corporation no longer knows who its owners are, since its transfer agent has all the immobilized shares recorded as the owner being Cede & Co. For purposes of sending proxy notices and other communications with beneficial owners, the transfer agent, acting on a request of the issuing corporation, sends an inquiry to DTCC, which in turn sends inquiries to its members and so <b>on</b> <b>down</b> the chain.|$|E

This example is mutual single recursion, and could easily be replaced by iteration. In this example, the mutually recursive calls are tail calls, and tail call optimization would be necessary to execute in constant stack space. In C, this would take O(n) stack space, unless rewritten to use jumps instead of calls.|$|E
25|$|An {{extension}} of the line could run to Chiang Kai Shek Airport, and possibly <b>on</b> <b>down</b> the island, passing through major population centres, which the High Speed Rail must avoid. The minimal vibration of maglev would also be suitable to provide access Hsinchu Science Park, where sensitive silicon foundries are located. In the other direction, connection to the Tansui Line and to High Speed ferries at Tansui would provide overnight travel to Shanghai and Nagasaki, and to Busan or Mokpo in South Korea, thus interconnecting the public transport systems of four countries, with great savings in fossil fuel consumption compared to flight.|$|E
25|$|The army {{maintained}} posts at Fort Vancouver, the Cascades, and The Dalles. In late 1855 orders {{arrived to}} move the army's main base up from the Cascades to the Dalles, closer to the anticipated area of war operations in the next campaign season. Movement on the river was completely halted by the severe winter in January 1856, when the Columbia froze from bank to bank from the Gorge <b>on</b> <b>down</b> well below {{the mouth of the}} Willamette. No river traffic moved anywhere on the river, even down to Astoria, Oregon. When the river was finally clear enough of ice, Belle and another boat, the Fashion started moving the Army's equipment up from Fort Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|The 49ers {{were forced}} to punt on their next drive, but San Diego ended up turning the ball over <b>on</b> <b>downs</b> when Means was tackled for a 4-yard loss <b>on</b> a fourth <b>down</b> and 1 from their own 37-yard line.|$|R
