5|$|Filming {{took place}} on the streets of Kolkata, where Ghosh often {{employed}} the art of guerrilla filmmaking (shooting in real locations without any previous knowledge given to onlookers) to avoid unwanted attention. The cinematographer Setu, who had assisted others in the past to shoot documentaries in Kolkata, said that unlike majority of Indian films, Kahaani was shot mostly without artificial light. The film was shot in 64 days, during which the Durga Puja festival of 2010 took place. Shooting locations in Kolkata included Kalighat Metro station, Nonapukur tram depot, Kumartuli, Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, old houses of North Kolkata and others. The climax, which takes place on the night of Vijayadashami (the last day of Durga Puja), was shot on the night of Vijayadashami in the premises of a Barowari (publicly organised) Durga Puja celebration in the Ballygunge neighbourhood of Kolkata. Most of the crowd in the climax were not actors. Some actors mingled with the crowd engaged in Sindoor khela—their job was to appreciate the camera angles and accordingly apply sindoor (vermilion) on Vidya's face so that accidental exposure <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to sindoor could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear narrative that moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E

The image is an altered picture of the band's bassist Ami Kusakari from the photoshoot for the band's album Shin-shiro, as she brushed hair out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The covers were made by design team Hatos, who have worked with Sakanaction since their second album Night Fishing.

Terry {{had been a}} prime target since his days as Governor of Gibraltar, where he signed the documents allowing the SAS to pursue IRA members. The attack took place at 9pm at the Main Road house. The gunman opened fire through a window hitting Sir Peter at least nine times and injuring his wife near one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The couple's daughter {{was found to be}} suffering from shock. Terry's face had to be rebuilt as the shots shattered his face and two high-velocity bullets were within millimetres of his brain.|$|E
25|$|With core ideas down, the {{remaining}} Titan team began putting these {{together as a}} prototype to present to management. They took the classes they had made for Titan and remade these as Heroes, giving them core abilities from the Titan skill set they believed worked best together, and developing backstory and personality for the heroes. Existing art assets from Titan for the various player avatars were also reused and refined to create {{the appearance of the}} heroes. The initial gameplay used maps they had developed for Titan along with Tracer, one of the reworked Titan heroes; at that point, they had not included any animations so Tracer would fire by shooting lasers out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The prototype proved successful within Blizzard, and the team was given the greenlight to proceed. Overwatch became Blizzard's second attempt at launching a new franchise since StarCraft in 1998. Some of the additional heroes came from the classes they created for the Crossroads concept as well as the Starcraft tie-in that they brainstormed prior to settling on Overwatch.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, {{she lost}} her mother, and, as her father had {{in the same year}} been elected member of the Provincial Parliament, necessitating his {{presence}} in Quebec for a considerable portion of the year, the family was, for the time being, broken up; and the above-mentioned uncle, Timothy, sent his son the long winter drive through Vermont and Canadian snowdrifts to bring this favored niece under his own roof. And here, and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, N. H. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family once more about him, in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. She joined him at that place, and in 1837 entered Oberlin College which had recently been established there, at first with no thought of taking a college course of study; but, as her perception of its advantages widened, she dropped her desultory work and, preparing herself in the languages, entered the class of 1844, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to do much of her studying at night. When she neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> In 1845, she received the degree of AB. in 1845.|$|E

There was bruising over both <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and to the right side of her face. Any physical evidence that might have identified an attacker, such as hair, blood or semen, appeared to have been washed away during the time the body spent in the canal.|$|E
500|$|It {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most exquisite portraits of the Northern Renaissance. Art historian Joel Upton described the sitter as resembling [...] "a polished pearl, almost opalescent, lying on a cushion of black velvet." [...] The panel builds on the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and was highly influential in the decades after its completion. Its appeal lies in part in her intriguing stare, accentuated by the slight misalignment <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> while the eyebrows are faintly skewed.|$|E

500|$|The {{covers of}} The Nancy Drew Files and Girl Detective series {{represent}} further departures from the bold, confident character portrayed by Tandy. The Nancy portrayed {{on the covers}} of The Nancy Drew Files is [...] "a markedly sexy Nancy, with a handsome young man always lurking in the background. Her clothes often reveal an ample bustline and her expression is mischievous." [...] In the Girl Detective series, Nancy's face is depicted on each cover in fragments. Her eyes, for example, are confined to a strip {{across the top of the}} cover while her mouth is located near the spine in a box independent <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The artwork for Nancy's eyes and mouth is taken from Rudy Nappi's cover art for the revised version of The Secret of the Old Clock.|$|E
500|$|Flocke's {{growth was}} {{carefully}} {{reported by the}} media during her first few months.

[...] At five weeks old, she was referred to by the publication Bild as [...] "Mrs. Knut", suggesting that the two German-born polar bears might become mates when they mature. [...] As she grew, Flocke's diet was enriched with dog food, and boiled bones were supplied for her to chew on when she was three months old.

[...] Ellis pointed out that he [...] "just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive.

[...] Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.|$|E

Calvino wrote of his mother's ordeal that [...] "she was an example of tenacity and courage… behaving with dignity and firmness before the SS and the Fascist militia, and in her long detention as a hostage, not least when the blackshirts three times pretended to shoot my father in front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The historical events which mothers take part in acquire the greatness and invincibility of natural phenomena".|$|E
