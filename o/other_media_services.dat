30|$|Although {{linear model}} {{is not used}} in Literature (Kumar 2013), the {{measurement}} parameters of video streaming QoE evaluation are only related to startup delay, average peak {{signal to noise ratio}} and buffer percentage. The simulation results are given in Figs.  5, 6, 7, 8, 9. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation on media service. In view of this, this method is considered to be one-sided, without considering the subjective factors, environmental factors and so on, with the disadvantage of poor portability, which is not suitable for the QoE evaluation on <b>other</b> <b>media</b> <b>services.</b> In this paper, QoE evaluation method based on fuzzy clustering heuristic rules relies on the support of large database to counts and gives an effective evaluation for each evaluation parameter index. When the server carries on QoE evaluation on media service, it will give service score information based on the big data information in media database. Meanwhile, if there is no evaluation information, service score prediction information is given on basis of service transmission status, and inserted into the database as big data source to provide reference to future service evaluation.|$|E

Originally, {{in the interest of}} historical preservation, there were plans to cover the window panes in screened diamond shapes to continue the pattern from the brickwork and to achieve the impression of a continuous façade.

40|$|Public {{service has}} long been notorious for its non-innovative characteristic. With {{increasing}} competition from other TV channels and <b>other</b> <b>media,</b> public <b>service</b> broadcasters see a desperate need for innovative strategies to fulfil public service obligations.

This {{is in line with}} Swedish Television’s new strategy for collaboration with society. The collaborative approach has taken many different expressions: technology development, common conferences, and programme creation. Using a critical cultural theory perspective on innovation theory, an analysis is made of the reasons for, and the consequences of, the work carried out by public service in collaboration with higher education as innovative strategy.

40|$|Mobile {{networks}} have evolved enormously {{over the last}} past decades and nowadays convergence with fixed networks is quite normal. However, traditional GSM networks are not suited best for the transfer of IP traffic, since technical limitations prohibit high bandwidth connections. Therefore the 3 GPP developed a mobile system based on evolved GSM core networks and the radio access technologies that they support. Examples of such systems are GPRS, EDGE and UMTS. Currently {{they are working on}} the specifications of the fourth generation of mobile networks, which is based on the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). IMS is an access independent framework, which is capable of delivering <b>media</b> <b>services</b> to (mobile) users. An example application is a Voice over IP connection between two connected devices, for example two smartphones. However, <b>other</b> <b>media</b> related <b>services</b> may be offered as well. Since previous mobile networks had its own security mechanisms and because IMS is an evolvement of these networks, the IMS specification initially did not offer media security. Due to the growing convergence of fixed and mobile networks {{over the last few years}} the specification has already changed over time and IMS has become access network independent, which led to the term Common IMS. Because of this access network independency property, media security became a real issue, since not every access network has a security mechanism build in, e. g. cable networks. Therefore the 3 GPP is looking for a solution and has already done several proposals. This thesis discusses which of the proposed solutions matches the stated 3 GPP requirements best and looks how the architecture of IMS is impacted by the implementation of those solutions. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the fast}} growth of social <b>media</b> <b>services,</b> {{vast amount of}} user-generated content with time-space stamps are {{produced}} everyday. Considerable amount of these data are publicly available online, some of which collectively convey information that are of interest to data analysts. Social media data are dynamic and unstructured by nature, which makes it very hard for analysts to efficiently and effectively retrieve useful information. Social Media Analytics Reporting Toolkit (SMART), a system developed at Purdue VACCINE lab, aims to support such analyzing. The current framework collects real-time Twitter messages and visualizes volume densities on a map. It uses Latent Dirichilet Allocation (LDA) to extract regional topics and can optionally apply Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) to detect abnormal events. While Twitter has {{a fair amount of}} active users, they account for a small portion of total active social media users. Data generated by many <b>other</b> social <b>media</b> <b>services</b> are not currently utilized by SMART. Therefore, my work focused on expanding data sources of SAMRT system by creating means to collect data from other sources such as Facebook and Instagram. During a test run using a collection of 88 specified keywords in search, over two million Facebook posts were collected in one week. Besides, current SMART framework utilizes only one topic model, i. e. LDA, which is considered to be slower than Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) model, thus I also put my effort into integrating NMF algorithm into the system. The improved SMART system can be used to fulfill a variety of analyzing tasks such as monitoring regional social media responses from different sources in disastrous events, detecting user reported crimes and so on.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} Context Manager to resolve {{conflicts}} for Context-aware <b>Media</b> <b>services</b> in smart home environments. Conflicts arise when multiple users access a <b>Media</b> <b>service</b> or when various <b>Media</b> <b>services</b> share limited resources to provide customized responses. In order to resolve conflicts among users, the Context Manager sums up preferences of users who collide {{with each other}} and recommends specific contents ordered by the summed preference. It also resolves conflicts among <b>Media</b> <b>services</b> by selecting a <b>Media</b> <b>service</b> with the highest preference. Furthermore, Context Manager resolves conflicts among <b>Media</b> <b>services</b> occupied by users with the <b>Media</b> <b>service</b> recommendation. During experiments on ubiHome, a smart home test-bed, the proposed method resolved conflicts among users and <b>Media</b> <b>services</b> while giving higher satisfaction to users than a resolution method selecting a specific user. Therefore, we expect the proposed management method can {{play a vital role in}} Context-aware <b>Media</b> <b>services</b> for offering personalized services to users by resolving <b>service</b> conflicts among <b>Media</b> <b>services</b> as well as users...|$|R

However, little work has explored the content of <b>other</b> so-cial <b>media</b> <b>services,</b> or compared content across two net-works during real world events. We believe that social me-dia platforms like Facebook also {{play a vital role in}} dis-seminating information on the Internet during real world events. In this work, we study and characterize the content posted on the world’s biggest social network, Facebook, and present a comparative analysis of Facebook and Twitter con-tent posted during 16 real world events. Contrary to existing notion that Facebook is used mostly as a private network, our findings reveal that more than 30 % of public content that was present on Facebook during these events, was also present on Twitter. We then performed qualitative analysis on the content spread by the most active users during these events, and found that over 10 % of the most active users on both networks post spam content. We used stylometric features from Facebook posts and tweet text to classify this spam content, and were able to achieve an accuracy of over 99 % for Facebook, and over 98 % for Twitter. This work is aimed at providing researchers with an overview of Face-book content during real world events, and serve as basis for more in-depth exploration of its various aspects like infor-mation quality, and credibility during real world events...|$|R
