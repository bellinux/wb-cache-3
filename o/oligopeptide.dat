40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to inhibit {{specifically}} one type of gap junction channel in cells expressing multiple connexins (Cx) using synthetic <b>oligopeptides.</b> A 7 r 5 cells (an aortic smooth muscle cell line expressing Cx 40 and Cx 43) were incubated overnight with synthetic <b>oligopeptides</b> (P 180 - 195) corresponding to a segment of the second extracellular loop of Cx 43. This segment is different in sequence from the corresponding location in Cx 40. P 180 - 195 (500 μM) decreased cell-to-cell coupling as assessed by dye coupling and dual whole-cell voltage clamp. The decrease in permeability and junctional conductance was caused by selective inhibition of Cx 43 gap junction channels. In contrast, overnight incubation of A 7 r 5 cells with <b>oligopeptides</b> corresponding to a segment of the intracellular cytoplasmic tail of Cx 43 was without effect. These results indicate that <b>oligopeptides</b> P 180 - 195 may interact with the extracellular domain of the Cx 43 protein, thereby possibly mimicking connexin-connexin binding.
