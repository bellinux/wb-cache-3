40|$|In 2007, Duke University {{signed the}} American College & University Presidents’ Climate Commitment, {{committing}} the University {{to develop an}} institutional plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2024. Achieving this goal will require Duke University to offset approximately 183, 000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) in 2024. To address this challenge, the University established the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative in 2009 to procure carbon offsets that prioritize investment in local and regional carbon offset projects that yield significant environmental, social and economic benefits beyond greenhouse gas emission reductions. The Offsets Initiative is currently assessing the feasibility of purchasing or developing forestry-based carbon offset projects in North Carolina and the Southeast region. From the perspective of Duke University, this report assesses the financial implications of forestry carbon <b>offset</b> <b>procurement.</b> Specifically, this report analyzes two potential investment opportunities: an existing afforestation project and a hypothetical avoided conversion project. Each project analysis begins with a project overview and identifies key players to understand incentive structures and assess qualitative project risks. Following this qualitative description, a quantitative analysis is performed to determine the levelized cost per offset (LCO) in present value terms to Duke University and to further assess additional risks and mitigation strategies. The analyses do not attempt to quantify intangible benefits such as educational, research, or ecosystem co-benefit values. Rather the financial analyses are intended to compliment the Offsets Initiative’s larger feasibility study on forestry carbon offsets. The analyses show both projects as potential candidates for long-term investments. The afforestation project has low project risk and provides sufficient offset supply to meet the University’s need. Additionally, the LCO is low relative to substitute over-the-counter forestry offsets. However, the project requires high upfront investment and exposes Duke University to price risk. This risk may be mitigated through {{the purchase of a}} real option from the project developer. The avoided conversion project is found to require little upfront investment and may produce a large offset supply if scaled up. However, sensitivity analysis performed on key parameters derived from the tax equity project finance structure produces a wide range of possible LCOs. Duke University can better understand its LCO by first performing an assessment on the tax equity value to determine if the project is financially feasible...|$|E

A theoretical model capturing the nature of this protective measure is developed.

While incumbents attributed such undercutting to entrants' lower costs from non-compliance with the law, 'generics' counterargued that incumbents' high prices stemmed from unilateral market power rather than cost heterogeneity. By estimating a structural model, I can single-handedly explain established brands' high prices through low equilibrium price elasticities of demand.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{practice}} of governments imposing domestic content based requirements known as “offsets” on suppliers {{in order to secure}} public procurement contracts. Known to cause distortions in international trade, offsets are forbidden under the WTO’s GPA and in the procurement chapters of several RTAs, although these restrictions have severe limitations with full offset prohibitions only accepted by a handful of developed countries. Given the sensitivity of procurement policy and the need to stimulate local economies, Asian countries in particular show an unwillingness to address offsets in their international agreements. While other WTO agreements restrain the use of local content rules, these regimes are ill-suited to control the harmful effects of <b>offsets</b> in a <b>procurement</b> context because of their focus on traditional commercial markets. The article suggests that an enlargement of offset prohibitions would be advisable given the expected expansion of global procurement markets commensurate with economic development...|$|R
40|$|Background: When governments procure {{fighter jets}} from {{international}} suppliers, offsets frequently occur. In 2009, the European Commission issued Defence and Security Directive 2009 / 81 /EC – {{a first step}} to incorporate the defence sector into the European single-market model. The regulation has changed the circumstances on the fighter market by limiting the use of offsets. Whether the fighter market, or the defence sector, is able to adjust to these changes remain unanswered. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate and analyse the role of <b>offsets</b> in <b>procurements</b> of fighter jets, to get a better understanding of the present situation at the fighter market where the EU attempts to ban offset agreements. Research method: This study uses a qualitative method. Seven interviews with employees at Saab Aeronautics were carried through. In addition to the interviews, a literature study was conducted on defence markets, offsets and the European context. The gathered material was thereafter analysed with selected theories of institutional and transaction cost economics, as well as previous research in order to fulfil the purpose of the study. Conclusion: The study concludes that offsets can be seen as a by-product of the existing market imperfections and political transactions, and therefore a natural component in procurements of fighter jets. Certain forms of offset can be used by purchasing governments to neutralize existing market imperfections and lower the transaction costs. However, this is only one dimension to offsets since they may appear in several forms with different purposes and risks attached to them. The institutional change on the European fighter market will produce both winners and losers in the years to come. Whether eliminating offsets will lead to a more open and transparent fighter market remains ambiguou...|$|R

This study {{sought to}} describe Turkish defense <b>offsets</b> in foreign <b>procurements.</b> Located at the epicenter of regions fraught with crisis, Turkiye is a secular, democratic, liberal country sharing western moral values. With the tradition of its 1, 000 years of statehood, its constitutional order, and its strong armed forces, Turkiye is a center of power that can affect delicate balances {{of power in the}} region. Offsets started to become an important way of obtaining industrial and technological benefits when importing military equipment in the early and mid- 1980 s. Offset deals remain an important aspect of Turkish arms importing policy and offset applications in Turkish foreign <b>procurements</b> show that <b>offsets</b> are likely to appear increasingly in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the study of Turkish defense offsets is important. The history of offsets is introduced for the background of this research. As a major user of U.

40|$|In {{addition}} to efficacy and safety, cost {{is an important}} determinant {{of the use of}} glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In PCI, the average procurement cost of GPIIb/IIIa therapy ranges from $US 400 to $US 1500 (1999 values) per patient treated, depending on agent, dose and duration of infusion. Prospective economic substudies with abciximab and tirofiban have demonstrated subsequent cost savings that partially <b>offset</b> the <b>procurement</b> costs of the agents. The drug procurement costs per death or myocardial infarction (MI) prevented in PCI appear to vary from $US 10 500 to $US 37 000, depending on the agent. Abciximab has been proven to provide a survival benefit in the setting of PCI, including coronary stenting. Analyses of abciximab use yield cost-effectiveness ratios of $US 2875 to $US 14 765 per life-year or quality-adjusted life-year saved, which compares favourably with most widely accepted therapies. In non-ST-segment elevation ACS, drug procurement costs range from $US 700 to $US 1700 per patient treated, also depending on agent, dose and duration of infusion. Evidence of cost offsets from changes in subsequent resource utilisation are limited and seem contingent upon a conservative risk-stratification approach. Drug procurement costs have been calculated as $US 32 000 to $US 82 000 per death or MI prevented in the ACS trials. Cost-effectiveness ratios of $US 16 000 per life-year saved for the US and Western European cohorts in the Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy (PURSUIT) trial are favourable. If these analyses prove correct, the cost effectiveness of GPIIb/IIIa receptor therapy for patients with non-ST-segment elevation ACS will also compare favourably with other widely accepted therapies in industrialised countries. More clinical and economic data are necessary to allow better selection of specific patients who will receive the most benefit from GPIIb/IIIa therapy in healthcare systems with limited resources.

The only {{existing}} offset {{agreement has}} been signed with Alstom {{which won the}} contract to build Morocco’s high-speed train system and which is also responsible {{for the construction of}} tram networks in Rabat and Casablanca. In January the company signed an agreement with the government that will see it establish a local production base for cabling and electronic components, creating 5000 jobs over 10 years, as well as establishing a rail sector training institute. Alstom also signalled its intention to step up purchases from Moroccan suppliers and service providers (such as local back-office offshoring services), for use in projects in other countries as well. To stimulate its industry, the government is working on a new <b>procurement</b> <b>offset</b> (compensation industrielle) policy. Under the policy reportedly being developed by the minister for industry and trade, foreign companies that win government tenders worth more than Dh200m (€17.69m) will be obliged to carry out local investments and purchases worth at least 50% {{of the value of the}} contracts. The measure is intended to boost the local industrial sector by ensuring that foreign companies invest locally, use local subcontractors and locally made products, and transfer technology to the country.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes offset {{arrangements in}} government <b>procurement.</b> <b>Offsets</b> are nonstandard contracts that oblige a foreign seller to provide extra {{benefits to the}} purchasing government 2 ̆ 7 s economy {{as a condition for}} the sale of goods and services. In many instances, governments prefer to realize these benefits in the form of in-kind-transfer instead of bargaining for discounts of the sale price. I employ the theoretical tools of the new institutional economics to explain why governments are electing to leave the price margin for some types of purchases, and to determine under what economic settings offsets are an efficient policy instrument. The new institutional economics approach is well suited for this study because it highlights three factors—transaction costs, asymmetric information, and bounded rationality—that figure prominently in government procurement of high technology goods and services. ^ In chapter 2, I define offset and examine the contractual attributes of the arrangement. Using these definitions, I then provide an historical account of offset arrangements since the 1930 s. This chapter describes how governments have modified the structure of offsets continually to accommodate different objectives. ^ Chapters 3 and 4 develop the core theory and policy implications of the dissertation. Chapter 3 introduces a model that demonstrates how offset arrangements may support exchange by reducing transaction costs. In chapter 4, I present a policy matrix that offers general guidelines for <b>procurement</b> officers considering <b>offsets.</b> This study will probably be of practical value to the 130 governments currently experimenting with offsets. An important finding is that mandatory offset programs are advised only for a subset of government purchases. ^ In chapter 5, I introduce an empirical model to test recent theoretical claims in the literature. Using a rich data set of three years of offset transactions, I estimate an econometric model that supports the view that offsets are the outcome of transaction cost economizing and political economy variables. Chapter 6 is a case study of the state of Maryland 2 ̆ 7 s offset program. It affords us the opportunity to examine potential strategies for firms facing large offset obligations. ...|$|R
40|$|Offset is {{compensation}} {{given to}} a buyer country for an arms sale. Initially perceived as ‘necessary evil’ in an imperfect defence market, it now serves dual purposes: a marketing strategy for defence industry and a procurement policy for buyer country to generate add on benefits from arms import. Offsets proliferate, and so are stricter mandatory government policies. Still evaluation of offset has been difficult, mostly done in a country-based setting using anecdotal evidence that result in mixed findings. Following the issuance of mandatory offset policy in Indonesia through Law on Defence Industry in 2012, evaluation of past and current offset practice have become not only relevant but also critical to provide policy feedback. This dissertation provides an empirical examination on how offset has been understood and practised in Indonesia, and its contribution to defence industrialisation. The timeframe chosen is 1988 - 2014, when countertrade {{has been used to}} support the lifecycle of strategic industries: development (1988 - 1998), survival (1999 - 2009), and revitalisation (2010 - 2014). This study derives its validity and reliability from triangulation, comprising secondary data, survey, and case study. Three variables are analysed: technology development through ‘strategic industries’, defence offset, and defence industrialisation. Technology development focuses on how technology policy centred on a strategic industries paradigm and ladder of production to initiate industrialisation push. Defence offset discusses the conceptual and practical aspects of offset in Indonesia, including strategic objectives, regulation and institution frameworksin the defence <b>procurement</b> context, and <b>offset</b> life cycle and financing. Defence industrialisation discusses the impact of offset through employment, skill enhancement, transfer of technology, export promotion, domestic supply chain creation, and R&D. Field works were conducted in three firms representing different industrial sectors: PT DI (aerospace), PT Pal (shipbuilding), and PT Pindad (landsystem). Research findings indicate that, first, offset practice has mostly taken place on an ad hoc basis, with no clear reference to strategic objectives, as well as long-term management and financing- that mirror deficiencies in defence procurement. Second, as result of the deficiencies, offset results have been varied from one firm to another, across the different industrial sectors of aerospace, maritime, as well as ammunition and land system. While offset has a positive impact on skill enhancement and technology transfer, it seldom translates into new employment, supply chain creation, export, or R&D. This study generates the following recommendations. First, Indonesia needs to strengthen the management of offset through pre-offset planning and preparing practical guidelines for offset stakeholders in parallel with human resources to support the programme. This means identification of <b>offset</b> potential in <b>procurement</b> (convergence of long term technology policy and long term defence procurement plan), estimation of offset premium cost, allowing participation of industry in the early stage of the offset cycle, as well as devising methods of evaluating offset. Second, Indonesia needs to formulate strategic objectives for offset that relate closely to the dual purposes of defence modernisation and industry revitalisation. Third, Indonesia must strengthen the technology absorptive capability in industry in order to sustain the benefit of offset...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is worthy}} {{to return to}} the {{surprising}} and preemptive exclusion of Patria. It could not have been on technical problems, since Patria AMV was a vehicle more tested than Pandur.Before Portugal´s purchase there were only few prototypes of Pandur II. On the other hand, Patria sold AMV to many countries: Finland, Poland, Croatia, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Slovenia.The exclusion of Patria AMV put Portugal in the awkward condition to have to negotiate with one supplier only. Portugal moved from a situation of monopsony (only one buyer and many sellers -typical of arms procurement) to a situation of monopoly (only one seller).It has been stated that Patria proposed the only vehicle that did not show the requested operational capabilities. The fact that the company gave its price offer after the deadline, knowing that this might have disqualified Patria from the tender, was also interpreted as a desire to avoid the final tests with the Portuguese Military, since the results could have harmed Patria's international image. However. this interpretation of Patria´s intentions is not consistent with Patria´s successive actions, especially with Patria´s public legal appeal against the decision of the Ministry of Defense. If a company wants to go unnoticed, it does not make such a public statement against the Portuguese real motivations for the elimination of Patria.After the elimination of Patria in 2004, Portugal was effectively left with one competitor, that is, General Dynamics Pandur vs.General Dynamics Piranha, GD vs. GD. At this point, the only factor that had actual weight for the Ministry of Defense was the offset proposal. Most of the serious problems on Pandur procurement pertain to the offset package offered by General Dynamics. Patria had claimed it was unrealistic, and time has shown that Patria was right. They claimed also that General Dynamics offset package was intentionally misleading, and this was an understatement.Fabrequipa, direct offset, is the most known case. General Dynamics transferred the Pandur production to Czech Republic, blaming the global economic crisis for their breach of the Pandur offset contract. The case of Tecnia Lda of Torres Vedras is connected to an indirect offset, that General Dynamics based in a LGT branch in Luxembourg. It was supposed to support Portuguese environmental and water technologies sales in Saudi Arabia and it is the most embarrassing of all Portuguese contractual violations related to the offset program. The destruction of Tecnia to justify the issuing offset certificates exposes the ways General Dynamics conceives offset contracts and offset fulfillment in Europe.The problem of the weight of <b>offset</b> in the <b>procurement</b> decisions is not exclusively Portuguese. It is a European plague. In the European horizon one can understand what happened in the Pandur procurement between 2003 and 2005 by looking at the Slovenian case, {{that is one of the}} many battles in the commercial war between Patria and General Dynamics European Land Systems. In 2008 Jorma Wiitakorpi (Patria CEO) was arrested in Finland and charged with bribery and industrial espionage. [...] Portuguese Pandur offset agreement demonstrates the urgency of a European reform to enforce Lisbon Treaty article 346, and the European convention against corruption involving officials.|$|R
