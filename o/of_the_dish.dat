5|$|Avocado brownies are brownies {{prepared}} using avocado as {{a primary}} ingredient. The use of overripe avocados {{may contribute to the}} gooey, fudge-like consistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b> Black beans can be used in the dish, and can be used in the place of flour.|$|E

5|$|Shakshuka, a North-African (Tunisian) dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, is a {{national}} favorite, especially in the winter.

5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh vegetarian sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs. The earliest published mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> is from the 1850s in the book Wild Wales by George Borrow, although earlier records in the Glamorgan Archives show a version which contains pork. The modern vegetarian version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E

50|$|Chinese Indonesian cuisine (Masakan Tionghoa Indonesia) is {{characterized}} by <b>the</b> mixture <b>of</b> Chinese with local Indonesian style.

50|$|A dish of stir-fried rice noodles {{is thought}} {{by some to}} have been {{introduced}} to Ayutthaya during <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ayutthaya Kingdom by Chinese traders,and subsequently altered to reflect Thai flavor profiles. Others believe that <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> is <b>of</b> Vietnamese origin, and <b>the</b> etymology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish's</b> name suggests it.|$|R
5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> are unclear. The name {{most likely}} {{derives from the}} French anges à cheval, and {{there appears to be}} no {{significance}} in the oyster/angel and bacon/horse links. Its first occurrence, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and other sources, is in 1888, in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included the price of the pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b> However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records {{from other parts of the}} country, as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and leaned toward lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is {{to add to the}} flavor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish,</b> rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
50|$|Cocktail {{sauce is}} one of several types of cold or room {{temperature}} sauces often served as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish(es)</b> referred to as seafood cocktail or as a condiment with other seafoods.

30|$|However, we {{must admit}} that recipes do evolve, often as an effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dishes</b> {{prepared}} after them. <b>The</b> evolution <b>of</b> recipes, in turn, has important consequences on <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> their authenticity. See Borghini (2015).|$|R
5|$|The dish is {{traditionally}} held to have originated {{from the village}} of Mousehole in Cornwall and {{is traditionally}} eaten during the festival of Tom Bawcock's Eve to celebrate his heroic catch during a very stormy winter. According to the modern festival, which is combined with the Mousehole village illuminations, the entire catch was baked into a huge stargazy pie, encompassing seven types of fish and saving the village from starvation. The story of Bawcock was popularised by Antonia Barber's children's book The Mousehole Cat, which featured the star-gazy pie. In 2007 contestant Mark Hix won the BBC's Great British Menu with a variant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and the price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish</b> has gone down significantly.|$|E
5|$|Carrot soup can be {{prepared}} as a cream-style soup and as a broth-style soup. Vegetable stock or chicken stock {{can be used as}} ingredients in both styles of soup. Other vegetables may be used in the dish, including root vegetables, the latter of which may include garlic onion, shallot, potato, turnip and others. Carrot juice and orange juice can be used in its preparation, and some versions are prepared using puréed carrot. After cooking, the dish can be run through a sieve to strain it. The carrots used can be peeled or unpeeled, and the use of peeled carrots can lend to increased smoothness in puréed versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dish.</b> Those prepared with puréed carrot may have a thick consistency while also being smooth in texture. The soup's color can vary based upon the coloration of the carrots used. Young carrots tend to make the soup sweeter and imbue it with a bright orange coloration, while older, larger carrots provide less sweetness and may imbue a yellow coloration. The use of old, cracked carrots that have a woody texture in their interior can produce a soup of inferior quality.|$|E
