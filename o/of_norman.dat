5|$|The {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>Norman</b> {{continued to}} the east, {{and later to}} the east-southeast as it interacted with a tropical disturbance {{off the coast of}} Mexico. Initially, re-development <b>of</b> <b>Norman</b> was not expected, as the disturbance was instead given the possibility for further development. On October 13, the NHC noted that the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Norman</b> were merging with the disturbance to its east; during the interaction, convection redeveloped and organized around the remnant low <b>of</b> <b>Norman,</b> and early on October 15 it reformed into a tropical depression, near the coast of southwestern Mexico. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, Norman was predicted to re-attain tropical storm status before moving ashore. However, the center quickly became less-organized, turning northward and northwestward within the larger tropical disturbance. Late on October 15, it is estimated Tropical Depression Norman dissipated 23miles (37km) south and offshore of Manzanillo, Colima, although satellite imagery suggested the center may have dissipated inland.|$|E
