25|$|The stapes (stirrup) <b>ossicle</b> bone of {{the middle}} ear transmits {{vibrations}} to the fenestra ovalis (oval window) {{on the outside of the}} cochlea, which vibrates the perilymph in the vestibular duct (upper chamber of the cochlea). The ossicles are essential for efficient coupling of sound waves into the cochlea, since the cochlea environment is a fluid–membrane system, and it takes more pressure to move sound through fluid–membrane waves than it does through air; a pressure increase is achieved by the area ratio of the tympanic membrane to the oval window, resulting in a pressure gain of about 20 from the original sound wave pressure in air. This gain is a form of impedance matching – to match the soundwave travelling through air to that travelling in the fluid–membrane system.|$|E
500|$|The water {{vascular}} {{system of the}} starfish is a hydraulic system {{made up of a}} network of fluid-filled canals and is concerned with locomotion, adhesion, food manipulation and gas exchange. Water enters the system through the madreporite, a porous, often conspicuous, sieve-like <b>ossicle</b> on the aboral surface. It is linked through a stone canal, often lined with calcareous material, to a ring canal around the mouth opening. A set of radial canals leads off this; one radial canal runs along the [...] groove in each arm. There are short lateral canals branching off alternately to either side of the radial canal, each ending in an ampulla. These bulb-shaped organs are joined to tube feet (podia) on the exterior of the animal by short linking canals that pass through ossicles in the ambulacral groove. There are usually two rows of tube feet but in some species, the lateral canals are alternately long and short and there appear to be four rows. The interior of the whole canal system is lined with cilia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{skull of}} the snake {{consists}} of a solid and complete neurocranium, to which {{many of the other}} bones are only loosely attached, particularly the highly mobile jaw bones, which facilitate manipulation and ingestion of large prey items. The left and right sides of the lower jaw are joined only by a flexible ligament at the anterior tips, allowing them to separate widely, while the posterior end of the lower jaw bones articulate with a quadrate bone, allowing further mobility. The bones of the mandible and quadrate bones can also pick up ground borne vibrations. [...] Because the sides of the jaw can move independently of one another, snakes resting their jaws on a surface have sensitive stereo hearing which can detect the position of prey. The jaw-quadrate-stapes pathway is capable of detecting vibrations on the angstrom scale, despite the absence of an outer ear and the <b>ossicle</b> mechanism of impedance matching used in other vertebrates to receive vibrations from the air.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether autologous os-sicles {{can be safely}} used in ossicular reconstruction in cholesteatoma surgery after attempting cholestea-toma removal under the operating microscope. Study Design: A prospective fine-section histological study of formalin-stored <b>ossicles,</b> harvested from cholestea-tomatous ears, to evaluate for existence of residual cholesteatoma after surface disease clearance under the operating microscope. Methods: One hundred four <b>ossicles</b> were harvested from 76 patients with cholesteatoma for the study. These malleus heads and incudes were categorized into three groups: group 1, <b>ossicles</b> with retained shape and useful bulk, treated by microscopic stripping alone; group 2, <b>ossicles</b> with retained shape and useful bulk, treated by micro-scopic stripping and drilling; and group 3, badly eroded <b>ossicles,</b> treated by microscopic stripping alone. These treated <b>ossicles</b> were then subjected to 4 -m histopathological study. Results: Residual dis-ease was identified in 6 of the 104 <b>ossicles.</b> Residual disease was found only in badly eroded <b>ossicles</b> that are not suitable for reconstruction. All the usable os-sicles were free of disease. Conclusions: Autologous <b>ossicles</b> that have retained body and bulk are safe to use for reconstruction after surface stripping under the operating microscope.

50|$|Ossicles {{are created}} intracellularly by {{specialised}} secretory cells known as sclerocytes in the dermis {{of the body}} wall of echinoderms. Each <b>ossicle</b> is composed of microcrystals of calcite arranged in a three-dimensional lattice known as a stereom. Under polarized light the <b>ossicle</b> behaves {{as if it were}} a single crystal because the axes of all the crystals are parallel. The space between the crystals is known as the stroma and allows entry to sclerocytes for enlargement and repair. The honeycomb structure is light but tough and collagenous ligaments connect the ossicles together. The ossicles are embedded in a tough connective tissue which is also part of the endoskeleton. When an <b>ossicle</b> becomes redundant, specialised cells known as phagocytes are able to reabsorb the calcareous material. All the ossicles, even those that protrude from the body wall, are covered by a thin layer of epidermis but functionally they act more like an exoskeleton than an endoskeleton.|$|E

50|$|A frog’s ear drum {{works in}} {{very much the}} same way as does a human ear drum. It is a {{membrane}} that is stretched across a ring of cartilage like a snare drum that vibrates. Crossing the middle ear chamber there is an <b>ossicle</b> called the columella that is connected to the tympanum, and another <b>ossicle,</b> the operculum, that connects this to the oval membrane. This separates the middle ear from the inner ear; and its movements are reflected in vibrations in the fluid in the inner ear; these vibrations cause microscopic hairs to move, which send signals to the frog’s brain. A frog's lungs are also involved in the reception of sound, although they are less sensitive than the frog's ear drums.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{morphology}} {{of stomach}} <b>ossicles</b> of decapod crustaceans provides valuable {{information on their}} phylogeny and biology. We herein described ten new <b>ossicles</b> in the foreguts of two trichodactylid crabs, Sylviocarcinus pictus (H. Milne-Edwards, 1853) and Valdivia serrata White, 1847, in addition to previously described 38 <b>ossicles,</b> which are also recognized and listed. Five specimens each of S. pictus and V. serrata were selected for morphological analysis of gastric <b>ossicles.</b> The stomachs were obtained after removing the carapace, and they were fixed in 10 % formalin for 24 hours. After this procedure, the stomachs were immersed in a solution of 10 % Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) and heated to 100 °C during 60 minutes for tissue maceration. At this point, the clean skeletons were colored by adding 1 % Alizarin Red to the KOH solution {{in order to facilitate}} visualization of the internal structures such as the setae and <b>ossicles.</b> The ten new <b>ossicles</b> are: dorsomedial cardiac plate; dorsolateral cardiac plate; suprapectineal lateral ossicle; inferior cardiac valve; lateral mesopyloric ossicle; ampullary roof-medium portion ossicle; process of the ampullary roof-upper portion; lateral-inferior post-ampullary plate; pleuro-pyloric valve’s ossicle; and lateral pleuro-pyloric plate. Some <b>ossicles</b> are thin plates that together with the main <b>ossicles</b> assist in the structure and support of the stomach, which are similar in the two species studied herein. The current knowledge on gastric <b>ossicles</b> will be useful in establishing taxonomic characters, which can evaluate phylogenetic relationships among brachyuran crabs...|$|R
