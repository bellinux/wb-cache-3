40|$|In this chapter, {{published}} geochemical {{data for}} soils from several Pb–Zn mine sites and districts from Spain are reviewed. Although {{most of the}} mines have closed down, a legacy of highly polluted soils still remains throughout the sites constituting a potential hazard for the environment and human health. The fate of the studied metals and metalloids in these soils is mainly controlled by factors such as mining methods, concentration and metallurgical operations, mineralogy of the <b>ore,</b> <b>gangue</b> and host rock, fracturing of the host rocks, physiography, climate, and soil types (pedogenic evolution). It can be concluded that the most polluted soils (identified {{on the basis of}} an enrichment factor) are those of the Sierra Minera (La Unión District – SE Spain), at more than 488 (Pb), 163 (Zn), 99 (Cd), and 1698 (As) times the background values from non-contaminated soils. Pb is usually related to As, which in turn is bound to Fe oxides and oxyhydroxides. Metal bearing jarosite and other soluble phases also play a relevant role in the studied soil–water systems, because these minerals are dissolved during intense rainy events, thus resulting in high rates of metal leaching and mobilization by runoff...|$|E
40|$|The {{blast furnace}} (BF) {{is widely used}} {{all over the world}} to produce high quality iron with high {{efficiency}} and low energy consumption. Blast furnace slag, formed by <b>ore</b> <b>gangue,</b> coke ash and flux, plays an important role in BF operation. In order to have a smooth operation and higher production, the slag should have some characteristics, such as small volume, easy slag-metal separation, good desulphurization capacity, stable composition, good fluidity and so on. Viscosity is one of the important physical properties to obtain the optimum slag composition. If the viscosity is too high, it will be hard for burden to descend and gas to rise. And the separation of slag-metal will slow down which leads to a bad operation and low production. Hence, it is important to control the viscosity of the slags for optimum BF operation. The aim of the present study was to develop an accurate and reliable viscosity model for the iron-making industry. Development of a reliable viscosity model requires accurate viscosity measurements. Although a large number of experimental data of viscosity have been reported, they have to be evaluated before they are used for the optimisation of the viscosity model...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{metamorphism}} of cupriferous {{iron sulfide}} deposits occurring in mahc vol-canic {{rocks in the}} Notre Dame Bay area of Newfoundland results in conspicuous changes in <b>ore</b> and <b>gangue</b> mineral assemblages. Formerly chloritic and sericitic host rocks are represented in the hornblende-hornfels facies by cordierire ñ anthophyllite ñ biotite ñ andalusite rocks. Pyritic ores in the low-grade greenschist facies are repre-sented by pyrrhotite- and magnetite-bearing ores in the hornblende-hornfels facies. Gangue chlorites from all deposits in the chlorite zone of the greenschist facies are Fe rich, display {{a wide range of}} composition, and are more Fe rich than chlorites outside the <b>ore</b> zones. <b>Gangue</b> ferromagnesian silicates in the hornblende-hornfels facies, on the other hand, are Mg rich but less so near the periphery of the ore zones. Systematic relationships between iron sulfide minerals and silicate compositions suggest that equil-ibration of sulfides and ferromagnesian silicates occurred during metamorphlsm. In the Gull Pond ores, copious pyrrhotite and magnetite and more Mg rich ferromagnesian silicate compositions can be accounted for by removal of iron from the silicate fraction by reactions involving pyrite and iron-rich ferromagnesian silicates...|$|R
40|$|Major {{and trace}} element {{contents}} in sulfide <b>ores,</b> <b>gangue</b> minerals and rock {{samples from the}} Arinteiro deposits hosted in metaophiolites of western Galicia were determined. S isotope ratios of selected sulfides were also analysed. Polymetallic orebodies, represented by abundant pyrrhotite, subordinate chalcopyrite and sphalerite, and rare pyrite, underwent metamorphic recrystallization, probably during the last stage of the Hercynian orogenesis {{as suggested by the}} K/Ar radiometric ages ascertained on host rocks (261 275 ± 20 Ma). Recrystallization took place at about 400 °C and 5. 5 kbar, log aS 2 was generally - 7 atm or lower, log am was about - 30 atm, and pH ranged mainly from 4. 4 to 4. 9. The Co/Ni values and Se contents of the sulfides are consistent with the inferred volcano-sedimentary origin of the deposit, and 834 S (about 0 % 0) indicates that the source of S was magmatic.

5000|$|In the Middle Ages {{until the}} start of the Early Modern Period the ore was broken up above ground using sledges and sorted by hand into silver, lead and copper <b>ores</b> and <b>gangue.</b> The {{pounding}} stones (Pochsteine) or stamps used have occasionally been found in recent times during archaeological excavations. The use of water power increased {{around the turn of the}} 16th and 17th centuries and it began to be employed in processing to enrich the ore concentration. On the one hand water was used as an energy source; on the other it was used to wash out the unwanted clay and to separate <b>ore</b> from <b>gangue</b> by making use of the different density of the minerals. The tailings from the washing process were simply emptied into the rivers of the Harz along with the used driving water. The low efficiency of the first ore processing machines resulted in a high content of heavy metals in the rivers. As a consequence of using the aforementioned water-based method of processing the stamp mills (Pochwerke) were located in the deeper river valleys. As a rule, they obtained water from the pits, where it had been used to drive water wheels and reversing wheels. Until the beginning of the industrial era, mechanical processing was carried out as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|Subsequent steps {{depend on}} the nature of the ore {{containing}} the copper and what will be extracted. For oxide ores, a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken, which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant. For sulfide ores, both secondary (supergene) and primary (hypogene), froth flotation is used to physically separate <b>ore</b> from <b>gangue.</b> For special native copper bearing ore bodies or sections of ore bodies rich in supergene native copper, this mineral can be recovered by a simple gravity circuit.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{mixing of}} the ore fluids with the seawater, {{dispersed}} across the seafloor, the <b>ore</b> constituents and <b>gangue</b> are precipitated onto the seafloor {{to form an}} orebody and mineralization halo which are congruent with the underlying stratigraphy and are generally fine grained, finely laminated and can be recognized as chemically deposited from solution.|$|R
50|$|A {{tailings}} dam is typically an earth-fill embankment dam used to store byproducts of mining operations after separating the <b>ore</b> from the <b>gangue.</b> Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, {{but due to}} cost, a {{tailings dam}} is more viable.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} separating <b>ore</b> from <b>gangue</b> consists of picking out the individual crystals of each. This {{is a very}} tedious process, particularly when the individual particles are small. Another comparatively simple method relies on the various minerals having different densities, causing them to collect in different places: metallic minerals (being heavier) will drop out of suspension more quickly than lighter ones, which will be carried further by a stream of water. The process of panning and sifting for gold uses both of these methods. Various devices known as 'buddles' were used {{to take advantage of}} this property. Later, more advanced machines were used such as the Frue vanner, invented in 1874.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} reflectance spectra, determined with an ASD Inc. TerraSpec® spectrometer, of five {{types of}} <b>ore</b> and <b>gangue</b> minerals from the Mboukoumassi sylvite deposit, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The spectral absorption features, with peaks at 999, 1077, 1206, 1237, 1524, and 1765 nm, of the ore mineral carnallite {{were found to}} be different from those of gangue minerals. Spectral comparison among carnallite samples from different sylvite deposits suggests that, in contrast to spectral shapes, the absorption features of carnallite are highly reproducible. Heating of carnallite to 400 and 750 °C, and comparing the spectra of heated and non-heated samples, indicates that spectral absorption is related to lattice hydration or addition of hydroxyl. Since carnallite undergoes deliquescence easily, the absorption features of carnallite in the 350 – 2500 nm spectrum could serve as a robust tool for carnallite identification and separation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{dispersion}} {{degree of}} the mineral {{particles in the}} pulp is especially relevant regarding {{the performance of the}} cationic reverse flotation of iron <b>ores.</b> The <b>gangue</b> minerals should remain dispersed while hematite particles should be selectively flocculated. The present study addressed determinations of dispersion degree and zeta potential of hematite in the presence of different dispersants, classified as organic polymeric (natural and synthetic), organic monomeric, and inorganic. Special attention was paid to results achieved at pH 10, used in plant practice. For natural organic polymers, correlation was observed between the dispersion degree and the increase in the negative value of zeta potential. Some synthetic organic polymers enhance the dispersion of hematite particles despite not affecting significantly the zeta potential. Sodium silicates, irrespectively of the SiO 2 /Na 2 O ratio, at pH 10, did not impact significantly either the dispersion degree or the zeta potential...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{properties}} {{and composition of}} oreforming fluids in magmatic-hydrothermal systems have been mainly characterized by studies of fluid inclusions in gangue minerals. Direct analyses of inclusion fluids trapped in ore minerals (pyrite, enargite, sphalerite, stibnite, wolframite) can be performed using near-infrared (NIR) microthermometry in combination with LA-ICP-MS analyses of individual inclusions. This study compares properties of fluid inclusions hosted in co-genetic ore (pyrite, stibnite, wolframite, enargite, sphalerite) and gangue (quartz, rhodochrosite) minerals from two magmatic-hydrothermal systems with fluid temperatures and salinities between 150 ° and 350 °C, and 0. 5 and 6 wt. % NaCl eq., respectively. Microthermometry reveals no difference in temperature and salinity records of fluid inclusions between host minerals. LA-ICP-MS analyses yield identical alkali concentrations for co-genetic <b>ore</b> and <b>gangue</b> mineral-hosted fluid inclusions, whereas chalcophile elements are strongly enriched in sulfidehosted fluid inclusions due {{to the presence of}} trapped solids attached to primary fluid inclusion cavities, or of daughter minerals that precipitate in the fluid inclusion following entrapment...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of an ore deposit that involves a hydrous fluid has four critical aspects: A {{source of the}} ore constituents, generally dispersed in magma, sedimentary rocks, etc.; the dissolving of the ore (and other) constituents in the hydrous phase; migration of the metal-bearing fluid; and the selective precipitation of the ore con-stituents in favorable environments. Many geologists have explained ore deposits by one of several "end-member " models, for each of which all four critcial aspects are mutually interdependent. Five districts are reviewed with respect o {{the origin of the}} water of the ore fluids, the origin of the dissolved constituents, the nature of the force that drives (or drove) the migrating fluids, and the possible causes for selective precipitation of the ore con-stituents. Chemical and isotopic data of the fluid phases are essential for such evalua-tions. The essential data were obtained largely by analysis of fluid inclusions in <b>ore</b> and <b>gangue</b> minerals (three mining districts), and of existing thermal fluids (two active high-metal-bearing hydrothermal systems).

50|$|In dense media {{separation}} a {{media is}} created with a density {{in between the}} density of the <b>ore</b> and <b>gangue</b> particles. When subjected to this media particles either float or sink depending on their density relative to the media. In this way the separation takes place purely on density differences and does not, in principle, relay on any other factors such as particle weight or shape. In practice, particle size and shape can affect separation efficiency. Dense medium separation can be performed using a variety of mediums. These include, organic liquids, aqueous solutions or suspensions of very fine particles in water or air. The organic liquids are typically not used due to their toxicity, difficulties in handling and relative cost. Industrially, the most common dense media is a suspension of fine magnetite and/or ferrosilicon particles. An aqueous solution as a dense medium is used in coal processing {{in the form of a}} belknap wash and suspensions in air are used in water-deficient areas, like areas of China, where sand is used to separate coal from the gangue minerals.|$|R

[...] The Gull Pond area is underlain by predominantly volcanic and pyroclastic rocks that range from Ordovician to Silurian in age. The ore body occurs within mafic volcanic rocks of the Roberts Arm Formation of probable Middle Ordovician age. These rocks are regionally metamorphosed to greenschist facies grade. They were intruded by granite-diorite bodies during the Devonian period. Numerous faults of regional scale traverse the Gull Pond area. One fault, which is only partly defined, is assumed to pass through Mineral Point. [...] The ore body has a somewhat lenticular form with a northeasterly trend and a westerly dip. It was disrupted by several faults that were, at a later stage, intruded by predominantly mafic dykes. The sulphides are associated with cordierite, andalusite, and anthophyllite assemblages. The host rock for the ore body is a chloritic cordierite rock that contains the cordierite-andalusite assemblage. This is bounded on both sides by cordierite-anthophyllite rock. Hydrothermal activity involving chloritization, silicification, and sericitization affected the zone which is now occupied by the ore body. [...] The opaque minerals occurring in the ore samples include chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, and pyrite with subordinate magnetite, ilmenite, hematite, sphalerite, galena, and one unknown mineral referred to as "X". The sulphides have replaced some of the pre-existing gangue minerals. Several textures of special interest are described. [...] On the basis of meager petrochemical data, a subtractive metasomatism, accompanied by contact metamorphism, of metabasalts is suggested as a process for {{the origin of the}} cordierite-andalusite and cordierite-anthophyllite assemblages. Despite rather non-conclusive evidence, the author proposes a modified volcanic exhalative origin of the ore body whereby the sulphides were remobilized and emplaced along the assumed fault zone at Mineral Point.

40|$|Abstract: The Late Cretaceous Silistar {{intrusion}} comprises of gabbros, gabbro-diorites to quartz-diorites and aplites, {{that were}} emplaced into a volcano-sedimentary succession of similar age. Structural {{data suggest that}} this intrusion {{is part of a}} larger, partially exposed body. A dense network of primary and secondary joints, in many places filled with various <b>ore</b> and <b>gangue</b> minerals, is a conspicuous feature of the intrusion. Hydrothermal alteration affecting the intrusion and the wall rocks includes: uralitization (amphibole–epidote), secondary biotitization and propylitization. Propylitic alteration occurred in two stages: high temperature (epidote-actinolite-chlorite) and middle to low temperature (sericite-chlorite-carbonate-epidote and chlorite-sericite-carbonate). Products of later alteration events include quartz-adularia, quartz-carbonate, carbonate, quartz-zeolites and zeolites. Apart from previously recognized contact-metasomatic mineralization, the presence of stockwork-type and disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization, hosted by both the intrusion and the host rocks, is documented here. Two types of magnetite and pyrite (magmatic and metasomatic) are recognized. Based upon the alteration products and ore minerals, the presence of two differing zones is suggested. The first zone, which closely coincides with the intrusion, is potassic and hosts py-ma-cpy-hm-(ilm). The second zone is propylitic with py-ma-cpy-hm-(ilm) +(sph+ga) +(bo+hz).

40|$|Koryu is an epithermal gold-silver {{quartz vein}} deposit n southwestern Hokkaido, Japan. The deposit occurs in an east-west hear zone within Miocene black mudstone.

K-Ar ages for adularia from veins 1 and 3 are 0. 8 to 1. 2 Ma, indicating a Pleistocene age of mineralization. Based on crosscutting relationships and mineral parageneses, the veins appear to have formed during two mineralization epochs. The earlier event is further divided into three stages (E-I,-II,-Ill), whereas even stages can be distinguished in the later event (L-I,-II,-Ill,-IV,-V,-VI,-VII).

During the Cu-rich mineralization stage, a drop in salinity to 2 wt. % NaCl equiv. at temperature ~ 280 °C, precedes locally developed phase separation, witnessed by coexisting vapor-rich and liquid-rich FI with similar Th but with higher salinity (2. 5 to 7 wt. % NaCl equiv.).
