5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> segmentations(partitions) is a {{multiscale}} set {{representation of}} the image. This paper introduces {{a new set of}} scale space operators or transformations on the space <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies</b> <b>of</b> partitions. An ordering <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies</b> is proposed which is endowed by an ω-ordering based on a global energy over the classes <b>of</b> the <b>hierarchy.</b> A class <b>of</b> Matheron semigroups are shown to exists in this ordering <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies.</b> A second contribution is the saliency transformation which fuses a saliency function corresponding to a hierarchy, with an external function, rendering a new or transformed saliency function. The results are demonstrated on the Berkeley dataset. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a discussion on}} implicational hierarchies. It presents the examples <b>of</b> typological <b>hierarchies</b> and considers in turn syntactic, morphosyntactic, and lexical hierarchies. A well-known syntactic hierarchy is the Accessibility Hierarchy. The Agreement Hierarchy and the Animacy Hierarchy are the two well-established examples <b>of</b> morphosyntactic <b>hierarchy.</b> The Berlin and Kay Hierarchy is a famous typological hierarchy for lexis. Any proposed hierarchy must be justified by the range of data that it explains and the closeness of fit between the data and the claim made. The use <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies</b> for research on individual languages is described. The article finally deals with the extension <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and the relation <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies</b> to semantic maps...|$|R
25|$|Firstly, {{hierarchical}} architectures best {{accomplish the}} goal of ‘parsing’ a complex visual scene with many objects consisting of many parts, whose relative position may greatly vary. In this case, different elements of the system must react to different objects and parts. In hierarchical architectures, representations of parts {{at different levels of}} embedding hierarchy can be stored at different layers <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy.</b>|$|E
25|$|A common {{image is}} the scala naturae, {{the ladder of}} nature on which animals of {{different}} species occupy successively higher rungs, with humans typically at the top. A more useful approach has been to recognize that different animals may have different kinds of cognitive processes, which are better understood in terms {{of the ways in which}} they are cognitively adapted to their different ecological niches, than by positing any kind <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Since {{resolution}} {{in space and}} time is lost in each node as described above, beliefs formed by higher-level nodes represent an even larger range of space and time. This is meant to reflect the organization of the physical world as it is perceived by human brain. Larger concepts (e.g. causes, actions and objects) are perceived to change more slowly and consist of smaller concepts that change more quickly. Jeff Hawkins postulates that brains evolved this type <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> to match, predict, and affect the organization of the external world.|$|E

40|$|The {{power law}} is {{ubiquitous}} in natural and social phenomena, {{and is considered}} as a universal relationship between the frequency and its rank for diverse social systems. However, a general model is still lacking to interpret why these seemingly unrelated systems share great similarity. Through {{a detailed analysis of}} natural language texts and simulation experiments based on the proposed 'Hierarchical Selection Model', we found that the existence <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and human's pursuit <b>of</b> top <b>hierarchy</b> lead to the power law. Further, the power law is a statistical and emergent performance <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> and it is the universality <b>of</b> <b>hierarchies</b> that contributes to the ubiquity of the power law...|$|R

25|$|Although {{one female}} {{typically}} dominates the reproduction on one colony, {{there is strong}} evidence for co-foundress behavior among P. alternata. Occasionally, the founding of new colonies occurs from the cooperation of two or females. The females stay on the nest for {{a good portion of}} the day but rarely interact. Both co-foundresses contribute to the construction of the nest and overall protection of the colony. Though the associated females share many responsibilities equally, there is evidence that female foundresses with larger ovaries spend more time off the nest, indicating some type <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> based on reproductive ability. One advantage in associative nesting is increased offspring. The more foundresses present in a nest, the more cells and eggs are produced. Also, the presence of more than one female improves active defense of the nest.|$|E
25|$|If one forms {{a related}} type <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> based on separations instead of separators, {{in which the}} two {{children}} of the root node are roots of recursively constructed hierarchies for the two subgraphs G1 and G2 of a separation of the given graph, then the overall structure forms a branch-decomposition instead of a tree decomposition. The width of any separation in this decomposition is, again, bounded by the sum of the sizes of the separators on a path from any node to the root of the hierarchy, so any branch-decomposition formed in this way has width O(√n) and any planar graph has branchwidth O(√n). Although many other related graph partitioning problems are NP-complete, even for planar graphs, it is possible to find a minimum-width branch-decomposition of a planar graph in polynomial time.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{progression from}} simple, undifferentiated homogeneity to complex, differentiated heterogeneity was exemplified, Spencer argued, {{by the development}} of society. He developed a theory of two types of society, the militant and the industrial, which corresponded to this evolutionary progression. Militant society, structured around relationships <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and obedience, was simple and undifferentiated; industrial society, based on voluntary, contractually assumed social obligations, was complex and differentiated. Society, which Spencer conceptualised as a 'social organism' evolved from the simpler state to the more complex according to the universal law of evolution. Moreover, industrial society was the direct descendant of the ideal society developed in Social Statics, although Spencer now equivocated over whether the evolution of society would result in anarchism (as he had first believed) or whether it pointed to a continued role for the state, albeit one reduced to the minimal functions of the enforcement of contracts and external defence.|$|E

25|$|As {{seen in the}} {{dimorphism}} between queens and workers, castes can {{be determined}} based on both behavior and morphology. As part of the Epiponini tribe, A. pallipes is characterized by being neotropical, polygynous and in relative abundance. The queens’ primary job is to reproduce whereas the workers are charged with foraging for food, caring for the larvae and defending the nest. As necessary with this type <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> {{there must be a}} mechanism for distinguishing between females’ ability to reproduce in a social setting. This reproductive control or suppression has been recently credited to pre-imaginal caste determination via the mechanism of insemination. The lack of intermediate females (workers with developed ovaries) implies heavy control of reproduction. It is hypothesized that only with the advent of insemination, the female will then be able to develop their ovaries adequately to become a layer. Observation has denoted that interactions among queen A. pallipes are unaggressive therefore implying that workers are most important in queen selection.|$|E
25|$|Pirates had {{a system}} <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> on board their ships {{determining}} how captured money was distributed. However, pirates were more egalitarian {{than any other}} area of employment at the time. In fact, pirate quartermasters were a counterbalance to the captain and {{had the power to}} veto his orders. The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship's equipment with medicines the most highly prized. A vessel's doctor's chest would be worth anywhere from £300 to £400, or around $470,000 in today's values. Jewels were common plunder but not popular as they were hard to sell, and pirates, unlike the public of today, had little concept of their value. There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a great deal more than the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crewmates as a share. He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{interest}} in power-law relations stems partly from {{the ease with}} which certain general classes of mechanisms generate them. The demonstration of a power-law relation in some data can point to specific kinds of mechanisms that might underlie the natural phenomenon in question, and can indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems; see also universality above. The ubiquity of power-law relations in physics is partly due to dimensional constraints, while in complex systems, power laws are often thought to be signatures <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> or of specific stochastic processes. A few notable examples of power laws are the Pareto's law of income distribution, structural self-similarity of fractals, and scaling laws in biological systems. Research on the origins of power-law relations, and efforts to observe and validate them in the real world, is an active topic of research in many fields of science, including physics, computer science, linguistics, geophysics, neuroscience, sociology, economics and more.|$|E

25|$|Crocodiles are {{the most}} social of reptiles. Even though they do not form social groups, many species congregate in certain {{sections}} of rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking. Most species are not highly territorial, {{with the exception of}} the saltwater crocodile, which is a highly territorial and aggressive species. A mature male will not tolerate any other males at any time of the year. Most other species are more flexible. There is a certain form <b>of</b> <b>hierarchy</b> in crocodiles: the largest and heaviest males are at the top, having access to the best basking site, while females are priority during a group feeding of a big kill or carcass. A good example of the hierarchy in crocodiles would be the case of the Nile crocodile. This species clearly displays all of these behaviours. Studies in this area are not thorough, however, and many species are yet to be studied in greater detail. Mugger crocodiles are also known to show toleration in group feedings and tend to congregate in certain areas. However, males of all species are aggressive towards each other during mating season, to gain access to females.|$|E
