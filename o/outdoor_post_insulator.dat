40|$|This project {{presents}} {{the study of}} electric field stress along {{the surface of a}} 132 kV ceramic <b>post</b> <b>insulator.</b> Insulators are among the important devices of the electric power transmission systems. They are used to support and separate conductors at high voltage. Different insulator shapes have been obtained by varying several parameters, which defines the shape of the <b>post</b> <b>insulator.</b> For each insulator shape, the maximum electric field stress occurring on the insulator surface has been determined under clean and dry environment. The COMSOL Multiphysics software has been employed to investigate the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. The full detailed model of a dry and clean ceramic 132 kV <b>post</b> <b>insulator</b> with 25 sheds has been developed for the base model calculation. The maximum value of electric field stress was found to be at the junction between the porcelain and the end fitting. End fittings with round edges tend to reduce the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. With smaller first shed’s outer corner radius, the electric field stress slightly decreases. The electric field stress of the 25 th shed near the top end fitting tends to reduce as the shed’s inclination angle is increased. Furthermore, as the shed’s diameter increases, the electric field stress increases except at the shed’s outer corner where the electric field stress decreases. With greater distance between the first shed and the bottom end fitting, the electric field stress becomes lower. The end fittings design was found to be significantly affecting the electric field stress along the surface of the <b>post</b> <b>insulator.</b> A modified <b>post</b> <b>insulator</b> is proposed and proven to have a better performance in term of electric field stress...|$|R

Insulators are devices which are used in electricity supply networks to support, separate or contain conductors at high voltage. Aging of ceramic and <b>post</b> <b>insulator</b> materials is reviewed mainly from the standpoint of their interfacial performance. Insulating materials can be divided into simple ceramics. Aging processes are complicated in general, and take place under simultaneous multiple stresses such as electrical, mechanical and environmental stresses. Contact angle measured insulation under consideration leads to the surface is approximately horizontal to the top surface. The sheds also aged differently around their circumference and this is reflected in discoloration differences on different sides of the insulator, in addition to hydrophobicity changes. Voltage breakdown measurements carried out in the laboratory are also presented. Material analysis shows oxidation of the surface. Ageing effects were different uniform for each shed, the greatest oxidation being on the top surfaces of the sheds on the west and east side. Microscopy was found to be the most useful and effective tools for analysis of these ceramic insulator. The measurements of the various parameters over the whole surface of the insulators are found to be consistent with each other and can be interpreted in terms of the chemistry of ageing and the longer term performance of the specific insulators in question. Two distinct types of ageing are identified. The role of solar radiation appears critical. In summary, the <b>post</b> <b>insulators</b> which have been in service for 15 years have very non-uniform surface properties in both the vertical and circumferential directions.
