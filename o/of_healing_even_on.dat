40|$|INTRODUCTION: During bowel surgery, {{perioperative}} {{blood loss}} and hypotension {{can lead to}} transient intestinal ischemia. Recent preclinical studies reveal that the strength of intestinal anastomoses can be compromised after reperfusion. So far, this phenomenon has not been investigated {{in the very first}} days <b>of</b> <b>healing</b> when wound strength is lowest. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ischemia was induced in rats by clamping both the superior mesenteric artery and ileal branches for 30 min. Immediately after declamping, anastomoses were constructed in both terminal ileum and descending colon. The same was done in control groups after sham-ischemia. Anastomotic bursting pressure and breaking strength were measured immediately after operation (day 0) and after 1, 2, or 3 days. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content, gelatinase activity, and histology were analyzed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In ileal anastomoses, at day 1, both the breaking strength and bursting pressure were significantly (p < 0. 05) lower in the ischemic group, while at day 2, this was the case for the bursting pressure only. In the colon, the bursting pressure in the ischemic group was lower at day 1. Anastomotic hydroxyproline content remained unchanged. Increased presence of the various gelatinase activities was found in ileum only at day 0 and in colon at days 1 and 2. Histological mucosal damage was found in ischemia-reperfusion groups. CONCLUSION: Transient mesenteric ischemia can negatively affect anastomotic strength during the very first days <b>of</b> <b>healing,</b> <b>even</b> if the tissue used for anastomotic construction looks vital...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the problem}} <b>of</b> the <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> wounds has {{commanded}} much interest {{for a long}} time, the metabolic changes which accompany wound healing have been seriousiy investigated only since the early work of Howes and his associates (1 - 4) has appeared. Much of the literature in this field has been concerned with an empirical approach to the accelera-tion <b>of</b> the <b>healing</b> processes. The lack of quantitatively precise methods for measuring the rates <b>of</b> <b>healing,</b> <b>even</b> in experimental wounds, has impaired the value of much of this work. Nonetheless, a number of metabolic implications can be gleaned from these empirical studies. Only relatively recently have systematic studies been undertaken on metabo-lism after injury. The biochemical work on wounds and wound healing has been devoted largely to the metabolism of proteins by the injured organism and {{the determination of the}} character and metabolism of certain proteins and polysaccharides of the wound area.

40|$|Dimensional {{alterations}} of {{the facial}} soft and bone tissues following tooth extraction in the esthetic zone play an essential role to achieve successful outcomes in implant therapy. This prospective study {{is the first to}} investigate the interplay between the soft tissue dimensions and the underlying bone anatomy during an 8 -wk healing period. The analysis is based on sequential 3 -dimensional digital surface model superimpositions of the soft and bone tissues using digital impressions and cone beam computed tomography during an 8 -wk healing period. Soft tissue thickness in thin and thick bone phenotypes at extraction was similar, averaging 0. 7 mm and 0. 8 mm, respectively. Interestingly, thin bone phenotypes revealed a 7 -fold increase in soft tissue thickness after an 8 -wk healing period, whereas in thick bone phenotypes, the soft tissue dimensions remained unchanged. The observed spontaneous soft tissue thickening in thin bone phenotypes resulted in a vertical soft tissue loss of only 1. 6 mm, which concealed the underlying vertical bone resorption of 7. 5 mm. Because of spontaneous soft tissue thickening, no significant differences were detected in the total tissue loss between thin and thick bone phenotypes at 2, 4, 6, and 8 wk. More than 51 % of these dimensional alterations occurred within 2 wk <b>of</b> <b>healing.</b> <b>Even</b> though the observed spontaneous soft tissue thickening in thin bone phenotypes following tooth extraction conceals the pronounced underlying bone resorption pattern by masking the true bone deficiency, spontaneous soft tissue thickening offers advantages for subsequent bone regeneration and implant therapies in sites with high esthetic demand (Clinicaltrials. gov NCT 02403700) ...|$|R

40|$|Statistical {{research}} indicates {{an increase in}} brokenness among North Americans over the past fifty years. Despite this increase, people seeking help for mental health issues, relational dysfunction, addictive behaviors, {{and other forms of}} brokenness are not often turning to the church for restoration, recovery, and <b>healing.</b> Many <b>of</b> those struggling with brokenness more often turn to therapeutic practitioners and other <b>healing</b> sources absent <b>of</b> any genuine spiritual parameters. Others turn to mutual support recovery groups where behavior modification and cognitive therapies lead to abstinence but not restoration. They stop giving into their addictions and compulsive behaviors, but they do not deal with the underlying reasons for them. Others seek spiritual solutions, including Christian discipleship, eastern meditation and yoga that are often void of any recovery or therapeutic practices or methods. Church leaders need to take a semiotic approach to this, understanding what the cultural signs are pointing to. What is this increase in brokenness pointing to and what opportunities does it create for the church? This is not as a threat to current ways of doing ministry. It is an opportunity to look at new paradigms, possibly helping the church regain credibility and provide restorative solution for increasing brokenness.

Methods: Forty eyes of 20 myopic patients were prospectively recruited to a randomized fellow eye study. Patients underwent transepithelial ASLA in both eyes, with one of the eyes randomly assigned to the use of the RGTA Cacicol. Postoperative pain and vision were subjectively assessed with the use of a questionnaire on the operative day, at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. Epithelial defect area size was measured at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) were assessed at 1 month. Results: Mean UDVA at 1 month was LogMAR 0. 028. The epithelial defect area was 10. 91 mm 2 and 13. 28 mm 2 at 24 hours and 1. 39 mm 2 and 1. 24 mm 2 at 48 hours for treated and nontreated eyes, respectively. Overall, 50 % and 65 % of treated and nontreated eyes healed by 48 hours. There was no statistically significant difference in the subjective vision between the groups, although vision of patients in the RGTA group was reported to be better. Pain scores were better at 24 hours and 48 hours in the RGTA group but with no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: The use of RGTA Cacicol shows faster epithelial recovery after transepithelial ASLA for myopia. Subjectively reported scores of pain and subjective vision were better in the RGTA group, although the difference was not statistically significant. There seems to be a consensual acceleration <b>of</b> epithelial <b>healing</b> <b>even</b> in eyes that did not receive treatment.

40|$|A 3 -year {{prospective}} trial of laser thermal-assisted balloon angioplasty in 28 patients included 27 who had advanced peripheral vascular disease (severe tissue loss, gangrene, infection, and rest pain), 7 who were failures of previous therapy (surgery and thrombolysis), and 4 who were {{high risk for}} operation (myocardial infarction within 6 weeks and/or ejection fractions of {{less than or equal}} to 20 %). Laser angioplasty was performed in the operating room via a groin incision by a surgeon-radiologist team. In the 27 patients with advanced peripheral vascular disease (ankle-brachial systolic pressure index [ABI] 0. 27 +/- 0. 2 in 10 nondiabetic, and 0. 46 +/- 0. 1 in 17 diabetic patients), recanalization of the native vessel was successful in 16, and patency was restored in 2 chronically occluded polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) grafts. In these 18 (67 %) successfully recanalized patients, however, five amputations were required within 1 month, and another six were needed between 8 and 12 months. Early amputations were caused by a failure <b>of</b> wound <b>healing,</b> <b>even</b> through angioplasty sites were patent. Late amputations were caused by reocclusion of the treated site in five of six patients. In the remaining seven patients in whom laser angioplasty alone was successful, five had healed limbs at 6 to 24 months and two remain incompletely healed but functional. The patency for successful procedures ranged from 48 hours to 25 months (5. 6 +/- 6. 4 mean months, +/- SD), with cumulative patency by life-table analysis of 55. 5 % at 3 months, 38. 8 % at 6 months, and 11. 1 % at 12 months. There were no procedure-related deaths. Complications included seven arterial wall perforations by the laser probe. We conclude that laser angioplasty has a limited role in advanced peripheral vascular disease but may provide an interval patency, thus allowing postponement of operation for high-risk patients until their medical conditions permits surgery, or to correct local tissue necrosis or infection in the operative field before reconstruction, and to restore patency to thrombosed PTFE grafts...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis {{is crucial}} to all types <b>of</b> wound <b>healing,</b> {{including}} gastric ulcer healing. The most potent promoter of angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We hypothesized that a 15 -amino acid peptide designed to mimic the angiogenic action of VEGF would accelerate gastric ulcer healing. Gastric ulcers were induced in mice by serosal application of acetic acid. Treatment with the VEGF mimetic accelerated gastric ulcer healing when administered orally or intraperitoneally, at a dose of 50 ng/kg or greater.

Contrary to our hypothesis, the VEGF mimetic did not significantly increase angiogenesis in the ulcerated stomach. The enhancement <b>of</b> ulcer <b>healing</b> by the VEGF mimetic occurred independently of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) activity but was blocked by inhibitors of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

Tests of various damage types, including sawing, cutting and puncture, revealed high-energy transfer damage modes to produce heat and store energy favourable to healing. DSC probed healed specimens revealing they had reached the viscoelastic melt believed requisite to healing response. Low-temperature ballistic experiments demonstrated films continue <b>healing</b> <b>even</b> when punctured at − 30 °C; analysis showed healing efficacy comparable to room temperature, holding significant pressures of approximately 3  MPa. At the lowest temperature, brittle fracture occurred in one material indicating insufficient heat transfer to store recoverable energy.
