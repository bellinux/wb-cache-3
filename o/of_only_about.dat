5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991; {{however, the}} full implementation of declaration only came into effect on 8 October 1991. In the meantime, tensions escalated into overt war when the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and various Serb paramilitary groups attacked Croatia. By {{the end of}} 1991, a high-intensity conflict fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to control <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> two-thirds of its territory. The various Serb paramilitary groups then began pursuing a campaign of killing, terror and expulsion against the non-Serb population in the rebel territories, killing thousands of Croat civilians and forcing at least 170,000 from their homes.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the weak interaction typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the weak interaction, and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|Exact French {{casualties}} {{are difficult}} to calculate, but of the 1,300 aboard Droits de l'Homme, 103 {{are known to have}} died in the battle and just over 300 were saved from the wreck, indicating the deaths of approximately 900men on the French ship between the morning of 14January and the morning of 18January. However, a French source suggests that up to another 500 of the crew were rescued from the wreck by the corvette Arrogante and the cutter Aiguille on 17 and 18 January. This would give a toll <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 400. A menhir at Plozévet, with an inscription carved in 1840 gives a death toll of six hundred.|$|E

As far as gross state product, from the period of 1990–1999 Ohio insurance contribution to Ohio's gross state product grew about 161% from $2.6 billion to $6.8 billion, despite population growth from 1990 to 2000 <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 4.67%, from 10,847,115 to 11,353,140.

5|$|The lighter {{isotopes}} {{usually have}} shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100ms for 260Bh, 261Bh, 262Bh, and 262mBh were observed. 264Bh, 265Bh, 266Bh, and 271Bh are more stable at around 1s, and 267Bh and 272Bh have half-lives of about 10s. The heaviest isotopes {{are the most}} stable, with 270Bh and 274Bh having measured half-lives of about 61s and 54s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope 278Bh appearing to have an even longer half-life of about 690s. The unknown isotopes 273Bh and 275Bh are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 90minutes and 40minutes respectively. Before its discovery, 274Bh was also predicted {{to have a long}} half-life of 90minutes, but it was found to have a shorter half-life <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 54seconds.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{supported}} a Jacobite-led invasion of Scotland in 1719, but stormy seas allowed only about three hundred Spanish troops {{to arrive in}} Scotland. A base was established at Eilean Donan Castle on the west Scottish coast in April, only {{for it to be}} destroyed by British ships a month later. Attempts by the Jacobites to recruit Scottish clansmen yielded a fighting force <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> a thousand men. The Jacobites were poorly equipped, and were easily defeated by British artillery at the Battle of Glen Shiel. The clansmen dispersed into the Highlands, and the Spaniards surrendered. The invasion never posed any serious threat to George's government. With the French this time fighting against him in the War, Philip's armies fared poorly. As a result, the Spanish and French thrones remained separate. Simultaneously, Hanover gained from the resolution of the Great Northern War which had been caused by rivalry between Sweden and Russia for control of the Baltic. The Swedish territories of Bremen and Verden were ceded to Hanover in 1719, with Hanover paying Sweden monetary compensation for the loss of territory.|$|E

5|$|Umbriel's {{surface is}} the darkest of the Uranian moons, and {{reflects}} {{less than half}} as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size. Umbriel has a very low Bond albedo <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel. The reflectivity of the moon's surface decreases from 26% at a phase angle of 0° (geometric albedo) to 19% at an angle of about 1°. This phenomenon is called opposition surge. The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color, while fresh bright impact deposits (in Wunda crater, for instance) are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering from bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere. The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous—it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{thickness}} of the effective dielectric is proportional to the forming voltage, the dielectric thickness can be tailored to the rated voltage of the capacitor. For example, for low voltage types a 10V electrolytic capacitor has a dielectric thickness <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 0.014µm, a 100V electrolytic capacitor <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>about</b> 0.14µm. Thus, the dielectric strength also influences the size of the capacitor. However, due to standardized safety margins the actual forming voltage of electrolytic capacitors is higher than the rated voltage of the component.|$|E
