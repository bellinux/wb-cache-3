5|$|Debates ensued <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end}} of {{the line}} had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield was {{particularly}} hard-hit during the 2007 United Kingdom floods and the 2010 'Big Freeze'. Many landmark buildings such as Meadowhall and the Sheffield Wednesday grounds flooded due to {{being close to}} nearby rivers that flow through the city. Since 2012, there have been disputes between the city council and residents <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 4,000 having been felled {{as part of a}} scheme to maintain the city streets.|$|E
5|$|The scuttling of the German fleet {{took place}} at the Royal Navy's base at Scapa Flow, in Scotland, after the First World War. The High Seas Fleet was interned there {{under the terms of the}} Armistice whilst {{negotiations}} took place <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the ships. Fearing that all of the ships would be seized and divided amongst the allied powers, the German commander, Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, decided to scuttle the fleet.|$|E

As a result of these inquests, the coroner ruled that according to the evidence given, the seven had died. The three other people who were left missing after Martin, had their deaths registered during 2004.|$|R
50|$|While the astronauts' wives (Lee Grant, Mariette Hartley and Nancy Kovack) agonize <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> their husbands, all normal {{checklist}} {{procedures are}} bypassed {{to prepare the}} X-RV for launch. A hurricane headed for the launch area threatens to cancel the mission, scrubbing the final attempt to launch in time to save all three Ironman astronauts. However, the eye of <b>the</b> storm passes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Cape 90 minutes later during a launch window, permitting a launch with Dougherty aboard in time to reach the ship while {{at least some of}} the crew survives.|$|R
5000|$|As part of {{the winning}} {{coalition}} against Napoleon Russia gained some spoils in Finland and Poland at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815. The tsar attended and was deeply involved in <b>the</b> diplomatic wrangling <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> Poland, Saxony and the Kingdom of Naples. He helped establish alliances that defeated Napoleon's attempt to regain power in 1815 and helped foster a spirit of cooperation among the conservative leaders of Britain, France, Austria, and Prussia. The major territorial gain was control of Poland, which Napoleon had made an independent state. The tsar became king of Poland and (at first) allowed it considerable autonomy.|$|R
5|$|When {{presented}} {{with evidence of}} Benedict Arnold's activities, it is reported that Washington remained calm. He did, however, investigate its extent, and suggested {{that he was willing}} to exchange André for Arnold during negotiations with General Clinton <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> Major André. Clinton refused this suggestion; after a military tribunal, André was hanged at Tappan, New York on October 2. Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to capture Arnold. This plan very nearly succeeded, but failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{following}} year, Alexandra's father had ascended the throne of Denmark, her brother George had become King of the Hellenes, her sister Dagmar was engaged to the Tsesarevich of Russia, and Alexandra had given birth to her first child. Her father's accession gave rise to further conflict <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> Schleswig-Holstein. The German Confederation successfully invaded Denmark, reducing the area of Denmark by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The Prussian conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra's profound dislike of the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|In 563, {{a mission}} from Ireland under St. Columba founded the monastery of Iona off {{the west coast}} of Scotland, and {{probably}} began the conversion of the region to Christianity. The kingdom reached its height under Áedán mac Gabráin (r. 574–608), but its expansion was checked at the Battle of Degsastan in 603 by Æthelfrith of Northumbria. Serious defeats in Ireland and Scotland in the time of Domnall Brecc (d.642) ended Dál Riata's golden age, and the kingdom became a client of Northumbria, then a subject to the Picts. There is disagreement <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom from the late 8th century onwards. Some scholars argue that Dál Riata underwent a revival under king Áed Find (736–78), before the arrival of the Vikings.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, {{also known}} as the Battle of Quebec (Bataille des Plaines d'Abraham, or Première bataille de Québec in French), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought by the British Army and Navy against the French Army on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City, on land that was {{originally}} owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Before talks could begin, Coalition armies {{crossed the}} Rhine on 22 December. Metternich retired from Frankfurt to Breisgau to {{celebrate}} Christmas with his wife's family before travelling {{to the new}} Coalition headquarters at Basel in January 1814. Quarrels with Tsar Alexander, particularly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> France intensified in January, prompting Alexander to storm out. He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid-January. Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres. The Tsar remained unaccommodating however, demanding a push into the centre of France; fortunately, he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich's other ideas, like a final peace conference in Vienna. Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Chatillon, as {{he wanted to stay}} with Alexander. The talks stalled, and, after a brief advance, Coalition forces had to retreat after the Montmirail and Montereau. This relieved Metternich's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{began to}} {{formally}} {{look for a}} new husband for Matilda in early 1127 and received various offers from princes within the Empire. His preference was to use Matilda's marriage to secure the southern borders of Normandy by marrying her to Geoffrey of Anjou, the eldest son of Fulk, the Count of Anjou. Henry's control of Normandy had faced numerous challenges since he had conquered it in 1106, and the latest threat came from his nephew William Clito, the new Count of Flanders, who enjoyed {{the support of the}} French King. It was essential to Henry that he did not also face a threat from the south as well as the east of Normandy. William Adelin had married Fulk's daughter Matilda, which would have cemented an alliance between Henry and Anjou, but the White Ship disaster put an end to this. Henry and Fulk argued <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the marriage dowry, and this had encouraged Fulk to turn to support William Clito instead. Henry's solution was now to negotiate the marriage of Matilda to Geoffrey, recreating the former alliance.|$|E

Following its closure, most of the railway system were {{demolished}} or paved <b>over.</b> While <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MSR's rolling stock is largely unknown; only one MSR locomotive of unknown specification serves as a permanent display in a park in Muar town.|$|R

5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Belgium in May 1940 generated concern <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> uranium ore from the Belgian Congo, the world's largest source; the subsequent Battle of France created alarm {{in the administration}} over the direction the war was taking. On June 12, 1940, Bush and Harry Hopkins went to the president with a proposal to create a National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) to coordinate defense-related research. The NDRC was formally created on June 27, 1940, with Bush as its chairman. It immediately absorbed the Advisory Committee on Uranium, which was indeed one of its purposes. Bush immediately reorganised the Advisory Committee on Uranium as the NDRC Committee on Uranium, reporting directly to him. Briggs remained chairman, but Hoover and Adamson were dropped from its membership, while Tuve, Pegram, Beams, Gunn, and Urey were added. For security reasons, no foreign-born scientists were appointed to the Uranium Committee. Publication of research into uranium, fission and isotope separation was now banned.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} playable {{characters}} are Frog and Magus. Frog originated in AD 600. He {{is a former}} squire once named Glenn, who was turned into an anthropomorphic frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 {{is in a state}} of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful sorcerer. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> his sister, Schala. Lavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.|$|E

2500|$|King Edward of Portugal died in August 1438 (of pestilence, {{said his}} doctors; <b>of</b> heartbreak <b>over</b> <b>the</b> hapless <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> Ferdinand, said popular lore). [...] Edward's death {{provoked}} an internal conflict in Portugal <b>over</b> <b>the</b> regency for his young son, the new king Afonso V of Portugal, and the kingdom became distracted.

50|$|The {{closing of}} MCAS El Toro ignited a {{political}} firestorm <b>over</b> <b>the</b> eventual <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facility. With its existing infrastructure, some favored converting the base {{into an international}} airport. Those favoring the new airport tended to come from northern Orange County, (desiring the convenience of a closer airport), and from areas in Newport Beach that are within the arrival and departure noise zones surrounding John Wayne Airport, (hoping to close that airport {{in favor of the}} new one at El Toro).|$|R
25|$|Since 1977, {{an ongoing}} and largely {{unsuccessful}} series of diplomatic {{efforts have been}} initiated by Israel, Palestinian organisations, their neighbours, and other parties, including the United States and the European Union, {{to bring about a}} peace process to resolve conflicts between Israel and its neighbors, mostly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Palestinian people.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, after most Allied {{war crimes}} trials had ended, {{thousands}} of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained {{in the countries}} where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).|$|E
25|$|After this incident, {{there was}} a huge {{division}} of opinions <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf Cartel. Some experts believed that the death of Ezekiel would be dreadful for the Gulf Cartel, and that Los Zetas would overthrow them and eventually take control of Tamaulipas. Others explained how his death allowed Costilla Sánchez to take full directive of the cartel, and that would tighten relations with Colombia and straighten the Gulf Cartel's path, something quite difficult with Ezekiel as co-leader.|$|E
50|$|When I-401 was {{completed}} and commissioned on 8 January 1945 in the Kure Naval District, the Second World War was almost <b>over.</b> This left <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> I-401 uncertain.

5|$|Before the 2010–11 season began, {{there was}} much {{anticipation}} around <b>the</b> league <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. Bosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami. Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo sought to trade Calderón, Evans and the disenchanted Türkoğlu for Tyson Chandler, Leandro Barbosa, and Boris Diaw, but the trade involving Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler {{was traded to the}} Dallas Mavericks instead. Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright, and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen, and Marcus Banks to New Orleans for Peja Stojaković and Jerryd Bayless. Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to a chorus of boos, but not as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter received upon their respective returns. Without Bosh, Toronto as a team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season.|$|R
25|$|Despite these incidents, the ECI {{expressed}} satisfaction {{about the}} conduct of the polls due to peaceful polling in many other parts of the country.

25|$|The police, Aboriginal {{trackers}} {{and others}} watched the surrounded hotel throughout the night.

She came out from the hotel crying bitterly and wandered into the bush on several occasions. With the assistance of one of the prisoners she removed her son from the building, and sent him to Wangaratta for treatment. The firing continued intermittently. Bullets lodged in the station buildings and the train.|$|E
25|$|His {{party had}} joined a {{coalition}} led by PPP but the alliance had been strained by differences <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> judges Musharraf dismissed {{last year and}} over {{how to handle the}} unpopular president. Sharif won much public support for his uncompromising stand against Musharraf and for his insistence the judges be reinstated. The coalition successfully forced Musharraf's resignation. He also successfully pressured Zardari for the reinstatement of judges removed by Musharraf in emergency rule. This led to the courts cleansing Sharif of a criminal record rendering him eligible to re-enter parliament.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{completion}} of flying tests performed by the prototype, the British government exercised considerable indecision <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the programme. In addition to the prototype, a further two Princesses (G-ALUO and G-ALUP) were under construction, but these would ultimately never fly. While a decision from the government was effectively pending, the three existing aircraft were placed into storage, being cocooned and retained, one at Cowes and two at Calshot Spit; it had been hoped that work on the programme would be restarted when a buyer was found.|$|E
