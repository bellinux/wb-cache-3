Access {{to the outer wall}} from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner wall's towers. The outer wall likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78m, with an average distance of 50–66m. Only 62 of the outer wall's towers survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14m tall and 4m wide. They featured a room with windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> the peribolos, crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. The outer wall was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the outer wall.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{study was}} carried out in order to {{determine}} the effect of vitamins (biotin, thiamine, pantotheniic acid and pyridoxal) and micronutrient (zinc, boron, manganese and iron) deficiencies on higher alcohol production during alcoholic fermentation with the industrially used yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae M- 300 -A. Zinc deficiency induced a reduction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> isobutyl and isoamyl alcohols. An increase on isobutyl alcohol (fivefold) and a reduction of isoamyl alcohol (two fold) and n-propyl alcohol (three fold) contents resulted from pantotheiiic acid deficiency, whereas pyridoxal deficiency caused an increase <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> isobutyl and isoamyl alcohols.

5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, {{the more likely it is}} that the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E

Methodology: 60 participants (15 males and 45 females), completed standardised demographic questions and then a number of questionnaires; the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Brief Cope Questionnaire (BCI) at a major Dublin teaching hospital. The data was analysed using an independent samples t-test, one way Anova of variance and a Pearson correlation. Results: Significant results were found between genders <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> perceived stress. No statistically significant results were found between age <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress, burnout and coping as well as the years in occupation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress, burnout and coping mechanisms.
