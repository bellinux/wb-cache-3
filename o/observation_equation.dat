40|$|GPS {{processing}}, {{like every}} processing method for geodetic applications, relies upon least-squares estimation. Quality measures must be defined {{to assure that}} the estimates are close to reality. These quality measures are reliable provided that, first, the covariance matrix of the observations (the stochastic model) is well defined and second, the systematic effects are completely removed (i. e., the functional model is good). In the GPS precise point positioning (PPP) the stochastic and functional models are not as complicated as in the differential GPS processing. We will assess the quality of the GPS Precise Point Positioning in this thesis by trying to define more realistic standard deviations for the station position estimates. To refine the functional model from systematic errors, we have 1) used the phase observations to prevent introducing any hardware bias to the <b>observation</b> <b>equations,</b> 2) corrected <b>observations</b> for all systematic effects with amplitudes of more than 1 cm, 3) used undifferenced observations to prevent having complications (e. g. linearly related parameters) in the system of <b>observation</b> <b>equations.</b> To have a realistic covariance matrix for the observations we have incorporated the ephemeris uncertainties into the system of <b>observation</b> <b>equations.</b> Based on the above-mentioned issues a PPP processing method is designed and numerically tested on the real data of some of the International GNSS Service stations.
