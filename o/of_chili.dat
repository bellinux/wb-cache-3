5|$|NY252A {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY33A and NY386 in Chili Center, a hamlet {{located within the}} town <b>of</b> <b>Chili.</b> The route proceeded eastward from the commercial community and passed through largely residential neighborhoods on its way across Chili. As it approached the Greater Rochester International Airport, the homes were gradually replaced by industrial factories and warehouses. It crossed the Rochester and Southern Railroad {{in the community of}} Maplewood just before intersecting Beahan Road, a local road that serves as the western extent of the airport property.|$|E
5|$|Just {{across the}} town line, NY33A intersects {{the east end}} of the Airport Expressway (NY204). At this point, NY204 leaves the highway and turns to follow NY33A eastward. While most of NY33A west of Gates is a two-lane highway, the portion <b>of</b> <b>Chili</b> Avenue that carries both NY33A and NY204 is a four-lane roadway. The two routes soon enter Tressmar, a hamlet that has been {{transformed}} into a major commercial destination. The development is mostly centered on Westgate Plaza, a large shopping plaza anchored by a Walmart. As NY33A passes south of the plaza, it connects to Howard Road (unsigned NY940L and formerly part of NY47) and Brooks Avenue. NY204 leaves NY33A at Brooks Avenue to follow the road eastward toward the Greater Rochester International Airport.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route252 (NY252) is an east–west {{state highway}} south of Rochester in Monroe County, New York, in the United States. The western {{terminus}} {{of the route}} is at an intersection with NY33A in Chili and the eastern terminus is at a junction with NY64 and NY96 {{in the village of}} Pittsford. NY252 passes {{through the center of the}} town of Henrietta's commercial district, where it intersects NY15. The route passes through three distinct areas: a lightly populated, rural area <b>of</b> <b>Chili</b> west of the Genesee River, the heavily developed commercial district centered on NY252's intersections with NY15 and NY15A, and a mostly residential area of the town of Pittsford.|$|E

5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Riga, NY33A becomes Chili–Riga Center Road as it {{traverses}} a largely rural portion of southwestern Monroe County. In the small hamlet of Riga, the route intersects and briefly overlaps with NY36. East of Riga hamlet, NY33A heads generally northeastward, passing by Black Creek Park as it enters the town <b>of</b> <b>Chili.</b> Just west of the hamlet of West Chili, the route crosses over Black Creek and intersects Chili Avenue Extension. At this junction, NY33A becomes Chili Avenue, the name it retains into the city of Rochester. Locally, the Chili Avenue name is used more in common parlance than the NY33A designation.|$|E

25|$|The general biosynthetic pathway of {{capsaicin}} {{and other}} capsaicinoids was elucidated in the 1960s by Bennett and Kirby, and Leete and Louden. Radiolabeling studies identified phenylalanine and valine as the precursors to capsaicin. Enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and their function in capsaicinoid biosynthesis were identified later by Fujiwake et al., and Sukrasno and Yeoman. Suzuki et al. {{are responsible for}} identifying leucine as another precursor to the branched-chain fatty acid pathway. It was discovered in 1999 that pungency <b>of</b> <b>chili</b> peppers is related to higher transcription levels of key enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase.

25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types <b>of</b> <b>chili</b> peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E
