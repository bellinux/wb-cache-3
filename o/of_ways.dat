To help assist the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) on the right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> acquisition process, two computerized simulator tools were developed by the Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M University and the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) in order to assist in this research. TAMSIM is a right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> simulator that provides with the acquisition costs and savings based on data from the Right <b>of</b> <b>Way</b> Information Systems (ROWIS).
