40|$|The {{pressure}} relief valve is a basic component in every hydraulic system. Its function is to limit maximal pressure in the system independently of the flow across the valve. Many authors have investigated the characteristics {{of this type of}} valves and different mathematical models have been obtained which described their characteristics. In this paper an attempt has been done, with contemporary mathematical approach, to determine the mathematical model of a specified {{pressure relief}} valve including all features of the valve such as compressible volume in front of the inlet port of the valve, pipeline with <b>oil</b> at the <b>outlet</b> <b>port</b> of the valve and hydrodynamic force.
