50|$|The first {{suburban}} <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>center</b> {{opened in}} 1931 in the Hollywood District of Portland, a neighborhood he deliberately chose through a shrewd and prescient application of market research: {{he would pay}} customers' overtime parking tickets that they incurred while shopping at his downtown store, just to obtain their home addresses. The store's innovations included a grocery store alongside a drugstore plus home products, off-street parking, gas station, and — eventually — clothing. Fred G. Meyer would base store locations on planned highway construction.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific Northwest chain Fred Meyer, now a {{division}} of the Kroger supermarket company, opened the first suburban <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>center</b> in 1931 in the Hollywood District of Portland, Oregon. The store's innovations included a grocery store alongside a drugstore plus off-street parking and an automobile lubrication and oil service. In 1933, men's and women's wear was added, and automotive department, housewares, and other nonfood products followed in succeeding years. In the mid 1930s, Fred Meyer opened a central bakery, a candy kitchen, an ice cream plant, and a photo-finishing plant, which supplied the company's stores in Portland and neighbouring cities with house brands such as Vita Bee bread, Hocus Pocus desserts, and Fifth Avenue candies. By the 1950s, Fred Meyer began opening stores that were 45000 sq ft to 70000 sq ft, and the 1960s saw the first modern-sized Fred Meyer hypermarkets.|$|E

30|$|In the 1960 s and 70 s, the supermarket, a {{new model}} of {{marketing}} from North America, appeared in Europe. The supermarket model was particularly successful in trading manufactured goods and supermarkets were recognized for their convenience as a <b>one-stop</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>center</b> for consumers. Food sales by supermarkets have grown at the expense of traditional independent retailers in Western Europe. In the 70 s and 80 s, the increasing number of supermarkets and hypermarkets in France, along with the generalization of food consumption, may have given the illusion of a decrease in the wholesale food market. In fact, what happened was the development of two concomitant food distribution systems in the Paris Region. According to a study realized in 2008 [44], the number of hypermarket and supermarket has increased by +[*] 367 % between 1970 and 2006 in France. Wholesalers have had to adapt to the new distribution power of supermarket chains.|$|E

The information about the history and development of American and Thai shopping centers, including types and trends, provides directions for a new Thai shopping center development.

The study looks at American consumers and their behavior reflected in the space and organization of the American mall as a model for designing Thai shopping centers with respect for Thai culture. In addition, this study reviews the major features of American retail design and their interpretation for Thailand.

40|$|Among the {{earliest}} {{issues to be}} solved regarding to web application (WA) architecture and de sign is the performance problem and business logic complexities due to some limitations in conventional CGI architecture. These issues arise when WA began {{to be used to}} provide services with a very high number of accesses by users and solve more complex problems such as large scale e-learning system, online banking, <b>one-stop</b> online <b>shopping</b> <b>center,</b> etc. Most of the solutions are not considering the complexity that also brought along with the new proposed architecture as long as the aforementioned issues can be solved. As WA evolved and used to solve more complex problems, the next phases of WA architecture and de sign research have going towards for more simplified design, further exploiting database technology maturity, and search for suitable aided-tools to facilitate on some aspects of WA development process. The research direction has also move towards on proposal for better insights on WA design via motivation or enforcement of particular design pattern and shows some awareness to the necessity for deep understanding on using technology appropriately as it was originally intended. Web application framework (WAF) that nowadays has been widely accepted for WA development has to be in tandem with the current research trends to provide better, profound and proven architecture-design inside the application. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To compare {{patterns}} of population service use and preference {{in areas with}} and without <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> services. Background: A number of strategy documents have recommended adopting a more integrated approach to sexual health service provision. One proposed model of integration is <b>one-stop</b> <b>shops,</b> where services for contraception and sexually transmitted infections are provided under the same roof. Currently, {{the potential impact of}} <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> services on patient service use and preference is unclear, particularly at a population level. Method: Three different models of <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> were studied: a dedicated young persons’ service, a specialist mainstream service,and an enhanced general practice. In each model, the <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> site was matched to two control sites with traditional service provision. Random samples of male and female patients were selected from general practices close to either the <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> or control sites. These patients received a postal survey asking about their use or preference for services for six sexual health needs. <b>One-stop</b> <b>shop</b> and control samples were compared using multivariate logistic regression.

The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how the <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> is successful in the dissemination of local authority information. After initial chapters which explore the background to the <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop,</b> it was necessary (because the extent {{and nature of the}} <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop</b> was so vague) to conduct a preliminary survey of local authorities in England and Wales. The results of this survey, when analysed provided an indication to some factors which might contribute {{to the success of the}} <b>one-stop</b> <b>shop.</b> Subsequently four representative local authorities were selected, Hampshire County Council, West Sussex County Council, the London Borough of Enfield and Lancashire County Council. These examples were chosen as authorities which represented the success factors in practice. The authorities were visited and evaluated by observation, personal interviews with the staff concerned, plus user questionnaire when possible, using common criteria and reference to available literature and results from the preliminary survey. Both surveys were conducted within a methodological framework and reference was made to conceptual models when possible. The success factors which emerge from the preliminary survey and further case-studies are discussed in the concluding chapter. They obviously contribute to the successful operation of the one-stop stop, but also offer guidelines to other authorities who might be considering such a venture...|$|R
