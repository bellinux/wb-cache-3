30|$|Our 2015 field {{research}} differs {{in important ways}} from earlier archaeoacoustics work. Andean approaches have developed since Moore [21, 22] associated site and architectural features with ranges of intelligible verbal communication. In their {{field research}} at Caylán, Helmer and Chicoine [23] focused on speech performance qualities, equating “volume” ranges with “ways of speaking” related to social function. Scullin [24] pioneered an extensive outdoor acoustical survey at the Huacas de Moche, using electronic instrumentation for both sound production and detection/reception. Adapting archaeological survey methods, her crew used handheld GPS devices and sound level meters to make readings every 10 – 20  m in straight lines radiating from the sound source, an <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> reproducing pink noise. Scullin divided her results into “high” and “low” frequencies, using them to estimate transmission-reception dynamics of portable Moche sound-producing instruments, such as whistles. For the Inca Empire, the study of high-altitude platform sonics by Meddens and Frouin [17] treats sound as a spatial constraint. Using Colonial documents to estimate the constituents of a musical-performance-based Inca “landscape of sound,” their multi-site study focused on unidirectional sound transmission from platforms outward, via experimental tests made with human voice, drum, and pututu.|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustical}} {{balance between}} the singer {{on the stage and}} the orchestra in the pit is typically found inside an opera house. The competition of the two sources is crucial, since in an opera the singer and the orchestra are performing at the same time. This topic of balance is receiving increasing attention in recent years, but several aspects are still to be clarified. The aim of this work is twofold: firstly the procedure for the acoustical qualification of the {{balance between the}} singer and the orchestra is investigated and secondly the means of controlling the balance at the design stage or during renovations is considered. For both tasks the study was conducted in a group of opera houses modelled within an acoustical CAD program. As regards the qualification of the balance this investigation compares the directional characteristics of two loudspeakers and of a dodecahedron <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> in the emulation of a soprano during simulated room acoustics measurements. It is shown that, in order to emulate a soprano singer, the directional characteristics of the source on the stage are quite important. The control of balance was also studied and the work reserves a special emphasis to the case of historical opera houses. In fact, when such theatres are refurbished, the range of possible architectural interventions is often limited to the orchestra pit only, due to the heritage nature of the hall which prevents from any substantial change {{in the area of the}} forestage. For this reason it is important to investigate the effectiveness of such limited interventions in the pit, and this is done here by a detailed study of the effects on balance of some major changes of the orchestra pit only...|$|E
40|$|Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) is a {{physical}} based sound reproduction technique. It relies on linear arrays of regularly spaced <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> A fundamental limitation of WFS is that the synthesis remains correct only up to a corner frequency referred to as spatial aliasing frequency. This paper addresses irregular spacing of loudspeaker array for WFS. Adapted driving functions are defined. New formulations of the spatial aliasing frequency are proposed. It is shown {{that the use of}} logarithmically spaced loudspeaker arrays can significantly increase the spatial aliasing frequency for non focused virtual sources. 1...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{reproduction}} systems using <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> produce reflections {{from room}} surfaces which {{interfere with the}} desired sound field within the array. While active compensation systems can reduce the reverberant level, they require calibration in each room and are processor-intensive. Directional loudspeakers allow the direct to reverberant level to be improved within the array, but still produce a finite exterior field which reflects from the room surfaces. The use of variable directivity loudspeakers allows the exterior field to be eliminated at low frequencies by implementing the Kirchhoff–Helmholtz integral equation. This paper investigates the performance of variable-directivity arrays in reducing reverberant levels and compares the results with those derived in a previous paper for fixed-directivity arrays. The results presented may have some impact {{on the design of}} commercial multi-channel systems for sound reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Sound Field Reproduction (SFR) is for {{creating}} a desired sound field from a primary source by using multiple loudspeakers. Its research calls for numerical experiments by simulation. SFR performance can be improved by optimizing the static Degrees of Freedom, i. e., the locations and patterns of loudspeakers. The approach is to decrease the sound field reproduction error without increasing the operational complexity, and this requires that the possible locations and frequencies of the primary source are known a priori. To optimize the loudspeaker locations, two placement methods are developed. In the first method, an idealized Acoustic Transfer Function (ATF) matrix that minimizes the reproduction error, but {{which may not be}} realizable, is derived for a fixed number of uniformly placed, <b>omnidirectional</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> The loudspeakers are then re-positioned within their aperture so that their realizable ATF matrix best approximates the idealized ATF matrix. In the second method, a new algorithm is called – Constrained Matching Pursuit (CMP), which optimizes loudspeaker location while constraining the total loudspeaker power to avoid acoustic hotspots. CMP is also used to jointly optimize the radiation patterns and locations of the loudspeakers. These methods optimize for a single frequency, and a method is presented which extends the case to multiple frequencies for the primary source. The multi-frequency method is deployed in the audio layer of an immersive communications system. An existing model for the Head Related Transfer Function (receiving pattern) is adapted for the computation of the loudspeaker excitation functions, called the dynamic Degrees of Freedom. Subjective and objective tests are applied and concur that the quality of speech of the SFR in a reverberant room is significantly improved compared to a system with the same number of loudspeakers that are uniformly spaced and omni-directional, and which have the same total power constraint and computation complexity...|$|R
