5|$|George Trice {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced {{for the first time}} to the three routes then operated. The company made an <b>operating</b> <b>loss</b> in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E
5|$|Team captain McMillan {{finished}} as the club's top scorer with 14 goals. He played 32 games, with goalkeeper Seymour, half-back Robinson {{and forward}} Graham all being ever-presents. With {{the advent of}} league football in Bradford, thousands of people came to home games, resulting in the club's end-of-season receipts totalling £3,896. It resulted in a small <b>operating</b> <b>loss</b> from the first season, but donations helped the club record a profit of £39 in their first season in the Football League. Following {{the end of the}} season, the club released six players and also sold Guy to Leeds City.|$|E
5|$|Tim Waterstone and James Daunt {{have been}} {{critical}} of tax avoidance by Amazon.com in the British press. Amazon has received sustained scrutiny for the amount of its overall sales that are reported by its UK subsidiary, in comparison to those 'processed offshore in Luxembourg to avoid UK tax'. In the 2012-13 financial year, Amazon paid £3.2 million in tax on sales of £4.2 billion and received £2.5 million in grants from the government. In the same period, it was revealed that Waterstones paid £11.9 million in tax, despite an <b>operating</b> <b>loss</b> of £25.4 million and sales of £410.4 million.|$|E

From April 2008, the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with £3.5million per annum for 3 years. This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing <b>operating</b> <b>loss</b> as the Centre remains profitable.

5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the <b>operating</b> <b>loss.</b> After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's overall {{net sales}} {{declined}} from its peak of ¥1.8trillion (US$18.7billion) in 2009 to ¥549billion (US$4.6billion) in 2015. Net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014. In 2010, Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of ¥68 million (US$770,000), which increased to ¥187 million (US$2.11million) with performance based bonuses. In comparison, Miyamoto earned {{a salary of}} ¥100 million (US$1.13million). Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for the poor sales while {{other members of the}} Nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of 20–30percent. This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo's employees, preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short-term finances. In 2012, the company experienced its first <b>operating</b> <b>loss</b> since entering the video game market more than 30years earlier. Losses continued {{for the next two years}} before the company finally returned to profitability at the end of the 2015fiscal year. The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
