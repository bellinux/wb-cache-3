These might include neo-mercantilists who depend on the protection of tariffs and state subsidies, or alliances of lesser developed countries, or feminist and environmentalist movements in the industrialized west. [...] If a counterhegemony grows large enough it is able to subsume and replace the historic bloc it was born in. Neo-Gramscians use the Machiavellian terms war of position and war of movement to explain how this is possible. In a war of position a counterhegemonic movement attempts, through persuasion or propaganda, {{to increase the number of}} people who share its view on the hegemonic order; in a war of movement the counterhegemonic tendencies which have grown large enough overthrow, violently or democratically, the current hegemony and establish themselves as a new historic bloc.|$|E
40|$|In Experiment 1, 6 college {{students}} were given generalization tests using 25 line lengths as samples with a long line, a short line, and a "neither" option as comparisons. The neither option was to be used if a sample did not go with the other comparisons. Then, four-member equivalence classes were formed. Class 1 included three nonsense words and the short line. Class 2 included three other nonsense words and the long line. After repeating the generalization test for line length, additional tests were conducted using members of the equivalence classes (i. e., nonsense words and lines) as comparisons and intermediate-length lines as samples. All Class 2 comparisons were selected {{in the presence of}} the test lines that also evoked the selection of the long line in the generalization test that had been given before equivalence class formation. Class 1 yielded complementary findings. Thus, the preclass primary generalization gradient predicted which test lines acted as members of each equivalence class. Regardless of using comparisons that were nonsense words or lines, the post-class-formation gradients overlapped, showing the substitutability of class members. Experiment 2 assessed the discriminability of the intermediate-length test lines from the Class 1 (shortest) and Class 2 (longest) lines. The test lines that functioned as members of an equivalence class were discriminable from the line that was a member of the same class by training. Thus, these test lines also acted as members of a dimensionally defined class of "long" or "short" lines. Extension of an equivalence class, then, involved its merger with a dimensionally defined class, which converted a close-ended class to an <b>open-ended</b> <b>class.</b> These data suggest a means of predicting class membership in naturally occurring categories...|$|E
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{identification of}} T-cell epitopes remains a principal goal of bioinformatics within immunology. As the immunogenicity of peptide epitopes {{is dependent on}} their binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, the prediction of binding affinity is a prerequisite to the reliable prediction of epitopes. The iterative self-consistent (ISC) partial-least-squares (PLS) -based additive method is a recently developed bioinformatic approach for predicting class II peptide−MHC binding affinity. The ISC−PLS method overcomes many of the conceptual difficulties inherent in the prediction of class II peptide−MHC affinity, such as the binding of a mixed population of peptide lengths due to the <b>open-ended</b> <b>class</b> II binding site. The method has applications in both the accurate prediction of class II epitopes and the manipulation of affinity for heteroclitic and competitor peptides. The method is applied here to six class II mouse alleles (I-Ab, I-Ad, I-Ak, I-As, I-Ed, and I-Ek) and included peptides up to 25 amino acids in length. A series of regression equations highlighting the quantitative contributions of individual amino acids at each peptide position was established. The initial model for each allele exhibited only moderate predictivity. Once the set of selected peptide subsequences had converged, the final models exhibited a satisfactory predictive power. Convergence was reached between the 4 th and 17 th iterations, and the leave-one-out cross-validation statistical terms - q 2, SEP, and NC - ranged between 0. 732 and 0. 925, 0. 418 and 0. 816, and 1 and 6, respectively. The non-cross-validated statistical terms r 2 and SEE ranged between 0. 98 and 0. 995 and 0. 089 and 0. 180, respectively. The peptides {{used in this study}} are available from the AntiJen database ([URL] The PLS method is available commercially in the SYBYL molecular modeling software package. The resulting models, which can be used for accurate T-cell epitope prediction, will be made freely available online ([URL]...|$|E

40|$|Two <b>open-ended</b> <b>classes</b> {{were formed}} when {{students}} {{were exposed to}} a forced choice primary generalization test, conducted in a matching-to-sample context. The classes were {{at opposite ends of}} a fill-based continuum. The endpoints of the continuum were called base stimuli and the intermediate stimuli were called variants. Class members were identified with tests conducted in the traditional variant-to-base format and a new base-to-variant format. The ranges of variants that functioned as members of the same nominal class differed with test format. In addition, the direction of that difference reversed for the classes {{at each end of the}} continuum. Follow-up tests showed that adjacent variants in a class were discriminable from each other. Thus, forced choice primary generalization tests induced classes of similar but discriminable stimuli. The fact that the same nominal class has two different widths raises a fundamental question about the definition of class membership. That issue is discussed along with recommendations for answering the question...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{foundation}} for a computational meta-theory of languages with bindings implemented in a computer-aided formal reasoning environment. Our theory provides the ability to reason abstractly about operators, languages, <b>open-ended</b> languages, <b>classes</b> of languages, etc. The theory {{is based on the}} ideas of higher-order abstract syntax, with an appropriate induction principle parameterized over the language (i. e. a set of operators) being used. In our approach, both the bound and free variables are treated uniformly and this uniform treatment extends naturally to variable-length bindings. The implementation is reflective, namely there is a natural mapping between the meta-language of the theorem-prover and the object language of our theory. The object language substitution operation is mapped to the meta-language substitution and {{does not need to be}} defined recursively. Our approach does not require designing a custom type theory; in this paper we describe the implementation of this foundational theory within a general-purpose type theory. This work is fully implemented in the MetaPRL theorem prover, using the pre-existing NuPRL-like MartinL of-style computational type theory. Based on this implementation, we lay out an outline for a framework for programming language experimentation and exploration as well as a general reflective reasoning framework. This paper also includes a short survey of the existing approaches to syntactic reflection. ...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{teaching}} {{is a major}} concern for teachers in most subject areas, including physical education (Doyle, 1986; Siedentop, 1991). In order to conduct classes effectively, teachers need to facilitate students learning. However, whether effective teaching results in students learning or not is questionable, particularly in physical education settings because enjoyment seems to be a major goal of teaching (Placek, 1983). Therefore, this study explored student learning and related factors that allowed learning to take place. Participants were one teacher and 38 college students, 30 males and 8 females (M age = 20 years) from a Dantien yoga course. The course, a two-hour unit, met once a week for 16 weeks. Students had no previous experience with yoga before taking the course. The certified female teacher with 17 years of teaching experience taught the class. Data were collected using two <b>open-ended</b> questionnaires, <b>class</b> observations, teacher and student interviews, and critical incident forms (Flanagan, 1954). Data were analyzed through a constant comparison technique to search for common themes and established trustworthiness using member checks and triangulation of methodology. Results indicated that students took the course because they had interest. They also expected to learn and to improve their health. Students reported that they learned an...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} analyze the use of special type of nouns called shell nouns. These nouns make up <b>open-ended</b> functionally-defined <b>class</b> of {{abstract}} nouns that have, to varying degrees, the potential of {{being used as a}} conceptual shells for complex, proposition like pieces of information. Shell nouns are used in texts and are used as cohesive devices within texts. Shell nouns are worthy of volume sized study as they belong to nouns that are most frequently used in English language. This study analyzed the frequencies and lexico-grammatical patterns of these nouns, using a corpus based study and a qualitative and quantitative analysis. To this end, a corpus of 239 research articles in education published in 2002 - 2010 was collected. The corpus consisted of 1, 710, 989 words. In order to calculate the frequencies and to extract lexico-grammatical patterns of the nouns Antconc Software was used. The results indicated that some of the shell nouns like change, process, and form were more frequent than the others in this corpus. The percentage of each of these nouns is 0. 02 %. The findings also indicated that the pattern, the+N+prepositional phrase, like the+N+of and the+N+in was the most frequent pattern to these nouns. The function of this pattern is to characterize a piece of information; that is to say, writers using these nouns rely on the context to identify the details of the information. The other patterns were N + that+ v, with a cataphoric function and premodifier+ N with characterization function. The results have implications to ESP and EAP...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were conducted using match-to-sample methodologies {{in an effort}} to model lexical classes, which include both arbitrary and perceptual relations between class members. Training in both experiments used a one-to-many mapping procedure with nonsense syllables as samples and eight sets of abstract stimuli as comparisons. These abstract stimuli differed along a number of dimensions, four of which were critical to the experimenter-defined class membership. Stimuli in some comparison sets included only one of the class-defining features, but stimuli in other sets included two, three, or all four of the critical features. After mastery of the baseline training, three types of probe tests were conducted: symmetry, transitivity/equivalence, and novel probe tests in which the training nonsense syllables served as samples, and comparisons were novel abstract stimuli that included {{one or more of the}} class-defining features. Symmetry and transitivity/equivalence probe tests showed that the stimuli used in training became members of equivalence classes. The novel stimuli also became class members on the basis of inclusion of any of the critical features. Thus these probe tests revealed the formation of <b>open-ended</b> generalized equivalence <b>classes.</b> In addition, typicality effects were observed such that comparison sets with more critical features were learned with fewer errors, responded to more rapidly, and judged to be better exemplars of th...|$|R
30|$|A {{thematic}} analysis of tweets revealed two main purposes: instant communication and content sharing. The themes are well corroborated with participants’ views solicited through a questionnaire as presented in Table 2 {{in which it}} is observable that most of them agreed or strongly agreed that they benefitted from Twitter through interactive learning, instant communication and independent learning. The results are realistic because the author made all communications to students including lecture notes, feedback and class cancellations through Twitter. For example, when the author posted this tweet: #DL & #IR: download lecture notes here [URL] & [URL] respectively”, it was retweeted 60 times and favoured 63 times within half an hour. The lecture notes were uploaded on Google Drive (another form of social media which is not part of this study’s scope) and the author shared the link with students by tweeting. Google URL Shortener ([URL] was used to shorten uniform resource locators (URLS) of links which were alarmingly long. Some researchers (Farkas, 2012 : 85; Franklin & Harmelen, 2007) have noted that these technologies offer an opportunity to shy students to freely express themselves. In the current study, {{only a small number of}} students indicated were shy because these students have stayed together and are used to each other. However, a departure from face-to-face interaction with students also profoundly helped to increase students’ participation in class discussions. For example, when the researcher asked <b>open-ended</b> questions in <b>class,</b> there could sometimes be total silence. However, by asking the same question via Twitter, the response rate was remarkable. This is probably the reason Conole and Alevizou (2010) argue that Web 2.0 approaches require pedagogical rethinking by challenging existing approaches to curriculum design, delivery and assessment.|$|R
40|$|English for Academic Purposes (EAP) {{departments}} now {{exist within}} contexts of increasing innovation in teaching, learning and assessment; development of identified key skills (Academic Development Centre, Kingston University, no date). These changes result in ever more diverse {{teaching and learning}} strategies and a proliferation in the genres {{students are expected to}} produce. This is particularly the case in Art and Design Faculties, since many courses have a vocational or professional focus. While genres within some fields are clearly defined by academics, in others studentsï¿½ creativity is prioritised. Therefore, some discourse communities within this faculty do not require the same degree of conformity to norms as many in academia (Hyland 2004). The divergency of this context may be extreme, but I would argue it is becoming increasingly normal. It is therefore increasingly challenging to design in-sessional EAP courses. One solution to this problem is to continue to ï¿½pin downï¿½ each genre, delivering ever more focused courses. Another might be to teach English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP). However, each carries its own disadvantages. A more promising option is to develop university valued key skills alongside EAP skills by developing studentsï¿½ ability to unpack texts, recognise differences, identify and articulate preferences; and therefore teaching them our skills along with our knowledge. This would help sensitise them to the creativity of choice in communication. I am therefore proposing that we view students less as apprentice academics and more as researchers in order to develop their literacies (Bhatia, 2002) in the broadest sense. This move involves shifting more responsibility for learning onto students, but this in mimics the general university environment. Furthermore, including more <b>open-ended</b> tasks in <b>classes</b> may prove more engaging. Though this shift may not necessarily be universally valued, it arguably equips students with the skills to deal with the contemporary shift in higher education...|$|R
