40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the transport of}} ions in the low-altitude magnetosphere magnetosphere of Mercury. We show that, because of small spatial scales, the centrifugal effect due to curvature of the E B drift paths can lead to significant particle energization in the parallel direction. We demonstrate that because of this effect, ions with initial speed smaller than the escape speed such as those produced via thermal desorption can overcome gravity and escape into the magnetosphere. The escape route of this low-energy exosphere <b>originating</b> <b>material</b> is largely controlled by the magnetospheric convection rate. This escape route spreads over a narrower range of altitudes when the convection rate increases. Bulk transport of low-energy planetary material thus occurs within a limited region of space once moderate magnetospheric convection is established. These results suggest that, via release of material otherwise gravitationally trapped, the E B related centrifugal acceleration is an important mechanism for the net supply of plasma to the magnetosphere of Mercury...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} artists {{working with the}} moving image {{constitutes}} a substantial dialogue with technology. The ability to construct a complex visual narrative from disparate visual material is a developed skill that {{is the product of}} such an evolving dialogue with technique. The use of found and stolen images and their re-processing within such an ‘experimental’ practice can be experienced as transforming the <b>originating</b> <b>material</b> and emphasizing aspects previously hidden. Such ‘shock tactics’ performed on historic material will be examined in the film work of Peter Tscherkassky (Dreamwork Austria 10 minutes 2001) and Martin Arnold (Alone: Life Wastes Andy Hardy Austria 15 minutes 1998). The traumatic effect of these films will be examined in relation to Maya Deren’s ideas of ‘vertical’ and ‘horizontal’ editing and Chris Brewin’s neurological research into traumatic remembering which proposes the interaction between two types of memory systems: SAM (Situational Accessible Memory) and VAM (Verbally Accessible Memory). <br /...|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} primary {{chemical}} compounds correlated with known secondary chemistry and morphological variation within the Ramalina siliquosa {{group has been}} investigated. A hundred specimens were collected on two different occasions from 13 different populations on the Swedish west coast during April 1984. Protein extracts were prepared from 27 on secondary constituents identified and morphologically analysed populations. The protein bandings were performed by means of isoelectric focusing. Twenty-two different banding patterns were analysed since two were destroyed during preparation and three others yielded weak patterns. The results indicated that three different banding pattern types could be discerned: type A <b>originated</b> from <b>material</b> containing norstictic acid, stictic acid, norstictic acid in combination with stictic acid and on acid-deficient material; type B <b>originated</b> from <b>material</b> containing salazinic acid or salazinic acid in combination with protocetraric acid; and type C <b>originated</b> from <b>material</b> containing salazinic acid, protocetraric acid, salazinic acid in combination with protocetraric acid or on acid-deficient material. Material of banding type A belonged morphologically to R. cuspidata (Ach.) Nyl. and material of banding types B and C to R. siliquosa (Hudson) A. L. Smith. Seasonal and developmental factors can, however, affect the production of both primary and secondary constituents. Since there are no obvious morphological differences between the different chemical races within R. siliquosa s. str. and as material of salazinic acid in combination with protocetraric acid yielded both type B and type C banding patterns, the results do not support a taxonomy in the R. siliquosa group recognizing more than two species...|$|R

25|$|As Simple Minds' main writing team, Kerr and Burchill had {{continued}} to demo and <b>originate</b> <b>material</b> by themselves. For the latest sessions they had shared studio space with a band called Sly Silver Sly who featured Jim Kerr's brother Mark (previously the drummer with Gun) and bass guitarist Eddie Duffy, and who were working with American songwriter Kevin Hunter. While in the studio, the two writing and recording projects (including the Hunter co-writes) merged to become the sessions for the next Simple Minds album, Our Secrets Are the Same. Once again, Forbes and Gaynor found themselves out of the band: Mark Kerr became the new drummer and Eddie Duffy joined on bass guitar. The new-look Simple Minds made their début with a short set of greatest hits at the Scotland Rocks For Kosovo festival, with Mark Taylor returning on keyboards. The displaced Forbes and Gaynor, having apparently {{been told that the}} band was not appearing at the festival, formed a new band of their own to play the same concert.|$|R

While in the wake of the work performed by Antoine Lavoisier and his group, the analysis of a considerable part of mineral compounds no longer posed a problem, the same was not the case of the substances of plant or animal origin. In this paper we discuss Pierre-J. Macquer’s and Antoine –F.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{characterization}} of Sr-, Zn- and Cd-exchanged zeolitic materials as water vapor adsorbents, in order to evaluate {{the influence of the}} extraframework species on their adsorption properties. Both synthetic and natural substrates are taken into account. Water vapor adsorption isotherms on each ion-exchanged sample have been obtained at 298, 318, 338, and 358 K and have then been modeled using the Dubinin-Astakhov equation. Focusing on the possible implementation of such adsorbents in thermodynamic cycles, an estimation of their specific heat storage densities has been expressed. Results revealed that adsorbents of natural origin are not suitable for a valid employment in thermodynamic cycles, while FAU-type zeolite X samples exchanged with Sr 2 + or divalent transition metal ions (i. e., Zn 2 + or Cd 2 +) show a significant potential as heat storage media. The same trend of the specific heat storage density with the cationic content of the adsorbent can be identified for both series of synthetic and naturally <b>originating</b> <b>materials</b> (i. e., Zn > Sr > Cd > Na), confirming how ion exchange allows effective tuning of zeolitic substrates when employed in thermodynamic cycles based on the reversible adsorption of water vapor...|$|R
