5|$|After {{the airport}} opened, {{services}} started with Widerøe-operated twenty-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters. The airline operated two trips Bodø–Røst–Værøy–Bodø on weekdays and <b>one</b> <b>round</b> trip during the weekend. In addition, {{there were two}} weekly trips that connected Værøy to Leknes Airport before returning to Bodø. The service was subsidized by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Widerøe replaced the Twin Otters with 37-seat de Havilland Canada DHC-8-100 Dash 8s in 1995. The route from Bodø to Røst was made subject to public service obligation from 1 April 1997, which was won by the incumbent, after beating Valdresfly and Helikopter Service in the auction. The following contract, valid from 1 April 2000, was awarded to Guard Air, but this company folded in 2001. Helikopter Service operated the route temporarily until Widerøe took it over again the same year.|$|E
5|$|Captain Lawrence {{realised}} {{that his}} ship's speed {{would take it}} past Shannon and ordered a 'pilot's luff'. This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make the sails shiver and reduce the ship's speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while <b>one</b> <b>round</b> shot demolished Shannons ship's bell.|$|E
5|$|Cotto {{returned}} to action on February 21, 2009, in a card {{held at the}} Madison Square Garden, sporting {{the first of his}} trademark tattoos which he has expanded on ever since. This time competing against Michael Jennings for the vacant WBO welterweight title. After both pugilists used the first round to study their opponent's style, the tempo accelerated during the second. In the third, Cotto pursued the offensive more fluidly, connecting with jabs and hooks. <b>One</b> <b>round</b> later, Cotto scored two knockdowns on Jennings, who was able to continue until the recess. In the fifth, Jennings was trapped against the ropes, which Cotto utilized to connect a right hook to score a third knockdown. Jennings incorporated, but the referee decided to stop the fight. With this action, Cotto was awarded a technical knockout victory, in the process winning his second championship in the welterweight division. On April 8, 2009, Cotto fired his uncle from the team's staff, following a violent discussion where his property was damaged. However, neither side expressed interest in pursuing any sort of legal action. Consequently, Cotto named Joe Santiago, who had served as the team's nutritionist as his new trainer.|$|E

5|$|For the 1982 season, Toivonen {{switched}} to the Rothmans-sponsored Opel team, which was co-managed by David Richards. Toivonen's team mates were Ari Vatanen, who had won the previous year's championship (with Richards as his co-driver), the 1980 and 1982 world champion Walter Röhrl and Jimmy McRae, the previous year's British Rally Champion and father of future rally star Colin McRae. In his Ascona 400 debut in Portugal, Toivonen surprised the event favourites by leading the rally before retiring five stages from the finish. He competed in only four more WRC events, but finished on the podium twice, at the Acropolis Rally and at the RAC Rally. In the European Rally Championship, he participated in four rallies, registering three podiums and one retirement. He also made a guest appearance in <b>one</b> <b>round</b> of the British Formula Three circuit racing championship, where he finished tenth driving a Ralt RT3. In his Formula One test for March Grand Prix at the Silverstone Circuit, Toivonen was 1.4 seconds faster than the team's regular driver Raul Boesel.|$|E
5|$|In her 15th {{professional}} bout, Kentikian {{fought for}} her first world championship in Cologne, Germany, on February 16, 2007; it was also her first time headlining a fight card. She won by a ninth round technical knockout against Carolina Alvarez of Venezuela, thereby winning the vacant WBA Flyweight title. Alvarez took unanswered punches {{in most of the}} rounds and was bleeding heavily from her nose and the referee eventually stopped the fight in round nine in concern for Alvarez's health. Six weeks later, on March 30, 2007, Kentikian made her first title defense. Before a crowd of 19,500 in the Kölnarena, she fought on the undercard of the popular exhibition bout between German comedian Stefan Raab and WIBF World Champion Regina Halmich. Kentikian beat María José Núñez from Uruguay with a third round technical knockout. Núñez was knocked down in round two and Kentikian finished the fight <b>one</b> <b>round</b> later with a right cross followed up by combinations that left Núñez defenseless on the ropes, causing the referee to step in.|$|E
5|$|Martin's team {{directly}} {{qualified for}} the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials {{in his hometown of}} Edmonton. In his fourth Trials, Martin lost just <b>one</b> <b>round</b> robin game. After defeating the previously undefeated Glenn Howard rink in his final round robin game, Martin got a bye to the final, which was against Howard, whom he defeated 7–3. With the win, Martin earned the right to represent Canada for the second time at the Olympics. After the Olympic Trials, Martin's rink failed to qualify for the playoffs at the 2010 Swiss Chalet National. This would mark the first time Martin failed to make the playoffs at a Grand Slam since 2003. However, they proved they were worthy to represent Canada at the Olympics by winning the 2010 BDO Classic Canadian Open two weeks later.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May 2014, Rob Edwards was {{appointed}} {{as the new}} manager replacing Ronnie Moore, who was suspended {{in the middle of}} February 2014 for breaching FA rules. The summer transfer window saw twelve players join the club, including experienced striker Kayode Odejayi while Ryan Lowe left the club shortly after being handed the Player of the Season award. Edwards was sacked after just five months following the home loss to Plymouth Argyle which saw Tranmere Rovers at the bottom of League Two. Three days later Micky Adams was announced as new manager. A brief improvement in results which saw Tranmere reach the Third Round of the FA Cup and move out of the relegation zone was followed by disastrous spring form resulting in Adams leaving Tranmere by mutual consent two games {{before the end of the}} season, with the club again bottom of the table. Assistant manager Alan Rogers took charge, but on 25 April Tranmere was defeated at Plymouth Argyle which confirmed Rovers' relegation to the National League <b>one</b> <b>round</b> prior to the end of the season. Thus, Tranmere Rovers' ninety-four-year presence in the Football League had ended.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in <b>one</b> <b>round,</b> and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|The main {{market for}} the charter {{services}} was Stavanger Airport, Sola, mainly serving transport of personnel in the oil industry. By the 1980s, Norsk Air had up to four daily round trips between the two cities. In 1983, the airline received concession to start a regular scheduled service to Stavanger. A ten-seat Beechcraft Super King Air was bought and services started on 12 January 1984. Services to Bergen Airport, Flesland started on 10 July. Soon there were four daily round trips to both cities, supplemented by charter trips operated by Penguin. Starting on 26 March 1984, Norsk Flytjeneste experienced competition on the routes from Sandefjord to Bergen and Stavanger, when Busy Bee, on contract with Braathens SAFE, started flights using 50-passenger Fokker F27s. However, they operated only <b>one</b> <b>round</b> trip, with the same aircraft serving Sandefjord–Stavanger–Haugesund–Bergen.|$|E
