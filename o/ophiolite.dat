5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath {{microcontinent}} was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks.

Methods: The birthplaces of patients with MM or PPs (cases) and patients with prostate or breast cancer (control subjects), diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 and identified through a mandatory cancer registry or from hospital records (PPs), were located on a geologic map, and the nearest distance to <b>ophiolites</b> was measured.

Results: Patients with MM (n = 100) or PPs (n = 133) were born significantly nearer to <b>ophiolites</b> (median distance, 4. 5 km for men, 0 km for women) than were patients with prostate cancer (n = 161) or breast cancer (n = 139) (median distance, 20 km for both).

For this reason these sequences {{have been so}} far referred to the Balagne-type <b>ophiolites.</b> The Pineto Massif is composed of a cumulitic intrusive sequence consisting of layered troctolites, dunites, gabbros, and anorthosites cross cut by basaltic dykes. The chemical composition of both cumulates and dykes reveal an oceanic tholeiitic affinity. In particular, the Pineto Massif basaltic dykes have REE patterns {{similar to those of}} N-MORBs with slight LREE/HREE depletion, as also evidenced by low CeN/YbN (0. 9 - 1. 2) ratios. The Nebbio ophiolitic sequence consists of pillow and massive lava flow basalts capped by cherts, Calpionella limestones, and Cretaceous siliciclastic formations. Chemically, the Nebbio basalts are similar to ocean-floor basalts. They are characterized by LREE enrichment with respect to HREE, as evidenced by the CeN/YbN (1. 2 - 1. 9) ratios. Their REE patterns are similar to those shown by T-MORBs. Geochemical data show that the Pineto Massif <b>ophiolites</b> are different from the Balagne Nappe T-MOR basalts, suggesting that any correlation between the Pineto Massif <b>ophiolites</b> and the Balagne Nappe should be ruled out.

In detail there are problems, with many ophiolites exhibiting thinner accumulations of igneous rock than are inferred for oceanic crust. Another problem relating oceanic crust and ophiolites is that the thick gabbro layer of ophiolites calls for large magma chambers beneath mid-ocean ridges.

40|$|<b>Ophiolites</b> {{have been}} a {{stimulating}} and interesting topic of multidisciplinary research since their recognition as on-land exposures of fossil oceanic crust in the early 1960 s. Since those times, the ideas on the tectonic setting of formation of <b>ophiolites,</b> mechanisms of their incorporation into continental margins, and their geodynamic significance in the formation and evolution of orogenic belts have significantly varied over the years. Over the past 30 years, a fundamental role for refining the general ideas on <b>ophiolites</b> has been played by multidisciplinary researches on <b>ophiolites</b> from the peri-Mediterranean orogenic belts (Tethyan <b>ophiolites),</b> which have produced a wealth of data and observations and have significantly improved {{our knowledge of the}} tectonic, magmatic and metamorphic processes through which the oceanic lithosphere is generated and transformed. The G. L. O. M. (Working Group on Mediterranean <b>Ophiolites)</b> session at the 6 th Italian Forum on Earth Sciences held in Rimini, Italy, 12 - 14 September 2007, provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate and discuss the most recent observations, data and ideas on <b>ophiolites</b> from the peri-Mediterranean orogenic belts. New observations and data were presented for a number of ophiolitic complexes located in the peri-Mediterranean orogenic belts, including Western Alps, Alpine Corsica, Northern and Southern Apennine, Albanides, Hellenides and central Anatolia. Multisciplinary discussion on igneous petrogenesis of <b>ophiolites,</b> melt and fluid flow in the oceanic lithosphere, tectonic and metamorphic evolution of <b>ophiolites,</b> emplacement tectonics of <b>ophiolites</b> sedimentary processes in the ophiolitic covers and biostratigraphy of radiolarian cherts, involved active participation of many researchers, from Italy and abroad. This Special Section of Ofioliti contains a collection of research papers presented at the 6 th Italian Forum on Earth Sciences with the aim of propagating new data and models on various aspects of the peri-Mediterranean <b>ophiolites</b> to the international community. A systematic geochemical investigation of ophiolitic basalts and metabasalts from Alpine Corsica is presented by Saccani et al. {{in order to understand the}} petrological processes responsible of their formation. Hellenide <b>ophiolites</b> are investigated in the Othrys area (External Ophiolitic Belt) by Bortolotti et al. through a synergetic combination of biostratigraphic, petrologic and tectonic expertise in order to constrain the Triassic evolution of the Vardar oceanic basin, as well as by Saccani et al. in the Guevgueli area (Internal Ophiolitic Belt), where the complex association of back-arc basin basalts and volcanic arc calc-alkaline rocks confirm the existence of an ensialic back-arc basin in that area. For Central Anatolia, Goncuoglu et al. provide new biostratigraphic and petrologic data in support of the debated existence of a Jurassic ridge spreading in the poorly known Intra-Pontide branch of the Tethys. For the Western Alps, Fontana et al. and Panseri et al. presented two companion papers on the oceanic to orogenic evolution of serpentinized ultramafic sequences and associated mafic rocks from the Mount Avic (Piemonte Ophiolitic Nappe) based on new field, petrographic and mineralogical data. The antigorite-titanian clinohumitediopside schists and the enclosed rodingitized mafic rocks are interpreted as products of oceanic metasomatism and tectonic and metamorphic evolution of the Alpine orogeny, at the expense of abyssal peridotites intruded by mafic rocks at a fossil slow-spreading ridge setting...|$|R

This resulted in the highly distorted and fractured basalt and serpentine of the Mount Diablo <b>Ophiolite</b> and metasediments of the Franciscan complex around the summit. East of the subduction zone, a basin was filling with sediment from the ancestral Sierra further to the east. Up to 60,000 feet (18,000 m) of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone of the Great Valley Sequence were deposited from 66 to 150 million years ago.
