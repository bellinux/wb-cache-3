5|$|A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28. A reconnaissance aircraft flight into a system <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day indicated that a tropical depression developed near 14.5°N, 48.9°W. The depression initially moved west-northwestward and remained disorganized for several days. In {{the early stages of the}} depression, the system appeared to have been located under minor vortices in the upper atmosphere, located within a strong easttowest oriented trough. Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Gabrielle was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused nine fatalities in the United States and Canada, despite remaining hundreds of miles offshore. The tenth tropical cyclone, seventh named storm, and third hurricane of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season, Gabrielle developed on August30 from a tropical wave near {{the west coast of}} Africa. Under favorable conditions, the depression intensified and became Tropical Storm Gabrielle early <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day. Rapid strengthening occurred thereafter, with Gabrielle reaching hurricane intensity early on September1. After becoming a hurricane, further intensification was steady, though by September5, Gabrielle peaked as a moderate Category4 hurricane. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day, Gabrielle began to slowly level-off in intensity, while gradually curving northward. After weakening to a Category2 hurricane, the storm passed east of Bermuda on September8.|$|E

Re-curving northeastward, Isbell quickly strengthened further and reached hurricane status by later that day. Late on October13, Isbell made landfall in the Pinar del Río Province of Cuba. The storm continued strengthening and peaked as a Category 3hurricane <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day. Isbell moved northeastward and made landfall near Everglades, Florida, late on October14. After reaching the Atlantic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day, the storm began to weaken.

5|$|Hurricane Keith was an Atlantic {{hurricane}} in October 2000 {{that caused}} extensive damage in Central America, especially in Mexico and Belize. It was the fifteenth tropical cyclone, eleventh named storm, and seventh hurricane of the that year's Atlantic hurricane season. Keith {{developed as a}} tropical depression from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on September28. The depression gradually strengthened, and became Tropical Storm Keith <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day. As the storm tracked westward, it continued to intensify and was upgraded to a hurricane on September30. Shortly thereafter, Keith began to rapidly deepen, and peaked as a Category4 hurricane less than 24hours later. Keith then began to meander erratically offshore of Belize, which significantly weakened the storm due to land interaction. By late on October2, Keith made landfall in Ambergris Caye, Belize as a minimal hurricane. It quickly weakened to a tropical storm, before another landfall occurred near Belize City early <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day. While moving inland over the Yucatán Peninsula, Keith weakened further, and was downgraded to a tropical depression before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on October4. Once in the Gulf of Mexico, Keith began to re-strengthen and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day, and a hurricane <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> day. By late on October5, Keith made its third and final landfall near Tampico, Tamaulipas, Mexico as a moderately strong Category 1 hurricane. The storm quickly weakened inland and dissipated as a tropical cyclone by 24hours after landfall.|$|E
