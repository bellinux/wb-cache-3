5|$|Division forms two polyps {{that each}} become {{as large as}} the original. Longitudinal {{division}} begins when a polyp broadens and then divides its coelenteron (body), effectively splitting along its length. The mouth divides and new tentacles form. The two polyps thus created then generate their missing body parts and exoskeleton. Transversal division occurs when polyps and the exoskeleton divide transversally into two parts. This means <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> basal disc (bottom) and the other has the oral disc (top); the new polyps must separately generate the missing pieces.|$|E

50|$|In finite groups, {{there were}} many {{independent}} milestones. <b>One</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> discovery of 22 new sporadic groups, and {{the completion of the}} first generation of the classification of finite simple groups. <b>One</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> influential idea of the Carter subgroup, and the subsequent creation of formation theory and the theory of classes of groups. <b>One</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> remarkable extensions of Clifford theory by Green to the indecomposable modules of group algebras. During this era, the field of computational group theory became a recognized field of study, due in part to its tremendous success during the first generation classification.|$|R

5|$|Zones. The {{object of}} this mode is to capture various control {{points on the}} map. Each control point has 3 levels for each team, and a neutral level. A player can do this in other game modes (except deathmatch) to earn points for yourself, but in Zones, their team gains points {{for the number of}} zones the player has, and how many levels each <b>one</b> <b>has.</b> <b>The</b> player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear, or {{captured}} by their team. The game ends when the time runs out, score limit is reached, or if the player is able to capture all control points.|$|E
5|$|Nynaeve, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who meets with Rand {{in an attempt to}} break his emotional isolation. Rand becomes angry when he learns that Tam was sent by Cadsuane, nearly killing his father before fleeing in horror at what he had almost done. Rand Travels to the Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he Travels to the top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life, suggests that by being reborn <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to do things right. Agreeing, Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is finally able to laugh again.|$|E
5|$|The cross-in-square plan, with {{a single}} dome at the {{crossing}} or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period. Examples include an early 9th century church in Tirilye, now called the Fatih Mosque, and the palace chapel of the Myrelaion, built around 920. The Nea Ekklesia of Emperor Basil I was built in Constantinople around 880 {{as part of a}} substantial building renovation and construction program during his reign. It had five domes, which are known from literary sources, but different arrangements for them have been proposed under at least four different plans. <b>One</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> domes arranged in a cruciform pattern like those of the contemporaneous Church of St. Andrew at Peristerai or the much older Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Others arrange them in a quincunx pattern, with four minor domes in the corners of a square and a larger fifth in the center, as part of a cross-domed or cross-in-square plan. It is often suggested that the five-domed design of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi, from 1164, is based on that of the Nea Ekklesia.|$|E

25|$|However, {{salpingitis}} {{can also}} lead to infertility because the eggs released in ovulation can't get contact with the sperm. Approximately 75,000-225,000 cases of infertility in the US are caused by salpingitis. The more times <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> infection, the greater the risk of infertility. With one episode of salpingitis, the risk of infertility is 8-17%. With 3 episodes of salpingitis, the risk is 40-60%, although the exact risk depends on the severity of each episode.|$|E
