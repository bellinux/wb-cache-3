5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, {{to bring in}} supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information {{about what was happening}} in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised {{by the size of the}} crowd, given the fact that Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the <b>open)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
