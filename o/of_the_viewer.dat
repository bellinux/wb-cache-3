5|$|The {{painting}} shows a {{large room}} in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid {{during the reign of}} King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> {{backlash}} Animal Planet {{received for}} allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, {{the producers of}} the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E

25|$|The sea {{is seen as}} {{blue for}} largely the same reason: the water absorbs the longer {{wavelengths}} of red and reflects and scatters the blue, which comes to the eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> The colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky, reflected by particles in the water; and by algae and plant life in the water, which can make it look green; or by sediment, which can make it look brown.|$|E

25|$|In {{their bright}} whites, the figures clearly {{stand out from}} the rest of the image. The light is {{characteristic}} of the early evening of a summer day in the Mediterranean. The already low sun appears from the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> on the two sides to seeing women whose long shadows loom on the beach behind them. Playback of these lighting effects under the southern sun are typical Valenciano for Luminismo, one in Spain resulting from the Impressionism as a special form of Neo-Impressionism, whose main representative was Joaquín Sorolla.|$|E
25|$|In the Channel Island of Guernsey, {{there are}} two named dogs. One, Tchico (Tchi-coh two Norman words for dog, whence cur), is headless, and is {{supposed}} to be the phantom of a past Bailiff of Guernsey, Gaultier de la Salle, who was hanged for falsely accusing one of his vassals. The other dog is known as Bodu or tchen Bodu (tchen being dog in Dgèrnésiais). His appearance, usually in the Clos du Valle, foretells death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> or someone close to him. There are also numerous other unnamed apparitions, usually associated with placenames derived from bête (beast).|$|E
25|$|Telematic {{art is a}} {{descriptive}} of art projects using computer mediated telecommunications networks as their medium. Telematic art challenges the traditional relationship between active viewing subjects and passive art objects by creating interactive, behavioural contexts for remote aesthetic encounters. Roy Ascott sees the telematic art form as the transformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> into an active participator of creating the artwork which remains in process throughout its duration. Ascott {{has been at the}} forefront of the theory and practice of telematic art since 1978 when he went online for the first time, organizing different collaborative online projects.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, {{art critic}} Leo Steinberg {{in his essay}} The Philosophical Brothel posited a wholly {{different}} explanation for {{the wide range of}} stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the gaze <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, the Romanian RCS, {{the largest}} company {{of its kind}} on the {{internal}} market, interrupted its carriage of Discovery Communications channels, including Discovery Channel. The CEO of Discovery Communications Mark Hollinger sent an open letter {{in his attempt to}} counteract the action of RCS, attracting the attention to the negation of the alleged right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to choose the viewed channels. In turn, RCS issued a press statement accusing of hypocrisy Hollinger's discourse attentive at the needs of viewers and attracted attention to the fact that, during negotiations, the main preoccupations of the Discovery representatives was maintaining as high as possible tariffs and monetary gains”.|$|E
25|$|The tiger's prey {{is beyond}} {{the edge of the}} canvas, so it is left to the {{imagination}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to decide what the outcome will be, although Rousseau's original title Surprised! suggests the tiger has the upper hand. Rousseau later stated that the tiger was about to pounce on a group of explorers. Despite their apparent simplicity, Rousseau's jungle paintings were built up meticulously in layers, using a large number of green shades to capture the lush exuberance of the jungle. He also devised his own method for depicting the lashing rain by trailing strands of silver paint diagonally across the canvas, a technique inspired by the satin-like finishes of the paintings of William-Adolphe Bouguereau.|$|E

25|$|These {{markings}} {{were effective}} {{within a mile}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer,</b> but as the numbers of groups increased from sixteen to forty, assembly difficulties increased. In February 1944 the USAAF decided to discontinue further camouflage painting of its aircraft, and the 2nd Bomb Division devised a system for its B-24s whereby the entire tail fin was painted in a color (each of its five combat wings was assigned a color) and a black or white band placed across the fin either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to identify the group within that wing. The 93rd CBW of the 3rd Air Division, which operated B-24s from May to September 1944, also adopted a color system in June.|$|E
25|$|Le Chahut is a {{conspicuous}} example of Seurat’s pointillist technique. The modulation {{of light and}} shadow throughout the work is obtained by the use of small dots of color juxtaposed side by side while alternating in both intensity and concentrations. The dots are meant to fuse in the eye <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to create the impression of mixed colors when observed from a distance. While the Impressionists had focused their attention on the harmony of colors based on similar or related hues (only partially separated), the Neo-Impressionists harmony had been based on contrasting hues, pitted one against the other; resulting in a vibrating mélange optique (the optical mixture in the observer's eye).|$|E
25|$|The image {{can be read}} as a petrified {{synthesis}} of all the stages during and after the Descent from the Cross: the lowering of the corpse, the Deposition, Lamentation and the Entombment. Christ's feet appear to be still nailed together, while the spread of His arms retains the position of His body on the Cross. Christ's body is shown as if held out for the concentrated gaze <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> Joseph of Arimathea looks across the body towards the skull of Adam. Joseph appears as a sumptuously dressed burgher and has the most portrait-like appearance of the figures in the painting; his gaze links the hands of Christ and his mother, the new Adam and Eve, with the skull of Adam. Thereby visualising the essence of the Redemption.|$|E
