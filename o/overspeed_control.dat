40|$|Abstract—The {{overspeed}} deflector {{control of}} two Pelton turbine hydro {{units in the}} Alaska Railbelt power system has caused many incidents of oscillatory instability. Among the causes is the high controller gains applied to the deflectors, which are essential for load rejection operations but destabilize the power swings. In this paper, the <b>overspeed</b> <b>control</b> is achieved by reducing the feedback gains derived from frequency-domain analysis and using an adap-tive feedforward control to counter the transient overfrequency condition. Simulation studies show the improved performance of the proposed control design. Index Terms—Adaptive feedforward control, deflector bias, de-flector control, Pelton turbine, PI regulation, swing modes. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} wind tunnel tests {{carried out on}} a small V-type Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (V-VAWT). This model wind turbine was specifically designed to study the effect of tip area and tip pitch {{on the performance of}} this novel VAWT. The results have demonstrated that tip pitch is highly suitable for overall control of the V-VAWT and tip areas as little as 5 % of the total blade area could provide both power regulation and <b>overspeed</b> <b>control.</b> While it has not been possible to match the predicted performance data directly to these test results, the computer model VAWTTAY 6 can be used with some confidence to predict the performance of larger sized V-VAWTs...|$|E
40|$|The present paper compares control {{strategies}} for fixed pitch Tidal Current Turbines and introduces the underspeed control technique. The {{state of the}} art approach of <b>overspeed</b> <b>control</b> for fixed pitch turbine increases the tip speed ratio to limit the power output of the turbine. This leads to a high fatigue loading as the number of load cycles increases and requires a specific rotor design not to increase the thrust coefficient as well. The underspeed controller on the other side reduces the tip speed ratio resulting in a reduced thrust coefficient and a reduced number of load cycles. However, this point of operation is unstable based on the characteristic curves of the rotor and needs to be stabilized by the controller. The basic structure of the controller as well as the calculated stability limits will be shown in the paper. Further, the performance of the underspeed controller regarding loads is compared to {{state of the art}} fixed and variable pitch controllers. The paper concludes with an analysis of the impacts on the turbine design and further potential and issues arising with the underspeed control approach...|$|E

40|$|Many small wind {{turbines}} {{are designed to}} furl (turn) in high winds to regulate power and provide <b>overspeed</b> protection. Furling <b>control</b> results in poor energy capture at high wind speeds. This paper proposes an alternative control strategy for small {{wind turbines}} [...] the soft-stall control method. The furling and soft-stall control strategies are compared using steady state analysis and dynamic simulation analysis. The soft-stall method is found to offer several advantages: increased energy production at high wind speeds, energy production which tracks the maximum power coefficient at low to medium wind speeds, reducing furling noise, and reduced thrust...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of special-purpose airfoils for horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) began in 1984 as {{a joint effort}} between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), formerly the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI), and Airfoils, Incorporated. Since that time nine airfoil families have been designed for various size rotors using the Eppler Airfoil Design and Analysis Code. A general performance requirement of the new airfoil families is that they exhibit a maximum lift coefficient (cl,max) which is relatively insensitive to roughness effects. The airfoil families {{address the needs of}} stall-regulated, variable-pitch, and variable-rpm wind turbines. For stall-regulated rotors, better peak-power control is achieved through the design of outboard airfoils that restrain the maximum lift coefficient. Restrained maximum lift coefficient allows the use of more swept disc area for a given generator size. Also, for stall-regulated rotors, thicker tip airfoils help accommodate <b>overspeed</b> <b>control</b> devices. For variable-pitch and variable-rpm rotors, outboard airfoils having a high maximum lift coefficient lend themselves to lower blade solidity. Airfoils having greater thickness result in greater blade stiffness and tower clearance. Airfoils of low thickness result in less drag and are better suited for downwind machines. Annual energy improvements from the NREL airfoil families are projected to be 23 % to 35 % for stall- regulate...|$|E
40|$|In {{the public}} domain. Date for general release: August 1986 Two-dimensional wind tunnel tests were {{conducted}} to determine the aerodynamic effects of spoiler hingeline location on the NACA 23024 airfoil. The particular motivation for these studies is potential application of spoilers for <b>overspeed</b> <b>control</b> of wind turbines. For the tests, 10 % chord spoiler at 90 degrees angle of deflection and 20 % chord spoiler at 60, 90, and 120 degrees angles of deflection were used. The locations of attachment for these spoilers were at 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 80 percent along the wing chord. The wind tunnel {{tests were conducted}} at Reynolds numbers of 0. 6 xlo 6 and of 1. 0 x 10 6, which correspond to Mach numbers of 0. 1 and 0. 2, respectively. Results of the study show that when the spoiler hingeline is relocated toward {{the leading edge of}} the airfoil, the spoiler effectiveness in producing reduced lift and added drag is increased, especially at high angles of attack below the stall. The leading edge suction force is decreased as the spoiler hingeline is relocated toward {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil. The trend of the results agrees with theoretical predictions. It is recommended that tests of spoilers be conducted on a rotating blade.

30|$|The Tyne & Wear Metro {{operates}} {{on its own}} infrastructure {{as well as some}} sections using shared track with Network Rail. Thus there is a variety of signalling used, all fixed block. Most of the system has simple two-aspect signalling with occasional fixed distants and three-aspect signals. However, the Pelaw to South Hylton route uses Network Rail infrastructure and subsequently utilises standard mainline four-aspect signalling with yellow and double yellow signals. As of May 2014, signals using LED technology were only installed on the section shared with Network Rail {{as well as at the}} depot. The Metro drivers do not have the benefit of automatic warning system (AWS) or train protection and warning system (TPWS) available to the mainline train drivers on the same route. The automatic train protection (ATP) system <b>controls</b> <b>overspeeding</b> and signal passed at danger (SPaD). However, the speed control infrastructure is at certain locations only. The ATP system used is the Indusi system which is a version of German mainline railway warning and supervision system Induktives Sicherungssystem.|$|R
