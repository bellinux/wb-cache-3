40|$|This {{research}} uses a {{grounded theory}} approach {{to explore the}} term ‘experienced Board Member’ with research into the learning experiences which {{bridge the gap between}} an inexperienced Board Member and an experienced Board Member. The purpose of this research is to identify repeatable/reportable patterns which could be utilised and developed to improve Board Member learning. Data is derived from interviews with nine (current and past) New Zealand Board Members. A common set of attributes of an experienced Board Member emerged from the study. The linking theme of the attributes is that they support the process of reaching a quality agreement or decision. The {{results of this study suggest}} that an experienced Board Member is perceived to be a Board Member who contributes to achieving a quality agreement and decision, using attributes associated with: •	Contribution to Board processes •	Understanding and Knowledge (governance and business acumen) •	Internal Drivers •	Making Hard Decisions. Formative Board Member learning is associated with developing self confidence, understanding what content is perceived to be (or not to be) relevant, understanding the Boardroom protocols and processes, and understanding the responsibility of the role. The primary mechanism in Board Member learning is <b>observation.</b> <b>Board</b> Member learning was most often the development of tacit understanding through observing events internal to the Board. Learning events for Board Members are likely to arise as part of the dismissal/departure of the CEO or from internal Board dissension. The results also indicate that current NZ Board Members are unlikely to have had any formal preparation for the Board Member role, and learning for the role is likely to be ad-hoc and vicarious. This research suggests that the successful development of experienced Board Members will require a fundamental change in the perception and practice of Board Member development within organisations and at Board level. A Capability and Maturity Model is presented as a framework for assessing an organisation’s capability and maturity in terms of the development of its Board Members. This study builds on corporate governance theory by identifying attributes considered indicative of an experienced Board Member. This study adds to Learning Organisation and Knowledge theories by providing examples and comment on the place of Communities of Practice, and knowledge development within the development of Board Member experience...|$|E

The power density along the wave normal direction shows a systematic peak structure which we identify as belonging to cyclotron wave harmonics of pickup ions near the comet. The fundamental harmonics of the cyclotron waves are also consistent with the gyrofrequencies calculated from the magnetic field data...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the generation of storm{associated ULF waves with discrete spectra (ion cyclotron harmonic waves) observed in the equatorial plasmasphere is presented. It is proposed that the appearance of waves with phase velocities smaller than the Alfven velocity is connected with a strong dispersion of magnetosonic waves near the bi{ion frequency occurring {{in the presence of}} oxygen ions of ionospheric origin. The waves are generated by an instability involving hot oxygen ions with loss cone or ring like distributions. Such ions are found in the magnetosphere during magnetic storms. A simple analytical model of this instability is elaborated. It is shown that ULF wave <b>observations</b> on <b>board</b> Akebono satellite are in a reasonable agreement with the present theoretical approach. 2 1...|$|R

In addition to the nearly radial IMF, the following particle and field conditions were present: (1) in situ cyclotron-resonant wave activity, (2) a seed energetic particle population, and (3) small (not above 25 deg) theta(Bn) at the points of connection of the spacecraft to the bow shock.

The percentage of discards varies from 80. 7 to 86. 4 % in weight which corresponds to a volume of 31 516 tons of fish discarded annually. Commercial species constitute 58. 8 % of the discards in the gamba fishery and 73. 8 % in the langostino fishery. In particular the hake and round fish stocks experience a fishery mortality as discards, which is high compared to the mortality induced by the specialized fleet...|$|R

But {{what happens when a}} non-profit organisation is highly dependent on a single source of funding? This paper provides an empirical exploration of this issue. It draws on a longitudinal case study of one non-profit organisation in the UK that is highly dependent on a single funder to examine how accountability is constructed and enacted, with a focus on the board. It critically examines accountability processes through direct <b>observation</b> of <b>board</b> and committee meetings and in-depth interviews with board members. The analysis shows how board members work to construct broader forms of accountability beyond accountability to the funder, but then struggle to enact them.

The modulations were characterized by two superposed periods of about 100 sec and about 10 sec. It is suggested that the long-period modulation is due to the magnetopause surface waves, while the short-period modulations are due to the signature of ion cyclotron turbulence above the proton gyrofrequency, related to the magnetopause boundary layer...|$|R

The BeppoSAX WFCs were coded mask instruments sensitive in the 2 - 28 keV energy band with a 40 x 40 square degree fields of view, pointing in opposite directions and perpendicularly to the BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments (NFI). The WFCs were usually operated simultaneously to NFI observations, each lasting up to several days. WFCs observed thus the entire sky several times with a typical sensitivity of 2 to 10 mCrab.

Precipitation features are defined as contiguous regions of radar echo and are subdivided into mesoscale convective system (MCS) and sub-MCS categories. Results show that MCSs observed in EPIC and TEPPS have distinct diurnal signatures.

This paper uses the High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder/ 2 (HIRS/ 2) and Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) <b>observations</b> on <b>board</b> the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-ministration satellites, to assess the characteristics of the cloud fields produced by the forecasting system over midlatitude and tropical oceans. Infrared and microwave radiation have different sensitivities to clouds and are therefore complementary. Observed and model-generated radiances, as well as HIRS/ 2 -derived cloud parameters, are compared. The model clouds are shown to be well distributed, with realistic seasonal cycles. However, deficiencies are identified and discussed: the cloud radiative impact may be too low in the midlatitudes, the frequency of occurrence of high clouds is overestimated in the intertropical convergence zone, and the stratocumulus off the west coast of the continents is underestimated. The methods described here provide a framework for assessing the impact of forthcoming improvements to the cloud scheme. 1...|$|R
