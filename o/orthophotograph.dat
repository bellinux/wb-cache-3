40|$|A {{system for}} the {{automatic}} reconstruction of a three dimensional terrain surface is presented. Matching is performed in object space, so that an arbitrary number of overlapping images, {{with a minimum of}} two, can be used. Image pyramids are used to decrease the search space. The similarity measure is the correlation coefficient. In order to take perspective differences into account, the images are resampled after each pyramid level, using the latest available surface model. The resampling method that is used comprises the differential rectification procedure for <b>orthophotograph</b> generation. Thus orthophotographs are automatically generated, simultaneously with the surface reconstruction. All pixels in the <b>orthophotograph</b> are matched. In order to make the result more robust, that is to reduce or eliminate the effects of gross errors, the matched points are filtered in two steps. The resolution of the digital surface model can be reduced by estimating a sparser grid of heights through a least squares adjustment of finite elements. Some test results are presented.

In order to improve the existing condition, I presented my suggestions for a reconstruction of the road on the existing route and the proposal of the completely new bypass.

The combination of various filter sizes (texture measures) and kernel sizes (filters) enlarges the signature space allowing the following image segmentation and classification {{in two or}} three scale levels. The at least two level classification simplifies thematically complex aerial <b>orthophotographs</b> by dividing the photo into thematically more homogenous areas in the higher level.

40|$|The {{production}} of <b>orthophotographs</b> at large scales for architectural photogrammetric applications faces {{a number of}} problems. The main difficulty arises when {{the ratio of the}} elevation differences on the object surface to the distance from the camera is large, or when there are surfaces with poor definition or little texture.

For Rosarie forest the estimations of stand top height, basal area, stand volume stand biomass and stand density (~ 23. 7 %) were similar with the ground measured stand characteristics (± 10 %), where as for Leanachan forest the estimations were less accurate due to the non-optimum illumination conditions during the acquisition of the aerial photographs. The level of accuracy achieved in this study is adequate for measuring tree and stand characteristics, if the acquisition conditions of aerial photographs are optimal.   Higher level of accuracy may be possible, but requires more accurate DTMs, possibly derived using active airborne remote sensing sensors.

The French benthic network (REBENT) needs detailed mapping of intertidal areas, based on aerial <b>orthophotographs,</b> Lidar (laser scanning) survey, field measurements and caracterization of morpho-sedimentary units. Different morphological types of coastal environments - rocky shore, sandy beaches and dunes, tidal flats and salt marshes - have been studied in Le Croisic macrotidal area, on the central Atlantic coast of France. The combined study of aerial <b>orthophotographs</b> and Lidar topographic data, collected in 2000, allows a description and preliminary mapping of the main morpho-sedimentary units.

Structures were mapped for 1982 and 2006 using human inter-pretation of high-resolution (0. 35 -m pixels) digital <b>orthophotographs.</b> Damage to structures from the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires was also evaluated using human interpretation of the digital <b>orthophotographs.</b> Approximately 25 % of the structures present were not mapped due to either interpreter error or overhanging vegetation. The majority of unmapped structures were sheds and garages. The error of omission for houses was between 7 and 10 % with the error of commission for houses being less than 0. 5 %. Bushfire threat was modelled using information about topographic slope and aspect, forest vegetation, and prevailing wind direction during days of high fire danger. The method detected a substantial change in bushfire threat from 1982 to 2006 {{for one of the}} three study sites whereas no change in overall bushfire threat was observed for the other two. Considering the location of structures built since 1982, these results appeared reasonable. However, the 1982 bushfire threat was not related to actual structure damage sustained during the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires.

40|$|True-orthophotographs are {{now being}} widely used in some areas, proving already as very {{valuable}} documents even replacing maps being more complete, reliable and objective. But they are still hard to produce with enough quality for other uses and scales, such as in architecture and conservation. Most works in these fields are just approximate ortho-rectifications by single or multiple planes [1]. Some academic attempts to reach quality “true ” orthophotos were made recently [2] [9] {{using a combination of}} laser scanner and images, but are still costly solutions lacking from the flexibility needed for field work. In this paper, a new practical technique and software to produce these architectural <b>orthophotographs</b> is presented, departing just from conventional digital photographs with no need for metric cameras or laser scanner, and for small projects, not even for topographical surveying. It is also intended to be easy to use for non-photogrammetrists, dramatically reducing the working time usually spent in other photogrammetry applications. This method requires very intensive calculations through a dedicated software development using GPU (Graphic Processing Unit), making easier and faster the production of high quality true-orthophotographs. The prototype was already tested producing some <b>orthophotographs</b> in a commercial environment and is being now developed as a compact software application making very easy to widely produce quality architectural orthoimages, that we feel can become a standard in heritage documentation soon. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIntertidal mudflats play a {{critical}} role in estuarine exchange, connecting marine and continental supplies of nutrients and sediments. However, their complex morphodynamics, associated with a wide range of physical and biological processes, are still poorly understood and require further field investigation. In addition, mudflats are challenging areas for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetric surveys. Indeed, the mudflats generally hold back residual tidal water, which can make stereo restitution particularly difficult because of poor correlations or sun-glint effects. This study aims to show the potential of light UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for monitoring sedimentary hydrodynamics at different spatial scales in a silty estuary. For each UAV mission an <b>orthophotograph</b> and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are computed. From repeated surveys the diachronic evolution of the area can be observed via DEM differencing. Considering the ground texture in such a context, the stereo restitution process is made possible because of the high spatial resolution of the UAV photographs. Providing a synoptic view as well as high spatial resolution (less than 4 cm), the UAV dataset enables multi-scale approaches from the study of large areas to the morphodynamics of smaller-scale sedimentary structures and the morphodynamics impact of plant ground cover...|$|E
