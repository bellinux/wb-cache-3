5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the <b>only</b> <b>word</b> that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E
5|$|After the {{briefing}} Phu immediately {{returned to his}} headquarters in Pleiku, where he began planning for the withdrawal with Brigadier Generals Tran Van Cam, Pham Ngoc Sang, Pham Duy Tat, and Colonel Le Khac Ly. To maintain secrecy, Phu ordered his officers to issue orders using <b>only</b> <b>word</b> of mouth instead of written documents, and not to reveal the withdrawal plan to local regional forces. Furthermore, he stated that the abandonment of II Corps Tactical Zone had to be quick, with the army taking only enough military equipment and ammunition to fight one last battle. Generals Tat and Cam were assigned the task of supervising the movements of soldiers and their dependents on the ground. Sang {{was responsible for the}} movement of vital military equipment and supplies via air transport and to sweep Route 7 using air force fighter-bombers. Ly was ordered to lead a group of combat engineers to repair the road and bridges on Route 7, as well as maintain contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters in Nha Trang. The plan was destined to fail, as Phu was unaware that General Ngo Quang Truong, commander of I Corps Tactical Zone, had also received similar orders to evacuate.|$|E
25|$|Duktė 'daughter' is the <b>only</b> <b>word</b> of {{the fifth}} declension, not having an ending uo. A word moteris 'woman, female' often has a genitive móters; the plural genitive of moteris is moterų (not palatalized -ių); {{it is the only}} normal form for the fifth declension and one of the two (the main is -ių) for the third. The more two words, obelis f – apple tree and dieveris m – (older) brother-in-law, are the same declensional case as moteris, but dieveris, being {{masculine}} possibly has a sg. inst. -iu. Dieveris is also the only -er- masculine case.|$|E

500|$|Martyn Williams {{remained}} {{in the dressing room}} for 90 minutes after the game, and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media. He later did give his reaction, expressing his opinion that the format {{was a bit of a}} lottery and observed [...] "somebody was going to miss – I've just got to live with the fact that it was me." [...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams' miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue. Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot-out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that [...] "gutted is the <b>only</b> <b>word</b> that properly describes how I am feeling".|$|E
500|$|The {{above-mentioned}} {{agreement between}} Pakistan and the United States {{was never an}} issue of money alone. [...] "It {{was a matter of}} honor for the army," [...] said Laiq ur-Rehman, a Pakistani defence correspondent for ARY News, a cable channel. [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>word</b> they were looking for was 'sorry.' It was a matter of pride, a matter of honor, a matter of ego." [...] "If it had been about the money, it would have been done months ago," [...] said an US enior administration official knowledgeable about the negotiations. [...] "Just like for us, it was not just about the supply routes." [...] According to the BBC the reason for the long US refusal to apologise for the Salala incident was deep anger among Americans about the death of US soldiers in Afghanistan from attacks by militant groups with alleged connections to Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency. Another reason for the United States refusal to apologise was the determination by American military investigators that Pakistan was equally culpable in the Salala incident because Pakistani soldiers, stationed on a ridge overlooking the border, had fired first on US troops on the Afghan side of the border. Pakistan has disputed that conclusion, saying its forces did not fire first.|$|E

2500|$|Bursts always access an aligned {{block of}} BL {{consecutive}} words beginning on {{a multiple of}} BL. So, for example, a four-word burst access to any column address from four to seven will return words four to seven. The ordering, however, depends on the requested address, and the configured burst type option: sequential or interleaved. Typically, a memory controller will require one or the other. When the burst length is one or two, the burst type does not matter. For a burst length of one, the requested word is the <b>only</b> <b>word</b> accessed. For a burst length of two, the requested word is accessed first, and the other word in the aligned block is accessed second. [...] This is the following word if an even address was specified, and the previous word if an odd address was specified.|$|E
