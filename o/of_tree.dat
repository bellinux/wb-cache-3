5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E

5|$|As is true {{for many}} species of deer, {{especially}} those in mountainous regions, elk migrate into areas of higher altitude in the spring, following the retreating snows, and the opposite direction in the fall.
