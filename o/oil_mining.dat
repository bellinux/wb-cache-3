Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming occurs {{as far north as}} The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba. The most common type of farm found in rural areas is cattle farming (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%).|$|E

25|$|In 1947 an {{even bigger}} field opened at Leduc, 20 miles (32km) south of Edmonton, and in 1948 <b>oil</b> <b>mining</b> began at Redwater. Both these fields were overshadowed in {{importance}} in 1956 {{with the discovery of}} the Pembina field west of Edmonton. Other fields were discovered east of Grande Prairie and in central Alberta. From collection and distribution points near Edmonton the oil is sent by pipeline to refineries, some as distant as Sarnia, Toronto and Montreal to the east, Vancouver to the west, and especially the U.S. to the South. Interprovincial Pipe Line (IPL) began in 1949, transporting oil to refineries in the east. IPL became Enbridge Pipelines in 1998 and now has 4500 employees; it moves 2 million barrels a day over 13,500 miles of pipe.|$|E

500|$|In 1886, {{natural gas}} was {{discovered}} in two counties adjacent to Blackford County. [...] The discoveries were in the small community of Eaton (south of Hartford City along railroad line) in Delaware County, and {{in the city of}} Portland in Jay County (east of Hartford City and Millgrove). [...] The Hartford City Gas & Oil Company was formed in early 1887, and successfully drilled a natural gas well later in the year. [...] In Montpelier, the Montpelier Gas & <b>Oil</b> <b>Mining</b> company was organized in the spring of 1887. [...] While natural gas was found throughout Blackford County, crude oil was found mostly in the county's Harrison Township (somewhat between Montpelier and Mollie). [...] Blackford County's first successful oil well, located just south of Montpelier, began producing during 1890. [...] Montpelier was thought to be [...] "the very heart of the greatest natural gas and oil field in the world". [...] Oil was also found in parts of Washington Township, including a well that was thought to be [...] "the most phenomenal well ever drilled in America". [...] By 1896, Blackford County had 18 natural gas companies. [...] These companies were headquartered in all four of the county's townships, including the communities of Hartford City, Montpelier, Roll, Dunkirk, Trenton (Priam Post Office), and Millgrove.|$|E
500|$|The local {{population}} in Miri has indeed started to extract oil from hand-dug wells for centuries. Song Huiyao Jigao, a {{documentation of the}} Song dynasty of China, mentions the imports of Borneo camphor and petroleum in the 11th century. In 1882, Mr de Crespigny reported to the Brooke government on 18 hand-dug oil wells in the Miri area. He also recommended that area near Miri River should be thoroughly explored. However, his recommendations were ignored. But when Charles Hose took over the Resident office in 1891, {{he was interested in}} Mr de Crespigny's idea and began to collaborate with him. Mr de Crespigny began to map oil seeps around the Miri area, however a consultant geologist from England discouraged the oil exploration in Miri due to poor logistical conditions. After his retirement from administrative positions in Sarawak, Charles Hose went back to England. He later went to London to discuss the idea of oil exploration in Miri with the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (later became a part of Royal Dutch Shell Company in 1907). Mr. H.N. Benjamin, a branch manager from the petroleum company, was interested in this idea. Finally in 1909, Rajah Charles Brooke came to London to sign the first Sarawak <b>Oil</b> <b>Mining</b> Lease. Royal Dutch Shell dispatched a senior geologist named Josef Theodor Erb together with Charles Hose back to Miri. Mr Erb started to map Miri oil fields from August 1909 to July 1910. He also identified a location known as [...] "Miri Hill" [...] (now known as [...] "Canada Hill", 150 m above sea level) is suitable to act as an anticline for oil drilling.|$|E

2500|$|Agrarian {{reform has}} been one of the FARC's main causes since the guerrilla's {{foundation}} in 1964. However, since then, the FARC's demands on agrarian reform have evolved significantly. In 1964, the nascent guerrilla called for the confiscation of Latifundium to deliver it for free to farmers. In 1982, at their seventh conference, the FARC issued a [...] abolishing land owned by foreign, <b>oil,</b> <b>mining,</b> banana or timber companies and latifundio properties over 1,500 hectares, to be turned over to the FARC for distribution to farmers. During the Caguán peace process, the FARC demanded the recovery of unproductive land for agrarian reform. The FARC arrived in Havana with moderated views on the subject - their proposals included stimulation of agricultural use of land for food production to achieve food sovereignty, empowering rural communities and formalization of property titles.|$|E

It also studies the Russian <b>oil</b> and <b>mining</b> sectors, its development, characteristics and current situation. The panel data methodology was implemented {{to identify the}} determinants of CAPEX in Russian <b>oil</b> and <b>mining</b> sectors and to test derived hypotheses. The core sample consists of annual financial data of 45 publicly listed Russian <b>oil</b> and <b>mining</b> sector companies. The timeframe of the thesis research is a six year period from 2007 to 2013. The findings of the master’s thesis have shown that Gross Sales, Return On Assets, Free Cash Flow and Long Term Debt are firm level performance variables along with Russian GDP, Export, Urals and the Reserve Fund are macroeconomic variables that determine the magnitude of new capital expenditures reported by publicly listed Russian <b>oil</b> and <b>mining</b> sector companies. These results are not controversial to the previous research paper, indeed they confirm them. Furthermore, {{the findings from the}} emerging countries, such as Malaysia, India and Portugal, are analogous to Russia. The empirical research is edifying and novel. Findings from this master’s thesis are highly valuable for the scientific community, especially, for researchers who investigate the determinant of CAPEX in developing countries. Moreover, the results can be utilized as a cogent argument, when companies and investors are doing strategic decisions, considering the Russian <b>oil</b> and <b>mining</b> sectors...|$|R
