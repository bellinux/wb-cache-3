5|$|Before their {{collaboration}} on the Diary, {{the brothers}} each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated {{nine of the}} principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote {{a large number of}} songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> it became fashionable to imitate.|$|E
5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The Sleeping Beauty and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of Spades. Otherwise, it was to composers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E

25|$|A third {{argument}} for incompatibilism was formulated by Carl Ginet in the 1960s and has received much {{attention in the}} modern literature. The simplified argument runs along these lines: if determinism is true, then we {{have no control over}} the events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> determined our present state and no control over the laws of nature. Since we can have no control over these matters, we also can have no control over the consequences of them. Since our present choices and acts, under determinism, are the necessary consequences of the past and the laws of nature, then we have no control over them and, hence, no free will. This is called the consequence argument. Peter van Inwagen remarks that C. D. Broad had a version of the consequence argument as early as the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|The Compromise of 1850 {{allowed the}} territories of Utah and New Mexico {{to decide for}} or against slavery, but it also allowed the {{admission}} of California as a free state, reduced {{the size of the}} slave state of Texas by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the District of Columbia. In return, the South got a stronger fugitive slave law than the version mentioned in the Constitution. Whereas Douglas said that the Compromise of 1850 replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of the state of Missouri, Lincoln said that this was false, and that Popular Sovereignty and the Dred Scott decision were a departure from the policies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> would nationalize slavery.|$|E

[...] Well-planned and coordinated, the general strike to this point had remained largely nonviolent. When the end-of-the-workday bell sounded, however, a group of workers surged to the gates to confront the strikebreakers. Despite calls for calm by Spies, the police fired on the crowd. Two McCormick workers were killed (although some newspaper accounts said there were six fatalities). Spies would later testify, [...] "I was very indignant.

500|$|In {{his desire}} to {{encourage}} a love of the countryside, especially during the Second World War, Beach Thomas was similar to other writers on rural matters, such as G. M. Trevelyan and H. J. Massingham. He described Massingham as [...] "perhaps {{the best of all}} present writers on Rural England" [...] and considered him among those writers who were [...] "so fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> they seem sometimes almost to despair of the future." [...] Malcolm Chase, a historian, says that these authors, including Beach Thomas himself, advocated an ultra-conservative, socially reactionary and idealistic philosophy that formed an important part of a national debate {{about the future of the}} land and agriculture. This attitude was coupled with an increasing public interest in pastimes such as cycling, motoring and walking; it was supported by the publication of popular, fairly cheap and colourful articles, books and maps that catered both to those pursuing such interests and those who were concerned about conservation and the effects of the influx of urban and suburban visitors. John Musty, in his comparative literary review of the works of Beach Thomas and Massingham, believes that Beach Thomas had a more [...] "gentle touch" [...] than Massingham, whose writings have [...] "frequently been judged as narrow and reactionary"; he quotes Beach Thomas as saying of the likes of Massingham that they [...] "preach an impossible creed, albeit an attractive one." ...|$|E

2500|$|A new {{memorial}} for the 72 Polish and Hungarian Jews who perished at the HASAG Colditz {{labor camp}} was unveiled at the Colditz cemetery on March 30, 2007. An earlier {{memorial to the}} [...] "Victims of Fascism" [...] was unveiled in 1948 and renovated in 1975, when a red triangle was added to commemorate the political prisoners who died. In 1995, two plaques were added to include honor the memory of forced laborers and prisoners of war, as well. In unveiling the new memorial, the mayor of Colditz, Manfred Heinz, said that each generation must always remind the next <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>that</b> such events are never repeated. He {{also said that the}} memorial was not to be seen as just a reminder of the forced laborers of the past, rather as a rejection of extremism, as well.|$|E
2500|$|Philip Birnbaum, in his {{edition of}} the Mahzor, {{comments}} on this passage: [...] "It refers to vows assumed by an individual for himself alone, where no other persons or interests are involved. Though the context makes it perfectly obvious that no vows or obligations towards others are implied, {{there have been many}} who were misled into believing that by means of this formula all their vows and oaths are annulled. In the eleventh century Rabbi Meir ben Samuel (Rashi's son-in-law) changed the original wording of Kol Nidré so as to make it apply to the future instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>that</b> is, to vows that one {{might not be able to}} fulfill during the next year." [...] This is the Nusach Ashkenaz version, the Nusach Sefard version still refers to the past year. However The Complete ArtScroll Machzor, Yom Kippur, Nusach Sefard has the future with the past included in brackets.|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{advertisements}} for Exalted placed the Age of Sorrows as the pre-history {{of the old}} World of Darkness. [...] However, once the game was released such connections became uncertain: names and themes from the World of Darkness line run throughout the material, but rarely {{in a way that}} suggested a direct connection between one and the other. Meanwhile, some oWoD supplements also supported this; the Hunter Apocrypha gave a vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> said that Hunters gained their power from the broken shards of the souls of great heroes of a lost age. which seems to suggest that hunters carry fragments of Solar Essences. Likewise, the Kindred of the East supplement gave a structure of the Wheel of Ages (mirrored in Exalted first edition books as the Ages of Man) that seemed to accommodate the integration of Exalted and the classic World of Darkness, the former the first and second age, and the latter being the fifth age.|$|E

2500|$|Aspects of the {{relationship}} between the physical body and socio-cultural conditions and practices can be recognized through the study of human remains. [...] This is most often emphasized in a [...] "biocultural bioarchaeology" [...] model. It has often been the case that bioarchaeology has been regarded as a positivist, science-based discipline, while theories of the living body in the social sciences have been viewed as constructivist in nature. Physical anthropology and bioarchaeology have been criticized for having little to no concern for culture or history. Blakey has argued that scientific or forensic treatments of human remains from archaeological sites construct a view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> is neither cultural nor historic, and has suggested that a biocultural version of bioarchaeology will be able to construct a more meaningful and nuanced history that is more relevant to modern populations, especially descent populations. [...] By biocultural, Blakey means a type of bioarchaeology that is not simply descriptive, but [...] combines the standard forensic techniques of describing stature, sex and age with investigations of demography and epidemiology in order to verify or critique socioeconomic conditions experienced by human communities of the past.|$|E
2500|$|Post-processual {{archaeology}} developed largely independently {{among the}} archaeological {{community in the}} United States. As such its primary influence was critical theory, {{as opposed to the}} French Marxist anthropology which had been the primary influence upon their British counterparts. Many American archaeologists had begun to recognise issues of bias within the scientific community, and within the processual movement itself which attempted to be scientific. They also began to notice elements of ethnic prejudice within archaeology, particularly in regards to Native American peoples, who had commonly not had a chance to participate in their own heritage management up until the 1990s. Many American archaeologists also began to take note of a gender bias in the archaeological interpretation and in the discipline as a whole, as women had been largely marginalised. The 1980s saw archaeological studies finally being published that dealt with this issue, namely through Joan Gero's paper on [...] "Gender bias in archaeology: a cross-cultural perspective" [...] (1983) and Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector's paper on [...] "Archaeology and the Study of Gender" [...] (1984). Among the post-processualists, less emphasis was put on correcting class biases in the American archaeological record than had been put into studying gender and ethnic differences. Instead, it was mostly among historical archaeologists (those who study the archaeology of the historic, or literate period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past),</b> <b>that</b> such investigation into marginalised classes such as workers and slaves took place.|$|E
