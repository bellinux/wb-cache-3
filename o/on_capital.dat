5|$|A {{rerouting}} of trunklines in 1941 lead to {{the creation}} of a Business US12 (BUS US12). M-96 ran concurrently with BUS US12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 was extended along the former US12 routing to end in Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and BUS US12/M-96 was extended by the end of the decade when the I-94/US12 freeway was completed in the area. BUS US12 was redesignated as Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running <b>on</b> <b>Capital</b> Avenue.

In a benchmark model, the social value of human capital is about 37 % higher than the private value.

The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return <b>on</b> <b>capital</b> invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
