5|$|Before 1816 the {{majority}} of the fur trading posts in the Minnesota area were owned by the North West Company, but by 1821 the American Fur Company, founded in 1808 by John Jacob Astor in New York, had taken <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> these.|$|E
5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its route, the East Plains Trail {{went through}} a post-glacial {{landscape}} of lakes, moraines, and drumlins, with beautiful scenery and difficult swamps. As the area became settled during Minnesota’s territorial and early statehood days, the routes were improved, stagecoach service was instituted, towns were established, and permanent settlement began.|$|E
25|$|Australia toured England {{twice and}} South Africa once during this decade. Australia played 28 Test matches during this decade, winning 14 and losing 6. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> them were against England and only 3 against South Africa. 5 of the Test matches had 8 ball <b>overs.</b> <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> the Test matches were {{timeless}} whereas there were 9 three day Test matches and 3 four day Test matches.|$|R

5|$|Those changes worsened the magazine's problems. When {{the title}} was {{shortened}} to just HG, many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside {{for the real thing}} to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came <b>over,</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the magazine's traditional advertisers pulled out.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} over 4,000 {{casualties in}} ten days, {{the failure of}} the last attack ended the 45th Division's role as the only combatant on the Chinese side. The UN forces had gained strong control <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the area, with the remaining Chinese defenders trapped in tunnels under the UN positions. Despite the initial setbacks, Deng Hua, acting commander of the PVA, considered the situation a golden opportunity to bleed the US military white. In the strategy meeting held on the evening of October 25, the 15th Corps was ordered to retake the two hills regardless of the cost.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, {{in which the}} nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{its range}} in woodland, the common {{blackbird}} has {{a preference for}} deciduous trees with dense undergrowth. However, gardens provide the best breeding habitat with up to 7.3 pairs per hectare (nearly three pairs per acre), with woodland typically holding about a tenth of that density, and open and very built-up habitats even less. They are often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.. The common blackbird also lives in parks, gardens and hedgerows.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Douglas DC-8s {{were also}} taken into use. Pan American World Airways had flights to New York City from 1967 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978. Braathens SAFE started taking {{delivery}} of Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s in 1969, and these gradually took <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the domestic routes. In 1970, Air France and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich, respectively. They were supplemented by Aeroflot's Moscow route in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Ficus rubiginosas range {{spans the}} entire eastern {{coastline}} of Australia, {{from the top}} of the Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland to the vicinity of Bega on the south coast of New South Wales. The range extends westwards to Porcupine Gorge National Park in Queensland and the far western plains in New South Wales. F.rubiginosa f. rubiginosa and F.rubiginosa f. glabrescens are found <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the range, though the latter does not occur south past the New South Wales-Queensland border region. Lithophytic, hemiepiphytic and tree forms can be found together in local populations of plants.|$|E
5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into {{the purview of the}} City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|Gustavus Adolphus {{chose to}} attack Riga, the Grand Duchy's {{foremost}} trade center, in late August 1621, {{just as the}} Ottoman army was approaching Khotyn, tying-up the Polish forces there. The city, stormed several times, had to surrender a month later. Moving inland to the south the Swedes next entered Courland. With Riga the Commonwealth lost the most important Baltic seaport {{in the region and}} an entry to northern Livonia, the Daugava River crossing. The 1622 Truce of Mitawa gave Poland the possession of Courland and eastern Livonia, but the Swedes were to take <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Livonia north of the Daugava. The Lithuanian forces were able to keep Dyneburg, but suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Wallhof.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, {{redevelopment}} began <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> {{the area}} above the platforms. The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development {{led to the}} replacement of almost {{the whole of the}} 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the Embankment Place complex is office space, with a selection of restaurants on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{nuthatch}}es, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on {{trunks and}} branches {{and is able}} to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do acorns and hickory nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> its range.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are found}} <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> Canada and the United States {{and a small}} part of {{northern}} Mexico. They were introduced to Europe {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe. They mostly inhabit wetlands, areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands, rivers, lakes, or ponds. They are not found in Florida, where the round-tailed muskrat, or Florida water rat (Neofiber alleni), fills their ecological niche.|$|E

5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears of the homeless focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E
5|$|Police {{work and}} {{criminal}} prosecutions {{relied heavily on}} confessions, witness testimony, and apprehending perpetrators {{in the act of}} committing an offence or in the possession of obvious physical evidence that clearly linked them to a crime. Forensic techniques, such as fingerprint analysis, were not in use. Policing in London was—and still is—divided between two forces: the Metropolitan Police with jurisdiction <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> the urban area, and the City of London Police with jurisdiction over about a square mile (2.9km2) of the city centre. The Home Secretary, a senior minister of the United Kingdom government, controlled the Metropolitan Police, whereas the City Police were responsible to the Corporation of London. Beat constables walked regular, timed routes.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes grows singly, scattered, or {{in groups}} {{on the ground in}} late summer and autumn. A common—and {{sometimes}} abundant—mushroom, it occurs <b>over</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> North America (including Hawaii), south to Mexico, and north to Canada. This species has been found in Puerto Rico growing under planted Pinus caribaea, where it is thought to have been introduced inadvertently from North Carolina by the USDA Forest Service in 1955. Other introductions have also occurred in exotic pine plantations in Argentina, India, New Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan.|$|E
