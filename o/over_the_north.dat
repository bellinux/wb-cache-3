5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1914 delayed the start of Amundsen's northern polar drift—to which the South Pole expedition had been intended as a preliminary—until July1918. He then set off in a specially-constructed vessel, Maud, which remained in Arctic waters {{for the next seven}} years. The ship did not drift <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pole, although {{in the course of the}} expedition it became the second ship to traverse the North-East Passage. Amundsen left the expedition in 1923; the remaining years of his life were largely devoted to polar exploration by air. On 12May 1926, aboard the airship Norge with Lincoln Ellsworth and Umberto Nobile, Amundsen flew <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pole. He and Wisting, also on the airship, were the first men to see both poles. In 1928, while attempting to rescue a later Nobile expedition, Amundsen disappeared with his aircraft in the seas between Norway and Spitsbergen.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day on}} August9, Arlene passed {{directly}} over Bermuda with winds of 85mph (140km/h). The storm continued to intensify after passing the island, with reconnaissance recorded a minimum pressure of 969mbar (hPa; 28.61inHg) and maximum winds reached 105mph (160km/h). The hurricane began to weaken hours later, with winds decreasing below 100mph (155km/h) by the afternoon of August10. Shortly after, Arlene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, while maintaining hurricane-force winds, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> Atlantic. The remnants were absorbed by a larger cyclone near Newfoundland on August11.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Karl was a late-season {{and unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that formed during the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season.

After being classified a subtropical cyclone on November 25, it became more independent of its parent storm and grew into a full-fledged hurricane. It peaked in intensity on November 26, and ultimately dissipated as it merged with another system.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the growing importance of German maritime transport routes through Norwegian waters, the Royal Air Force's Coastal Command transferred seven squadrons of anti-shipping aircraft from bases in eastern England to northern Scotland during September and October 1944. Three squadrons equipped with Mosquito light bombers were stationed at RAF Banff while a wing made up of four squadrons operating Beaufighter heavy fighters was based at RAF Dallachy. The Dallachy Wing comprised the British No.144 Squadron, Canadian No.404 Squadron, Australian No. 455 Squadron and New Zealand No. 489 Squadron. These four squadrons were veterans of many anti-shipping operations <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Sea.|$|E

5|$|S. A. Andrée's Arctic balloon {{expedition}} of 1897 was {{an effort}} to reach the North Pole in which all three expedition members perished.

5|$|Schnaufer {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} his commander, Walter Grabmann, commanding 3. Jagd-Division (3rd Fighter Division), that a intruder operation {{be allowed to take}} place.

Grabmann was enthusiastic, and suggested the operation go further and attack the enemy bombers while they were attempting to land in eastern England. Schnaufer also became aware of Schmid's desire for an intruder operation at this time and personally urged him to approach the High Command once more.|$|E
5|$|The first Wellington N2960 {{took off}} from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk at 09:27 with Wing Commander Richard Kellett at the controls. No. 9 Squadron {{took off from}} the nearby RAF Honington and formed up over King's Lynn and started out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Sea. Feltwell's No. 37 Squadron took off but missed the {{rendezvous}} and {{caught up with the}} main formation an hour later <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Sea. Once over the Wash they set a course of 040° true, as far as latitude 55°north. The plan was to avoid heavy anti-aircraft artillery concentrations on the Frisian Islands. However, as they left England the cloud broke and they found themselves without cover in a bright crystal clear sky. Two bombers, N2984 and N2894, piloted by Duguid and Kelly turned back; the first due to engine trouble, the other escorting the troubled bomber back to base. The remaining bombers flew north past the Frisian Islands then turned due south, continuing their mission in perfect visibility which made it easy to be spotted by German aircraft.|$|E
