This story was the series' first full-blown attempt at space opera and it set <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> the two main signature elements of Valérian: the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds. The follow-up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières' art into the style that became prevalent in the Valerian stories of the 1970s and 1980s, with the first realistic renderings of Valérian and Laureline, {{as opposed to the}} caricatures of the earlier stories.|$|E

They pushed this over 1,000W within weeks. The main Birmingham team gave up on the klystron and began work on this new cavity magnetron, and by the summer had examples producing 15kW.

25|$|In week 3, the Golden Hurricane {{made the}} drive to Norman for their 24th meeting with the Sooners, whom they had beaten only once since 1979. Tulsa {{appeared}} to be {{off to a good}} start, intercepting Landry Jones on the first play of the game and taking 25 of their first 27 snaps in Oklahoma territory, but two costly red-zone turnovers and a missed 50-yard field goal kept them scoreless in the first half while the Sooners built an insurmountable 31-0 lead.

25|$|To {{implement}} these strategies, Rolf led the union’s organizing staff into communities they hadn’t {{worked in}} before, and hired organizers that reflected those areas demographically. A neighborhood-based group meeting structure {{was developed for}} home care workers to share stories, identify common challenges, and activate around the need for collective action. Rolf noted that through these meetings, home care workers “found <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> that they weren’t alone.” The local also worked closely with other groups, such as the disability community, around shared interests in a form of coalition-based social unionism. He raised the new local's credibility by taking a lead role on Proposition 210, a 1996 California State initiative that raised the minimum wage to $5.75 per hour beginning March 1, 1998. The local collected more signatures than any other group.|$|E
25|$|The Tar Heels {{were shut}} <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> since a 7–0 loss to Georgia Tech in 2006, and their first shut out by NC State since 1960.

The UNC offense had its worst performance of the season, being held to a game low of 165 total yards. Giovani Bernard was, however, able to become the 15th Tar Heel to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and the third freshman to rush for 1,000 yards. The only point in the game in which it seemed UNC was going to put points on the scoreboard was on a 75 yard touchdown reception by Dwight Jones that was called back because of holding on the offensive line.|$|E

Coleman instead faced a relatively unknown (at that time) last minute replacement fighter, up and coming Lion's Den product Pete Williams. In what turned out to be another long and strenuous battle, Coleman appeared to be completely exhausted after 10 minutes; he was fatigued to the point of resting his hands on his knees during the fight. Williams took advantage of Coleman's fatigue and landed a heavy kick to the face, knocking 'The Hammer' <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in his career.|$|E
