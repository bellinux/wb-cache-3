40|$|Modern driver {{assistance}} systems increasingly support {{the driver to}} drive safer and more efficient. To fulfill these tasks information about the vehicle environment is essential. Besides extracting this information from sensors to perceive the environment, {{it is also possible}} to use stored static data. These models allow a reliable and fast access to the environmental data without the typical problems faced with the recognition by sensors. Nowadays street maps produced for navigation purposes reach a precision of several meters. To support the driver during manoeuvres however a precision one magnitude better is necessary. The positioning technology has steadily improved over the years, so it is possible today to determine a position with an accuracy of a few millimeters (i. e. using DGPS). With the introduction of Galileo, the quality and the level of service of future positioning solutions will be further improved. The high-precision positioning systems available today are for automotive applications too expensive. Due to the upcoming Galileo system, it can be expected that high-precision positioning will become ready for the mass market in the near future. As a result, high-precision street maps will also become more relevant in the future for advanced {{driver assistance}} systems. This paper describes a method that is able to generate largely automated street maps for highways which are usable as input for driver assistance systems supporting maneuvering tasks. The basis for the map generation is measured street data which is collected by the test vehicle ViewCar. This vehicle has a high-precision coupled navigation, which is based upon DGPS, an inertial measurement unit and an odometer. Furthermore the ViewCar has an <b>optical</b> <b>lane</b> detection system. By combining this information, the absolute position of the lane sign posting in world coordinates is calculated. Disturbances, errors and so on, resulting in a fluctuating data quality are reduced by taking several test sets from the same roadway lane. Along the sign posting, the median from the measurement values at constant distances is calculated to minimize these errors. The sign posting course calculated in this way shows a very high quality. Every test run results in a large amount of data hence the data handling is also a challenge. To overcome these challenges, all measurement data is stored in a spatially enabled database for efficient access in which the access is performed by location and not by time. The described procedure can be used to align all lanes on the road. To reduce this effort in one direction only one lane is measured and the other lanes are assumed to run parallel to the measured lane. Thus, only the lane widths of the other lanes must be determined. The lane widths of German freeways follow the guidelines from “Richtlinie für Anlage von Straßen – Querschnitt (RAS-Q) ” sufficient accurately. Hence the widths of the lanes which are not directly measured are verified in one test drive. Afterwards the highway course is divided into sections and described with mathematical functions for a compact and exact representation. Several test drives have been performed on the freeway A 2 to get data {{for the development of the}} method. The individual steps of the method have been implemented in software and tested on the collected data. The preliminary results show the general potential of the method...|$|E

40|$|My {{graduation}} {{thesis is}} concerned with the effect of polarization mode dispersion on transmitted signal by optical line. It describes external and internal causes of origination of polarization mode dispersion. On the basis of these effects there is a differential group delay (DGD). It is the time delay in meantime within individual modes. DGD results in a time extension of impulsion and limitation of maximum bit rate. This thesis contains localization methods of part of gossamer filament with increased value of PMD by POTDR method. This method is based on the principium of back dispersion and its modifications SOP a DOP. Very important chapter of this thesis is the measurement of the polarization mode dispersion. There are described methods of PMD measurement. It is the interferometric and polarimetric method and the method of state of polarization. The major part of this thesis is about the reduction of polarization mode dispersion effect. This part is divided into two parts. First part is about the methods of PMD effect reduction and the second one is about the PMD compensation. The discrepancy between these two parts is the reduction way of PMD effect on transmitted channel. The compensation use the compensation components inserted into the transmission path. By PMD reduction methods we can solve the problems from the view of changing of fibre or all cable.

In order to improve rate reduction and efficiency the full muon trigger chain will be com-pletely redesigned: the plan is to move from a redundant scheme, where the three sub-detectors (CSC, DT, RPC) have a separate track finder, to three geographical track finders (barrel, endcap and overlap) that combine trigger primitives of each sub-detector. In particular, the Muon Barrel Track Finder (MBTF) will host a new algorithm, that aggregating DT and RPC trigger data, will be able to improve the fake rejection and the muon momentum measurement.

40|$|NGC 2359 is an HII region {{located in}} the outer Galaxy that {{contains}} the isolated Wolf-Rayet (WR) star HD 56925. We present new CO observations of NGC 2359 with the Nobeyama 45 m radio telescope and the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment using the ^ 12 CO(J = 1 - 0, 3 - 2) emission lines and compare them with archived HI and radio-continuum data from the Very Large Array. Our purpose is to investigate whether {{the formation of the}} WR star in NGC 2359 was triggered by a cloud-cloud collision. We find two molecular clouds at ∼ 37 and ∼ 54 km s^- 1, and two HI clouds at ∼ 54 and ∼ 63 km s^- 1. All are likely to be associated with NGC 2359 as suggested by good morphological correspondence not only with an <b>optical</b> dark <b>lane</b> through the nebula but also with the radio-shell boundary. We also find that the molecular cloud at ∼ 54 km s^- 1 has a high kinematic temperature of at least ∼ 40 K, thus indicating that the gas temperature has been increased because of heating by the WR star. We propose that both NGC 2359 and the isolated WR star were created by a collision between the two molecular clouds. The supersonic velocity separation of the two clouds cannot be explained by stellar feedback from the WR star. The complementary spatial distributions and bridging features of CO and HI also are in good agreement with the expected observational signatures of high-mass star formations triggered by cloud-cloud collisions. We argue that NGC 2359 may be in the final phase of a cloud-cloud collision and that the collision timescale is ∼ 1. 5 Myr or longer. We also note that there is {{no significant difference between the}} physical properties of colliding clouds that trigger the formation of isolated O-type and WR stars.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the nuclear {{obscuration}} of galaxies hosting LINERs {{based on their}} X-ray and optical emission. They show column densities (N_H) at soft energies (0. 5 - 2 keV) mostly related to the diffuse emission around the AGN, showing a correlation with the optical extinction. N_H at hard energies (2 - 10 keV) {{seem to be much}} higher than what would be expected from the optical extinction. They might be associated to the inner regions of the AGN, buried at optical wavelengths. The main result of this paper is that around 50 % of our LINER sample shows signatures of Compton-thickness (CT) according to the most common tracers: the X-ray spectral index, F(2 - 10 keV) /F([OIII]) ratio and EW(FeKa). However, the EWs of CT LINERs are significantly lower than in CT Sy, suggesting that the 2 - 10 keV emission is dominated by electron scattering of the otherwise invisible AGN, or by emission from shocked gas associated to star formation rather than by reflection from the inner wall of the torus. However, no clear relation seems to exist between galaxies with <b>optical</b> dust <b>lanes</b> and X-ray classified CT objects. This may suggest that CT sources should be related to absorbing material located at the very inner regions of the AGN, maybe in the putative dusty torus. Larger M_BH and lower Eddington ratios than Sy galaxies have been found. This effect can be better attributed to LINER nuclei being hosted by earlier morphological types than Sy nuclei. However, it has to be noted that, once a proper correction to the X-ray luminosity is applied, LINERs show Eddington ratios overlapping those of Sy 2. We speculate with a possible scenario for LINER nuclei: an inner obscuring matter similar to that of Sy 2, and an external obscuring matter responsible for the optical extinction. CT sources appear to be more common among LINERs than Sy. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|The Tamura {{coupling}} model [Rev. Mod. Phys. 37, 679 (1965) ] {{has been}} extended to consider the coupling of additional low-lying rotational bands to the ground-state band. Rotational bands are built on vibrational bandheads (even-even targets) or single-particle bandheads (odd-A targets) including both axial and nonaxial deformations. These additional excitations are introduced as a perturbation to the underlying axially symmetric rigid-rotor structure of the ground-state rotational band. Coupling matrix elements of the generalized optical model are derived for extended multiband transitions in even-even and odd-A nuclei. Isospin symmetric formulation of the optical model is employed. A coupled-channels optical-model potential (OMP) containing a dispersive contribution is used to fit simultaneously all available optical experimental databases including neutron strength functions for nucleon scattering on 232 Th, 233, 235, 238 U, and 239 Pu nuclei. Quasielastic (p,n) scattering data on 232 Th and 238 U to the isobaric analog states of the target nucleus are also used to constrain the isovector part of the <b>optical</b> potential. <b>Lane</b> consistent OMP is derived for all actinides if corresponding multiband coupling schemes are defined. For even-even (odd-A) actinides almost all low-lying collective levels below 1 MeV (0. 5 MeV) of excitation energy are coupled. OMP parameters show a smooth energy dependence and energy-independent geometry. A phenomenological optical-model potential that couples multiple bands in odd-A actinides is published for a first time. Calculations using the derived OMP potential reproduce measured total cross-section differences between several actinide pairs within experimental uncertainty for incident neutron energies from 50 keV up to 150 MeV. The importance of extended coupling is studied. Multiband coupling is stronger in even-even targets owing to the collective nature of the coupling; the impact of extended coupling on predicted compound-nucleus formation cross section reaches 5 % below 3 MeV of incident neutron energy. Excitation of multiple bands in odd-A targets is weaker owing to the single-particle nature of the coupling.

We find that the isospin mixing depends on the symmetry energy and a stiffer behaviour leads to more transparency. The results are also nicely sensitive to the “fine structure ” of the symmetry energy, i. e. to the covariant properties of the isovector meson fields. The isospin tracing appears much less dependent on the in medium neutronproton cross sections (σnp) and this makes such observable very peculiar {{for the study of the}} isovector part of the nuclear equation of state.

In our fit to elastic and QE charge-exchange data, we allow the values of isoscalar and isovector radii, diffusivities and overall potential normalizations to float away from those in the popular Koning and Delaroche parametrization. We find that the best-fit isovector radii are consistently larger than isoscalar and the best-fit isovector surfaces are steeper. Upon identifying the displacement of the potential surfaces with the displacement of the surfaces for the densities in the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock calculations, and by supplementing the results with those from analysing excitation energies to isobaric analog states in the past, we arrive at the slope and value of the symmetry energy at normal density of 70 <L< 101 MeV and 33. 5 <a_a^V< 36. 4 MeV, respectively.
