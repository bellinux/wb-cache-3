40|$|There is <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> {{information}} on the interactive relationship of absorption and transformation between two inorganic arsenic (<b>As)</b> <b>species</b> and two inorganic selenium (Se) species in rice grown under hydroponic condition. Interactive effects <b>of</b> inorganic <b>As</b> (As(III)) and (As(V)) and Se (Se(IV) and Se(VI)) species on their uptake, accumulation, and translocation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) seedlings were investigated in hydroponic culture. The results clearly showed the interactive effects <b>of</b> inorganic <b>As</b> and Se on their uptake by rice. The presence of Se reduced the sum <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in the rice shoots regardless of Se speciation. If Se is present as Se(IV), then is it is accompanied by <b>a</b> corresponding increase <b>of</b> the sum <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> but if Se is present as Se(VI), {{then there is no}} change in the sum <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in rice roots. These effects are observed regardless <b>of</b> initial <b>As</b> speciation. When the rice plants are exposed to Se(IV), the presence <b>of</b> <b>As</b> increases the sum of Se species in the roots, and decreases the sum of Se species in the corresponding shoots. This effect is more pronounced for As(III) than for As(V). There is no effect on Se during exposure to Se(VI). Co-existence <b>of</b> <b>As</b> also increased SeMet in rice roots...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{concentration}} of arsenic in urine {{has been used}} as <b>a</b> marker <b>of</b> exposure to inorganic As (iAs). Relative proportions of urinary metabolites of iAs have been identified as potential biomarkers of susceptibility to iAs toxicity. However, the adverse effects of iAs exposure are ultimately determined by the concentrations of iAs metabolites in target tissues. OBJECTIVE: In this study we examined the feasibility <b>of</b> analyzing <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in cells that originate in the urinary bladder, a target organ for As-induced cancer in humans. METHODS: Exfoliated bladder epithelial cells (BECs) were collected from urine of 21 residents of Zimapan, Mexico, who were exposed to iAs in drinking water. We determined concentrations of iAs, methyl-As (MAs), and dimethyl-As (DMAs) in urine using conventional hydride generationcryotrapping-atomic absorption spectrometry (HG-CT-AAS). We used an optimized HG-CT-AAS technique with detection limits of 12 – 17 pg <b>As</b> for analysis <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in BECs. RESULTS: All urine samples and 20 of 21 BEC samples contained detectable concentrations of iAs, MAs, and DMAs. Sums of concentrations <b>of</b> these <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in BECs ranged from 0. 18 to 11. 4 ng As/mg protein and in urine from 4. 8 to 1, 947 ng As/mL. We found no correlations between the concentrations or ratios <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in BECs and in urine...|$|R
40|$|The {{fate and}} {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> total arsenic (<b>As)</b> and <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in soils is {{of concern for the}} quality of drinking water. To estimate the relevance <b>of</b> organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> and the mobility <b>of</b> different <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> we evaluated the vertical distribution of organic and inorganic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in two uncontaminated and two contaminated upland soils. Dimethylarsinic acid (up to 6 ng As g− 1), trimethylarsine oxide (up to 1. 5 ng As g− 1), 4 unidentified organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> (up to 3 ng As g− 1) and arsenobetaine (up to 15 ng As g− 1), were detected in the forest soils. Arsenobetaine was the dominant organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in both unpolluted and polluted forest soils. No organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> were detected in the contaminated grassland soil. The organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> may account for up to 30 % of the mobile fraction in the unpolluted forest floor, but never exceed 9 % in the unpolluted mineral soil. Highest concentrations <b>of</b> organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> were found in the forest floors. The concentrations of extractable arsenite were highest in the surface horizons of all soils and may represent up to 36 % <b>of</b> total extractable <b>As.</b> The concentrations <b>of</b> extractable arsenate were also highest in the Oa layers in the forest soils and decreased steeply in the mineral soil. In conclusion, the investigated forest soils contain <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> organic <b>As</b> <b>species.</b> The organic <b>As</b> <b>species</b> in forest soils seem to result from throughfall and litterfall and are retained mostly in the forest floor. The relative high concentrations of extractable arsenite, one of the most toxic <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> and arsenate in the forest floor point to the risk of their transfer to surface water by superficial flow under heavy rain events...|$|R

5|$|Variation {{comes from}} {{mutations}} in the genome, reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (gene flow).

However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5% of their genomes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{importance}} of adsorption kinetics and redox transformation <b>of</b> arsenic (<b>As)</b> during the adsorption process, the present study elucidated natural organic matter (NOM) effects on As adsorption-desorption kinetics and speciation transformation. The experimental procedures were conducted by examining interactions of arsenate and arsenite with different concentrations of humic acid (HA) as <b>a</b> model representative <b>of</b> NOM, in the presence of iron oxide based adsorbent (IBA), as a model solid surface in three environmentally relevant conditions, including the simultaneous adsorption <b>of</b> both <b>As</b> and HA onto IBA, HA adsorption onto As-presorbed IBA, and As adsorption onto HA-presorbed IBA. Experimental adsorption-desorption data were all fitted by original and modified Lagergren pseudo-first and-second order adsorption kinetic models, respectively. Weber’s intraparticle diffusion was also used to gain insight into the mechanisms and rate controlling steps, which the results suggested that intraparticle diffusion <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species</b> onto IBA is the main rate-controlling step. Different concentrations of HA mediated the redox transformation <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> with <b>a</b> higher oxidation ability than reduction. The overall results indicated the significant effect of organic matter on the adsorption kinetics and redox transformation <b>of</b> <b>As</b> <b>species,</b> and consequently, the fate, transport and mobility <b>of</b> <b>As</b> in different environmentally relevant conditions...|$|R

5|$|B. bufo is part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> complex, a {{group of}} closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are {{believed}} to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese common toad (B. japonicus). The European common toad (Bufobufo) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that {{the range of the}} ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred {{as a result of the}} development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of Bufoverrucosissimus and Bufospinosus. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.|$|E
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>species.</b> It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E

5|$|Before 1846, Gray {{had been}} firmly {{opposed to the}} idea of {{transmutation}} of species, in which simpler forms naturally become more complex over time, including via hybridization. By the early 1850s, Gray had clearly defined his concept that the species is the basic unit of taxonomy. This was partly the result of the 1831–1836 voyage during which Darwin discovered the differentiation of species among the various Galápagos Islands. Local geography could produce variances, like in the Galápagos and Hawaii, which Gray did not get to study in depth as he had wanted. Gray was insistent that a genetic connection must exist between all members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>species,</b> that like begat like. This concept was critical to Darwin's theories. Gray was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>species</b> were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E
