40|$|For {{more than}} a decade the {{interest}} ingroup-V antisite def ects in GaAs was focusing on the intrinsic AssubGa defect. More recently, when GaAs samples doped with isovalent group-V impurities became available, also group-V heteroantisites <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site</b> were discovered. These include PsubGa, SbsubGa and BisubGa. Such defects are double donors which in their singly ionized state can be observed by conventional electron-spin-resonance (ESR) or, with even better sensitivity, by ESR detected via the magnetic- circular-dichroism (MCD) of the absorption (MCD-ESR). Their chemical identification is based on the characteristic hyperfine structure observed in each case. The resonance spectra and the origin of the MCD absorption bands are discussed.

40|$|Insulating FeGa$_ 3 $ poses {{peculiar}} puzzles {{beyond the}} occurrence of an electronic gap in an intermetallic compound. This Fe-based material has a very distinctive structural characteristic with the Fe atoms occurring in dimers. The insulating gap can be described comparably well in either the weakly correlated limit or the strongly correlated limit within density functional theory viewpoints, where the latter corresponds to singlet formation on the Fe$_ 2 $ dimers. Though most of the calculated occupied Wannier functions are an admixture of Fe $ 3 d$ and Ga $ 4 s$ or $ 4 p$ states, {{there is a single}} bonding-type Wannier function per spin centered on each Fe$_ 2 $ dimer. Density functional theory methods have been applied to follow the evolution of the magnetic properties and electronic spectrum with doping, where unusual behavior is observed experimentally. Both electron and hole doping are considered, by Ge and Zn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site,</b> and by Co and Mn on the Fe site, the latter introducing direct disturbance of the Fe$_ 2 $ dimer. Results from weakly and strongly correlated pictures are compared. Regardless of the method, magnetism including itinerant phases appears readily with doping. The correlated picture suggests that in the low doping limit Mn (for Fe) produces an in-gap hole state, while Co (for Fe) introduces a localized electronic gap state.

40|$|From electron-irradiation studies, it {{is known}} that point defects can {{strongly}} affect the electrical properties of GaAs-based MESFET 2 ̆ 7 s, MODFET 2 ̆ 7 s, solar cells, resonant-tunneling diodes, MIMIC circuits and other devices. As an example, 1 × 1016 cm− 2, 1 MeV electrons reduce the transconductance in a 1 μm by 200 μm MESFET by nearly an order of magnitude. Fortunately, annealing at 350 °C for 10 min. can largely restore the device performance, although not without some adverse effects. Point defects, or simple point defect complexes, can also exist in as-grown GaAs and affect devices in several different ways. For example, an As-rich stoichiometry can lead to an abundance of Ga vacancies, and thus to a higher Si donor activation in implanted MESFET devices; however, it can also promote an increase in unwanted impurities which sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ga</b> <b>site.</b> As another example, extremely high (3 ̆e 3 × 1019 cm− 3) concentrations of As antisites, which are found in MBE GaAs grown at 200 °C, lead to very unusual electrical and optical properties, and make possible a highly useful buffer material and a very fast photoconductive switch. However, there are also adverse effects here, such as slow-transients in some MODFET devices, which may result from defect diffusion. Thus, the effects of point defects in GaAs devices must be understood...|$|E

The samples were prepared with 10 % substitution of Al and with Cu concentrations of x = 0. 0, 0. 2, and 0. 3. Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature performed from 10 to 400 K, with an applied field of 0. 02 T showed a ferromagnetic state, with critical temperature T-c = 295 and 300 K for the samples with Cu, x = 0. 2 and 0. 3, respectively. For the sample without Cu, a complex behavior is observed at T-c = 370 K, with martensitic transition at 220 K and a premartensitic at 250 K. Analysis of x-rays diffractograms at room temperature show a L 2 (1) structure for x = 0. 0, while for x = 0. 2 a mixture of L 2 (1) and martensitic is present, and the sample with x = 0. 3 it is in a fully martensitic phase. Heat capacity measurements were performed in order to calculate magnetocaloric effect in the samples. The results indicate that in Ni(Mn,Cu) Ga alloys, a partial substitution of Ga by Al still produce a high refrigerant capacity while reducing the costs of fabrication.

Large resonant signals of magnetic dipole character are observed below the Neel temperatures at both edges. The signals at the Np edges confirm the behaviour determined previously from neutron diffraction, i. e. the moments along [001] in NpCoGa_{ 5 } and in NpRhGa_ 5 a reorientation of the moments from the c-axis direction to the ab plane.

The realization of such devices would benefit greatly from room temperature ferromagnetic dilute magnetic semiconductors. Theoretical predictions {{have suggested that}} room temperature ferromagnetism may be possible in the wide bandgap semiconductors GaMnN and ZnMnO, though the existing models require input from the growth of high-quality materials. This work focuses on an experimental effort to develop high-quality materials {{in both of these}} wide bandgap materials systems. ZnMnO and ZnCoO single crystals have been grown by a modified melt growth technique. X-ray diffraction was used to examine the structural quality and demonstrate the single crystal character of these devices. Substitutional transition metal incorporation has been verified by optical transmission and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements. No indications of ferromagnetic hysteresis are observed from the bulk single crystal samples, and temperature dependent magnetization studies demonstrate a dominant antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. Efforts to introduce ferromagnetic ordering were only successful through processing techniques which significantly degraded the material quality. GaMnN thin films were grown by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition. Good crystalline quality and a consistent growth mode with Mn incorporation were verified by several independent characterization techniques. Substitutional incorporation of Mn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ga</b> lattice <b>site</b> was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance. Mn acted as a deep acceptor in GaN. Nevertheless, ferromagnetic hysteresis was observed in the GaMnN films. The apparent strength of the magnetization correlated with the relative ratio of trivalent to divalent Mn. Valence state control through codoping with additional donors such as silicon was observed. Additional studies on GaFeN also showed a magnetic hysteresis. A comparison with implanted samples showed that the common origin to the apparent strong ferromagnetic hysteresis related to contribution from Mn substitutional ions. The observed magnetic hysteresis is due to the formation of Mn-rich regions during the growth process. This work demonstrated that the original intrinsic models for room temperature ferromagnetism in the wide bandgap semiconductors do not hold and the room temperature ferromagnetism in these materials results from extrinsic contributions.
