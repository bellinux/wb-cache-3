5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to <b>offend</b> <b>the</b> Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of AIDS in the nation's blood supply and subsequent lack of response by blood bank leadership occurred {{as early as}} 1982, yet {{it was not until}} 1985, when AIDS antibody testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), that blood bank industry leaders acknowledged that HIV could be transmitted through blood transfusions. Shilts' coverage revealed the feeling among blood bank industry leaders that screening donors for hepatitis alone might <b>offend</b> <b>the</b> donors, and that the cost of screening all the blood donations provided across the country every year was too high to be feasible.|$|E

The relevant community, however, is not defined.|$|R
5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or executive body, can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not <b>offend</b> <b>the</b> separation of powers.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{abruptly}} {{stopped working}} as an insurance actuary and became {{a researcher at the}} Wall Street firm Bache & Company. He was frequently promoted despite his tendency to <b>offend</b> <b>the</b> older members of the firm by ignoring their advice and flaunting his success. Although he was skilled at his job, co-workers sensed that Milk's heart was not in his work. He started a romantic relationship with Jack Galen McKinley, and recruited him to work on conservative Republican Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign. Their relationship was troubled. When McKinley first began his relationship with Milk in late 1964, he was 16 years old. He was prone to depression and sometimes threatened to commit suicide if Milk did not show him enough attention. To make a point to McKinley, Milk took him to the hospital where Milk's ex-lover, Joe Campbell, was himself recuperating from a suicide attempt, after his lover Billy Sipple left him. Milk had remained friendly with Campbell, who had entered the avant-garde art scene in Greenwich Village, but Milk did not understand why Campbell's despondency was sufficient cause to consider suicide as an option.|$|E
5|$|The victors {{also found}} a golden crown among the booty. It was reputed {{to be from the}} time of the fifteenth-century Majapahit empire, during which there were reports of the use of a golden crown. The crown was handed to Captain Tack of the VOC, who insisted on {{requiring}} 1,000 Rds. before giving it to the king. This behaviour seemed to <b>offend</b> <b>the</b> king and might have contributed to Tack's death at the Mataram court in 1686. On 27 November, Hurdt presented the crown to the king, who proceeded to wear it. In an act of cultural misunderstanding, the VOC fired musket and cannon salutes, thinking the event was a coronation in the European sense. In reality, crowns did not have ceremonial importance in Javanese royal protocol. This episode attracted much attention among later historians. Dutch historian H. J. de Graaf opined that the king would later consider this event as a symbol of the European's condescension and that they were instrumental to the king's legitimacy.|$|E

However, Adolph Schauffler (of the City Mission Society) and Josiah Strong arranged to sponsor Riis's lecture at the Broadway Tabernacle church. Lacking money, Riis partnered with W.L.

Later legislation strengthened its application: in England and Wales this was largely via the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003, in Northern Ireland through an Order in Council and in Scotland with the Antisocial and Sexual Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004. Scotland, however, had a pre-existing tribunal system charged with dealing with children and young persons who <b>offend,</b> <b>the</b> Children's Hearings System.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawing the advert {{was also}} controversial, as critics accused Heinz of homophobia. The gay rights group Stonewall {{called for a}} boycott of the company's products.

25|$|The film is {{also thought}} notable for {{being one of}} the first adult films to be {{produced}} or directed by Bernard Natan. Scholars have expressed surprise that a beginning filmmaker would produce a work which contained sex acts which might anger or <b>offend</b> <b>the</b> target audience (straight men). That Bernard would do so is a testament, film historians have said, to his willingness to take risks and his subtle understanding of the role homoeroticism and homosexuality play in French male sexual identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} The Guide to Science was to present answers to over 2000 {{questions}} about common phenomena. There are questions {{dealing with the}} man-made objects such as candles, stoves and chimneys as well as answers seeking to explain natural phenomena such as thunder and lightning (including a mention of ball lightning), clouds, dew and rainbows.

The Peace of Barcelona, signed between Charles V and the Pope in 1529, established a more cordial {{relationship between the two}} leaders.

When {{the governor}} tried to retreat, his retreat route was temporarily cut off by Ma Wu, but Ma Wu allowed him to escape, not wanting to <b>offend</b> <b>the</b> government more than the rebels have done already. Instead, the Lülin rebels roved near the area, capturing many women, and then returning to the Lülin Mountain. By this point, they had 50,000 men.|$|E
25|$|In September, Proposition 8 proponents filed {{a motion}} for summary judgment.

The motion {{asserted}} that Baker v. Nelson foreclosed any further review by the court. Failing that, the motion argued that all of the couples' claims failed as a matter of law. After a two-hour hearing on October 13, Walker denied the motion. He noted that the Supreme Court doctrine on sexual orientation and gender discrimination had changed since 1972. Resolving the amendment's validity, Walker noted, required hearing testimony at trial.|$|E
