30|$|Call networks: The Dataset 1 {{contains}} the number (and duration) <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between any pair of antennae for every hour during a five month period. We construct {{three types of}} networks: (1) G^n_a=(A, N_a) is a directed weighted network where N_a = {n(a_i,a_j)} denotes the total number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between a_i and a_j; (2) G^d_a=(A,D_a) is also a directed weighted network where D_a={d(a_i,a_j)} denotes the total duration <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between a_i and a_j. We further map antennae into different levels of administrative areas based on their geo-location and aggregate the mobile communication flow (in terms of numbers or duration <b>of</b> <b>calls)</b> between pairs <b>of</b> administrative areas. For instance, G^n_d=(D,N_d) is a directed weighted network of department-to-department communication, where N_d={n(d_i,d_j)=∑_(a_u,a_v):a_u∈ d_i∧ a_v∈ d_j n(a_u,a_v)} denotes the total number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> between department d_i and d_j, aggregated from their antenna records. Here mobile communications within the same department are ignored. Similarly, we generate call networks G^n_r (region-to-region number <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> G^n_p (pole-to-pole call volume), G^d_d (department-to-department duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> G^d_r (region-to-region duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> and G^d_p (pole-to-pole duration <b>of</b> <b>calls),</b> respectively.|$|R

The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{gameplay}} <b>of</b> <b>Call</b> of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth comprises unarmed {{escape and}} evasion together with investigative exploration, although first-person shooter (FPS) style combat is introduced later on.

40|$|A novel call {{admission}} control (CAC) scheme for an adaptive heterogeneous multimedia mobile network with multiple classes <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> is investigated here. Different classes <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> {{may have different}} bandwidth requirement, different request call holding time and different cell residence time. At any time, each cell of the network has the capability to provide service to at least a given number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> for each class <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> Upon the arrival (or completion or handoff) <b>of</b> a <b>call,</b> a bandwidth degrade (or upgrade) algorithm is applied. An arriving call to a cell, finding insufficient bandwidth available in this cell, may either be disconnected from the network or push another <b>call</b> out <b>of</b> the cell toward a neighboring cell with enough bandwidth. We first prove that the stationary distribution of the number <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> in the network has a product form and then show how to apply this result in deriving explicit expressions of handoff rates for each class <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> in obtaining the disconnecting probabilities for each class of new and handoff calls, and in finding the grade of service of this mobile network...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the call admission problem in cellular networks that support several classes <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> In {{the first part of}} this paper, we first introduce a multi-threshold guard channel policy and study its limiting behavior under the stationary traffic. Then we give an algorithm for finding the optimal number of guard channels that minimizes the blocking probability <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> with lowest level of QoS subject to constraints on blocking probabilities <b>of</b> other <b>calls.</b> In the second part of the paper, we give an algorithm for finding the minimum number of channels subject to constraints on blocking probabilities <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> Finally, we propose a prioritized channel assignment algorithm for multicells cellular networks to minimize the blocking probability <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> with lowest level of QoS subject to constraints on the blocking probabilities <b>of</b> other <b>calls...</b>|$|R
5|$|Jurisdiction over {{charitable}} disputes {{is shared}} equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission. The Commission, the first port <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, {{as well as}} providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done. Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity, or even, under the Cy-près doctrine, change the purpose of the charity or gift altogether.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese of the Song dynasty were adept sailors who {{traveled}} to ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{as far away}} as Fatimid Egypt.

Even before Shen Kuo and Zhu Yu had described the mariner's magnetic needle compass, the earlier military treatise of the Wujing Zongyao in 1044 had also described a thermoremanence compass. This was a simple iron or steel needle that was heated, cooled, and placed in a bowl of water, producing the effect of weak magnetization, although its use was described only for navigation on land and not at sea.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approximate}} analytical method to compute e#ciently the call blocking probabilities in wavelength routing networks with multiple classes <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> The model is fairly general and allows each source-destination pair to serve <b>calls</b> <b>of</b> di#erent classes, with each call occupying one wavelength per link. Our approach involves two steps. The arrival process <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> on some routes is first modified slightly {{to obtain an}} approximate multi-class network model.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> is {{integral}} to {{who we are as}} human beings. From a Christian perspective, a sense <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> connects us to God and provides a center around which our lives can begin to make sense and have meaning. In this guide to understanding and responding to a calling, author Dr. Joe Collins provides both a clear picture <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> and various tools to help laypeople and clergy to pursue it in ways that are both biblical and practical. What Does God Want Me to Do? recognizes calling as a process that involves a growing perception of both God and self. It proposes a model that is both biblically sound and grounded in the actual experiences of people; it also demonstrates an appreciation of evolving understandings <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> {{in the history of the}} Church. Drawing wisdom from writers both modern and ancient who have struggled with calling and its meaning, it seeks to answer the hard questions about the nature <b>of</b> <b>calling</b> directly and honestly. Providing more than just a theoretical exploration <b>of</b> how <b>calling</b> works, this guide offers practical suggestions on how to prepare for a call and how to respond to it. [URL]...|$|R
