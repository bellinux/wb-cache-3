From an application perspective it is often not clear for what kind of applications this combination yields significant advantages. We argue for supporting distributed design environments by deductive <b>object</b> <b>bases</b> as <b>repositories</b> and summarize experiences made with our system ConceptBase. 1 Introduction From a technical side, it seems an obvious idea to merge the two leading competitors for next-generation database technology, deductive and object-oriented databases. From the application side, the matter is much less clear. Who needs a deductive <b>object</b> <b>base</b> ? In this position paper, we summarize some answers resulting from our work with ConceptBase, a DOB prototype based on the Telos language [MBJK 90, JEUS 92], but don't focus on implementation details which are described elsewhere [JEG* 93, JARK 92, SNJ 93]. ConceptBase has been under development si [...] ...|$|R

The proposed solution uses a mapping ontology {{that is a}} part of a recent Semantic Web initiative called the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). On top of that, we propose the search algorithm that takes arguments from one ontology and generates queries compliant with other ontologies. We evaluated the solution on a web application that allows using a local ontology, which describes content of a web site, to search for web resources in remote digital libraries or <b>object</b> <b>repositories</b> <b>based</b> on more general content ontologies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The eduSource Communication Layer (ECL) {{defines a}} set of services, middleware, and {{communication}} conventions that enable repositories and tools {{to communicate with each}} other. ECL was designed and implemented within the scope of the recommendations in the IMS DRI specification. The ECL has been deployed world-wide and connects repositories in Canada, USA, Australia, UK and Europe. In this chapter we describe the design of ECL, its architecture and middleware components. In the second part we describe novel ECL security infrastructure (ECL-SI) for web services that provides the security framework for <b>object</b> <b>repositories</b> <b>based</b> on a trust federation. The security solution defines security profiles, infrastructure services, and middleware component for a low-barrier adoption by existing repositories. Although this infrastructure can scale to large networks it is particularly sensitive to the needs of medium and small organizations, which have complex attributes and accessing policies. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{on the development of}} learning objects has targeted either learners, as consumers of these objects, or instructors, as designers who reuse these objects in building new online courses. There is currently an urgent need for the sharing and reuse of both theoretical knowledge (literature reviews) and practical knowledge (best practice) in learning design. The primary aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a strategy for constructing a more powerful set of learning objects targeted at supporting instructors in designing their curricula. A key challenge in this work is the definition of a new class of learning design objects that combine two types of knowledge: (1) reusable knowledge, consisting of theoretical and practical information on education design, and (2) knowledge of reuse, which is necessary to describe the reusable knowledge using an extended learning object metadata language. In addition, we introduce a general model of learning design <b>object</b> <b>repositories</b> <b>based</b> on the Unified Modeling Language, and a learning design support framework is proposed <b>based</b> on the <b>repository</b> model. Finally, a first prototype is developed to provide a subjective evaluation of the new framework...|$|R
40|$|Not {{having a}} formal {{semantics}} for representing metadata instances in a machine understandable way, LOM {{makes it difficult}} to implement software modules capable of searching and retrieving data from learning <b>object</b> <b>repositories</b> <b>based</b> only in conforming metadata descriptions. Design by Contract, a well-known object oriented software design technique aimed at helping developers and designers to reuse objects, is revisited in order to find similarities with the paradigm of learning objects. Design by Contract is introduced here as a convenient means of formalizing the information in metadata instances resulting in machine understandable metadata information. In this paper we describe preconditions as an essential part of applying Design by Contract techniques to learning objects. A definition of what a precondition is intended to be in the learning objects arena is described, as well as a syntax for writing formal preconditions. Finally, we map the existing LOM metadata categories that can be useful in expressing preconditions to our machine-readable syntax...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Knowledge is {{considered}} as the lifeline of {{global economy and}} its proper management leads to successful knowledge economies. Knowledge based society calls for effective knowledge management and a great need is felt in Kashmir, where it is in its teething stage. Times immemorial, knowledge in different forms has emancipated from Kashmir valley but due to number of reasons it couldn’t find its judicious use. So, a {{need to develop a}} knowledge <b>based</b> <b>repository</b> to enable collaboration among different societal organizations across the barriers of time and space is felt. The paper discusses the strategies to be adopted for managing a knowledge <b>based</b> <b>repository</b> that can provide the ability to connect end-users to a single gateway of customized, personalized, consolidated, integrated, and enhanced knowledge. Methodology: Documentary analysis is used to engineer a well managed knowledge <b>based</b> <b>repository.</b> Findings: The study found that a well managed interplay of men, money and material are the influential factors for nurturing a successful knowledge based platform. Research Implications: The study does not include all the knowledge management tools/services that can help in building a future vision knowledge repository for Kashmir but includes the ones that can lay down a fundamental platform for the same. Originality/Value: The study provides the suggestive measures to be implemented to achieve well knitted and effective management processes {{for the development of a}} knowledge <b>based</b> <b>repository</b> for a conflict zone-Kashmir. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a general hierarchical model for <b>object</b> <b>based</b> systems, called gMobS. To call a model general one first has {{to define what}} the model is used for. The only basic property of <b>object</b> <b>based</b> systems is, that they consist of objects that communicate by messages only. Obviously, apart from systems usually called <b>object</b> <b>based,</b> circuits and neural nets meet this condition, too. This implies that the model must not only be a timed model but {{must be able to}} model continuous sending of messages. At first glance this seems awkward but in fact it does not really complicate the theory and unifies two different theories. Moreover, in the future some <b>objects</b> of <b>object</b> <b>based</b> systems might be implemented in hardware and continuous sending of messages could become important. Obviously systems without time can be modeled with timed models. We concentrate mainly on the important results of this theory [...] many proofs are omitted or sketched only. A more detailed study can be found in [9]. This article consists of two parts. The first part describes a very general formalism for objects, called I/O-descriptions, and investigates some properties. The second part, which will appear in the next mathPAD, describes a formalism for general <b>object</b> <b>based</b> systems. A canonical way to view an <b>object</b> <b>based</b> system as an object is introduced. Then it is investigated under which conditions an object, defined by an <b>object</b> <b>based</b> system, behaves well, e. g. respects a kind of causality. Finally an <b>object</b> <b>based</b> system representing a stack (LIFO) is presented. A Model for <b>Object</b> <b>Based</b> Systems Definition...|$|R

40|$|Naming plays a {{key role}} in the design of any system that exports {{services}} or resources. Object systems may export many different categories of names: instances, components of records, types, etc. Operating systems export the names of files, devices, and services. Integrating an <b>object</b> <b>base</b> with existing operating system facilities can improve accessibility of the <b>object</b> <b>base</b> resources. We consider the benefits and pitfalls of integrating an <b>object</b> <b>base</b> namespace with the Unix namespace. 1 1 Introduction Naming plays an important role in modern systems design. Uniform naming of files and devices, long recognized as an important innovation, was first made widely available by the Unix 2 [RT 78] operating system. Newer systems such as Plan 9 [PPT + 93] extend uniform naming to most system resources, including network connections, processes, etc. <b>Object</b> <b>bases</b> export names for a wide variety of smaller grain entities, such as instances, components of types, types, etc. <b>Object</b> <b>bases</b> share [...] ...|$|R

40|$|We examine {{open access}} to the Spanish {{scientific}} literature through investigation of a sample of peer reviewed articles in seven subject categories. Of the 28, 259 papers published in 2000, 26. 89 % were freely accessible with the share varying among disciplines. Articles in the Social and Behavioral Sciences were the most available for free. This disciplinary divide applies also to the strategies used to offer open access to documents. In Clinical Medicine, Life Sciences, Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences open access was mainly based on the publishers side while subject <b>based</b> <b>repositories</b> were dominant in Physical, Chemical and Earth Sciences and deposit in home pages was the preferred strategy in Engineering, Computing and Technology. Institutional and general repositories seem to play a minor role in providing free {{access to the}} Spanish peer reviewed literature. Papers published in commercial journals are less accessible than those that appear in non-commercial journals and we found overlaps in almost 20 % of papers deposited. The fastest way to gain open access is to deposit in subject <b>based</b> <b>repositories</b> and the longest delays are related to deposits in home pages and specially to institutional repositories.
