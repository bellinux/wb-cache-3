5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E

5|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> {{change are}} another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, an {{expedition}} by Ivar Tollefsen {{made the first}} ascents of several mountains, including the tallest, Jøkulkyrkja. Norway established the summer station Troll in 1989–90. In 2003, Minister of the Environment Børge Brende was the first Norwegian minister to visit Queen Maud Land, and he soon allocated funds to expand the Troll station. Troll was upgraded to a year-round station in 2005 {{as part of the}} centenary of Norway's independence. Among the guests were Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen and Minister of the Environment Knut Arild Hareide, and Troll was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway, the first queen to ever visit Antarctica. In 2008, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, accompanied by forty officials, scientists and reporters, became the first Norwegian prime minister to visit Queen Maud Land. He personally named three mountains around the Troll station where he was based, although he chose to sleep outdoors in a tent, rather than in a bed inside. He said the purposes of the visit were to claim Norway's possessions in Antarctica, as well as {{to learn more about the}} climate research at Troll, which he said was key to better understanding <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} {{enjoys a}} large range and a big {{population}}. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black-throated blue warbler in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change on the population dynamics of the black-throated blue warbler by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied {{in relation to the}} survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Niño years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the three factors were relatively higher during La Niña years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long-term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the black-throated blue warbler population.|$|E

25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter {{could be}} in a period <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change. This is {{hypothesized}} to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region heating up. The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new vortices.|$|E
25|$|Both {{geologic}} and climatic events {{helped to}} make Australia's fauna unique. Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Gondwana began to break up 140million years ago (MYA); 50 MYA Australia separated from Antarctica and was relatively isolated until the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Asia in the Miocene era 5.3 MYA. The establishment and evolution of the present-day fauna was apparently shaped by the unique climate and the geology of the continent. As Australia drifted, it was, to some extent, isolated from the effects <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change. The unique fauna that originated in Gondwana, such as the marsupials, survived and adapted in Australia.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{progress}} has focused {{not only on}} the speed of the ocean heat uptake but also the spatial pattern of the ocean heat uptake. The spatial pattern influences the global radiative damping and thus the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> feedback parameter. These influences arise from the evolving spatial pattern of the surface temperature anomaly and/or changes in the local feedback parameter. The inconstancy <b>of</b> the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> feedback may be formulated by a single parameter, called ocean heat uptake efficacy. In addition, the dependency <b>of</b> the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> feedback parameter on the background climate has also been pointed out. The physical mechanisms behind the behavior <b>of</b> the <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> feedback parameter still need to be established. Detailed analysis of the atmosphere-ocean interaction as well as perturbed physics ensemble experiments including the ocean component might be useful for identifying the physical mechanisms (Collins et al. 2006). Ocean heat uptake processes associated with the AMOC and those operating in the Southern Ocean are of great importance in understanding both speed and spatial pattern of ocean heat uptake and require further study.|$|R

500|$|Two {{changes to}} the global {{atmosphere}} due to anthropogenic activity threaten marine mammals. The first is increases in ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion, and this mainly affects the Antarctic and {{other areas of the}} southern hemisphere. An increase in ultraviolet radiation has the capacity to decrease phytoplankton abundance, which forms the basis of the food chain in the ocean. The second effect <b>of</b> <b>global</b> <b>climate</b> change is global warming due to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. [...] Raised sea levels, sea temperature and changed currents are expected to affect marine mammals by altering the distribution of important prey species, and changing the suitability of breeding sites and migratory routes. The Arctic food chain would be disrupted by the near extinction or migration of polar bears. Arctic sea ice is the polar bear's habitat. It has been declining at a rate of 13% per decade because the temperature is rising at twice the rate {{of the rest of the}} world.
