50|$|OPC was {{designed}} to provide a common bridge for Windows-based software applications and process control hardware. Standards define consistent methods of accessing field data from plant floor devices. This method remains the same regardless of the type and source of data. An <b>OPC</b> <b>Server</b> for one hardware device provides the same methods for an OPC Client to access its data as any and every other <b>OPC</b> <b>Server</b> for that same and any other hardware device. The aim was {{to reduce the amount of}} duplicated effort required from hardware manufacturers and their software partners, and from the SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and other HMI (Human-Machine Interface) producers in order to interface the two. Once a hardware manufacturer had developed their <b>OPC</b> <b>Server</b> for the new hardware device their work was done to allow any 'top end' to access their device, and once the SCADA producer had developed their OPC Client their work was done to allow access to any hardware, existing or yet to be created, with an OPC compliant server.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that some OPC specifications are published, others are available only to members of the OPC Foundation. So whilst no company [...] "owns" [...] OPC and anyone can develop an <b>OPC</b> <b>server,</b> whether or not they are a member of the OPC Foundation, non-members will not necessarily be using the latest specifications. Anyone can integrate OPC products, and there is no pre-requisite for the system integrator to belong to any organization. It is therefore up to each company that requires OPC products to ensure that their products are certified and that their system integrators have the necessary training.|$|E
50|$|B-Scada uses {{data models}} {{as the basis}} of end users toolkits, which allow {{representations}} of assets with immediate interactions. It provides “templating,” where a data model is created for a type of object instead of for a specific object. Conventional HMI and SCADA products bind data from programmable logic controllers (PLCs) or other data sources directly to the graphics. Data modeling in HMI/SCADA allows the virtualized model of assets to be bound to the HMI/SCADA screens. The PLC or <b>OPC</b> <b>Server</b> memory addresses plus any additional associated information can then be referenced at run time, allowing one generic data model template to be used for many different specific assets.|$|E
50|$|Utgard is a vendor-independent Java OPC client API that {{supports}} the OPC interface {{and can be used}} independently from other Eclipse SCADA projects. Utgard is used in Eclipse SCADA together with Atlantis to connect to and communicate with systems of other vendors over the OPC DA 2.0 interface. The project is open source, written in pure Java and is distributed under the LGPL. To run Utgard, the prerequisites are a Java 1.6+ environment. In other words, with Utgard, it is possible to communicate over the OPC interface in an OS-independent manner without needing additional DLLs/shared libraries, or JNI libraries. Currently, an <b>OPC</b> <b>server</b> is required to communicate with Utgard.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Origin and uses== The OPC Specification {{was based}} on the OLE, COM, and DCOM {{technologies}} developed by Microsoft for the Microsoft Windows operating system family. The specification defined a standard set of objects, interfaces and methods for use in process control and manufacturing automation applications to facilitate interoperability. The most common OPC specification is OPC Data Access, which is used to read and write real-time data. When vendors refer to OPC generically, they typically mean OPC Data Access (OPC DA). OPC DA itself has gone through three major revisions since its inception. Versions are backwards compatible, in that a version 3 <b>OPC</b> <b>Server</b> can still be accessed by a version 1 OPC Client, since the specifications add functionality, but still require the older version to be implemented as well. However, a Client could be written that does not support the older functions since everything can be done using the newer ones, so a DA-3-compatible Client will not necessarily work with a DA 1.0 Server.|$|E

50|$|<b>OPC</b> <b>servers</b> {{provide a}} method for many {{different}} software packages (so {{long as it is}} an OPC Client) to access data from a process control device, such as a PLC or DCS.

40|$|During {{embedded}} software development of complex control system, the calibration {{is an important}} approach to obtain optimal parameters of {{embedded software}}. Currently, typical calibration systems are with poor adaptability for various controllers which have different communication interfaces and calibration protocols. In order to solve the problem, an improved architecture for embedded controller calibration system is proposed to support more communication buses and protocols. In this architecture, by introducing OPC (OLE for Process Control) technology, the host software of calibration system is separated into <b>OPC</b> <b>server</b> and client. The <b>OPC</b> <b>server</b> masks the difference of various calibration protocols and detail of communication devices, and provides a unified access interface for controller parameters. The OPC client calibrates and acquires the parameters though calling the interface provided by the <b>OPC</b> <b>server.</b> By the method, when communication device or calibration protocol is varied, only the corresponding <b>OPC</b> <b>server</b> is required to be replaced. Then the details of communication devices and calibration protocols are no longer considered while developing a calibration system, and the generality and openness of the calibration system are enhanced greatly. The calibration system corresponding to the architecture was applied to an engine controller to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} method presented. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} for generic design and efficient development of <b>OPC</b> UA <b>servers.</b> Development starts with creation of a design file, in XML format, describing an object-oriented information model of the target system or device. Using this model, the framework generates an executable <b>OPC</b> UA <b>server</b> application, which exposes the per-design OPC UA address space, without the developer writing a single line of code. Furthermore, the framework generates skeleton code into which the developer adds the necessary logic for integration to the target system or device. This approach allows both developers unfamiliar with the OPC UA standard, and advanced OPC UA developers, to create servers for the systems they are experts in while greatly reducing design and development effort as compared to developments based purely on COTS OPC UA toolkits. Higher level software may further benefit from the explicit <b>OPC</b> UA <b>server</b> model by using the XML design description {{as the basis for}} generating client connectivity configuration and server data representation. Moreover, having the XML design description at hand facilitates automatic generation of validation tools. In this contribution, the concept and implementation of this framework is detailed along with examples of actual production-level usage in the detector control system of the ATLAS experiment at CERN and beyond...|$|R
