40|$|Scale is an {{essential}} <b>notion</b> <b>in</b> <b>geography</b> and geographic information science (GIScience). However, the complex concepts of scale and traditional Euclidean geometric thinking have created tremendous confusion and uncertainty. Traditional Euclidean geometry uses absolute size, regular shape and direction to describe our surrounding geographic features. In this context, different measuring scales will affect the results of geospatial analysis. For example, {{if we want to}} measure the length of a coastline, its length will be different using different measuring scales. Fractal geometry indicates that most geographic features are not measurable because of their fractal nature. In order to deal with such scale issues, the topological and scaling analyses are introduced. They focus on the relationships between geographic features instead of geometric measurements such as length, area and slope. The scale change will affect the geometric measurements such as length and area but will not affect the topological measurements such as connectivity.   This study uses three case studies to demonstrate the scale issues of geographic features though fractal analyses. The first case illustrates that the length of the British coastline is fractal and scale-dependent. The length of the British coastline increases with the decreased measuring scale. The yardstick fractal dimension of the British coastline was also calculated. The second case demonstrates that the areal geographic features such as British island are also scale-dependent in terms of area. The box-counting fractal dimension, as an important parameter in fractal analysis, was also calculated. The third case focuses on the scale effects on elevation and the slope of the terrain surface. The relationship between slope value and resolution in this case is not as simple as in the other two cases. The flat and fluctuated areas generate different results. These three cases all show the fractal nature of the geographic features and indicate the fallacies of scale existing <b>in</b> <b>geography.</b> Accordingly, the fourth case tries to exemplify how topological and scaling analyses can be used to deal with such unsolvable scale issues. The fourth case analyzes the London OpenStreetMap (OSM) streets in a topological approach to reveal the scaling or fractal property of street networks. The fourth case further investigates the ability of the topological metric to predict Twitter user’s presence. The correlation between number of tweets and connectivity of London named natural streets is relatively high and the coefficient of determination r 2 is 0. 5083.   Regarding scale issues <b>in</b> <b>geography,</b> the specific technology or method to handle the scale issues arising from the fractal essence of the geographic features does not matter. Instead, the mindset of shifting from traditional Euclidean thinking to novel fractal thinking in the field of GIScience is more important. The first three cases revealed the scale issues of geographic features under the Euclidean thinking. The fourth case proved that topological analysis can deal with such scale issues under fractal way of thinking. With development of data acquisition technologies, the data itself becomes more complex than ever before. Fractal thinking effectively describes the characteristics of geographic big data across all scales. It also overcomes the drawbacks of traditional Euclidean thinking and provides deeper insights for GIScience research in the big data era. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article aims to {{integrate}} the existing theoretical framework for thinking the power relations between individuals and sociotechnical systems in social media. In the first section, the authors show how Panopticism found breeding ground in social media studies. Yet they claim that despite an expanding critical literature, not much seems to be changing in prosumers’ practices online. Their hypothesis {{is that this is}} happening not only because individuals are forced or cheated by the sociotechnical systems, as it has been usually argued, but also because they voluntarily submit to them. For this reason, in the second section, the authors introduce the notion of voluntary servitude, coined by Étienne de la Boétie in the XVIth century. Voluntary servitude is a paradoxical notion because it represents the attempt of tidying up two opposite facts: human beings’ will of freedom and their reiterated submission. In the third section, they make the <b>notion</b> <b>operative</b> <b>in</b> the context of social media by focusing on privacy as the counter-discourse of surveillance. In conclusion, the authors deal with the emancipatory character of voluntary servitude, {{as well as with the}} concept of subjectivity it entails...|$|R
40|$|Preference is an <b>operative</b> <b>notion</b> of {{sequential}} {{organization and}} interpersonal understanding in conversation analysis. The {{complexity of the}} phenomenon that we are attempting to grasp through this notion has manifested itself in the seemingly controversial widening of {{the interpretation of the}} <b>notion.</b> <b>In</b> this paper I argue that preference can be interpreted through an inference rule {{as a consequence of the}} simultaneous but not equal manifestation of pragmatic principles; a deeper and uncontroversial interpretation of the notion is possible if, in addition to a structural inference rule and interpersonality principles, we take into consideration the role of rationality principles as well. In every communicative situation an interpersonal concern and a topical concern is operative; in consensus-oriented contexts preference structure is regulated by interpersonality principles that govern interpersonal relations and self-projection, while in conflict-oriented discourse the most important role is played by rationality principles. Approaching preference from the perspective of pragmatic principles may prove instrumental in integrating conversion analysis more closely with new directions and results of pragmatic research...|$|R
