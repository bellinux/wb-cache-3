5000|$|The {{cultural}} {{system may be}} regarded as a (second order) [...] "observer" [...] of the instrumental couple that occurs between the normative personality and the <b>operative</b> <b>system.</b> The function of this couple is to manifest figurative attributes of the personality, like goals or ideology, operatively consequently influencing behaviour. This instrumental nature occurs through feedforward processes such that personality attributes can be processed for operative action. Where there are issues in doing this, feedback processes create imperatives for adjustment. This is like having a goal, and finding that it cannot be implemented, thereby having to reconsider the goal. This instrumental couple can also be seen in terms of the <b>operative</b> <b>system</b> and its first order [...] "observing" [...] system, the normative personality. So, while personality is a first order [...] "observer" [...] of CAT's <b>operative</b> <b>system,</b> it is ultimately directed by its second order cultural [...] "observer" [...] system.|$|E

50|$|Now, {{paradigms}} {{are concerned}} with not only theory but also modes of behaviour within inquiry. One significant part of Beer's paradigm {{is the development of}} his Viable Systems Model (VSM) that addresses problem situations in terms of control and communication processes, seeking to ensure system viability within the object of attention. Another is Beer's Syntegrity protocol which centres on the means by which effective communications in complex situations can occur. VSM has been used successfully to diagnose organisational pathologies (conditions of social ill-health). The model involves not only an <b>operative</b> <b>system</b> that has both structure (e.g., divisions in an organisation or departments in a division) from which behaviour emanates that is directed towards an environment, but also a meta-system, which some have called the observer of the system. The system and meta-system are ontologically different, so that for instance where in a production company the system is concerned with production processes and their immediate management, the meta-system is more concerned with the management of the production system as a whole. The connection between the system and meta-system is explained through Beer's Cybernetic map. Beer considered that viable social systems should be seen as living systems. Maturana used the term or autopoiesis (self-production) to explain biological living systems, but was reluctant to accept that social systems were living.|$|E

5000|$|MS-DOS 7 is a {{computer}} <b>Operative</b> <b>system</b> which never has been separately released by its inventors Microsoft, but which is the basic (real mode) of Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 98SE (as version 7.1, but the difference between version 7 and 7.1 are tiny). A major difference towards earlier versions of MS-DOS however, is the usage of the MSDOS.SYS file. In version 7 isn't this file a binary one, but a pure setting file. Anyone who wants the older boot style (where the booting process ends with a DOS-prompt, and which requires [...] "WIN" [...] to be typed at the prompt in order for Windows to start) could keep on using that same style, by just setting BootGUI=0 in the MSDOS.SYS-file. Otherwise does Windows naturally start up [...] "by it self", which {{was a very important}} issue at the time when Microsoft released Windows 95. But this was in reality only an automatical call for the file WIN.COM, the Windows starting file. So, also Windows 95 and 98 are both highly depending of a Real mode system, although MS-DOS 7 possibly is more [...] "hidden" [...] than earlier versions of MS-DOS. This is also true for Windows Millenium Edition, but [...] "ME" [...] refuses users to use Real mode. [...] Also the paths for (a plausible but actually not necessary) Windows directory and Boot directory is to be set in this new version of the MSDOS.SYS-file. Whilst IO.SYS (although binary different) remained as the initial executive startup file which BIOS booting routines fires up, if located correctly. Also the COMMAND.COM file keeps handle the command prompt. The typical DOS setting files CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT essentially retained its functions from earlier versions of MS-DOS (although memory allocation was no longer needed).|$|E

Within the secondary system, which typically runs on a separate machine, we utilize suitable statistical models of the original data streams to simulate them. As the simulation can run at much faster rates, we are able to examine and assess new query plans in a shorter period of time without running the risk of deteriorating the original plan; we only migrate practically approved plans into the <b>operative</b> <b>system.</b> In our demonstration, we will present our prototypical implementation of this optimiza-tion architecture.
