40|$|The {{refractive}} {{indices of}} crystalline phase-change films are usually obtained by thermal-induced crystallization. However, {{this is not}} accurate, because the crystallization of phase-change film in rewritable <b>optical</b> <b>disks</b> is laser induced. In this study, we use the initializer to crystallize the phase-change films. The dependence of the refractive index n and the extinction coefficient k of the phase-change films on the initialization conditions are studied. Remarkable changes of the refractive indices (especially k) are found when the initialization laser power density is 6. 63 mW/mum(2) and the initialization velocity is 4. 0 m/s. At the same time, the structure changes of the phase-change films are also studied. This dependence is explained by the structure change of the films.
