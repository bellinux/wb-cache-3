5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City <b>of</b> <b>Portland</b> and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series <b>of</b> <b>Portland</b> CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
