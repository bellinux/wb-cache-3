25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than <b>our</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would give us hope.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 2009, there was {{considerable}} analysis and speculation in the media {{of what kind of}} role and level of influence Clinton had within the Obama administration, with a variety of assessments being produced.

It is fair to say that Henry Kissinger was the father of the ? inter-agency system? that is still with us today.

But General Scowcroft is the father of the modern-day <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Advisor. The manner and method by which Brent Scowcroft performed the role became the model or ?base case? for all those who came after him. David Rothkopf, with his authoritative studies of the role of the <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> Advisor and the various individuals who have filled that position, concludes that the ?Scowcroft Model? is the one that best serves the President and <b>our</b> nation?s <b>national</b> <b>security</b> decision-making process...|$|R

2500|$|Because {{the almost}} {{simultaneous}} disclosures of PD 59 and the stealth technology {{came in the}} midst of the 1980 presidential campaign, some critics asserted that the Carter administration leaked them to counter charges of weakness and boost its re-election chances. Others charged that PD 59 made it more likely that the United States would initiate a nuclear conflict, based on the assumption that a nuclear war could somehow be limited. Brown insisted that the countervailing strategy was not a first strike strategy. As he put it, [...] "Nothing in the policy contemplates that nuclear war can be a deliberate instrument of achieving <b>our</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> goals [...] [...] [...] [...] But we cannot afford the risk that the Soviet leadership might entertain the illusion that nuclear war could be an option--or its threat a means of coercion--for them." ...|$|E

It was {{no coincidence that the}} places where women's lives were most undervalued largely lined up with the parts of the world most plagued by instability, conflict, extremism, and poverty. This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but over the years I came to view it {{as one of the most}} compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. [...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity.
