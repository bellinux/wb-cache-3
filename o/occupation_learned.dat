40|$|Key Words: Active Learning Classroom Design Occupational Transaction Intent The {{intent of}} this {{theoretical}} {{paper is to}} elucidate the connection between design and occupation applied to active learning in the college classroom. The paper will apply models of occupational science including the Transactional Model, and the Model of Person Object Interaction to understand why design is theorized to impact engagement in learning from an occupational science perspective. The discussion will differentiate views from educational, aesthetic, and psychological orientations, thus uncovering the unique contribution of occupational science. Additionally, the application of these theories will help us to illustrate various components which influence the manifestation of both active and passive engagement in the <b>occupation</b> of <b>learning.</b> Argument Active learning is currently considered a pre-eminent educational strategy. The positive effect of design on active learning is touted by designers and institutions of higher learning. Psychological literature focuses on the connection between environment and behavior in terms of perceived quality and impulse control, {{as well as the}} feeling conveyed non-verbally in a space. Educational literature has explored the concept of built pedagogy (Monahan, 2002) focusing on the flexibility of spaces and the relationship with pedagogical practices. Occupational science can contribute to the design of spaces and development of pedagogical practices via deep exploration of the variety of influences on this occupation. Further, application of active learning to occupational science theories will further enhance understanding of those theories. Importance Application of theoretical frameworks within occupational science through which we can analyze the design, affordances, and aesthetic/perceived value of the learning environment beyond the established psychology and educational research, has the potential to further the transactional <b>occupation</b> of active <b>learning,</b> thus demonstrating the unique utility of occupational science. Further, application of occupational science models to the complex interaction of factors embedded within the concept of active learning will further our understanding and refinement of occupational science models. Conclusion Occupational science has a unique perspective that is highly useful in understanding not only human behavior, but also the essence of human occupation in relation to the myriad of influences that exist. Occupational science allows us to look holistically at our most defining human occupations, and determine how active participation in occupation is facilitated and hindered. Application of occupational science to the relationship between active learning and design will both further the <b>occupation</b> of active <b>learning,</b> and the understanding of occupational science. Questions How does classroom design impact the person-object interaction within the <b>occupation</b> of active <b>learning?</b> How does the manner in which process skills interact with the built environment of furniture and design impact active learning? Is there a hierarchy of occupational transactions that corresponds to levels of learning such as those categorized by Bloom? Can a rigorous framework for a hierarchy of occupational transactions be developed for specific situations such as active learning in the classroom or for occupational transaction as a whole? How can we describe the relationships between the Occupational Transaction Model and the Person-Object Interaction Model as it relates to active learnin...|$|R

30|$|The novel {{approach}} of our {{paper is to}} use information on <b>occupations</b> to <b>learn</b> more about spousal compatibility. Given that {{there is ample evidence}} from the previous literature that both similarities and dissimilarities draw spouses together and make marriages work, we suspect the richness of information about one’s occupation can shed light on the role of dissimilarities. The risk sharing explanations for match quality and the idea that dissimilar spouses could more effectively divide tasks in the household imply that spouses with proximal occupations reap fewer gains from marriage. Alternatively spouses with occupations that are dissimilar could have a disadvantage in match quality if the gains from marriage come from preference compatibility, complementarity in household public good production, or spillover of human capital within the household. The last idea, suggested by Benham (1974), argues that one spouse’s earnings are enhanced by the knowledge of the other spouse, assuming that the other spouse has relevant knowledge. This would be applicable when both spouses’ occupations are complements in market goods production (e.g., physician and nurse). A marriage involving two such occupations could be expected to make both spouses better at doing their individual jobs, thus generating larger gains from marriage.|$|R
30|$|A common {{argument}} against a career-oriented {{approach is that}} the mix of jobs changes so frequently that occupational skills easily become outmoded while academic skills are said to apply broadly and make future workers more adaptable. But, in fact, skills in broad-based occupational fields are often quite portable. For example, while only 42 % of German apprentices stay in their initial occupation, nearly two-thirds remain with either the <b>occupation</b> they <b>learned</b> as an apprentice or another occupation in the cluster using a similar mix of skills. Clark and Fahr (2001) present workers’ own views on how skills learned in apprenticeship training apply to their current jobs. Not surprisingly, 85 % of workers remaining within their training occupation use many or very many of the skills they learned through apprenticeship. This group constitutes 55 % of the sample. But, even among the remaining 45 %, about two of five workers reported using many or very many of the skills from their apprenticeship and another 20 % used some of the skills. Overall, only 18 % of all former apprentices stated they used few or no skills learned in their apprenticeships.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October 1944, the {{regiment}} landed on the beaches near Dulag {{on the east coast}} of the island of Leyte. With the beachhead secured, they moved inland. The island provided the Japanese with an ideal defensive terrain, as Leyte is a large island, covered with mountains, rain forests, and swamps. The Japanese were long accustomed to fighting in the jungle, and had over three years of <b>occupation</b> to <b>learn</b> the terrain and plan defenses. Additionally, it was easy for the Japanese to reinforce their garrison on Leyte from Luzon in the north and Mindanao in the south. The Japanese 34th Army, consisting of four divisions, including the infamous 16th Division that was credited for the [...] "Rape of Nanking" [...] and the [...] "Bataan Death March," [...] was the primary opponent on Leyte. The 184th Infantry Regiment pushed through the Dulag Valley and experienced high casualties. When the Japanese counterattacked the 32d Infantry Regiment, which had spread out along the Palanas River, the 184th was sent to reinforce them. Several attacks were repulsed and the enemy was driven into the bamboo thickets. This action later became known as The Battle of Shoestring Ridge.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} an equilibrium {{labor market}} model, where workers gradually {{learn about their}} unobserved production abilities. While engaged in a productive activity (occupation), workers observe their output and extract information {{that allows them to}} make inferences about their unobserved aptitudes. Because workers are learning about themselves, their output informs them not only about their productivity in their current occupation, but about their likely produ ctivity in other occupations as well. As workers acquire more information, they self-select into the occupations in which they expect to perform best, and their wages increase. Returns to experience here capture improved job selection by workers as they sort through <b>occupations</b> and <b>learn</b> about their productive abilities. Our setup can account for the o¤setting worker ows across occupations, the within-occupation wage inequality, as well the decline in the probability of occupational switching as workers grow older, that we observe in the data.

40|$|In this {{presentation}} I {{examine the}} processes of professionalisation and mutual development within and between two occupational groups in the UK - sport and exercise scientists and sports coaches. At the outset I acknowledge the ‘cultural turn’ in science and use my own positionality, based on 30 years of experience within both communities, to inform the analysis. The main questions addressed here are whether these two interdependent groups have found a satisfactory professional relationship and how they have adjusted to the destabilising forces of late modernity. The issue of child protection in sport {{is used as a}} case study through which to examine these questions. The readiness of the two groups to acknowledge and embrace associated ethical and professional practices differs considerably. It is argued that sports coaching has addressed protection issues much more readily and effectively than has sport science. It is also suggested that the preoccupation of sport science with scholarly activity undermines the realisation of its aspiration for professional and chartered status. The emphasis of both occupational groups on ‘performance enhancement’, both scholarly and/or athletic, has led them to suffer from diminished social and political perspectives which benefit neither. The paper concludes with some reflections on the potential for both <b>occupations</b> to <b>learn</b> from attending to wider external reference points...|$|R

Even though a majority of VET graduates who change company at the end of training remain in their <b>learned</b> <b>occupation</b> (Müller and Schweri 2015), we do not know if firm mobility results in a similar transmission of gender segregation from education to early employment as it does in the case of firm takeover.|$|R

40|$|Problem Statement: Although {{there has}} been an {{increased}} emphasis on the use of occupation in the practice of occupational therapy (OT), it is unknown to what extent clinical practice has evolved to reflect the focus on occupation. If the distinct value of occupation is key to the profession’s continued relevance in enabling health, data is necessary to identify how occupational therapists are prepared and use occupation in practice. Purpose: The aim {{of this study is to}} understand how graduates of an OT program practice, how they articulate their practice, and if they use occupation in their practice. Background: Wilcock (2001) identifies occupational science as a key to broadening horizons in OT. She suggests that “adopting occupational science will assist occupational therapists to think in occupational rather than medical terms” (p. 412). An occupational perspective provides a way of thinking regardless of practice area. Pierce (2001) conceptualized critical bridges to link knowledge of occupation to practice including: generative discourse regarding occupation-based practice, and effective education. In 2006 the terms occupation-based interventions and occupation-based outcomes were first incorporated into the ACOTE standards further fixing the professions focus on occupation. Hooper et al. (2014) advocate keeping occupation at the center of learning. Despite the expectation that occupation is used in practice, there is little empirical knowledge of how this does or does not occur and how. Methods: This research uses a comparative case study approach (Merriam, 1998) to explore the translation of knowledge of occupation from an OT education program to entry-level practice. Qualitative data collection includes: in-depth interviews of OT graduates about their understanding and experience of use of occupation in practice and photo elicitation of participant’s physical practice environment. Results: Preliminary findings of this research provide an understanding of occupation and its use in practice from the perspectives of occupational therapist who have graduated from a specific OT program. In addition, participant’s reflections on the programs curriculum elucidates the extent to which the curriculum integrates various topics with the field’s core subject, occupation. It explores graduates conceptualizations of occupation, and the extent to which occupation is explicitly integrated into the curriculum. Understanding the integration of occupation into the curriculum is necessary to understanding practice, as the degree to which the core subject is integrated impacts formation of professional identity, clinical reasoning, self-efficacy as a practitioner, and advocacy on behalf of their profession to policy makers, payers, and consumers (Hooper et al., 2014 p. 189). Implications: Findings will contribute to the profession’s generative discourse concerning occupation, the diversity of how occupation is understood and realized in practice, and the impact education on occupation has on practice. Furthermore, findings will reveal strategies OT practitioners and educators can use to support an occupational perspective in practice. Mitcham (2014) proposed that education is the engine that drives the profession. This study will offer insights into education that have the potential to advance the distinct value of the profession’s core of <b>occupation.</b> <b>Learning</b> Objectives: Participate in the ongoing discussion on how occupation is realized in occupational therapy practice. Articulate barriers/supports to the translation of knowledge of occupation–based practice as experienced by recent graduates.

40|$|The {{application}} of occupational science to practice, specifically {{the principle of}} occupational justice, has inspired occupational therapist to pursue new practice arenas - to actively pursue the development of programs designed to promote health through occupation for all individuals. From an occupational science perspective, the unique role of occupational therapy in addressing the occupation-based and social-emotional needs of low-income urban youth attending after-school care will be explored. Low-income urban youth may be at-risk of occupational deprivation because of limited social and material resources. With fewer opportunities to engage in structured leisure occupations, these children {{spend more time in}} passive, unstructured activities and subsequently may be lured into participating in risky street activities in order to meet personal need for challenging occupation. In the spirit of occupational justice, the Occupational Therapy Groups for HOPE (Healthy Occupations for Positive Emotions) were developed to promote occupational enrichment for low-income urban youth. The nine-week HOPE groups provide a combination of meaningful structured leisure <b>occupations</b> and social-emotional <b>learning</b> activities within a supportive group context. In an attempt to determine the essence of occupation and its influence on health and well-being, this phenomenological study focused on the meaning of the HOPE groups for the participating youth. In-depth interviews and participant observation were used to explore how the participants’ perceived and experienced engagement in structured leisure <b>occupations</b> and social-emotional <b>learning</b> activities provided within a therapeutic group context. Ten {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 12 were interviewed between one and three times yielding a total of 23 interviews. The focus of analysis was on understanding the children 2 ̆ 7 s subjective experience of the HOPE groups and identifying the core essence of the experience from an occupational perspective.

40|$|Background Immigration, {{settlement}} and integration are complex phenomena involving {{a range of}} transitions in relation to physical, economic, political, social and cultural aspects of occupation (Huot, Laliberte Rudman, Dodson, 2 ̆ 6 Magalhães, 2013; Nayar 2 ̆ 6 Sterling, 2013). These transitions are shaped by the socio-historic and political contexts within which immigrants’ journeys are embedded (Huot 2 ̆ 6 Laliberte Rudman, 2010). Purpose To critically explore how social integration is mediated through occupation, a comparative international study of the experiences {{of a group of}} multi-national migrants in Auckland, New Zealand and London, Ontario, Canada was undertaken. This research considers migrants’ changes in everyday occupations and the influences of structural and systemic barriers and enablers upon their negotiation of transitions and integration. Methods A critical ethnography with two stages of data collection was utilised. First, policy documents from Canada and New Zealand were reviewed to understand the socio-political context governing immigration within each country. Second, authors engaged in qualitative interviews with immigrants in London and Auckland. Participants Nineteen participants (9 males and 10 females) were purposefully selected; 10 in London and 9 in Auckland. London participants immigrated from Benin, Brazil, Burundi, Columbia, France, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Auckland participants immigrated from Fiji, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, UK, US, and Zimbabwe. Data collection Interviews began by eliciting narratives pertaining to international migration, {{settlement and}} integration. A semi-structured interview guide was then used to obtain additional information such as engagement in occupations within the host community, and changes to occupations following migration. Next, participants created an ‘occupational map’ (Huot et al., 2013), describing the places they go and the things they do in their host communities. Follow-up interviews were undertaken as required to clarify information and seek additional experiences. Data analysis In total, 29 interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Analysis is ongoing, using a two-stage coding approach. In the first open-coding stage, transcripts are read line-by-line and codes reflect participants’ words. The second stage will entail a theoretical coding approach guided by concepts from Bourdieu’s theory of practice and Nayar’s (2009) theory of Navigating Cultural Spaces. Results Presentation of findings will address how immigrants’ experiences are shaped within the host societies’ broader contexts. For instance, New Zealand’s Biculturalism and Canada’s Multiculturalism and Bilingualism provide particular approaches to dealing with immigrant integration. We will discuss how this is negotiated at the local scale by individual immigrants who mediate their integration through engagement in occupation. As such, we will focus upon how occupations are affected by the transitions resulting from international migration, and how possibilities to engage in occupations, or not, shape immigrants’ integration into receiving communities. Contribution to occupational science Immigrants’ abilities to engage in occupations are central to their integration into a new society (Nayar, Hocking 2 ̆ 6 Wilson, 2007), yet many migration theories fail to explicitly acknowledge the centrality of occupation. Given that occupations are culturally mediated, this research will inform occupational science education by providing a deeper understanding of how people migrating between diverse cultural contexts experience transitions to <b>occupations.</b> <b>Learning</b> objectives: Following this presentation, audience members will better understand: The structural and systemic factors shaping immigrant integration; How international mobility can alter the occupations engaged in by migrants; and How transitions resulting from migration are mediated through occupation...|$|R

The detail {{is available from the}} author. Regressions were done using the full set of EU− 15 countries to overcome sample size limitations. A multinomial logit regression was used, taking the Taylor system as benchmark. A separate logit regression was done for that system to facilitate interpretation of the results. The results are broadly consistent with economic and human resource theories of incentive pay. The need for cooperation and team-working in the Learning and Lean systems is reflected in the use of collective, company-based, incentive pay. The focus on individual output in Taylorist systems is reflected in the use of individual payment by results, but also in pay for specific inconveniences of the job, such as overtime, bad conditions and unsocial hours. Because of the nature of mlogit, the coefficients need to be read comparatively between work systems. Likewise with regard to investments in training and on-the-job learning (proxied by length of service), the Learning and Lean systems emerge as the predominant users. Turning to workplace size and occupation, whereas use of taylorism increases steadily with establishment size, {{this is not the case}} for the other systems, which increasingly diverge from taylorism as size increases. In terms of <b>occupations,</b> the <b>Learning</b> and Lean models are associated with managerial and technical work, whereas taylorism is associated with blue collar and junior white collar work. This correspondence between individual reports of work organisation with workplace HR policies suggests strongly that the four types can indeed be interpreted as work systems. The derivation of the work system models from the EWCS is explained in the Appendix. Detailed regressions are available from the author.|$|R
30|$|Educational {{systems are}} {{distinguished}} by {{the extent to}} which they convey more general or specific occupational skills. Especially pronounced is the occupational specificity in countries with dual vocational education. Job specific skills are conveyed to the apprentices through vocational education acquired at the company, and they are canalized into set jobs after such training (Bol and Werfhorst 2013). The Swiss educational system is an example of such a strongly vocationally-oriented system that conveys specific occupational skills in a qualification space (Imdorf et al. 2017). In contrast to Switzerland, the Bulgarian educational system conveys more general skills, and vocational training is more school-based (Ilieva-Trichkova et al. 2015). Even though the Bulgarian VET system comprises hundreds of different <b>learning</b> <b>occupations</b> and specialities, there remains a mismatch between labour demands and vocational qualification. The fact that both the type of secondary education (e.g. arising from the different quality of upper secondary schools) and the institutional characteristics of higher education institutions strongly influence graduate employability (Boyadjieva and Ilieva-Trichkova 2015, 2018 b) suggest that the Bulgarian education–employment transition system is more representative of organizational space. Therefore, it can be assumed that the linkage between education and work is stronger in Switzerland than in Bulgaria.|$|R

The goal of this research was to date the period of <b>occupation</b> and to <b>learn</b> more about the origins, social standing and activities of its occupants. The structural remains of the house are examined and compared with contemporaneous houses in colonial North America and England. To date the house occupation, the ceramic, tobacco pipe and bottle glass assemblages are analysed. This analysis also indicates the nature of 17 th-century trade with Newfoundland and suggests the social standing and activities of the household. Metal artifacts are studied in an attempt to identify other activities carried out within the house and to determine the social position of the household. [...] The results of these analyses indicate that the house at Area B was a timber-framed structure built ca. 1660 and abandoned in 1696. The permanent residents appear to have been of the middling sort and were participants in the cod fishery. The evidence suggests they also were engaged in other seasonal activities, including hunting and boat-building, or repair...|$|R
