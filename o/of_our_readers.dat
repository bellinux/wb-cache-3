2500|$|Change {{of title}} and {{extension}} of scope – Preface to Volume 6.Editorial AnnouncementThe Editors desire to announce to their readers an important modification in {{the scope and}} contents of this work. As originally planned and hitherto announced, the series was intended to furnish the original sources, printed and documentary, {{for the history of}} the Philippine Islands only {{to the beginning of the}} nineteenth century. To most <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>readers,</b> the reasons for this are obvious: the fact that the classic period of Philippine history is thus bounded; the comparative rarity and inaccessibility of most material therein to the general public; the vast extent of the field covered by Philippine history, and the necessary limitations of space imposed upon the selection of material for this work; the closing of foreign archives to all investigators after an early date in the nineteenth century; and the greater difficulty, in that later period, of securing a proper historical perspective. But so many and urgent requests have come to us, from subscribers and reviewers, for such extension of this series as shall cover the entire period of Spanish domination, that we have decided to modify the former plan in the manner here briefly indicated.It is our purpose not to exceed the number of volumes already announced, fifty-five. We are able to do this because in our original plan, to avoid a subsequent increase in the number of volumes, a certain amount of space was purposely left for possible future changes as a result of later investigations to be made in foreign archives, or on account of the necessary excision of extraneous or irrelevant matter from the printed works which are to be presented in this series. The new title will be [...] "The Philippine Islands: 1493–1898." [...] The early and especially important history of the islands will be covered as fully as before. For the history of the nineteenth century, we will present various important decrees, reports, and other official documents; and provide a clear, careful, and impartial synopsis of some of the best historical matter extant, down to the close of the Spanish régime. Throughout the series will be used, as has been done from the beginning, all the best material available – historical, descriptive, and statistical – for reference and annotation. With the copious and prepared bibliography of Philippine historical literature, and the full analytical index, which will close the series; the broad and representative character of the material selected throughout; and the impartial and non-sectarian attitude maintained, the Editors trust that this change will still further enable scholars, historical writers, and general readers alike to study, with reliable and satisfactory material, the history of the Philippine Islands from their first discovery by Europeans to the close of the Spanish régime, and incidentally the history of the entire Orient.|$|E

30|$|A {{portable}} {{test strip}} reader {{that runs on}} a tablet PC and equipped with a Wi-Fi module was successfully developed in this study. This reader has a lighter weight than those of existing detection readers. It can run for long durations without an alternating current (AC) power supply, making it suitable for outdoor detection. Given the favorable price of the CMOS sensor, the cost <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>reader</b> is also tremendously low, making it an even practical device. The 3 D printed cartridge of the LFIA is highly suitable for <b>our</b> <b>reader,</b> and 3 D printing technology {{can be used to}} design different formats. The barcode printed on the strip contains the patient information and the detection type, thereby avoiding incorrect detections. The use of the barcode scanner enables the quick and accurate retrieval of information, which simplifies the operation.|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} humanism and hedonism. However, its main objective is not to explain the terms in their summarized historical relatedness but to point out their internal coherence. The fundamental issue the thesis deals with {{is the fact that}} sentient beings suffer from sorrow. Enumerating the reasons why it is important to search for a solution would be a waste <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>reader's</b> time. It is necessary to understand that we don't expect empirical science to solve the problem since - despite the enthusiasm significant for this modern period - has not introduced any relief from sorrow. Here comes the opportunity for philosophy and, eventually, ethics. In its first part the thesis maps out the context of humanism and hedonism, studies their apparent as well as hidden nature, and lays the conceivable foundations of humanistic hedonism. The following section suggests a set of particular steps. Adhering to these instructions makes it possible to experience delight and to eliminate sorrow...|$|R
