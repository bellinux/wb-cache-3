Further {{for developing the}} model has been selected suitable adaptive filter. Two types of NN-based inverse model (i. e. with and without disturbance input) were accurately simulated.

The simulation results revealed that NN-IMC with appropriate learning rate - momentum is capable to pursue the set-point changes and to reject the disturbance changes without steady state error or oscillations.

40|$|AbstractGeothermal energy, {{deep and}} shallow, {{has always been}} {{identified}} as an important renewable energy resource. The stable temperature and relatively low enthalpy of mine water contained in the abandoned and flooded coal mines {{have the potential to}} form a geothermal resource to be used in conjunction with heat pumps to provide heating and cooling for buildings. The usage of heat pump for space heating and cooling can be classified as a low carbon technology and if heat pump is powered by solar or wind energy it can be classified as a truly renewable technology. This paper presents a novel application of Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) for space heating and cooling using a flooded coal mine through an <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> based <b>single</b> shaft system. In this novel application, a single shaft is used for both extraction and injection of mine water for the heating application. This research work will report on the performance of the system and its long term potential in comparison to standard gas boilers heating systems. The usage of a single shaft system has been found effective in developing an efficient heating system with reduced cost and neutral environmental impact...|$|R

50|$|Control for the {{solenoids}} and {{stepper motors}} {{can be either}} closed <b>loop</b> or <b>open</b> <b>loop.</b> Closed loop systems rely on feedback from a manifold pressure sensor to meet a predetermined boost pressure. <b>Open</b> <b>loop</b> systems have a predetermined control output where control output is merely based on other inputs such as throttle angle and/or engine RPM. <b>Open</b> <b>loop</b> specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific level of boost pressure. Since <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> systems do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or engine coolant temperature. For this reason, systems that do not feature closed loop operation are not as widespread.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The ionic polymer metal {{composite}} (IPMC) {{is a novel}} smart polymer material. It shows significant {{potential in}} the application for low-mass high-displacement actuators. The IPMC behavior in <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> is not repeatable and also {{it is difficult to}} maintain its tip displacement constant at a specified position in <b>open</b> <b>loop.</b> Hence closed-loop control of IPMC is important. In this paper model-based precision position control of an IPMC strip in a cantilever configuration is demonstrated. After implementing the closed-loop position control the overshoot decreased to 20 % from 205. 34 % in <b>open</b> <b>loop,</b> and the settling time reduced to 1 s from 27 s in <b>open</b> <b>loop.</b> Precision micro-scale position-control capability of the IPMC was also demonstrated.

In the closed loop model, generation companies choose capacities that maximize their individual profit in the first stage while the second stage represents the conjecturedprice- response market equilibrium. In the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> model, firms simultaneously choose capacities and quantities to maximize their individual profit, while each firm conjectures a price response to its output decisions. The closed loop equilibrium model is an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints, which belongs to a class of problems that is very hard to solve. The <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> equilibrium model is much easier to solve, however, it is also less realistic. With the approximation scheme proposed in this paper, we are able to solve the closed loop model reasonably well when market behavior is closer to oligopoly than to perfect competition by smartly employing <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> models which reduces the computational time by two orders of magnitude. We achieve this by transforming the <b>open</b> <b>loop</b> equilibrium problem into an equivalent convex quadratic optimization problem which can be solved efficiently. Finally, a case study is presented in order to validate the proposed approximation scheme. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
