2500|$|The basic {{philosophy}} of Ryu-te is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> protection. This {{can be seen}} in Oyata's book Ryu-Te No Michi with his translation of [...] Budo is commonly translated as [...] "martial way" [...] or [...] "martial art", however, Oyata prefers to translate it as [...] "life protection art". This interpretation stems from an analysis of the first kanji Bu (...) [...] From an etymological perspective, it is composed of two kanji: [...] which means [...] "to stop" [...] and [...] which means [...] "spear". Thus the underlying meaning of [...] {{can be thought of as}} [...] "to stop fighting" [...] rather than something pertaining to combat.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to {{the recommendations of the}} jury, Superior Court Judge William Keene ordered a reconvening of court on February 24, upon which date William Charvet was to argue for a modification of the sentence recommended by the jury. Despite an impassioned appeal by Charvet, Judge William Keene formally sentenced Bonin to death for the 10 murders of which he was convicted on March 12. Describing the murders as [...] "a gross, revolting affront to human dignity", Judge Keene further ordered at this hearing that if Bonin's death sentence were commuted to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> imprisonment, the sentences should run consecutively. Bonin was then ordered to be remanded to the warden of San Quentin State Prison, to await execution in the gas chamber. He remained unmoved upon receipt of this sentence, having earlier informed his attorney he had fully expected to formally receive the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|The defence stands here solely {{upon the}} {{absolute}} immunity from judicial inquiry {{of every one}} who asserts authority from {{the executive branch of}} the government, however clear it may be made that the executive possessed no such power. Not only no such power is given, but it is absolutely prohibited, both to the executive and the legislative, to deprive any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> liberty, or property without due process of law, or to take private property without just compensation. ... No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All the officers of the government, from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law, and are bound to obey it. It is the only supreme power in our system of government, and every man who by accepting office participates in its functions is only the more strongly bound to submit to that supremacy, and to observe the limitations which it imposes upon the exercise of the authority which it gives. Courts of justice are established, not only to decide upon the controverted rights of the citizens as against each other, but also upon rights in controversy between them and the government; and the docket of this court is crowded with controversies of the latter class. Shall it be said, {{in the face of all}} this, and of the acknowledged right of the judiciary to decide in proper cases, statutes which have been passed by both branches of Congress and approved by the President to be unconstitutional, that the courts cannot give a remedy when the citizen has been deprived of his property by force, his estate seized and converted to the use of the government without lawful authority, without process of law, and without compensation, because the President has ordered it and his officers are in possession? If such be the law of this country, it sanctions a tyranny which has no existence in the monarchies of Europe, nor in any other government which has a just claim to well-regulated liberty and the protection of personal rights.|$|E

This much we can say: that it is no ordinary love escapade. You saw the woman's face at the sign of danger. We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the desperate need for secrecy, argue that the matter is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> or death. The attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male.

60|$|But England is a {{small and}} wealthy country, whose best defence against a neighbour, always likely to become a foe, {{consists}} in a mere ocean canal; where the question, I will not say of war, but of readiness for war, is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> or death--in which the temptation, always so strong, to subordinate national honour to what {{is supposed to be}} policy, is in our day for most statesmen almost irresistible, because political influence is so evenly balanced, that a peace party of perhaps twenty votes has often the destinies of a ministry in its hands. Had Mr. Lowell been an Englishman, no one who knows his writings can believe for a moment that he would have swelled the cry or strengthened the hands of the vain and mischievous clique, who amongst us have of late years raised the cry of peace when there is no peace.|$|E
60|$|But to {{the utter}} {{destruction}} of most such hands as Geoffrey held, loving women never will play {{according to the}} book.

Beatrice after all was very much of a woman, and she did not behave much better than any other woman would have done. She was angry and suspicious, and she showed it, with the result that Geoffrey grew angry also. It was cruel of her, he thought, considering all things. He forgot that she could know nothing of what was in his mind, however much she might guess; also as yet he did not know the boundless depth and might of her passion for him, and all that it meant to her. Had he realised this he would have acted very differently.|$|E

His uncle's conduct to this woman, and his wife's, had created the intimacy which had existed. Through their efforts she had become almost {{as one of the}} family. And now to be dismissed, like a servant who had misbehaved herself! And then her arguments in her own defence were all so good,--if only that which Lady Cantrip had laid down as law was to be held as law. He was aware now that she had had no knowledge of the matter till his daughter had told her of the engagement at Matching. Then it was evident also that she had sent this Tregear to him immediately on her return to London. And {{at the end of the}} letter she accused him of what she had been pleased to call his usual tenacity in believing ill of her! He had been obstinate,--too obstinate in this respect, but he did not love her the better for having told him of it.|$|E
60|$|With a murmured word of excuse she glided away, and Courtlaw, who {{had come}} with a mission which seemed to him to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> or death, was left {{to listen to the}} latest art jargon from Chelsea. He bore it as long as he could, {{watching}} all the time with fascinated eyes Annabel moving gracefully about amongst her guests, always gay, with a smile and a whisper for nearly everybody. Grudgingly he admired her. To him she had always appeared as a mere pleasure-loving parasite--something quite insignificant. He had pictured her, if indeed she had ever had the courage to do this thing, as sitting alone, convulsed with guilty fear, starting at her own shadow, a slave to constant terror. And instead he found her playing the great lady, and playing it well. She knew, or guessed his mission too, for more than once their eyes met, and she laughed mockingly at him. At last he could bear it no longer. He left his companion {{in the midst of a}} glowing eulogy of Bastien Leparge, and boldly intercepted his hostess as she moved from one group to join another.|$|E
60|$|Many years ago, {{long before}} the lovely Furness {{district}} was invaded by the genius of steam, the villagers along the coast from Bardsea to Rampside were haunted by a wandering being whose errand, the purpose of which could never be learned, used to bring him at night along the lonely roads and past the straggling cottages. This pilgrim was a wearied, emaciated-looking man, on whose worn and wan face the sorrows of life had left deep traces, and in whose feverish, hungry-looking eyes, mystery and terror seemed to lurk. Nobody knew the order of his coming or going, for he neither addressed anyone, nor replied if spoken to, but disregarded alike the 'good neet' of the tramp who knew him not, and the startled cry of the belated villager who came suddenly upon him at a turn of the road. Never stopping even for a minute to gaze through the panes whence streamed the ruddy glow of the wood fires, and to envy the dwellers in the cosy cottages, he kept on his way, as though his mission was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and death, and, therefore, would not brook delay.|$|E

Yet must we be satisfied, in the first place because we have to be, no other means is at our control, and secondly, because, after all these things, tradition and superstition, are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for others, though not, alas! for us, on them? A year ago which of us would have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific, sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome, he flourish in Germany all over, in France, in India, even in the Chermosese, and in China, so far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples for him at this day.

They have no thought of throwing off their allegiance to Spain, if Spain will but be tolerant. The Prince of Orange issues his orders and proclamations as the stadtholder and lieutenant of the king, and declares that he is warring for Philip, and designs only to repel those who, by their persecution and cruelty, are dishonouring the royal cause.|$|E
