It just creates movement and it seems like there is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building."

500|$|During the 2010–11 season, the Capitals {{participated in}} the 2011 NHL Winter Classic against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Heinz Field, Pittsburgh. Leading up to the game, both teams were {{featured}} on HBO's 24/7, which offered a behind-the-scenes look at both teams as they prepared. Laich refused to blame {{the presence of the}} cameras for the team's losing streak, saying, [...] "There's no using the HBO cameras as a crutch or an annoyance <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that. There's no excuse. I don't think HBO has played any bit of an ounce in how things have gone the last two weeks."

500|$|Their fourth album Suck It and See {{sees the}} band {{exploring}} styles, mixing them with newfound maturity. Turner said: [...] "I think {{the new album}} is a balance between our first three. There's nothing about taxi ranks <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that, but there's {{a bit of the}} standpoint I had on those early songs and the sense of humour, but also there's a bit of the 'Humbug' stuff which is kind of off in the corners." [...] Critics noted an influence from British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as The Smiths, and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound. Turner wrote much of the album in his apartment on an acoustic guitar, further influencing the ballad-style prevalent on the album.|$|E

500|$|The {{sociologist}} Bob Ashley {{observed that}} while people in Britain might {{agree that the}} core national diet consisted of items such as the full English breakfast, roast beef with all the trimmings, tea with scones, and fish and chips, few had ever eaten the canonical English breakfast, lunch and dinner in any single day, and many probably never ate any item from the list at all regularly. In any case, Ashley noted, the national diet changes with time, and cookery books routinely include dishes of foreign origin. He remarked that a National Trust café, whose manager claimed [...] "We're not allowed to do foreign food... I can't do lasagne <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that", in fact served curry, because [...] "seemingly curry is English". Anglo-Indian cuisine has indeed {{been part of the}} national diet since the eighteenth century.|$|E

I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that, {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle. In May 2012, it was confirmed that Ryan would be recast and played by Sol Heras, because Thompson chose not to return.|$|E

500|$|While {{starting}} for {{an injured}} John David Booty in 2007, Sanchez wore a custom mouthguard that featured {{the colors of}} the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage. It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame. The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints: for Mexican-Americans, it was a symbol of unity—Sanchez accepting his heritage; for critics, the gesture symbolized a radical political statement. Sanchez, who {{was born and raised in}} the United States, received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico. Sanchez responded to the controversy stating, [...] "It’s not a Mexican power thing <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that. It’s just a little bit of pride in our heritage. Hopefully, it inspires somebody and it’s all for the best." [...] Overwhelmed by the attention and shying away from politics, Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece, but began participating in other efforts to help the Hispanic community.|$|E

[...] Trevor-Roper died in 2003.

500|$|The next day, Churchill filed {{a lawsuit}} in state court {{claiming}} that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views.

As Stanley Fish said, [...] "It was the jury’s task to determine whether Churchill’s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his constitutionally protected statements." [...] The jury found that the alleged misconduct would not have led to Churchill's firing and rejected the university's academic misconduct claim as the grounds for dismissal. On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages. As {{one of the jurors}} said later in a press interview, [...] "it wasn't a slap in his face <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that when we didn't give him any money.

500|$|References to China {{appear in}} the album's songs, {{including}} in [...] "Burning Airlines Give You So Much More", [...] "China My China" [...] and [...] "Taking Tiger Mountain".

[...] On the political theme within the lyrics and album title, Eno explained that he is [...] "not Maoist <b>or</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that; if anything I'm anti-Maoist". The album addresses several different esoteric topics. [...] "Burning Airlines Give You So Much More" [...] is inspired by a 1974 crash near Paris of a Turkish Airlines DC-10, {{one of the worst}} air crashes in history. [...] "The Fat Lady of Limbourg", described by Eno as a [...] "Burroughs-type song" [...] about an asylum in Limbourg, Belgium where the residents of it outnumber the population of the town.
