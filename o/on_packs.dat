50|$|The game may be {{purchased}} in booster packs (similar to Magic: The Gathering), {{but there are}} ways of acquiring particular pieces without spending large quantities of money <b>on</b> <b>packs.</b> Trade is the most common option, followed by purchases on eBay. There are units that players can only acquire through trade or send-aways, such as the Battleforces and the Designer Series Mechs and pilots. From August 2002 to August 2003, WizKids organized story-based campaigns wherein it was possible for players to win units based on the factions named in the story. Such items - the Champion, Fellowship, and two Participation units (one for each faction) - are unique versions of certain game pieces with higher stats and a special lapel pin. There are several factions to collect, and many are interconnected by alliances and other relations. Many of the factions from Classic Battletech were introduced into the game and the game has several original factions as well. In keeping with the spirit of the Battletech universe, there are also many mercenary units referred to as Gunslingers.|$|E
50|$|Hunting {{scenes were}} common topics in medieval and Renaissance art. Hunting {{in the medieval}} period was a sport {{exclusive}} to the aristocracy and hunting was {{an essential part of}} court etiquette. Depictions of person together with a hunting dog, hawks or falcons would signal status, or was the signalment of a noble man - since the hunting dogs were connected to aristocracy, and only the nobility was hunting. Hunting was considered as a sport, but also a way of showing bravery, chivalric virtue while hunting dangerous prey such as wild boars and bears. Hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs were used for different types of hunting. Hunting with dogs was so popular that during the Middle Ages the wild bears had already been hunted to extinction in England.Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. Hunting filled also a practical necessity, assuring food for the tables of the nobility. Nobles spending their money <b>on</b> <b>packs</b> of specially bred hounds were not unusual.|$|E
