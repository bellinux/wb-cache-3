40|$|We {{present study}} of the {{synthesis}} and reactions of an analog of the meteoritic mineral schreibersite with formula (Fe,Ni) 3 P, {{believed to be a}} prebiotic source of reactive phosphorus that may have prompted the formation of phosphorylated biomolecules near the time of the origin of life (Pasek and Lauretta, 2005). The mineral was synthesized by mixing stoichiometric proportions of elemental iron, nickel and phosphorus and heating in a tube furnace at 820 °C for approximately 235 hours under argon or under vacuum, a modification of the method of Skála and Drábek (2002). The mineral was characterized using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), micro-raman spectroscopy and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA). Characterization indicates that both schreibersite, with approximate formula Fe 2 NiP and the mineral nickel-phosphide, FeNi 2 P were synthesized. In addition to characterization of the solid product, the reactions of the synthetic schreibersite were investigated to determine the similarity between these and prior work done with Fe 3 P. Synthetic schreibersite was corroded in several solutions: seawater and sulfidic water under both oxic and anoxic conditions. After corrosion, the solutions were analyzed using phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P NMR) and high performance liquid chromatography attached to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (HPLC-ICP-MS) to determine phosphorus speciation as well as concentrations of phosphorus present in solution. As expected from previous studies, the NMR and HPLC-ICP-MS results indicated the presence of <b>orthophosphate,</b> <b>phosphite,</b> pyrophosphate and hypophosphate in the corrosion solutions (Pasek and Lauretta, 2005). The HPLC-ICP-MS results indicate that the extent of corrosion of the mineral—measured by the concentration of phosphorus released—depends on the ionic strength of the solution, as well as {{the presence or absence of}} the chelating agent. Finally, we report the successful phosphorylation of a potentially prebiotic molecule—choline—using synthesized schreibersite...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{has long}} been {{acknowledged}} as a vital nutrient for living organisms and is a key factor responsible for the fresh water eutrophication. Our understanding of the phosphorus cycle has been limited by: (1) the common assumption that all P in the environment occurs primarily as phosphates and (2) by the limited analytical methods available to identify P speciation. In an attempt to understand the distribution and chemistry of phosphorus within a freshwater system we {{must be able to}} identify individual P species. To this end, we used a coupled High Performance Liquid Chromatograph (HPLC) - Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICPMS) to determine concentrations of <b>orthophosphate</b> (+ 5), <b>phosphite</b> (+ 3) and hypophosphite (+ 1) in aqueous samples using methods modified from IC techniques developed by Ivey 2 ̆ 6 Foster (2005) and Pech, et al. (2009) and Atlas et al. (in prep). The identification of different P species provides insight pertaining to contamination, bioavailability and sustainability within a freshwater system. Thirty-two individual water samples were collected from six different bodies of freshwater in the Tampa Bay area between the months of November 2012 to March 2013. The freshwater samples collected were from river and pond/swamp water locations. Two sampling sites were chosen at each location. At each site, one sample was collected from the water 2 ̆ 7 s surface and a second sample was collected from the sediment pore water. When depth was sufficient a third sample was obtained from the midpoint between the surface and sediment. Analytical results show that redox reactions of P occur in all freshwater samples collected as identified by HPLC-ICP-MS analysis. Our data show that the distribution and concentration of reduced P is controlled primarily by pH, and secondarily by water circulation, ORP and sediment type. Our results also imply biologic influence as a potential primary control of reduced P flux. Additional samples must be collected in order to quantify and differentiate the processes controlling P speciation. The ability to identify P speciation raises many questions concerning the validity of current methods used to measure P; other forms of reduced P may be present. Additional sample analysis will be necessary to determine how and if reduced forms of P affect the P cycle...|$|R
