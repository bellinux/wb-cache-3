40|$|DC/AC {{inverter}} topologies having reduced {{numbers of}} switches to reduce costs, total inverter size and switching losses have previously been proposed. In addition, these topologies {{reduce the likelihood}} of semiconductor switch damage, and have lower common-mode currents. This paper proposes new designs for inverters with reduced switch numbers. For three-phase systems, the proposed inverters use four switches instead of the six used in the traditional three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI). Compared to the traditional Four-Switch Three-Phase (FSTP) inverter, the proposed FSTP inverters improve the voltage utilisation factor of the input dc supply, without the need for triplen injection. Sliding-mode control is used to demonstrate the dynamic response and robustness of the inverters. Also the paper presents new single-phase inverters with two switches instead of the four used in the traditional VSI. The capability of suppressing the 2 nd order current harmonic from the input dc side is discussed. The basic structures of the proposed inverters and their <b>operation,</b> <b>switch</b> ratings, controller design with supporting mathematical equations, and MATLAB/SIMULINK results are presented. Practical results, based on laboratory prototype circuitry controlled using a Texas Instruments TMSF 280335 DSP, are presented to demonstrate the design flexibility and operation of the proposed topologies...|$|E

40|$|Apart from {{providing}} detailed insight about the energy harvesting {{system as a}} whole, this work tackles the challenges of efficient control of the interface circuit of an electrostatic vibration energy harvester, with severely limited power consumption allowance for the controlling electronics. Used interface circuit consists of double charge-pump topology, comprising a storage element (pre-charged reservoir capacitance), dual antiphase variable capacitance and an intermediate storage element, with an inductive flyback return path. Since high voltages are expected {{in the long term}} <b>operation,</b> <b>switch</b> component of the interface circuit is realized as a high-voltage PMOS device from AMSH 35 process by AMS. Concerning the interface circuit, theoretical analysis was introduced, to demonstrate the requirement for precise synchronization of the switch with the circuit voltage levels, with the purpose of optimizing the harvested energy. Previous work was addressed, and this work was built upon it. For decreasing the power consumption of the critical component, a low power clock-signal generator was designed, with power consumption of approximately 0. 35 nW, and accompanying stable current reference with constant power consumption of 0. 57 nW, and 4. 7 %/V current deviation caused by variations in the supply voltage. Additionally, issues accompanying the long term operation, and thus increase in the pre-charge voltage, were discussed in details, and subject of interest for further research and promising possible improvements were suggested...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{defines a}} frame forwarding technique offering a fixed delay to a subclass of traffic in closed industrial control networks. In these networks bandwidth {{is dedicated to}} periodic traffic supporting tight inter-process control and control loop communication. Ideally periodic traffic arrival will have minimal delay-jitter with constant realized delays. This simplifies the implementation of connected control devices. Furthermore networks are simplified with asynchronous node and switch <b>operation.</b> <b>Switch</b> designs are simplified {{as there is no}} dependence on adjacent switch clock operation. Correct network function only relies on switches directly traversed by each flow and is not dependent on complex clock synchronization mechanisms. Existing packet scheduling schemes that attempt to minimize delay-jitter, suffer from either requiring inter-switch clock coordination (i. e. RCSP-DJ), or maintain a fixed priority so that the highest priority flows must contend without regard to past frame arrival treatment (i. e. RCSP-RJ). In this dissertation the FlexTDMA protocol is defined which supports closed network communication. FlexTDMA will be enhanced to accommodate real-world networking conditions (FlexTDMA+) and will be enhanced to support simultaneous multicast (FlexTDMA++). The FlexTDMA scheduling algorithm delivers frame data on each flow nearly at the maximal delay bound with minimal delay-jitter in an asynchronous network. Industrial control switching network systems will benefit from FlexTDMA when the complexity of system level synchronization is unacceptable, but the component switches must operate independently. FlexTDMA does not require synchronous network clock coordination and preserves the data content of frames. FlexTDMA+ includes three improvements: baseline preemption, partial baselining and baseline deadline density control, which are used to support real-world conditions of node periodic on-off transmission, clock drift, frame loss and bandwidth load. FlexTDMA++ supports simultaneous multicast under real-world conditions of switch failures, node periodic on-off transmission, clock drift, frame loss and bandwidth load...|$|E

40|$|Abstract–Based on the {{requirements}} of electric vehicles on electric motor drives, this paper presents three criteria to evaluate motoring <b>operation</b> of in-wheel <b>switched</b> reluctance motor drives for electric vehicles. They are the average torque, the average torque per rms current, and torque smoothness factor. They indicate the motoring torque, copper loss and torque ripple, respectively. The model of motoring operation under the current hysteresis control is developed to investigate {{the effects of the}} turn-on angle, the turn-off angle, and the current reference on these criteria. The simulated and measured current waveforms verify the proposed model. The simulated results show that the turn-on angle and the turn-off angles have considerable effects on motoring <b>operation</b> of <b>switched</b> reluctance drives. The optimal turn-on angle and the optimal turn-off angle can be optimized in order to maximum the average torque, the average torque per rms current, or the torque smoothness factor. In addition, the larger current reference results in the larger average torque, average torque per rms current and torque smoothness factor. Thus, this study is helpful for developing new control method to implement the best motoring <b>operation</b> of in-wheel <b>switched</b> reluctance motor drives in electric vehicles.
