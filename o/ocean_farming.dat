50|$|The TTED is the {{culmination}} of years of research. With funding provided by the European Union and the DIREN (Regional Environmental Authorities), WWF commissioned a study from IFREMER (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) to determine which selective gear was the most adapted to fishing conditions in French Guiana. These initial trials, conducted under experimental conditions, were carried out on board a shrimp trawler. Following this work, shrimp industry’s members expressed the need to continue these experiments and to become more involved in the project. In response, WWF and the CRPMEMG (French Guiana Regional Fishery and <b>Ocean</b> <b>Farming</b> Committee) began working in close collaboration in order to test and develop the best gear for the French Guiana fleet.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the fair value per share of SalMar ASA, a Norwegian salmon farming company, at 3 rd of May 2017. The analysis has been performed using fundamental and relative valuation methods. Future cash flows are forecasted using key value drivers identified and analyzed in a thorough strategic and historical performance analysis. The value per share is derived by discounting future cash flows at a weighted {{average cost of}} capital before subtracting debt and non-equity claims. At last the sensitivity of estimates is thoroughly analyzed. Firstly, the macro analysis uncovers how regulations due sustainability challenges limits further organic growth in the industry, despite favorable economic conditions for a continued demand growth for salmon. Secondly, the industry analysis uncovers a threat of increased salmon supply due to new entrants within non-traditional salmon farming methods. Thirdly, the resource based-view analysis uncovers short term competitive advantages in SalMar ASA’s optimized value chain, license locations and <b>ocean</b> <b>farming</b> technology. At last, the historical performance analysis reveal how SalMar {{has a history of}} stronger operating margin, lower operational cost, and higher return on invested capital compared to peers. The development in non-financial drivers are forecasted {{based on the results of}} the strategic and historical performance analysis. Salmon price is expected to stay strong in the short run, but revert to a lower historical average as supply from non-traditional farming methods gradually increase. Cost of goods sold is expected to decrease while fixed assets per license is expected to increase over the explicit forecast period. This is due to larger investments in cost efficient solutions including <b>ocean</b> <b>farming</b> technology, and self- sufficient smolt production. As a result, the forecast exhibits a continued high operating margin while return on invested capital declines compared to historical levels. Based on, these assumptions the fundamental valuation derives a fair value per share of NOK 153, while the relative valuation suggests a value interval of NOK 174 - 240. The sensitivity analysis uncovers a large value sensitivity to forecasted salmon price and cost of goods sold. The scenario analysis investigates the effect of success and failure of investments in cost improving technologies, ceteris paribus, where the result suggests a fair value per share of NOK 201 in case of success, and 90 in case of failure. At last, a Monte Carlo Simulation based on the historical probability distribution of the salmon price, suggests that the base case fair value per share estimate is less than 40 % probable. The thesis concludes that the fair value per share for SalMar ASA is NOK 153 ~ 30 % lower than today’s market price...|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of global {{overfishing}} of wild-caught seafood, <b>ocean</b> fish <b>farming</b> has augmented the supply of fresh fish to western markets and {{become one of the}} fastest growing global industries. Accurate reporting of quantities of wild-caught fish has been problematic and we questioned whether similar discrepancies in data exist in statistics for farmed fish production. In the Mediterranean Sea, <b>ocean</b> fish <b>farming</b> is prevalent and stationary cages can be seen off the coasts of 16 countries using satellite imagery available through Google Earth. Using this tool, we demonstrate here that a few trained scientists now have the capacity to ground truth farmed fish production data reported by the Mediterranean countries. With Google Earth, we could examine 91 % of the Mediterranean coast and count 248 tuna cages (circular cages > 40 m diameter) and 20, 976 other fish cages within 10 km offshore, the majority of which were off Greece (49 %) and Turkey (31 %). Combining satellite imagery with assumptions about cage volume, fish density, harvest rates, and seasonal capacity, we make a conservative approximation of ocean-farmed finfish production for 16 Mediterranean countries. Our overall estimate of 225, 736 t of farmed finfish (not including tuna) in the Mediterranean Sea in 2006 is only slightly more than the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reports. The results demonstrate the reliability of recent FAO farmed fish production statistics for the Mediterranean as well as the promise of Google Earth to collect and ground truth data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OnlyThe western Indian Ocean {{coastal regions}} {{are poised to}} develop the great potential, largely {{untapped}} to date, for increased seafood production from marine aquaculture. The scales at which aquaculture development in the region proceeds will determine how the benefits from this economic activity are distributed. Finfish and shellfish farming can be pursued {{at a variety of}} scales. Some forms of aquaculture, including tilapia farming in ponds, can be conducted effectively at the small (family) scale, while others (shrimp <b>farming,</b> <b>ocean</b> cage <b>farming)</b> are most efficient at larger (corporate) scales. Marine shellfish farming in particular can be very efficient at the family scale, with adequate infrastructure support. In coastal villages in Tanzania and other parts of East Africa, local species of clams and oysters can be farmed by individuals or small cooperatives in ways that are ecologically and economically sound. Shellfish farming can generate revenues of several hundred dollars/year/person at this scale, and can provide economic opportunity for women as well as men. Significant markets for additional shellfish product exist in local communities, in tourist restaurants, and in international export markets. Infrastructure requirements to support such farming include hatcheries and training in shellfish grow out and business skills. We illustrate this concept with a case study from Zanzibar, Tanzania...|$|R
