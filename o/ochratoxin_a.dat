30|$|The {{issue of}} TiO 2 {{toxicity}} {{has been a}} research subject in many research centres {{around the world for}} many years. It is assumed that the microsized titanium dioxide (micro-TiO 2) is harmless to people and animals [36, 44]. As the dynamic development of nanotechnology goes on, however, there has been an increased concern that this compound might be toxic in the NP form, though. There are studies proving that NPs of many other metal oxides, such as ZnO or MgO, are more harmful to people and animals than MPs of the same compounds [45]. One of the main differences between micro-TiO 2 and nano-TiO 2 is a much bigger active surface of nano-TiO 2, a feature resulting in a higher absorption rate of UV and a greater photocatalytic activity. Hence, nano-TiO 2, contrary to micro-TiO 2, was classified in the 2 B group by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [46]. The 2 B group assembles compounds that might be carcinogenic for humans (to compare: in the same group, there are also chloroform, nitrobenzene, fumonisins B 1 or <b>ochratoxins</b> <b>A).</b>|$|R

50|$|Citrinin often occurs {{together}} with other mycotoxins like <b>ochratoxin</b> <b>A</b> or aflatoxin B1, because they are produced by the same fungi species.

The effects of co-occurrence of these mycotoxins are either additive or synergistic. The nephrotoxic effects of <b>ochratoxin</b> <b>A</b> and citrinin, for example, are increased synergistic when exposure to both takes place.

The pH studies revealed an increase in mycelial weight as the pH of the medium increase, with a mycelial weight of 18. 0 + 2. 0333 mg/ 50 cm 3 at pH 3. 0, 73. 0 + 1. 0837 mg/ 50 cm 3 at pH 4. 0 before reaching the peak (106. 0 + 1. 4204 mg/ 50 cm 3) at pH 5. 0. Thereafter, an increase in pH resulted in a reduction in mycelia weight with no growth detected at pH 9. 0. Temperature studied showed that a temperature of 30 ºC produced the highest mycelial weight of 145. 5 mg/ 50 cm 3 closely followed by 120. 6 mg/ 50 cm 3 at 35 ºC while the lowest mycelial weight (15. 5 mg/ 50 cm 3) was recorded at 20 ºC and no growth detected at 15 ºC. Among the various microelements investigated, Zinc appears {{to be the most important}} with a Zinc-free medium producing the poorest mycelia weight of 37. 01 + 0. 6666 mg / 50 cm 3 while Cobalt appears not to play any significant role in the growth of this Rhizopus sp. as the Cobalt-free medium produced identical mycelial weight (57. 3 mg/ 50 cm 3) with the medium containing all the nutrients. Investigation of the macroelement requirement of the organism showed that Calcium is the most important with a Calcium-free medium producing the poorest growth of 15. 0 + 0. 7676 mg/ 50 cm 3 while the best growth was (50. 7 + 0. 4096 mg/ 50 cm 3) was observed in a complete medium without Magnesium.

40|$|The present {{communication}} is a survey report {{carried out to}} assess the incidence of toxic mycoflora on seven types of agriculture products/by products incorporated during fish culture as supplementary dietary items. Samples were obtained from various sources at Darbhanga, Madhubani and Samashtipur districts during summer, winter and monsoon months. Out of the total 1774 samples, only 894 appeared to be fresh visually reflecting average incidence of contamination around 46. 6 %.

Thus, degree of fungal spoilage in feed ingredients in parts of north Bihar appears to be significantly high (73. 5 %).

40|$|Abstract: Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolic {{products of}} several moulds {{that can be}} found as contaminants of feedstuffs (mainly cereals) and exert toxic effects in animals and human beings. Contamination can already occur in-field but is usually a consequence of poor storage conditions. Pigs are particularly sensitive to the toxic effect of trichothecenes and zearalenone that are produced by Fusarium strains but animal health and production can be compromised also by the ingestion of other mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, ochratoxins, and fumonisins. While ingestion of all mycotoxins usually result in reduced animal growth, other possible symtomps include reduced feed intake, vomiting and diarrhoea (trichothecenes), reduced reproductive capability (aflatoxins and zearalenone), suppressed immune function (aflatoxins), nephropathy (ohcratoxins), and pulmonary edema (fumonisins). Moreover, to some extent, some mycotoxins can be found in animal organs such as liver (aflatoxins) and kidneys (<b>ochratoxins)</b> and represent <b>a</b> potential threat to consumers health. Several methods have been developed {{in order to reduce the}} intestinal absorption of mycotoxins in farm animals. Modern detoxification methods are based on the utilization of dietary supplements such as absorptive materials that can bind the toxins and microbes and enzymes that can inactivate them. Some lactic acid bacteria are able to bind and biotransform mycotoxins while absorptive agents such as aluminosilicates, clays, and mannan oligosaccharides have shown the ability to bind aflatoxins. Similarly, biotransformation of mycotoxins can be achieved through the use of specific enzymes.
