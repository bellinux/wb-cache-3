5|$|After {{his return}} to London, Carte formed a new {{partnership}} with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of their shows. Meanwhile, Pinafore continued to play strongly. On 20 February 1880, Pinafore completed its initial run of 571performances. <b>Only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> work of musical theatre in the world had ever run longer, Robert Planquette's operetta Les cloches de Corneville.|$|E
5|$|By 1915, {{there was}} <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> U.S. college playing intercollegiate rugby: Santa Clara. The rest of Stanford's {{schedule}} {{was made up}} of local club and all star teams. The team played to a scoreless tie with the Olympic Club team to start the season, but recovered to win the rest of the games on the schedule.|$|E
5|$|Domesday {{makes it}} obvious that Urse {{was the most}} {{powerful}} layman in Worcester, and {{the only person who}} could contest his power in the county was the Bishop of Worcester. The power struggle continued into the 12th century, as Urse's descendants still contested the bishops. <b>Only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> layman is recorded as having a castle in Worcestershire in Domesday, and he held much less land than Urse.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the death}} of Harrison, three Presidents served within a single {{calendar}} year (Martin Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler). This has happened on <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> occasion, 40 years later in 1881, when Rutherford B. Hayes was succeeded by James A. Garfield, who was assassinated later that year. With the death of Garfield, Chester A. Arthur stepped into the presidency.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Phillies won the NL East {{and reached}} {{the playoffs for the}} first time since 1993 and the first time in Burrell's career. Burrell hit a home run against Jeff Francis in the first game of the NL Division Series (NLDS) but had <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> hit in the series as the Phillies were swept by the Colorado Rockies.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} {{is the sole}} member of the genus Tetracerus, and is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first described by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. The {{four-horned antelope}} has <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus). The Boselaphini have the horns with a keel {{on the front and}} lack rings as found in other antelope groups.|$|E

5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> parrot species. One {{of the most}} striking characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapos.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Chrysomela graminis {{and was later}} transferred to the genus Chrysolina. The genus Chrysolina currently contains 39 subgenera. C. graminis (with its several subspecies) {{is located in the}} subgenus Euchrysolina which contains <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> species – C. virgata; this subgenus was first established in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique {{at the age of}} 19 is something rare. I can recall <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E

5|$|In 1345, while Grosmont was in France, {{his father}} died. The younger Henry was now Earl of Lancaster – the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} peer of the realm. After participating in the Siege of Calais in 1347, the king honoured Lancaster by including him as a founding knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. A few years later, in 1351, Edward bestowed an even greater honour on Lancaster when he created him Duke of Lancaster. The title of duke was of relatively new origin in England; <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> ducal title existed previously.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Mike Marshall won the award, {{becoming}} the first relief pitcher to win the award. In 1992, Dennis Eckersley was the first modern closer (first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth-inning situations) to win the award, and since then <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> relief pitcher has won the award, Éric Gagné in 2003 (also a closer). A total of nine relief pitchers have won the Cy Young Award across both leagues.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC gene mutation is present in <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> breed – the Flat-coated Retriever.|$|E

The percentage of black children in Omaha who live in poverty rank ranks number one in the United States, with nearly six of 10 black kids living below the poverty line. <b>Only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> metropolitan area in the U.S., Minneapolis, has a wider economic disparity between blacks and whites.|$|E
5|$|Taxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson {{classified}} the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in {{the genus}} Parascaphirhynchus and the family Acipenseridae, which includes all sturgeon worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi), which may soon become extinct. These three species belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which has <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> genus, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, represented by three species found in west-central Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{shooting}} {{took place}} at the Kauhajoki School of Hospitality, owned by the Seinäjoki Municipal Federation of Education. The facilities and campus were shared between the Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences and the Seinäjoki Vocational Education Centre – Sedu. Saari was a second-year student in a Bachelor of Hospitality Management degree programme. The incident was the second school shooting {{in less than a year}} in Finland, the other being the Jokela school shooting in November 2007, in which nine people including the gunman died. Before that, <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> school shooting had taken place in the country's history, in Rauma in 1989, leaving two people dead.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt {{had been}} an {{assistant}} marshal when he and policeman James Masterson, {{along with a few}} other citizens, fired their pistols at several cowboys who were fleeing town after shooting up a theater. A member of the group, George Hoyt (sometimes spelled Hoy), was shot in the arm and died of his wound a month later. Wyatt always claimed to have been the one to shoot Hoyt, although it could have been anyone among the lawmen. Wyatt had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed lawman, but prior to the gunfight in October 1881, he had been involved in <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> shooting, in Dodge City, Kansas during the summer of 1878.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players available to them, they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Queensland at 17 against Victoria in December 1933, having never previously attended a first-class match as a spectator. He conceded only six byes {{and took a}} catch in an innings of 542 in a tidy performance, and made 17 and three in an innings defeat, but was dropped after the match. Queensland officials had ruled {{that it was not}} advisable to take such a young player on away trips to Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Tallon reclaimed his position when Queensland returned for their home games and from then on was the first-choice wicket-keeper for the state. He played in <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>other</b> first-class match for the 193334 season, scoring 13 and taking a catch and a stumping in an eight-wicket win over South Australia.|$|E
