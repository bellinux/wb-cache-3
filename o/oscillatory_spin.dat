The interplay between the spin Nernst effect and the seebeck coefficient is investigated for a wide range of the Rashba SOI. When no peaks appeared in the seebeck coefficient, an <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin</b> Nernst effect still occurs. In addition, the disorder effect on the spin Nernst effect is also studied. We find that the spin Nernst effect can be enhanced up to threefold by disorder.

40|$|We {{explore the}} phases {{exhibited}} by an interacting quantum spin Hall edge {{state in the}} presence of finite chemical potential (applied gate voltage) and spin imbalance (applied magnetic field). We find that the helical nature of the edge state gives rise to orders that are expected to be absent in non-chiral one-dimensional electronic systems. For repulsive interactions, the ordered state has an <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin</b> texture whose ordering wavevector is controlled by the chemical potential. We analyze the manner in which a magnetic impurity provides signatures of such oscillations. We find that finite spin imbalance favors a finite current carrying groundstate that is not condensed in the absence of interactions and is superconducting for attractive interactions.

This Comment shows that Bergsten and co-authors incorrectly identified AAS effect {{as a source of}} resistance oscillations in magnetic field, that spin relaxation in their experimental setting is strong enough to destroy <b>oscillatory</b> effects of <b>spin</b> origin, and that the oscillations are caused by changes in carrier density and the Fermi energy by gate, and are unrelated to spin.

40|$|The present paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} spin recovery of an aircraft as a nonlinear inverse dynamics problem of determining the control inputs {{that need to be}} applied to transfer the aircraft from a spin state to a level trim flight condition. A stable, oscillatory, flat, left spin state is first identified from a standard bifurcation analysis of the aircraft model considered, and this is chosen as the starting point for all recovery attempts. Three different symmetric, level-flight trim states, representative of high, moderate, and low-angle-of-attack trims for the chosen aircraft model, are computed by using an extended-bifarcation-analysis procedure. A standard form of the nonlinear dynamic inversion algorithm is implemented to recover the aircraft from the <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin</b> state to each of the selected level trims. The required control inputs in each case, obtained by solving the inverse problem, are compared against each other and with the standard recovery procedure for a modern, low-aspect-ratio, fuselage heavy configuration. The spin recovery procedure is seen to be restricted because of limitations in control surface deflections and rates and because of loss of control effectiveness at high angles of attack. In particular, these restrictions adversely affect attempts at recovery directly from high-angle-of-attack oscillatory spins to low-angle-of-attack trims using only aerodynamic controls. Further, two different control strategies are examined in an effort to overcome difficulties in spin recovery because of these restrictions. The first strategy uses an indirect, two-step recovery procedure in which the airplane is first recovered to a high- or moderate-angle-of-attack level-flight trim condition, followed by a second step where the airplane is then transitioned to the desired low-angle-of-attack trim. The second strategy involves the use of thrust-vectoring controls in addition to the standard aerodynamic control surfaces to directly recover the aircraft from high-angle-of-attack <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin</b> to a low-angle-of-attack level-flight trim state. Our studies reveal that both strategies are successful, highlighting the importance of effective thrust management in conjunction with suitable use of all of the aerodynamic control surfaces for spin recovery strategies...|$|E

The spin polarization enhancement is caused by squeezing of the electron momentum distribution {{in the direction of}} drift.

40|$|A large-angle {{simulation}} {{model for the}} F- 18 C/D has been recently validated and reported. 1 - 11 Utilizing this model, various methods of suppressing falling leaf motions were evaluated. The results indicated that falling leaf motions were highly susceptible to damping applied to the wind roll axis. The difficulty of implementing such a scheme is that the required states are not always measured, or measured accurately. Another suppression strategy, which performed at nearly the same level, involved applying a damping moment directly against the instantaneous angular momentum vector of the aircraft. The advantage of this system is that it requires information which is available and accurately measured on most fighter aircraft.

In Fe/MgO/GaAs structures, the ultrathin MgO interlayer at the interface causes an unexpected sign reversal in spin dependent reflection, despite being a nonmagnetic insulator.

40|$|Strongly {{imbalanced}} {{mixtures of}} ultracold atoms open new possibilities for exploring impurity physics. Recent studies of impurities interacting with a single-component, degenerate gas provided {{new insights into}} the physics of Bose and Fermi polarons. Yet, measuring the polaron dressing cloud that is the ultimate building block of polarons remained a major challenge. Here we show that the Ramsey interferometry of bath atoms provide a way to directly probe the polaron-cloud formation dynamics. As an example, we demonstrate that an impurity atom immersed in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate provides a unique platform to study magnetic polaron dynamics, where Ramsey interference of bath atoms enables a direct measurement of spin-wave excitations generated in the environment. This allows us to study the formation of magnetic polarons in real time and reveal an interplay of few- and many-body physics that is signified by single- and multi-frequency <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin</b> dynamics corresponding to the formation of many-body bound states.

40|$|Persistent, <b>oscillatory</b> {{charge and}} <b>spin</b> {{currents}} are {{shown to be}} driven by a two-component terahertz laser pulse in a one-dimensional mesoscopic ring with Rashba-Dresselhaus spin orbit interactions (SOI) linear in the electron momentum. The characteristic interference effects result from the opposite precession directions imposed on the electron spin by the two SOI couplings. The time dependence of the currents is obtained by solving numerically the equation of motion for the density operator, which is later employed in calculating statistical averages of quantum operators on few electron eigenstates. The parameterization of the problem is done in terms of the SOI coupling constants and of the phase difference between the two laser components. Our results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillations is controlled by the relative strength of the two SOI's, while their frequency is determined by the difference between the excitation energies of the electron states. Furthermore, the oscillations of the spin current acquire a beating pattern of higher frequency that we associate with the nutation of the electron spin between the quantization axes of the two SOI couplings. This phenomenon disappears at equal SOI strengths, whereby the opposite precessions occur with the same probability. Comment: 10 pages 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{transfer}} matrix approach that combines the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) formalism and self-consistent {{solutions to the}} Bogolibuov-de Gennes (BdG) equations {{and use it to}} study the tunneling conductance and spin transport in ferromagnet (F) -superconductor (S) trilayers (F_ 1 F_ 2 S) as functions of bias voltage. The self-consistency ensures that the spin and charge conservation laws are properly satisfied. We consider forward and angularly averaged conductances over a broad range of the strength of the exchange fields and F thicknesses, as the relative in-plane magnetization angle, ϕ, between the two ferromagnets varies. The ϕ-dependence of the self-consistent conductance curves in the trilayers can differ substantially from that obtained via a non-self-consistent approach. The zero bias forward conductance peak exhibits, as ϕ varies, resonance effects intricately associated with particular combinations of the geometrical and material parameters. We find, when the magnetizations are non-collinear, signatures of the anomalous Andreev reflections in the subgap regions of the angularly averaged conductances. When F_ 1 is half-metallic, the angularly averaged subgap conductance chiefly arises from anomalous Andreev reflection. The in-plane components of the spin current are strongly bias dependent, while the out-of-plane spin current component is only weakly dependent upon voltage. The components of the spin current aligned with the local exchange field of one of the F layers are conserved in that layer and in the S region, while they oscillate in the other layer. We compute the spin transfer torques, in connection with the <b>oscillatory</b> behavior of <b>spin</b> currents, and verify that the spin continuity equation is strictly obeyed in our method.

Model spin tests were conducted with and without simulated engine rotation. Tests without simulated engine rotation indicated two types of spins: one, a slightly oscillatory flat spin; and the other, a violently <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin.</b> Tests with simulated engine rotation indicated that spins to the left were fast rotating and steep and those to the right were slow rotating and flat. The optimum technique for recovery is reversal of the rudder to against the spin and simultaneous movement of the ailerons to full with the spin followed by movement of the elevators to neutral after the spin rotation ceases. Tumbling tests made on the model indicated that although the Ryan X- 13 airplane will not tumble in the ordinary sense (end-over-end pitching motion), it may instead tend to enter a wild gyrating'motion. Tests made to simulate power failure in hovering flight by dropping the model indicated that the model entered {{what appeared to be}} a right spin. An attempt should be made to stop this motion immediately by moving the rudder to oppose the rotation (left pedal), moving the ailerons to with the spin (stick right), and moving the stick forward after the spin rotation ceases to obtain flying speed for pullout.

Starting from the Keldysh formalism, we develop the spin-charge dynamic equation at finite temperature in the presence of inelastic scattering which provide a new approach to describe the spin relaxation from the weak to the strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) regime. In the weak SOC regime, our theory shows that when the system is near the SU(2) symmetry point, because the spin relaxation due to DP mechanism is suppressed dramatically, the spin relaxation is dominated by the Elliott-Yafet (EY) mechanism in a wide temperature regime. The non-monotonic temperature dependence of enhanced-lifetime of spin helix mode is due to the competition between the DP and EY mechanisms.

40|$|DESIGN of {{maneuvers}} for carefree {{access of}} an aircraft to its complete flight envelope including poststall regimes is useful {{not only from}} a combat strategy point of view, but also for devising recovery strategies from an accident scenario. Maneuvers for an aircraft can be efficiently designed if a priori knowledge of its maneuverability characteristics is available to the control designers. Different types of agility metrics that characterize aircraft maneuvering capabilities have been proposed in literature based on different criteria [1, 2]. A recent approach to define maneuverability characteristics is based on computing “attainable equilibrium sets,” as suggested in [3] and [4]. This approach involves computing a two dimensional (2 -D) section of attainable equilibrium sets of a particular maneuver using an inverse trimming formulation. Construction of maneuvers based on attainable equilibrium sets involves accessing desired aircraft states in the attainable equilibrium set from a normal flying condition, such as a level flight trim condition. Computing an attainable equilibrium set for a given aircraft model and developing control algorithms to switch aircraft states between different operating points lying within the accessible region defined by attainable equilibrium sets are thus essential ingredients of aircraft maneuver design. For aircraft models, which are inherently nonlinear due to nonlinear aerodynamics in the poststall regimes, and because of various couplings, use of nonlinear control design techniques based on dynamic inversion (DI) or sliding-mode control (SMC) have been proposed for control prototyping to design maneuvers [3, 5 – 7]. Using bifurcation theory and continuation methods, Raghavendra et al. [5] computed spin solutions for the F 18 /high-alpha research vehicle (HARV) model, and demonstrated use of the DI controller to recover the aircraft from a flat <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin</b> motion.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to determine the}} molecular and structural changes that occur in swelled coal as a result of oxidation and moisture los both in the presence and absence of light using our newly developed EPR spin probe method. The proposed study will make it possible to deduce the molecular accessibility distribution swelled, {ital oxidized} APCS coal for each rank as a function of (1) size (up to 6 nm) and shape, (2) the relative acidic/basic reactive site distributions, and (3) the role of hydrogen bonding as a function of swelling solvents. The advantage of the EPR method is that it permits molecules of selected shape, size and chemical reactivity to be used as probes of molecular accessible regions of swelled coal. From such data an optimum catalyst can be designed to convert oxidized coal into a more convenient form and methods can be devised to lessen the detrimental weathering process. This quarter we have continued to examine the effect of exposure of light before alkylation versus after O-alkylation of the coal structure. The variation in uptake of spin probe VII (amine group) is depicted in figure 1 for Wyodak-Anderson. Before O-alkylation, a significant decrease occurred in the uptake of VII with increasing exposure to ambient light. This suggests that partial break-up of the hydrogen bond network occurs, making it possible to wash out more of the spin probes. This effect was eliminated if the coal was O-alkylated after exposure to sunlight (Figure 2). The removal of the source of hydrogen bonding is responsible for the lack of spin probe up-take variation with time of exposure to light. Further experiments have shown that the data in Figures 1 and 2 is reproducible with a deviation of less than {+-} 10 %.

30|$|Spin {{dynamics}} {{and the related}} physics in semiconductors have drawn much attention in the past years because of its importance to realize novel spin-electronic devices [1]. In recent years, electron spin relaxation in many types of materials, especially in low dimensional III-V group semiconductor heterostructures, has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally [1]. The relevant spin relaxation mechanisms, such as the Elliott-Yafet, Bir-Aranov-Pikus (BAP), and D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) mechanisms as well as hyperfine interactions, have been well established to describe spin relaxation and dephasing dynamics. However, {{the relative importance of}} these mechanisms strongly depends on material design and temperature as well as carrier concentration and so on. Previous investigations in literature show that the BAP mechanism dominates the spin relaxation at low temperatures for bulk GaAs [2, 3] and GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells (QWs) [4, 5], whereas DP mechanism dominates spin relaxation in other regimes. However, recent reexaminations using the microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach [6 – 9] have revealed that the BAP mechanism is much less important than DP mechanism for intrinsic III-V group semiconductors, even at low temperatures. The DP mechanism resulting from spin-orbit coupling in systems lacking inversion symmetry, such as zinc-blende structure or asymmetric confining potentials in QWs, has a spin relaxation rate inversely related to the momentum scattering rate [9]. Electron spin relaxation in GaAs QWs has been experimentally studied through temperature [10, 11] and QW width dependence [10 – 12], and DP mechanism has been revealed to dominate spin relaxation in intrinsic QWs at high temperatures [10]. The <b>oscillatory</b> <b>spin</b> dynamics study for two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) at low temperatures also demonstrated the dominance of DP mechanism in the weak momentum scattering regime [13]. The observed enhancement of spin relaxation time resulting from electron-electron scattering in n-doped GaAs/AlGaAs QW agrees with DP mechanism governed by electron-electron scattering as well [14 – 17]. The experimental observation of electron spin relaxation time maximum for temperature-dependent study in a high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs 2 DEG has also revealed the importance of electron-electron Coulomb scattering [18].|$|E
