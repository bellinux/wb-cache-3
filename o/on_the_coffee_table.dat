2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{of these}} {{material}} objects carries {{along with its}} stories or memories the ability for family members to experience simultaneity in the home. [...] "…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times {{of our lives and}} our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present." [...] The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting on the counter, and the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item. [...] "The artifacts that family members make, use, or display can be an unseen backdrop to the duties and demands of family life. Alternatively, they might be carefully crafted statements about the values and expectations of family tradition bearers." [...] The candy bowl <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> or the silver tea service set out in the dining room speak of an elegance of hospitality which is customary in this family.|$|E

5000|$|On 2015, {{director}} Dennis Dugan revealed he {{was hired}} for the movie, his first theatrical release {{after a decade of}} television directing, once in his audition for Universal, he jumped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> executives' <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> and said [...] "You're looking at me like I'm fucking nuts, {{and this is what we}} want. We want this kind of chaos." [...] Dugan suggested John Ritter, with whom he had worked in his actor career, for the role of Ben Healy. The studio was initially reluctant, feeling they needed a more famous actor, but eventually relented. For the role of [...] "Big Ben" [...] Healy, Jack Warden first refused the role, and then Dugan offered half his net points. Warden was so touched he accepted the work while not taking Dugan's payments. Amy Yasbeck was cast as Ritter's wife, and both fell in love during production, eventually marrying in 1999. During production, both Ritter and Gilbert Gottfried were allowed to ad lib, making Universal complain at Dugan for shooting too much footage for Gottfried's scenes. The first test screening was disastrous, with 70 percent of the audience walking out, verbal complaints from viewers, and a score of only 30. The studio forced two weeks of reshoots, including a retooled ending and the addition of key scenes like the girl's birthday party.|$|R

50|$|Marge is {{the agent}} in the first pair of {{sentences}} because she initiates and carries out the action of fixing, and <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> is <b>the</b> patient in both because it is acted upon in both sentences.

The subject is the agent Marge in the first sentence and <b>the</b> patient <b>The</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> second sentence. The direct object is <b>the</b> patient <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>table</b> in <b>the</b> first sentence, {{and there is no}} direct object in the second sentence. The situation is similar with the ergative verb sunk/sink in the second pair of sentences. The noun phrase the ship is the patient in both sentences, although it is the object in the first of the two and the subject in the second.|$|R
