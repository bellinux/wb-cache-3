It helped at establishing correlations between content of <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> and agro-morphological characteristics. For this purpose the quantitative variability of five <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> namely: alliin, isoalliin, glutamyl allyl cysteine (GluAlCs), isoglutamyl allyl cysteine (isoGlu- AlCs) and allicin is studied. The diversity of the accessions for number of leaves per plant, the pseudostem length, dry weight of bulb, weight of one clove, weight of one bulb, bulb diameter, number of cloves in one bulb, the yield and number of days to dormancy release, is assessed. Particular correlations related to the yield and to the <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> were demonstrated. Genetic diversity was assessed between and within accessions using statistical analyses including coefficients of variation, one way analysis of variance, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA). Significant agro-morphological traits and organo-sulphur contents variations were found between accessions, except {{for the number of}} days for dormancy release (DDR). There is no correlation between total measured <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> and any of the agro-morphological characteristics. The yield is highly influenced by the following characteristics: weight of the clove, the weight and the diameter of the bulb, the number of leaves per plant and the stem length. Total variance was well described by the first three PCA axes which represent 80. 57 % of the variance. The PCA and HCA distinguished two major groups of garlic. Clustering does not correspond to the geographical origin but it distinguishes clearly between coloured and light coloured accessions...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of elemental sulphur and sulphur bound in inorganic and organic compounds was investigated for three surface {{samples of the}} oil-source rock from the Upper Jurassic strata in the Dinarides. Concentrations of elemental sulphur are very low and the concentrations of sulphur bound in pyrite and sulphates are relatively low. On the other hand, organically-bound sulphur in both kerogens and bitumens is rather high, representing almost {{a tenth of the}} bitumens and the kerogens by weight. Among the <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in bitumens, analyzed by GC-MS, alkylthiophenes, alkylbithiophenes, alkylthiolanes, alkylbenzothiophenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes were identified. Among the pyrolysis products of kerogens alkylthiophenes, alkenylthiophenes and benzothiophenes were identified. Based on similar sulphur distribution and the same <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> identified in the bitumens and kerogen pyrolysates, samples are thought to be geochemically related. The extremely high concentrations of organic matter and of organically-bound sulphur indicate that the depositional environment of the Upper Jurassic strata in the Dinarides was most probably anoxic and iron lean...|$|R
40|$|<b>Organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are often}} {{abundant}} in sediments and crude oils deposited under anoxic conditions, especially in evaporitic environments. The latter are, indeed, favourable {{for the growth}} of microorganisms (e. g. sulphate reducers, photosyn-thetic sulphur bacteria) which are implied in the formation of reduced inorganic sulphur species uch as hydrogen sulphide, elemental sulphur or related polysulphides. These species are able to react with decaying biological organic matter to form organo-sulphur components of low molecular weight and, to a much greater extent, macromolecules build-up of low molecular weight functionalized sub-units cross-linked with sulphur or polysulphide bridges.

40|$|Sulphur is a {{significant}} component of the organic matter in recent and ancient sediments and in petroleums, yet the precise nature of its association and incorporation is poorly understood. Various sulphur-containing compounds have been recognized in petroleums, but {{little is known about}} their origins and mode of generation during sediment burial, and for only a few <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> with > 15 carbon atoms have the structures been determined. Here we identify one of the alkyl thiophenes which occur widely in both recent and ancient deep-sea sediments as 3 -methyl- 2 -(3, 7, 11 -trimethyldodecyl) -thiophene, occurring as a limited number of the possible stereoisomers. This compound is presumed to originate from the incorporation of sulphur into chlorophyll-derived phytol, or archaebacterial phytenes or their diagenetic products. Its recognition suggests a novel diagenetic pathway for acyclic isoprenoids involving the introduction of sulphur into specific lipid moieties. Similar, but intermolecular, sulphur incorporation might give rise to sulphurlinked macromolecular materials and thereby contribute significantly to the formation of kerogens...|$|R
40|$|Garlic (Allium sativum L.) {{and related}} {{species of the}} Alliaceae family {{are known for their}} cancer-protecting and anti {{atherosclerotic}} potential. The bioactivity of these plants is related to <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> mainly alliin. In the present investigation, an alliin-specific biosensor exploiting immobilised alliinase (EC 4. 4. 1. 4) has been developed. Enzymatically formed ammonia was detected by a potentiometric sensor based on an ammonia electrode or a pH-sensitive electrolyte/insulator/semiconductor (EIS) layer structure made of Al/p-Si/SiO 2 /Si 3 N 4. It could be demonstrated with both methods that this biosensoric approach yielded results comparable to sensitivities obtained by HPLC. Alliin concentrations down to 6 x 10 (- 6) M could be quantified. The EIS biosensor showed also sensitivity to further cysteine sulphoxides, like methiin, ethiin and propiin, which are common for wild Allium species. Besides the analysis of garlic and garlic-containing preparations, like herbal remedies, this biosensor can be additionally used for breeding research and screening purposes of potential medicinal plants.

40|$|Immature {{organic matter}} in {{lacustrine}} source rocks from the Jianghan Basin, eastern China, was studied for distributions and stable carbon isotopic compositions (13 C) of hydrocarbon biomarkers. All of the bitumens contain isorenieratane (13 C ca. − 17) indicating {{the presence of}} Chlorobiaceae, and thus periods of euxinic conditions extended into the photic zone. Aliphatic hydrocarbon fractions are dominated by pristane and phytane and contain relatively low amounts of 4 - and 4 -methylsteranes (C 30, 13 C ca. − 16) believed to originate from 4 -methylsterols in dinoflagellates. 13 C values of gammacerane (ca. − 24) and C 30 17, 21 (H) -hopane (ca. − 23) are consistent with an origin from bacterivorous ciliates that fed on Chlorobiaceae. The bitumens contain low relative amounts of <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> One rock contains C 37 and C 38 n-alkanes (13 C ca. − 36) derived from alkadienes and alkenones of prymnesiophytes. The distributions of hydrocarbon biomarkers suggest that they were initially sulphurised during early diagenesis and later released during early thermal maturation...|$|R
40|$|Extending the {{collection}} of garlic (Allium sativum L.) accessions is an important means that is available for broadening the genetic variability of this cultivated plant, with regard to yield, quality, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic traits; {{it is also an}} important means for restoring fertility and flowering. In the framework of the EU project Garlic and Health, 120 garlic accessions were collected in Central Asia - the main centre of garlic diversity. Plants were documented and thereafter maintained in field collections in both Israel and The Netherlands. The collection was evaluated for biological and economic traits. Garlic clones vary in most vegetative characteristics (leaf number, bulb size and structure), as well as in floral scape elongation and inflorescence development. A clear distinction was made between incomplete bolting and bolting populations; most of the accessions in the latter populations produced flowers with fertile pollen and receptive stigma. Wide variations were recorded with regard to differentiation of topsets, their size, number and rapidity of development. Furthermore, significant variation in <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (alliin, isoalliin, allicin and related dipeptides) was found within garlic collections and between plants grown under differing environmental conditions. Genetic fingerprinting by means of AFLP markers revealed three distinct groups within this collection, differing also in flowering ability and organo-S content...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} benefits of using plant derived tools in fighting against plant bacteria and fungi attack, is their environmentally safety, much higher compared to synthetic products, simultaneously with offering important therapeutic benefits. Garlic has an increasing role on unconventional phytopathogens fight, especially within integrated pest management systems. Even its preventive and curative effects on both human and vegetables is well known from ancient times, the scientific basis of using garlic as nutraceutic with valuable action on human health and/or alternative agent against plant pathogens, was scientifically settled only in last decades. The present work attempts to emphasize a picture concerning the garlic aliin component, which confer the plant antibacterial and antifungicide properties. Our study strengthens the previous assessments concerning synergistically action of main <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> from Allium sativum L. resulting in antifungicide and antibacterial effects. The intensity and efficacy of those effects depends at large extent on garlic extracts nature and their processing technology. Among updated actions of garlic different extracts we mention: antibacterial properties against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, fight against yeast-like fungi and other fungi varieties, in control of particular plant diseases, control of warms, aphids, Colorado beetles, mosquitoes. The present available knowledge concerning the aliin action against a large spectrum of bacteria, fungi, particular plant diseases, and pests will need a wider approach that involves the development of molecular biology tools, in order to identify the complex mechanisms of interaction between aliin and plant pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Supported and {{unsupported}} molybdate {{films have}} served as the backbone as of the hydrodesulphurisation catalysts used for removing <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> from light petroleum feedstocks. The catalyst material starts as one or more molybdenum (VI) oxide(s), but the oxidation state reduces to Mo(IV) during sulphidation. Despite the extensive analytical studies carried out on these systems over the past 25 years, the fundamental questions still remain [...] {{what is the nature}} of the catalytic site on the molybdate hydrodesulphurisation catalyst, and is the site identical on promoted and unpromoted catalysts?;A new approach to catalyst film preparation was developed using thin supported molybdate films. The films could be easily prepared and their compositions could be easily changed, and they could be readily studied using modern surface analytical equipment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was chosen as the primary tool to characterise the molybdate films, while laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) was used to complement the information gained from XPS.;The surfaces of supported molybdenum oxide thin films were characterised following calcination, reduction, and sulphidation treatments. Special peak broadening of Mo(VI) oxide films have been observed on electrically conducting thin films deposited on planar alumina and graphite substrates. This peak broadening decreases as the film thickness increases. This phenomenon may be influenced either by aggregate sizes and the local electronic environment of the molybdate clusters, or it may be indicative of multiple, unresolved Mo(VI) species. Thermal reduction of supported MoOdollar 3 dollar in Hdollar 2,dollar Ndollar 2,dollar or in vacuo at 500 dollar∘dollarC for extended periods yields a mixture of MoOdollar 2 dollar and higher Mo(3 d) oxidation states, including a non-octahedral Mo(VI) species. The diversity of reduction products observed under these conditions can be adequately explained using crystallographic shear mechanisms. Sulphidation of thin film molybdenum oxides yields a variety of Mo(3 d) species including oxide and sulphide components. Two sulphide species are observed on thin dollar(dollar 100 nm) yield only MoSdollar 2. dollar The reduced sulphide species may be a thiomolybdate or polysulphide component which forms at coordinatively unsaturated positions on the MoSdollar 2 dollar slabs such as corner and edge sites.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the TENORM samples for their initial activity concentrations, the chemical types of bounding the contained natural radionuclides occur, the resulting radon emanation coefficients and finally the transfer factors, leads to the following statements: • Phosphate industry: 1. In dependence from the geological origin, the used raw materials and the produced fertiliser can contain enhanced initial activity concentrations, the latter mainly uranium 2. From the raw materials 226 Ra can be easily mobilised, in case of the phosphogypsum waste and produced fertiliser attention must be paid for 238 U and 210 Pb 3. Highly contaminated raw materials can result in enhanced radon emanation rates, also the fertiliser can contribute to some radon enhancement 4. There is a well developed transfer factor for 226 Ra from all materials involved into plants • Aluminium industry: 1. In dependence from the geological origin, the used raw materials can contain enhanced initial activity concentrations 2. 226 Ra is the relevant radionuclide and can be easily mobilised from the raw materials and the waste as well 3. Highly contaminated raw materials can result in strongly enhanced radon emanation rates, 4. Transfer factors are established for 226 Ra into water from both types of bauxites • Refractory industry: 1. Enhanced initial activity concentrations occur in the additive zircon sand and the fused zirconia mullite products 2. 226 Ra is the relevant radionuclide being present in all materials but not really leachable, 210 Pb can be easily mobilised from the filter dust waste in some extent 3. The radon emanation rates are generally low 4. 228 Th is transferable into water and plants • Crude oil exploitation: 1. Enhanced initial activity concentrations especially of 210 Pb occur in the sludge and scale wastes 2. 210 Pb is the relevant radionuclide being present in all materials and is mostly bound to <b>organo-sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> relatively few amounts are easily mobilisable 3. The sludge can cause really high radon emanation rates 4. The sludge releases both radium isotopes and 228 Th as well for water • Hard coal extraction: 1. Enhanced initial activity concentrations of 226 Ra can occur close to the mining water discharge point and along the riverbanks 2. 226 Ra is the relevant radionuclide being enhanced present in all materials, but is not mobilisable, 228 Th is found under easily available, reducible and oxidisable conditions • Thorium compounds industry: 1. Strongly enhanced initial activity concentrations of 228 Ra and 228 Th can occur in soils being influenced by former thorium processing 2. 228 Ra and 228 Th are proven to be available especially for plants 3. The resulting transfer factors for the pathway “solid-plant” concern all radionuclides • Uranium industry: 1. Strongly enhanced initial activity concentrations occur in the uranium ores and the tailing wastes, unwanted by-products can be contaminated partly 2. All uranium radionuclides are not preferably bound in the raw materials, especially 226 Ra and 210 Pb can be easily leached from the tailings, the unwanted by-products dead rocks mainly contain the uranium radionuclides bound to sulphides, sediments show uranium radionuclides being bound to oxides, the most of them is strongly fixed 3. The uranium ores and tailing wastes cause really high radon emanation rates, in case of dead rocks they are lower, contaminated sediments can show enhanced emanation rates 4. Important transfer factors are set from tailings into water for 226 Ra and into plants for uranium and lead, from sediments 226 Ra can be transferred into plants • Investigation procedure: 1. The developed investigation procedure as presented in this study to determine simultaneously many radionuclides in extraction liquids by gamma-spectrometry is more applicable and reliable for highly contaminated samples 2. The influence of different grain sizes on the radionuclides’ mobilisation potential is rather low 3. Uranium oxides can not be cracked by scientific extraction procedures 4. Some limitation of the investigation procedure seems to be given by the low amounts of starting material for the extraction procedures as proposed in their instructions and the resulting small extraction liquid volumes For all those reasons, TENORM must be controlled not only for their initial activity concentrations, radon releases and the resulting radiological hazard, but for their radionuclide mobilisation potential and environmental influences, too...|$|R
