5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> bright stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the}} more massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Death Valley Pupfish swam to the area from the Colorado River via a long-since dried-up system of rivers and lakes (see Lake Manly). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonball Marsh. Death Valley is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> and driest places in North America, yet {{it is home to}} over 1,000 species of plants; 23 of which, including the very rare Rock Lady (Holmgrenanthe petrophila), are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Located near Alpha is R Muscae, a Classical Cepheid {{variable}} {{ranging from}} apparent magnitude 5.93 to 6.73 over 7.5days. It is a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F7Ib and G2Ib, located around 2037light-years away. S Muscae is likewise a Classical Cepheid, a yellow-white supergiant ranging between spectral types F6Ib and G0Ib and magnitudes 5.89 to 6.49 {{over a period}} of 9.66days. A luminous star around 5.9times as massive as the Sun, it is a binary star with a blue-white main sequence star companion likely to be of spectral type B3V to B5V with a mass of just over 5solar masses, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> and brightest companions of a Cepheid known. The two stars orbit each other every 505days.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|In July 1863, Sabina had {{delivered}} the libretto {{for a second}} opera, a light comedy entitled The Bartered Bride, which Smetana composed during the next three years. Because {{of the success of}} The Brandenburgers, the management of the Provisional Theatre readily agreed to stage the new opera, which was premiered on 30May 1866 in its original two-act version with spoken dialogue. The opera went through several revisions and restructures before reaching the definitive three-act form that in due course established Smetana's international reputation. The opera's first performance was a failure; it was held on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> evenings of the year, {{on the eve of the}} Austro-Prussian War, with Bohemia under imminent threat of invasion by Prussian troops. Unsurprisingly the occasion was poorly attended, and receipts failed to cover costs. When presented at the Provisional Theatre in its final form, in September 1870, it was a tremendous public success.|$|E
5|$|The Wonder World Tour was commercially {{successful}} and represented {{stability in the}} touring industry, despite the financial recession. In North America, the tour sold out twenty-nine out of forty-five concert dates and grossed over US $45.2 million. The tour was able to remain as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> tours in the United States during its expansion. The Wonder World Tour's entire, ten-date European leg sold out in only ten minutes. In order to meet demand, an eleventh date was added and scheduled for December 29, 2009. In December 2009, the tour ranked atop Billboards Hot Tours, based on the tour's European performances. For the month, box office grossed US $21.9 million for eleven shows in four markets. The five concerts held at The O2 Arena in London produced ticket sales that topped $11 million (£6.8 million). On December 19, 2009, with an audience of 16,196, Cyrus broke {{the record for the}} largest attendance at The O2 Arena; a record that surpassed the previously tied records by Beyoncé's I Am... Tour (2009–10), Bon Jovi's Lost Highway Tour (2007–08), and Coldplay's Viva la Vida Tour (2008–10). In total, the tour grossed over $67.1 million, $15 million which were earned by Cyrus.|$|E

25|$|Duffy {{indicates}} that the screenplay was inspired by personal experience, while living in Los Angeles. Initially regarded as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> scripts in Hollywood, the movie had a troubled production and was finally given a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week due to the Columbine High School massacre. It was met with poor critical reviews; however, the film ultimately grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales and developed a large cult following. The movie {{was followed by a}} 2009 sequel, , and a third film is currently in development.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} major {{meteorological}} droughts of recent times occurred {{in the year of}} 1976, where a dry 1975 winter was followed by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> and driest summers since records began. The drought effectively began in October 1975, but with low temperatures and therefore low evaporation rates during the winter, the below average rainfall did not present an immediate problem. As the dry winter ended and was followed by the hot and particularly dry summer of 1976, the drought became one {{of the most}} famous in United Kingdom history.|$|E
25|$|Bill Edrich {{did some}} {{service as a}} fastish bowler with a {{slinging}} action while Norman Yardley's all-round skill won him a place in all the Tests. With his deceptively plain-looking medium-pace he actually took Bradman's wicket in three successive Test innings, and without any help from a fielder at that. But our out-cricket was simply not good enough. Wright was the best bowler (23 at 44 runs apiece), Bedser was still an enthusiastic and tireless learner (15 at 54), but Bill Voce aged 37, in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> Australian summers, could not recapture the old magical fire.|$|E

25|$|But {{the most}} troubled era for the tram service in Trondheim {{was in the}} 1980s, when {{the future of the}} tram was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> {{political}} issues in Trondheim, resulting in several mayors having to leave office. The debate {{about the future of the}} trams had been going on through the late 1970s, in general with the left side of the city council supporting the tram while the right side wanted to close it down. After the city council election in 1979 the Progress Party got its first representative in the city council, Hildur Karstensen, who was a tram driver for TT. Though the Conservative mayor, Axel Buch, was expected to be re-elected, Kristiansen chose to support the Labour candidate Olav Gjærevoll, in the hope that a socialist majority would ensure the future of the trams, and thus making Gjærevoll mayor.|$|E
25|$|One of the most-studied exoplanets in {{the night}} sky is TrES-1b, in orbit around the star GSC 02652-01324. Detected from a transit of its parent star, the planet has around 3/4 the mass of Jupiter, yet orbits its parent star in only three days. The transits have been {{reported}} to have anomalies multiple times. Originally thought to be possibly due to the presence of an Earth-like planet, it is now accepted that the irregularities are due to a large starspot. Also discovered by the transit method is WASP-3b, with 1.75 times the mass of Jupiter. At the time of its discovery, it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hottest</b> known exoplanets, in orbit around the F-type main-sequence star WASP-3. Similar to TrES-1b, irregularities in the transits had left open the possibility of a second planet, although this now appears unlikely as well.|$|E
