5|$|There are no <b>outdated</b> {{versions}} in unstable for any release ports.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with various}} love poems, Panait Cerna's {{writings}} also evince his intellectual pursuits. This intellectual characteristic {{earned him a}} dedicated following, but was criticized by many of his peers, who found it artificial and <b>outdated.</b>|$|E
5|$|On March 29, 2010 0verflow {{announced}} that an <b>outdated</b> DLL {{had been released}} with retail versions of the game. A 372 KB replacement was provided via download. The following day another patch was released to bring copies of the game up to version 1.00a.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by critics, who praised its combat, pacing, {{and use of}} the Third Edition rules. However, some reviewers felt that the graphics and engine had become <b>outdated,</b> and could not compete with its contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many {{disclosures}} and exposés dating {{as far back as}} the 18th century. These often lack context, may be <b>outdated</b> for various reasons, or could be outright hoaxes on the part of the author, as in the case of the Taxil hoax.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rolling Stones {{remained}} popular {{through the}} early 1970s, music critics had begun to grow dismissive of the band's output, and record sales failed to meet expectations. By the mid-1970s, after punk rock became influential, many people had begun to view the Rolling Stones as an <b>outdated</b> band.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is <b>outdated.</b> Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player has. In their reviews of the PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance versions, {{they said that the}} gameplay still holds up. They found the demon fusion system to be excellent and fun, and did not think it felt <b>outdated.</b> Kurt Kalata and Cristopher J. Snelgrove of Hardcore Gaming 101 {{appreciated the}} game's lowered difficulty compared to that of the first Shin Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|Finland had {{a limited}} defence budget after its {{independence}} {{and especially in}} the 1930s. Consequently, the Finnish Defence Forces were lacking military materiel in almost all branches. Much of the military's materiel was <b>outdated,</b> and even proved unsuitable for the field during the Winter War. During the Winter War the material situation improved, but it still lagged behind the more modern and well-equipped Red Army.|$|E
5|$|However, {{safety issues}} {{continue}} to be a persistent problem in Indonesian aviation. Several accidents have given Indonesia's air transport system the reputation of the least safe in the world. Indonesian aviation faces numerous challenges, including poorly maintained, <b>outdated,</b> and often overwhelmed infrastructure, the factor of human error, bad weather, haze problems caused by plantation fires, and volcanic ash spewed by numerous area volcanoes that disrupts air transportation.|$|E
5|$|In 1961 the Silver Jubilee Bridge {{replaced}} the <b>outdated</b> Transporter Bridge {{and in recent}} years many of the old heavy chemical factories have closed to be replaced by more modern factories. Much of the land previously polluted by the old dirty chemical processes has been reclaimed, and there have been improvements in the cleanliness and environment of the town.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} was started to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge {{and to allow}} for dedicated local traffic and bridge traffic lanes. The lane configuration changes confused drivers in the area, especially motorists with <b>outdated</b> GPS devices; because of this, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E
5|$|Like most corvettes, Fredericton was {{installed}} with a Type 123A ASDIC detection system. This technology was designed in 1934 for armed trawlers and minesweepers of the Royal Navy. The system was <b>outdated</b> but {{was the best}} system available to the Canadian Navy at the time. Type 123A could detect the distance to underwater sounds but could not determine the depth.|$|E
5|$|Origins was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews upon release. Critics praised the game for remaining faithful to the arcade versions and its additional features, but criticized it for its <b>outdated</b> gameplay and unbalanced rosters. In December 2014, the game was removed from its online platforms after Capcom's licensing contracts with Marvel Comics expired.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a staple of popular culture {{for as long as}} their cousins the dinosaurs, though they are usually not {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly <b>outdated</b> picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{institutional}} {{problems in the}} delivery of pain management include lack of resources for adequate training of physicians, time constraints, failure to refer people for pain management in the clinical setting, inadequate insurance reimbursement for pain management, lack of sufficient stocks of pain medicines in poorer areas, <b>outdated</b> government policies on cancer pain management, and excessively complex or restrictive government and institutional regulations on the prescription, supply, and administration of opioid medications.|$|E
5|$|The Defence Forces set strict {{requirements}} for the vehicles to be produced. There was {{not enough time to}} develop a new model. Although <b>outdated,</b> the best of the available options was the Sisu S-21. Yhteissisu and SAT agreed to transfer Sisu S-21 lorry production to Yhteissisu. The Yhteissisu-produced models were named S-22.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{designed}} as an action-oriented alternative to other Infinity Engine games, with {{less emphasis on}} exploration and story. It uses a real-time adaptation of the Dungeons & Dragons (D) Third Edition ruleset. The Infinity Engine was extensively modified {{to comply with the}} Third Edition, but the team was forced to remove certain rules because of the engine's <b>outdated</b> nature. It was the final game to be developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed to poor reviews. Critics {{found its}} physics modelling unrealistic, and many {{believed that the}} game's graphics and gameplay were <b>outdated,</b> {{particularly in light of}} contemporary simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik. The limited number of missions and large number of glitches were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped that fans would improve the game with the included physics and mission editors.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{barriers to the}} widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, <b>outdated</b> energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.|$|E
5|$|The {{refinery}} {{was large}} and old, featuring <b>outdated</b> construction methods, and these factors {{are believed to have}} contributed to the fire's severity. The origin of the explosion has been narrowed down {{to the center of the}} factory. It was believed to have occurred in a basement beneath storage silos. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The royal commission's third {{report also}} dealt with prison administration. It {{found that the}} prison was {{operating}} under <b>outdated</b> legislation, with little regulation or written guidance, {{and that there was}} incertitude in administration – the positions of sheriff and inspector of prisons were held by one man, James Roe, who lived in Perth, with the prison's superintendent, William George, taking on much of the management responsibility.|$|E
5|$|This {{project will}} {{coincide}} with reconstructing the <b>outdated</b> cloverleaf interchange at Colonel Talbot Road and widening Highway401 {{from four to}} six lanes between Highway4 and Highway402. These projects start in 2017. The MTO is also planning on widening Highway401 from six to eight lanes through part of the London corridor.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{living things}} have been divided into five kingdoms: Monera; Protista; Fungi; Plantae; Animalia. However, many {{scientists}} now consider this five-kingdom system <b>outdated.</b> Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria) and Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Yoshi's Island led to {{a strong}} year for Yoshi as a character. IGN's Thomas added that the {{hand-drawn}} style of Yoshi's Island made the computer-generated Donkey Kong Country appear <b>outdated,</b> though both games sold well, and Rareware included a Yoshi cameo in their sequel, , released that same year. Yoshi's Island graphics and characters were also incorporated into the 1996 Super NES tile puzzle game Tetris Attack.|$|E
5|$|A remaster of the game, also titled Perfect Dark, was {{released}} in 2010 for the Xbox 360 through its Xbox Live Arcade download service, featuring enhanced graphics and an online multiplayer. The remaster was developed by 4J Studios, the same studio that previously handled the Xbox 360 ports of Rare's platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie. The game received generally favorable reviews from gaming publications. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be <b>outdated,</b> but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic. In 2015, the remaster {{was included in the}} Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem <b>outdated</b> and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly falling out of fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1954, Australia {{recognised}} that the English Electric Canberra was becoming <b>outdated</b> and evaluated aircraft {{such as the}} Avro Vulcan and Handley-Page Victor as potential replacements. Political pressure for a Canberra replacement only rose to a head in 1962; at which point more modern types such as the BAC TSR-2, General Dynamics F-111C, and North American A-5 Vigilante had become available. The RAF would have transferred several V-bombers, including Vulcans, for interim use by the RAAF if they had purchased the TSR-2, but the RAAF selected the F-111C.|$|E
5|$|As musical {{films were}} popular with Indonesian audiences, Tiga Dara {{was made in}} that genre. It {{featured}} seven songs by Sjaiful Bachri (who also served as sound editor) {{as well as one}} by Ismail Marzuki and two by Oetjin Noerhasjim. Only Wijaya provided her own vocals; the other actors were dubbed by Sam Saimun, Elly Sri Kudus, Bing Slamet, Djuita, S. Effendy, and Sitti Nurochma. Long-time Perfini cameraman Max Tera handled cinematography for this black-and-white film, using the company's <b>outdated</b> equipment, and Soemardjono was in charge of editing.|$|E
5|$|Coon {{assumed the}} role of {{superintendent}} of shops in 1896. During his tenure at Georgia Tech, he moved the curriculum away from vocational training. Coon emphasized a balance between the shop and the classroom. Coon taught his students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of <b>outdated</b> and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis and problem solving, and mathematics.|$|E
5|$|Criticism {{focused on}} {{particular}} {{aspects of the}} game. Miller considered the inability to save progress a drawback since gamers will {{have to play the}} entire game in one sitting if they wish to complete it. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being <b>outdated</b> in comparison to games on the Mega Drive and Super NES (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time Super Mario Bros. 3 was released in Europe).|$|E
5|$|Dealing with sanitation, Espejo {{observed}} that the hospital (Hospital de la Misericordia) of the city, the monasteries and the places of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council. Finally, he condemned {{the management of the}} hospital by the Bethlehemites. He said their methods were <b>outdated</b> and that they provided poor service. The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.|$|E
5|$|Despite improvements, {{several aspects}} of the {{transport}} sector were still riddled with problems due to <b>outdated</b> infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved to be unable to meet the growing demand of the people. The underdeveloped Soviet road network, in a chain reaction, led to a growing demand for public transport. The nation's merchant fleet {{was one of the}} largest in the world.|$|E
5|$|Far Side Virtual is the thirtieth studio album by the American {{electronic}} musician James Ferraro, {{released on}} October 25, 2011 by the record label Hippos in Tanks. First {{conceived as a}} series of ringtones, the album marked Ferraro's transition from his previous lo-fi recording approach to a sharply produced, electronic aesthetic that deliberately evokes sources such as elevator music, corporate mood music, easy-listening, and <b>outdated</b> computer sound design. The album has been interpreted as engaging with themes such as hyperreality, disposable consumer culture, 1990s retro-futurism, advertising, and musical kitsch.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, Pennsylvania {{provided}} shore bombardment during the Battles of Makin, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Saipan, {{along with the}} Palau Islands Campaign. The ship also participated in the landings on Leyte and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During this time, Pennsylvania {{was present at the}} last battle ever between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait. The ship did not fire any salvos because the Japanese vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond Pennsylvanias <b>outdated</b> fire control but within range of other, radar-directed battleships.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of <b>outdated</b> anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being the Smith Gun. The Smith Gun had what Mackenzie describes as an 'unorthodox origin', {{like many of the}} other weapons produced for use by the Home Guard. Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. The Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured anti-tank weapon.|$|E
