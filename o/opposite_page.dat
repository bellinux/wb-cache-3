Sindy was used to contrast her childish fashion with the sophistication of Alexon's fashion range. Each double page spread showed Sindy in a typical outfit superimposed on a real-life setting. The <b>opposite</b> <b>page</b> showed a real woman dressed in Alexon's clothes above the line 'Dressing up for grown ups'.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} notable {{contemporary}} sets is the award winning The Key to the Kingdom, a semi-transformation deck commissioned by London's V Museum of Childhood and created by Tony Meeuwissen. [...] It won the WH Smith Literary Award for best illustration and The Designers and Art Directory Association of London gold award. [...] This set of cards was created around the theme of nursery rhymes and poems. [...] The cards were sold with a book containing each poem {{and a picture of}} the corresponding card on the <b>opposite</b> <b>page.</b> Additionally, the deck was constructed as a puzzle contest laid out {{in the form of an}} original poem. [...] The poem gave clues to pick certain cards, which then could be decrypted into a secret message. The prize of $10,000 and a golden key was won by Susan Kavanagh of Essex.|$|E
500|$|William Gilpin, in his Observations on the River Wye, and Several Parts of South Wales, etc. Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty; {{made in the}} Summer of the Year 1770, {{published}} in 1782, generated considerable interest in the natural and man-made attractions of South Wales and heralded {{the development of the}} Wye Tour {{as an alternative to the}} Grand Tour. As a consequence, Monnow Bridge and Gatehouse became a popular subject for artists. A late 18th-century watercolour by Michael Angelo Rooker is now in the Monmouth Museum. The noted architectural watercolourist Samuel Prout painted the bridge in a study dated [...] "before 1814", now held at the Yale Center for British Art in Connecticut. In 1795, J. M. W. Turner sketched the bridge and gatehouse during one of his annual summer sketching tours. Henry Gastineau drew the bridge [...] Due to a printing error that confused his drawing of the bridge with one of the tower at Raglan Castle on the <b>opposite</b> <b>page</b> of the printed collection, Gastineau's image often appears with the title Gate and Bridge, Ragland. The watercolourist and etcher John Sell Cotman sketched the bridge in the early 19th century, his drawing showing the overhanging accommodation and guardhouse that were later removed. Joshua Cristall produced a similar pencil sketch in 1803. The artist of the American West Thomas Moran produced an undated pencil drawing of the bridge which is printed in his Field Sketches. A depiction of the bridge in stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe can be seen in the Memorial of the Boer War window in St Mary's Priory Church in Monmouth.|$|E

2500|$|When {{photographic}} curator Maya Benton {{began to}} catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the International Center of Photography, she noticed that, {{in his book}} A Vanished World, Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were {{not supported by the}} material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the <b>opposite</b> <b>page</b> a small boy points with his finger to his eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: [...] "The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935-1938." [...] At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: [...] "The pogromshchiki" [...] (pogrom lynch mob) [...] "are coming. But the iron door was no protection." [...] Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book [...] "almost certainly did not happen".|$|E
