5|$|Although the {{destruction}} <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> is centered upon conservation, {{there are other}} considerations which affect institutions' decisions on the matter.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show human use <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over 1000 tons <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> were exported to Europe yearly. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest consumer <b>of</b> <b>ivory,</b> accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E

50|$|The {{first group}} <b>of</b> <b>ivories</b> was {{excavated}} {{from the site}} of the palace of Shalmaneser III (ruled 859-824 BC) at the Assyrian capital of Nimrud. The palace was rediscovered in 1845 by Austin Henry Layard, on the very first day of his excavations; on the second day, he made the first discovery <b>of</b> <b>ivories.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>ivories</b> {{uncovered by}} Mallowan were divided between Iraq and Britain, where they {{remained at the}} British School of Archaeology in Iraq (later to become the British Institute for the Study of Iraq) until 1987. They were then put in storage at the British Museum until 2011, but were not put on display. Many <b>of</b> the Iraqi-held <b>ivories</b> have been lost or damaged. Following the Iraq War 2003 the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad was looted, and many <b>of</b> the <b>ivories</b> kept there were damaged or stolen. Other ivories that were stored in a bank vault in Baghdad were damaged by water when the building was shelled.|$|R
5|$|Kenya {{has held}} three more ivory burns since 1989. The second was {{just two years}} later in 1991, {{destroying}} 6.8 tons. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki held the country's third event in 2011, destroying another five tons <b>of</b> <b>ivory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Destroying ivory by any {{practical}} {{means is}} difficult. Burning {{is the most}} common method of large-scale destruction <b>of</b> <b>ivory.</b> When Kenya burned 12 tons of it in 1989, it created a major media spectacle and inspired similar actions around the world. More recently, crushing methods have also been used, as well as combinations of crushing and burning.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{opened in}} 1946, Nairobi National Park {{was the first}} {{national}} park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya's conservation and wildlife protection image.|$|E

5|$|There is archeological {{evidence}} that humans {{have attempted to}} replace missing teeth with root form implants for thousands of years. Remains from ancient China (dating 4000 years ago) have carved bamboo pegs, tapped into the bone, to replace lost teeth, and 2000-year-old remains from ancient Egypt have similarly shaped pegs made of precious metals. Some Egyptian mummies {{were found to have}} transplanted human teeth, and in other instances, teeth made <b>of</b> <b>ivory.</b>|$|E
5|$|World title {{competition}} {{first started}} in 1986 and required the use <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> balls. However, this requirement was dropped in 1990. The highest score ever achieved in world competition was 374, by the Frenchman Jean Reverchon in 1992, while {{the highest score in}} competition overall is 427 set by Belgian Walter Bax on March 12, 2006 at a competition held in Deurne, Belgium, beating his own previous record of 425. The {{game is played}} predominantly in western Europe, especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Chopsticks: The Han dynasty {{historian}} and writer Sima Qian (145–86 BC) {{wrote in the}} Records of the Grand Historian that King Zhou of Shang {{was the first to}} make chopsticks out <b>of</b> <b>ivory</b> in the 11th century BC; the most ancient archaeological find of a pair of chopsticks, made of bronze, comes from Shang Tomb 1005 at Houjiazhuang, Anyang, dated roughly 1200 BC. By 600 BC, the use of chopsticks had spread to Yunnan (Dapona in Dali), and Töv Province by the 1st century. The earliest known textual reference to the use of chopsticks comes from the Han Feizi, a philosophical text written by writer and philosopher Han Fei (c. 280–233 BC) in the 3rd century BC.|$|E
50|$|The Nimrud ivories are carved ivory plaques {{and figures}} {{dating from the}} 9th to the 7th centuries BC that were {{excavated}} from the Assyrian city of Nimrud (in modern Ninawa in Iraq) during the 19th and 20th centuries. Many <b>of</b> the <b>ivories</b> {{were taken to the}} United Kingdom and were deposited in (though not owned by) the British Museum. In 2011, the Museum acquired most <b>of</b> the British-held <b>ivories</b> through a donation and purchase and is to put a selection on view. It is intended that the remainder will be returned to Iraq. A significant number <b>of</b> <b>ivories</b> were already held by Iraqi institutions but many have been lost or damaged through war and looting.|$|R

5|$|Jarrell's career {{took him}} to Africa in 1977, where he found {{inspiration}} in the Senufo people <b>of</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast, Mali and Burkina Faso. Upon return to the United States he moved to Georgia and taught at the University of Georgia. In Georgia, he began to use a bricklayer's trowel on his canvases, creating a textured appearance within his already visually active paintings. The figures often seen in his paintings are abstract and inspired by the masks and sculptures of Nigeria. These Nigerian arts have also inspired Jarrell's totem sculptures. Living and working in Cleveland, Jarrell continues to explore the contemporary African American experience through his paintings, sculptures, and prints. His work {{is found in the}} collections of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, High Museum of Art, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the University of Delaware.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 Summer Games was Hinikissia Ndikert's second Olympics. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, age 15, she was her country's flag bearer {{for both}} ceremonies. In her {{competition}} she finished 64th out of 85 {{competitors in the}} 100 metres. For the 2012 Summer Olympics, Ndikert qualified for the 200 metres. She competed on August 6th in the first heat of her event. She ran a time of 26.06 seconds and finished last in her heat of eight athletes. She was 3.51 seconds behind {{the winner of the}} heat, Murielle Ahouré <b>of</b> <b>Ivory</b> Coast. Overall, Ndikert was the second-slowest athlete of any in the heat round. The only athlete she was faster than was Chan Seyha of Cambodia. Ndikert was 2.96 seconds slower than the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-final round, and was therefore eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels {{include two}} sceptres {{originally}} made for Mary of Modena, {{the wife of}} JamesII, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made <b>of</b> <b>ivory.</b> Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband GeorgeVI in 1937. For the coronation of MaryII, the wife and joint sovereign of WilliamIII, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went missing for several decades, only {{to be found in}} 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London.|$|E
