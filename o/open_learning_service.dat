40|$|In the UK, <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> {{has been}} used in {{industrial}} training for at least the last decade. Trainers and <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> practitioners have been concerned {{about the quality of the}} products and services being delivered. The argument put forward in this thesis is that there is ambiguity amongst industrialists over the meanings of `Open Learning' and `Quality in Open Learning'. For clarity, a new definition of <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> is proposed which challenges the traditional learner-centred approach favoured by educationalists. It introduces the concept that there are benefits afforded to the trainer/employer/teacher as well as to the learner. This enables a focussed view of what quality in <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> really means. Having discussed these issues, a new quantitative method of evaluating <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> is proposed. This is based upon an assessment of the degree of compliance with which products meet Parts 1 & 2 of the <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> Code of Practice. The vehicle for these research studies has been a commercial contract commissioned by the Training Agency for the Engineering Industry Training Board (EITB) to examine the quality of <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> products supplied to the engineering industry. A major part of this research has been the application of the evaluation technique to a range of 67 <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> products (in eight subject areas).

40|$|Interests {{on access}} to <b>open</b> <b>learning,</b> some {{tangential}} while others significant, have surfaced as the shared agenda of much {{debate in the}} educational community.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the need to}} clarify {{the meaning of the}} <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> concept. It does so from a curriculum perspective and with a particular focus on curriculum control. The {{reason for this is that}} <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> is said to involve control of curriculum by learners. The study draws on curriculum theory to identify three alternative conceptions of curriculum which are used as alternative ways of considering <b>open</b> <b>learning.</b> Thus,open learning is examined as an element of social theory, as an intended curriculum and as a perceived student learning experience. The analysis is facilitated by the development of a suite of analytical tools, comprising curriculum code theory and the concepts of frame and decision-making space. Students are considered as curriculum decision-makers in order to investigate their latitude for curriculum control from their own perspective. By comparing the three conceptions of <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> listed above as they apply to a particular case of <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> provision, by analysing that case in terms of the suite of analytical tools and by considering the relevant historical and socio-cultural context, a new theory of <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> is generated. In the first instance, the three curriculum conceptions of <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> are applied to the Australian <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> Initiative. The methodology is based on a research philosophy of realist-coherentism. Theory on <b>open</b> <b>learning,</b> which is generic and inclusive of a wide range of views, is analysed and reviewed. Three major categories of theory on <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> (descriptive, prescriptive and explanatory) are considered. The intended curriculum of the Initiative is then detailed primarily from documentary evidence with support from key informant interviews. Students' curriculum experiences are studied by means of a series of telephone interviews with a targeted sample of 44 students registered for units of study with <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> Australia (the <b>Open</b> <b>Learning</b> Agency of Australia) in the first study period of 1993. Comparing theory on <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> with the evidence of the intended curriculum and student experience indicates that a technocratic approach to opening access, rather than learner control of curriculum, is the central feature of this case. Learner-centred features of the curriculum and learner control are not primary aims but rather the byproducts of increasing participation primarily through flexibility in the location and timing of study and an open entry policy. Students are seen to be essentially curriculum-takers with curriculum structures acting as strong frames on their decision-making. In relation to its context, the Initiative is seen as a pragmatic response to economic and political pressures to expand participation in higher education and to have implications for centralising control of higher education. It is proposed that <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> is understandable as a manifestation of educational democratisation. Rather than being a novel post-Fordist or neo-Fordist form of education, it is argued that <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> is a continuation of longer term, progressive educational trends. <b>Open</b> <b>learning</b> is distinctive from earlier progressive educational movements in its adult focus and use of communications technologies. It is suggested that, in the post-industrial era, pressures associated with the attainment of mass higher education are inducing reforms at that level similar to reforms previously enacted in primary and secondary education as these reached mass levels of provision. Evidence for this interpretation extends beyond the Australian case and includes parallels between <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> and the reforms characteristic of democratisation as well as historical data on the expansion of opportunities for adult education. In terms of curriculum code theory, <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> is seen as an expression of the rational curriculum code. This suggests an amendment to curriculum code theory to acknowledge a lag in the implementation of certain codes at post-secondary level in comparison with schooling. If the patterns previously observed in school education continue to be followed, state intervention is likely to involve further technocratic and internalised controls at this level. The new theory implies that a systems wide, rather than a piecemeal, approach to the development of national systems of <b>open</b> <b>learning</b> is needed. In Australia, this means fully integrating the Initiative within the Unified National System of Higher Education and making its funding base and systems of student support more equitable with conventional provision. The study identifies the learners' context as a significant but previously unacknowledged constraint on students' decision-making and learner control of curriculum. It notes that transfer of control over entering a program of study is not automatically conferred by an open admissions policy but is, instead, dependent on providers meeting the information needs of students...|$|R
