5|$|A {{significant}} amount of new star formation and star destruction data {{is expected to be}} recorded from continued observation of Sakurai's Object, as well as be used as reference data in the future research of similar stars. The reason that stars such as Sakurai's <b>Object</b> <b>and</b> V605 Aquilae exist, as well as experience a shorter lifespan compared to most stars, is largely unknown. Sakurai's <b>Object</b> <b>and</b> V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again behavior for only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such behavior for 120 years. It is hypothesized that this is due to Sakurai's <b>Object</b> <b>and</b> V605 Aquilae evolving to the asymptotic giant branch of stars for the first time, while FG Sagittae is undergoing the process a second time.|$|E

On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without any explanation to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E

40|$|Abstract I {{defend a}} pragmatist reinterpretation of Sellars’s famous manifest-scientific distinction. I claim {{that in order}} to do justice to this {{important}} distinction we must first recognize, despite what philosophers—including, arguably, Sellars— often make of it, that the distinction does not draw an epistemological or metaphysical boundary between different kinds of <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> events, but a pragmatic boundary between different ways in which we interact with <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> events. Put differently, I argue that the manifest-scientific distinction, in my view, can be best understood, not as a metaphysical distinction between apparent <b>and</b> real <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> events, or an epistemological distinction between perceptible <b>and</b> imperceptible <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> events, but rather as a distinction, which is not necessarily rigid over time, between distinct ways in which we collectively deal, in practice, with <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> events...|$|R

Harvey Wippleman threw Gonzalez a rag soaked with chloroform, which Gonzalez used to knock The Undertaker unconscious. The referee disqualified Gonzalez for using a foreign <b>object</b> <b>and</b> awarded the match to The Undertaker. After the match, The Undertaker recovered and attacked Giant Gonzalez.|$|E
5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the <b>object,</b> <b>and</b> then use hands {{to make contact}} with and manipulate the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an <b>object</b> <b>and</b> then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E

I conclude that the notion of a truthmaker makes ontological demands beyond <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> properties/relations and propose that truthmakers are exemplification relations which are necessarily tied to <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> properties/relations...|$|R
5|$|Lethbridge's {{next book}} was ESP – Beyond Time and Distance, {{published}} in 1965.

In 1966 he published A Step in the Dark, which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed the authenticity of the Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.|$|E
5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a rich set of grammatical voices.

Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the <b>object</b> <b>and</b> another that emphasizes the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).|$|E
