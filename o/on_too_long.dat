Observers were welcome, provided they were silent and didn't disturb the proceedings. American saxophonist Ornette Coleman was asked to leave after he continually talked during one performance; Beatles member Paul McCartney once sat quietly through an early AMM session. When asked how he liked the music he said they went <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{called the}} movie [...] "more of a {{scrapbook}} than a coherent history". The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub {{stated that the}} film [...] "doesn't succeed {{in its attempt to}} make a feminist statement, with too many of the wrestlers sounding like male athletes who talk in excruciating detail about high school football seasons that everyone else forgot." [...] Echoing that statement, Russell Scott Smith of the New York Post stated, [...] "Unfortunately, the filmmakers let the ladies prattle <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> about issues that would only matter to the most rabid wrestling aficionados." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1977, word {{leaked out}} that Matlock {{was leaving the}} Sex Pistols. On 28 February, McLaren sent a {{telegram}} to the NME confirming the split. He claimed that Matlock had been [...] "thrown out...because he went <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> about Paul McCartney.... the Beatles was too much." [...] In an interview a few months afterwards, Steve Jones echoed the charge that Matlock had been sacked because he [...] "liked the Beatles." [...] Jones expanded {{on the matter of}} the band's issues with Matlock: [...] "He was a good writer but he didn't look like a Sex Pistol and he was always washing his feet. His mum didn't like the songs." [...] Matlock told the NME that he had voluntarily left the band by [...] "mutual agreement".|$|E

500|$|Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was {{the subject}} of reviews and {{critical}} analysis following its initial release. Fuad Omar called it a phenomenal debut for director Karan Johar; he said that the film has a memorable [...] "feelgood factor". Subhash K Jha called the film [...] "a simple stylish, sensuous and ambrosial love story," [...] further adding that the chemistry between the lead pair was unbeatable. A reviewer for Timeout Film Guide, while commenting that the second love triangle went <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> liked most of the film, saying that [...] "its performances, camerawork, storytelling and extensive musical numbers [...] all energetically colourful." [...] In 2004, Meor Shariman of The Malay Mail called the film a [...] "must watch" [...] for Bollywood fans, and also for those seeking an introduction to Bollywood. The film has also been criticized for creating unreal worlds and characters, to which Johar has said that this was part of his vision of escapism.|$|E
500|$|Jenna's storyline in {{the episode}} {{received}} mixed reception. Canning enjoyed her subplot but found it predictable and stereotypical, while Sepinwall reported {{it did not}} work, and wrote that Jenna's stories need to have Liz or Jack featured prominently or that she be put with Scott Adsit's 30 Rock character, Pete Hornberger, as in this episode, [...] "as her insanity's only amusing when contrasted against a relatively normal character. As with Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad believed Jenna's subplot was fair, observing it was great in parts but [...] "it just went <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> and got tedious and silly." [...] He believed {{it would be a}} good idea to have Jenna dating or perhaps marrying a recurring character, but opined [...] "The Ones" [...] did not choose that path. Tom O'Neil from the Los Angeles Times, in an August 2009 article, was thrilled for Krakowski receiving an Emmy nomination for her work on 30 Rock, but felt that [...] "The Ones" [...] would not be the episode for which she'd win the Outstanding Supporting Actress award.|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode [...] "C–", and criticized its {{extended}} nature. He {{said that it}} was [...] "both brimming with narrative yet straining to fill its allotted time." [...] Adams argued that elements, like Toby's visit to the prison, seemed like tacked on codas intended to increase the length of the show. He also felt that Odenkirk's performance was humorous, but dragged <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> and played the joke too far. Adams, however, was complimentary towards Angela and Dwight's subplot, calling it the most [...] "daring" [...] of the episode's various subplots, and saying it provided momentum for the episode. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "unpleasant', largely due to Andy's presence; he felt that the character [...] "continues to dominate the action and crush all the goodwill generated earlier in the season". However, he was very pleased with Odenkirk's performance, calling his acting [...] "a pretty spot-on recreation of the early years [...] ". Bob Odenkirk's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an [...] "Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series" [...] Emmy consideration.|$|E

500|$|Destructoid's Carter {{thought that}} Delsin {{was a more}} {{interesting}} protagonist than [...] "wooden" [...] Cole, which helped his investment into the story. IGN's Ingenito thought Delsin was an interesting lead character, especially because of the chemistry with Reggie. He found Troy Baker's performance of Delsin [...] " [...] with a charm and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey [...] or overwrought". However, he found supporting characters like Fetch underdeveloped and the narrative too straightforward. Although calling the characters clichéd, Edge {{felt that they were}} written and acted well. GameSpot's Mc Shea called Delsin annoying and immature, and found the gameplay more interesting than the [...] "tired" [...] story. Eurogamer's Welsh considered the plot driven by [...] "inconsequential MacGuffins" [...] and thought the ending rushed, but praised the story for not stretching <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> Polygon's Kollar felt that the story did not explore its themes of surveillance and security-over-freedom well enough, such that its impact was diminished. He was overall disappointed with the narrative, despite finding the main characters written better than in previous Infamous games. OPM's Meikleham was put off by Delsin's arrogance and was underwhelmed with the story, but he was impressed by the quality of the motion capture performances.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Tan of Destructoid {{highlighted}} the pacing and combat intensity, which requires players {{to pay attention}} to the flow of the battle more than usual. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot stated similar pros, especially during the second portion of the mission. According to him, [...] "enemies attack at just the right pace, so individual battles never drag <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long,</b> nor are they over so quickly that they end up being unsatisfying." [...] He also {{highlighted the}} vehicle chase scene, comparing it favorably to Blade Runner and The Fifth Element, but criticize the controls in the Xbox 360 version for not being very precise. The bosses received similar praise, with Steimer stating that both of them [...] "have unique traits that make them a formidable opponent." [...] The Shadow Broker's base was highlighted as a valuable addition to the game. Whitehead noted that marking mineral-rich planets alleviates the scanning, which was seen as a tedious feature in the main game. VanOrd concluded that [...] "Lair of the Shadow Broker" [...] is [...] "worthy of your time (more than two hours) and your money." [...] The pack was nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content) at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to [...] It won the Inside Gaming Award for Best DLC.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Peter Travers {{said the}} film [...] "goes <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> and {{repetition}} dulls its initial cleverness" [...] but the [...] "junky feel {{is part of}} its charm." [...] He praised the cast, particularly Reynolds, as well as Tim Miller's action sequences. At the Boston Globe, Tom Russo gave the film three stars. He criticized the [...] "featherweight" [...] plot, but said that there is enough humor to support it, and that Reynolds was [...] "born to play" [...] Deadpool. Chris Nashawaty graded the film a 'B' for Entertainment Weekly, saying it [...] "doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story" [...] but makes up for that with R-rated fun. Nashawaty felt Reynolds was the perfect star for the film, and is [...] "a blast of laughing gas in a genre that tends to take itself way too seriously." [...] Tasha Robinson at The Verge felt {{there was too much}} juvenile humor, but was positive that the film did not make homophobic, racist, or sexist jokes, and that its overall tone remained joyous despite the material. She also praised the smaller scope of the film. David Edelstein of Vulture said the film's jokes save it from a lack of subtext and strong villains, and noted the gratifyingly twisty" [...] structure. Manohla Dargi at The New York Times did not give the film a pass for listing its genre cliches in the opening credits before using them, but instead highlighted the [...] "human" [...] elements in the film and the moments where Reynolds and Tim Miller did [...] "more than hit the same bombastic notes over and over again." [...] For IndieWire, Kate Erbland gave the film a 'B-', praising its style, and Reynolds' Deadpool for breaking the superhero mold, but criticizing the overall film for following genre conventions and focusing on [...] "numbing" [...] violence and un-original swearing and nudity.|$|E

2500|$|Annexation of the Philippines by the United States {{was felt}} to be {{justified}} by those in the U.S. government and media who supported the conflict {{through the use of}} moralistic oration. Stuart Creighton Miller writes [...] "Americans altruistically went to war with Spain to liberate Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Filipinos from their tyrannical yoke. If they lingered <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> in the Philippines, it was to protect the Filipinos from European predators waiting in the wings for an American withdrawal and to tutor them in American-style democracy." ...|$|E

[...] Oliver awarded the sixth season a score of 3.9 out of 10, saying: [...] "Like The X-Files, Highlander: The Series simply went <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long.</b> If the star is wanting {{to get out of a}} show as much as Paul was ready to hang up his katana, then I say let it go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{not having}} the Republican nomination, Lindsay {{was still on the}} ballot as the {{candidate}} of the New York Liberal Party. In his campaign he said [...] "mistakes were made" [...] and called being mayor of New York City [...] "the second toughest job in America." [...] Two television advertisements described his position: In one he looked directly into the camera and said, [...] "I guessed wrong on the weather before the city's biggest snowfall last winter. And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more cops on the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> and we all made some mistakes.

2500|$|Both sides {{came under}} {{criticism}} for their defensive {{approach in the}} final Test — New Zealand for failing to set aside its headaches about the gifts of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma and groom a traditionally seam-friendly wicket, and India for not ramming home its advantage {{over the course of}} the final two days. [...] "A 2-0 victory would have been a more correct index of the difference between the teams," [...] wrote Indian journalist Suresh Menon, bemoaning Dhoni's lack of urgency first in batting <b>on</b> <b>too</b> <b>long</b> in the second innings and then in leading a signally listless and complacent display in the field. [...] The Indian skipper's answer to the first charge was that [...] "a huge score meant that we could keep attacking all the time." [...] As Menon observed, however, strangely, he didn't attack all the time. [...] He didn't tell Harbhajan Singh that the bowler should stop sending down his express deliveries but flight the ball. [...] Post-tea on the fourth day, the whole team appeared over-relaxed and almost casual, as if winning would be just a matter of turning up on the fifth day.A 2-0 victory would have been a more correct index of the difference between the teams. India appeared only too satisfied with a 1-0 win. This is not how champion teams play, and if India aspire to knock Australia off the perch at the top, they will have to be more ruthless in their approach, more focused, and not so easily satisfied.|$|E
