40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new method of stiffening CHS L-joints and compares it against current stiffened and unstiffened moment connections. The method {{is derived from}} studying the failure modes of existing methods, typically local buckling and <b>ovalisation</b> of the section.

An alternative approach, where a stiffening plate welded vertically inside both the column and beam, outperformed the unstiffened frame plate in terms of reduced <b>ovalisation</b> and increased load capacity.

40|$|Abstract — Circular tubes {{have been}} widely used as {{structural}} members in many engineering applications. Therefore, its collapse behavior has been studied for many decades, focusing on its energy absorption characteristics and collapse mechanism. In order to predict the collapse behavior of tubes, one could rely on the use of finite element codes or experiments. These tools provide results with high accuracy but costly and require extensive running time. Therefore, an approximated model of tubes collapse mechanism is an alternative especially for the early step of design. This paper is also aimed to develop a closed-form solution to predict the response of circular tube subjected to pure bending, focusing on the <b>ovalisation</b> regime. New <b>ovalisation</b> model was developed to include the effect of curvature into account. In order to compare, the experiment was conducted with a number of tubes having various D/t ratios. In addition, the available predictions from other investigators were also presented and compared. Good agreement was found between the theoretical predictions and experimental results. In addition, the present model provides more accurate result compared to some available theories. Index Terms—Bending, Circular tube, Plasticity, <b>Ovalisation</b> I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the winch winding {{properties}} of typical driving mechanisms of cable-driven parallel robots. While cable properties have already been studied, the accuracy of winding mechanisms to control cable robots and the interaction with cable properties {{has yet to be}} investigated. To initiate this, some properties believed to affect the winding accuracy are outlined. It was found that cable force can have a significant effect not only because of finite stiffness, but due to <b>ovalisation</b> and elongation effects of the rope. An experimental test on <b>ovalisation</b> showed significant deviations from a standard approximation to evaluate transmission accuracy. This effect can change the accuracy of winding mechanisms by 0. 3 – 1. 2 %. Thus when investigating cable-robot accuracy the winch winding properties cannot be ignored...|$|E
40|$|Even {{though for}} most {{hydraulic}} and geotechnical structures clear guidelines are available, those for flexible dolphins are still missing. Consequently, whether a design is safe is usually subject of debate. Economical dolphin piles are large diameter tubular piles, susceptible to local buckling. After installation the embedded {{part of these}} piles remains predominantly filled with soil. The aim {{of this research is}} to provide understanding of the effects concerning local buckling and therewith to contribute to the discussion whether a dolphin design is safe. The main research question is: Does the soil in dolphin piles contribute to the local buckling resistance and can this be used in the design of these piles? Gresnigt (1986) prescribes a strain based method to check a pile on local buckling. This method is incorporated in EN 1993 - 4 - 3 (2009). The resistance against local buckling depends on the slenderness ratio De/(tε 2). Also, <b>ovalisation</b> influences the resistance. The presence of a soil plug reduces the <b>ovalisation,</b> enhancing the local buckling resistance. An analytical method is proposed in which beam theory is used to determine the dolphin pile deformation and loads on the pile. Literature provides equations to calculate the <b>ovalisation</b> that can be applied in three distinct parts: above the bed level, between the bed level and plug level and below the plug level. The provided equations however, show inconsistencies at the transitions. It is proposed to apply beam theory on the pile wall, modelled as a linear beam with springs providing resistance against <b>ovalisation.</b> Above the plug level, the resistance is provided by the ring behaviour of the shell. Below the plug level, the stiffness is increased with the stiffness of the soil plug. The model overcomes the inconsistencies in <b>ovalisation.</b> The method assumes the stiffness of the plug in the pile can be approximated. However, it is concluded that the suggested stiffness in CUR 211 E (2013) is not able to determine the plug stiffness for semi-filled piles. Key parameters that affect the local buckling resistance are identified. These are the plug packing, plug level, slenderness ratio and the soil packing. The influence of these key parameters are studied with the finite element program Abaqus. The parametric study proves that the soil in dolphin piles contributes to the local buckling resistance. A denser packing of the plug improves the capacities of the bending moment and lateral load. Most of all, the dolphin can dissipate more energy. The plug level influences the level at which local buckling is observed, as well as whether an inward or outward buckle occur. The contribution of the inner soil on the local buckling resistance can be compensated by designing a more slender dolphin pile. A more slender cross-section reduces the capacities of the pile. The packing of the outer soil also influences the buckling level and shape. Furthermore, a looser soil packing improves the energy capacity of the dolphin pile. To obtain a dolphin pile that optimises the improvements on the local buckling resistance by the inner and surrounding soil, an installation method is used that does not compact the soil and plug packing and after installation, the plug packing is compacted. With the Abaqus analyses the stiffness of the soil plug is studied. It reveals that the plug is stiffer at deeper levels. For a pile with a diameter comparable to 914 mm, when the predicted <b>ovalisation</b> for that pile without a soil plug is less than 8 mm, a plug stiffness of 30, 000 kN/m 2 can be assumed in the proposed analytical method, regardless of the plug packing. The stiffness is independent of the slenderness ratio. The Port of Rotterdam facilitated a full scale field test with eight piles. The Abaqus model shows reasonable comparison with the field test. The observed local buckling behaviour piles that were not modelled can well be explained with the results of the parametric study.

40|$|Aims: Mechanisms of lumen {{compromise}} after provisional side branch (SB) stenting {{are poorly}} understood. In {{this study we}} aimed to investigate the impact of bifurcation angle, plaque composition, and procedural strategy on SB compromise. Methods and results: Computer simulations of stent implantation were performed in Medina (1, 1, 1) bifurcation models. Provisional SB stenting was replicated including post-dilation after main branch stenting. Two bifurcation angles (45 °, 70 °) and four plaque types (fully lipid, fully fibrous, lipid with half and fully calcified ring distal to the carina) were tested. Two post-dilation balloons of different lengths (15 mm and 9 mm) were also investigated. Provisional stenting caused an <b>ovalisation</b> of the SB ostium (i. e., increase of ellipticity from 0. 27 to 0. 58 ± 0. 21, p< 0. 05) that might appear as a significant stenosis on two-dimensional angiography, although SB ostium area was preserved (- 3. 3 ± 10. 3 %) {{in the absence of}} calcifications. However, in the presence of calcifications, SB lumen volume compromise was evident (- 0. 89 ± 0. 15 mm 3). Plaque type had a higher impact than bifurcation angle on SB ostium shape. A shorter balloon (9 mm) for proximal optimisation reduced SB lumen volume compromise from - 1. 11 mm 3 to - 0. 72 mm 3. Conclusions: Simulations showed <b>ovalisation</b> of the SB ostium, generally without significant lumen compromise.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in deep water pipelaying consists in the analysis of the configuration at the installation stage. In fact it is well known from practical experience that most pipelines are likely to encounter their highest stresses during the laying process. From a mechanical point of view the problem is one of large displacements and is furthermore {{complicated by the fact that}} the length of the suspended span is a priori unknown, as well as some boundary conditions at the seabed touchdown point and at the connection to the laybarge. In the case of deep waters, additional problems become significant. In fact the curvature of the pipeline during the installation process tends to cause the <b>ovalisation</b> of the cross-section according to the well known von Kàrmàn effect and in turn the consequent reduction of the bending stiffness influences the pipeline axis configuration. Thus the rod equilibrium problem becomes non-linear also in the bending moment-curvature relationship even for a linear elastic material. The present paper proposes an analytical approach for the calculation of the elastic deflection of submerged pipelines laid with a stinger which takes into account the overall effects of the <b>ovalisation</b> of the cross-section. The analysis is performed by means of a singular perturbation technique and the analytical solution obtained turns out to present some advantages over the finite element method. A practical example is discussed and a comparison with the results obtained by means of a well-known commercial finite element package (ABAQUS v. 5. 7) is performed...|$|E

40|$|If {{it would}} be {{possible}} to install Tight Fit Pipe by means of reeling, {{it would be}} an attractive new option for the exploitation of offshore oil and gas fields containing corrosive hydrocarbons. Tight Fit Pipe is a mechanically bonded double walled pipe where a corrosion resistant alloy liner pipe is mechanically fitted inside a carbon steel outer pipe through a thermo-hydraulic manufacturing process. Reeling is a fast method of offshore pipeline installation where a pipe is spooled on a reel, which is positioned on a vessel. The vessel subsequently sails to the offshore location where the pipe is unwound, straightened and deployed to the seabed. However, reeling of Tight Fit Pipe is not yet proven technology. The reeling process imposes high plastic strains (due to bending) in the pipe, which may cause unacceptable liner pipe wrinkling and Tight Fit Pipe <b>ovalisation.</b> This PhD project aimed to make a contribution to the possible development of the installation of Tight Fit Pipe by means of the reeling method. The focus of this research was on the initiation and the degree of liner pipe wrinkling as well as the degree of <b>ovalisation</b> occurring during the spooling-on phase of the reeling process, both theoretically and experimentally; the latter by performing full scale bending tests on 12. 75 inch outer diameter Tight Fit Pipe. One of the test results indicates that a higher mechanical bending strength decreases liner pipe wrinkling and makes the Tight Fit Pipe more suitable for reeling. However, test results also show that the mechanical bonding strength for the Tight Fit Pipe tested was significantly reduced, irrespective of whether a high or a low initial mechanical bonding strength had been used prior to spooling-on. These findings justify further research into this phenomenon as the eventual mechanical bonding strength after reeling installation may be vital for its anticipated application during operation.

Analytical treatments of this problem have a history going back almost a century and still constitute an active and challenging research area. This paper investigates in detail the effect of cylinder length on the nonlinear elastic buckling behaviour of clamped cylindrical tubes under global bending, covering a very wide range of lengths.

40|$|Cylindrical metal shells with {{elliptical}} cross-sections {{are gaining}} increasing popularity as hollow sections {{due to their}} unique aesthetic appearance and different geometric properties about their two principal axes, with one axis exhibiting properties that are significantly more favourable than the other under flexure. However, in comparison with other hollow geometries, elliptical cross-sections have only recently begun receiving significant research attention. This is partly because even simple analytical treatments inevitably encounter cumbersome elliptical integrals that have no closed-form solutions, a problem now attenuated by powerful modern computing capabilities. A recent computational study investigated the nonlinear buckling resistance of perfect elastic circular cylindrical shells under uniform bending, establishing four distinct length-dependent domains of behaviour and characterising these in compact form using specially chosen dimensionless parameters.

RESULTS: Of 925 butts, 3. 8 % were cigarillos, 11. 1 % cigarettes without filter, 57. 7 % ventilated filter cigarettes, 22. 5 % filter cigarettes without macroscopic ventilation and 4. 9 % undetermined. Thirty-six different cigarette brands were identified. A wide distribution of butt lengths (mean 32. 1 mm, variation coefficient 28 %), peripheral <b>ovalisation</b> of the filter in 83. 9 %, and extended browning {{of the mouth}} end of the filter in 48. 6 % were observed.

40|$|Most {{liquid bulk}} {{terminals}} {{are equipped with}} a jetty as berthing facility. The ship mostly berths to dedicated breasting dolphins, which can be single-pile flexible dolphins or multi-pile rigid dolphins. In design methods for flexible dolphins, the yield limit is approached more and more {{over the years to}} employ the load-bearing capacity of the dolphin more optimally. In recent design guidelines (EAU 1996 and PIANC 2002) also the plastic yielding capacity is implicitly or explicitly included in the ultimate load-bearing capacity. This movement towards plastic design however is not accompanied by the development of calculation models and design criteria to assess the plastic load-bearing capacity. Damage cases in recent years seem to support the conclusion that the completeness and safety of those standards and guidelines is questionable. The first objective in this thesis project is the development of a calculation model for the prediction of the nonlinear structural behaviour of a dolphin. The most important output of the model is a complete load-deflection curve up to failure, including all relevant failure mechanisms, with which the elastic and plastic load-bearing capacity in terms of energy absorption can be assessed. The model, which is called the Bruijn model, is developed for the system of a single steel pile with uniform cross-section and steel grade sufficiently embedded in non-cohesive soil of uniform properties, under influence of a static horizontal load applied at the pile-head. As the second objective an evaluation of the currently effective design standards and guidelines for dolphins is carried out, in order to assess the safety which can be realised in the plastic range. A representative case is chosen with varying diameter-wall thickness ratios (D/t ratio of 83, 63 and 42), which is calculated according to all relevant standards and guidelines, and compared to the load-deflection curve generated by the Bruijn model. The case study leads to the conclusion that sufficient plastic yielding capacity is confirmed for a D/t ratio of 42, where an increase in the elastic energy absorption capacity of up to 1, 33 times the original elastic energy absorption capacity can be obtained after some plastic yielding. At larger D/t ratios (60 - 80) this plastic yielding capacity is significantly smaller due to a much higher buckling sensitivity. At a D/t ratio above 80 buckling in the elastic range can be expected, reducing the ultimate energy absorption capacity to less than the full-elastic energy absorption capacity. For the standards and guidelines it can be concluded that the employment of the plastic yielding capacity should be accompanied by an assessment of the safety against failure for the failure modes stresses, strains, buckling and <b>ovalisation.</b> This means that the current standards and guidelines should be expanded with limit state criteria for failure modes buckling and <b>ovalisation</b> and should be adjusted for failure mode yielding. By doing this the safety of a design for any value of the D/t ratio will be ensured. It is recommended to evaluate and further develop the Bruijn model, and release such a model to the design environment. Such a model is easier to work with and more suitable for the specific design requirements than complex FEM analysis packages. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper reports recent {{results from}} a set of {{experimental}} and computational studies of ductile flat fracture in modern gas pipeline steel. Experimental data from plain and notched cylindrical tensile bars and standard C(T) specimens together with damage mechanics theories {{have been used to}} capture the flat fracture characteristics of a gas pipeline steel of grade X 100. The modelling was via finite element analysis using the Gurson-Tvergaard modified model (GTN) of ductile damage development. The assumption of effective material damage isotropy was sufficiently accurate to allow the transfer of data from the notched bars to predict, in a 2 D model, the crack growth behaviour of the C(T) specimen. This was in spite of the considerable <b>ovalisation</b> of the bars {{at the end of their}} deformation. However, it was not possible to obtain similar accuracy with a 3 D model of the C(T) test, even after a large number of attempts to adjust the values of the GTN parameters. This, and the anisotropic shape change in the tensile bars, suggests very strongly that the damage behaviour is so anisotropic that conventional models are not good enough for a full engineering description of the flat fracture behaviour. Suitable averaging (of shape) in the modelling of the notched bar data, and the companion averaging associated with the 2 D model of the C(T) data provide a relatively fast way of transferring engineering data in the tests. There is a discussion of potential ways in which to incorporate 3 D effects into the modelling for those purposes where the considerable increase in computational time (due to the microstructurally-sized finite elements needed to capture the damage behaviour) is acceptable in order to include through-thickness effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state-of-the-art {{review of literature}} available for the structural assessment {{of all types of}} mitred pipe bends. Compared with smooth bends, the volume of literature available for mitres is less extensive and its scope is not as wide. Historically, this reflects a reduced application level, as well as a less demanding range of applications, such as non-high temperature use. There is also the issue that an analysis of a mitred bend is complicated by discontinuity stresses, as well as those due to cross-section <b>ovalisation.</b> This fact delayed the development of non-linear analysis of mitred bends. Nevertheless, there is now a substantial body of work on mitred bends. This review tabulates and characterises all publications to date in chronological order. The details of experimental specimens are highlighted, with a view to these perhaps providing useful verification data for any future finite element analysis for example. Issues of particular interest to pipework designers are discussed, including the effects of combinations of loading, out-of-circularity, tangent pipe length and flanges. Failure characteristics and loads are discussed where relevant. Topics for further research are also noted. For example, comprehensive design curves do not exist for the elastic and plastic behaviour of all mitre types, over a practical range of geometry and loading parameters. Similarly, there is still scope for further work on the effect of combined loading, end effects and out-of-circularity. Limit, collapse and burst loads are not yet available across the entire spectrum of bends and loading parameters either. Creep and optimisation represent virgin territory as far as mitred bends are concerned and given that unforeseen vibration is a common source of high-cycle fatigue failure in pipework, there must also be scope for vibration-induced fatigue studies...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to give a deeper {{understanding}} of Power Spectral Density analysis and how {{it can be used to}} predict the impact of fluctuating loads induced directly to a rocket nozzle. The initial study mainly deals with understanding how the response may vary with changed geometrical setup of the reinforcement structure. That is why a great deal of the time has been spent on parameterize the model to make it easy to automatically loop over many different geometrical and material properties of the nozzle extension. The work was implemented on a simplified FE-model of the next generation sandwich nozzle extension that was under development at GKN Aerospace Engine Systems. The thesis will only address the impact of buffeting loads during atmospheric ascent as it is the most critical stage of the flight. The occurrence of buffeting loads during atmospheric ascent is due to varying pressure fields as it passes through the atmosphere. This load depends primarily on the shape of the vehicle, but the severity can change rapidly depending on the dynamic pressure, angle of attack and Mach number. To analyze the behavior of a random load it is important to understand which critical structure modes are present in the specified frequency range. Excitation of these modes can lead to structural failure of the nozzle due to excessive displacement. Evalaution of the critical mode frequencies indicated a linear relationship, up to 60 mm stiffener height, between the eigenfrequency of the critical modes and the stiffener height, where both 3 -wave and 4 -wave increase modes more rapidly for higher stiffeners than for the <b>ovalisation</b> mode. The pendulum and torsion mode will have nearly constant frequencies. Both the torsion and pendulum mode are caused by motion at the nozzle throat and are unaffected by the increased stiffness of the lower part of the nozzle. Connecting these linear relations to the energy distribution of the PSD spectrum showed an increase of available energy for the <b>ovalisation</b> mode and a decrease for 3 -wave and 4 -wave modes for higher stiffeners. A further study of how the reinforcement structure affects the eigenfrequencies and the magnitude of the critical modes states that the stiffener height has the largest contribution. The increased stiffener height gives an exponentially decreased radial displacement of the nozzle wall. The stiffener thickness has a minor effect on the mode frequencies and contributes only to an increased structural stiffness of the reinforcement structure. This states that it is better to use higher stiffeners than an increased number of lower stiffeners. At the same time the allowed stiffener height is limited by an increased stiffness of the wall at each stiffener due to increased risk for axial buckling between stiffeners. An important notice is that the PSD spectrum for the Ariane 5 rocket was not available during the thesis. Instead a PSD spectrum from a slightly larger nozzle extension was used. How this PSD spectrum relates to the Ariane 5 PSD spectrum needs to be further investigated to verify the magnitude of these critical modes. Finally, the study has shown that PSD analysis is a time efficient and competent tool that could be used as a first approach during the design phase. A problem that was stated early on was the lack of support to handle nonlinear behaviors such as plasticity in ANSYS. This meant that large temperature changes occurring during flight could not be accounted for in this PSD analysis. However LS-DYNA has recently implemented a non-linear solver for the aerospace industry, based on Boeing software N-FEARA, a NIKE 3 D-based finite element tool for structural analysis of vibro-acoustic loads. If the LS-DYNA non-linear solver can account for large thermal and structural loads, the PSD analysis might be an alternative to perform time history analysis. It shall be emphasized that this is a reduced report; company sensitive results and developed methods are not included. Validerat; 20150420 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} spirally welded tubes in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to earth load, economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the local buckling stress. For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with longitudinally welded tubes and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for spirally welded tubes. Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on spirally welded tubes with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (spiral welds and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and earth loads) on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined. Therefore, in the test program accurate measurements are performed of these conditions. Moment - curvature and curvature - <b>ovalisation</b> relationships are presented and compared with theoretical prediction...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCTS) is a {{transitional}} technology offering a nearterm method of mitigating climate change. Pipelines {{are considered to}} be the most suitable systems for CCTS; however, structural integrity of pipeline has to be guaranteed in order for this technology to become a practical technical solution. The investigation detailed here is based on a systematic experimental approach to investigate the structural integrity of API X 100, X 60 and X 70 steels exposed in simulated flue-gas under dynamic conditions. A core of the structured experiments through some methods such as aging test, tensile properties, fracture toughness, residual stress and engineering critical assessment was accomplished in parent material and exposed samples on flue-gas. The temperature range of evaluation for tensile test covers - 70 C to 21 C while fracture toughness was over the range - 196 C to 21 C. Tensile properties of virgin material show that steels meet standard specification while aging samples do not show significant scatter compared with parent steels. <b>Ovalisation</b> of the fracture surface and splitting phenomenon was observed which is related with steel anisotropy. Fracture toughness obtained from experiment was compared with that calculate by two existing correlations. However both correlations did not predict the level of fracture toughness expected indicating the methods used in this work has limited applicability under the test conditions used here. Residual stress (RS) induced in API X 100 steel by cold rolling method was characterised using two complementary techniques known as Neutron Diffraction (ND) and Incremental Hole Drilling (IHD). The RS distribution shows good agreement for both techniques used but reproducibility of them depends on their own inaccuracies. An Engineering Criticality Assessment (ECA) was performed based in Failure Assessment Diagram (FAD) approach using all the experimental data obtained by a leak-before-break method under three operational pressures. The results showed the effect on the integrity of material under the presence of a flaw length assessed. Overall, the thesis presents a combined engineering critical assessment which involved the examination of materials used to transport flue-gas and established a methodology to determine fracture toughness alongside with the FAD to assess the integrity of pipelines...|$|E
