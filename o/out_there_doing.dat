500|$|While Carey paved {{a lot of}} {{the album}} with slower and autobiographical ballads, she also {{attempted}} at making an album with a mixture of several different genres. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the album showed off Carey's musical and vocal versatility, especially when viewing the differences in the record's first and second singles, [...] "Ms. Carey is known for her voice, of course: she can hit high notes that barely sound human, and few singers leap around the octaves as gracefully as she does. But as she tries to regain her audience, her greatest weapon may be her versatility: Ms. Carey also knows how to make a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine." [...] Carey decided to work with Just Blaze after she heard the song [...] "Oh Boy" [...] he had produced for Cam'ron. Together they produced [...] "Boy (I Need You)", a remake of [...] "Oh Boy", and [...] "You Got Me". Carey described the former as one of her favorites on the album. [...] "It's definitely one of my favorites, 'cause I love the original. It was cool to have him <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>doing</b> his thing in such a random environment," [...] she said.
