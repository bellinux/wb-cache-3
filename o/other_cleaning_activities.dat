Increased risk of infection is related to practices {{of those in the}} childcare environment, and infection risk can be reduced by taking precautions. Practices which reduce the likelihood of spreading infection include encouraging hand washing in all present, providing facial tissue to cover sneezes, doing food preparation in a place separate from <b>other</b> <b>activity,</b> <b>cleaning</b> and using a disinfectant on surfaces people touch, and among groups using diapers, having good practices to change and dispose of diapers while cleaning children and the changing area.|$|R

40|$|Wet work is {{the main}} cause of {{occupational}} contact dermatitis in the cleaning industry. Dermatologists and occupational physicians need to base their primary and secondary prevention for workers in the cleaning industry on the characteristics of wet work exposures. We quantified the burden of wet work in professional office <b>cleaning</b> <b>activities</b> with a continuous standardized observation by trained observers of 41 office cleaners. Duration and frequency of wet work exposure and of different <b>cleaning</b> <b>activities</b> were assessed. Wet work made up 50 % of such cleaning work. Within a typical 3 -hr shift, a mean frequency of 68 episodes of wet work was observed, which classifies office cleaning as wet work. Skin exposure to irritants was markedly different among cleaners who did the same <b>cleaning</b> <b>activities.</b> Reduction in skin irritation can be achieved by training the workers. Because this group of workers, who have a low level of education, has a high risk of developing irritant hand dermatitis, a special effort on training and instruction should be made. A reduction of exposure can be achieved by: using gloves more often; using gloves for a shorter period of time; using gloves while doing activities that otherwise cause the skin to be in contact with water and cleaning substances and washing hands with water only, reserving soap for when the hands are visibly dirty.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Triatoma infestans is {{the main}} vector of Chagas disease in the {{southern}} cone countries. Present controlstrategies based on indoor and outdoor residual insecticide spraying are not sufficient to control diseasetransmission, particularly in Bolivia. Techniques based on {{the management of the}} human environment maybe good alternatives or supplements. Methods: Social and entomological surveys were carried out in four villages of Bolivia situated in the dry inter-Andean Valleys and the Chaco region. Risk factors for house infestation by T. infestanswere identified, and an ecohealthintervention based on education and community participation was carried out to reduce the risks of houseinfestation. It consisted of implementing simple and low cost vector control techniques such as coating of mudwalls, <b>cleaning</b> <b>activities</b> and removal of poultry that enter rooms to lay eggs. Results: The eco-health intervention significantly reduced the number of infested bedrooms, the mean abundanceof T. infestans in bedrooms and beds, especially in the Chaco region. Mud wall coating was well acceptedand could be proposed as a supplementary tool to the National Program of Chagas Disease Control to enhancethe effects of insecticide sprayings. Conclusions: Even if <b>cleaning</b> <b>activities</b> were still neglected, community participation proved to be effective inreducing house infestation...|$|R
