50|$|To {{purchase}} an IDS BK travelcard the customer needs a smartcard accepted by IDS BK operators. These are smartcards issued by DPB, Slovak Lines and Železničná spoločnosť Slovensko, a student card issued by selected Slovak {{schools and universities}} as well as Bratislavská mestská karta which is a Maestro PayPass card issued only to residents of Bratislava by participating banks. Customer can then load a travelcard at <b>ticket</b> <b>offices</b> of participating operators, some DPB ticket machines or via websites of IDS BK operators. Online purchase is only available {{at least one day}} before {{the first day of the}} travelcard validity - this is to ensure enough time for all operators' control devices (such as regional bus cash registers, or train conductor's control devices) to synchronize data about <b>online</b> <b>tickets.</b> Such synchronization is necessary since <b>online</b> <b>tickets</b> are not physically loaded into smartcard's chip when purchased. Instead, all control devices have database of <b>tickets</b> purchased <b>online</b> and compare loaded card's ID with this database. When purchasing travelcard on Bratislavská mestská karta, 10% discount from price of Bratislava zones is provided by City of Bratislava.|$|R
