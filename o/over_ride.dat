The whorls slope behind and are rounded in front. The axial sculpture consists of (on the penultimate whorl about 17) short rounded ribs with subequal interspaces, hardly extended over the periphery and gradually becoming obsolete on the body whorl [...] Incremental lines are somewhat conspicuous on the base where they slightly reticulate the spiral sculpture. The latter comprises three prominent cords on the periphery equal and equidistant, swollen where they <b>over</b> <b>ride</b> the ribs, and feebler on the body whorl. The anal fasciole carries finer equal spiral threads, the base 10 or more somewhat larger and more nearly adjacent as they approach the siphonal canal. The aperture is rather narrow. The outer lip is solid and sharp-edged. The anal sulcus is large, rounded, close to the suture. The inner lip is erased. The siphonal canal is short, deep and slightly recurved.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to recognize that throughout the history of America, racism has always been evident. This project may bring about the most change seeing how it highlights the issue of feminism through the lens of a Latina author, artist, or speaker. What is often forgotten about is the sexism that has always played a role in the history of the country. [...] "Like Marxism and nationalism, feminism had numerous variants. Critics dwell on the fact that Vázques declared herself a [...] "Chicana primera," [...] claiming that race should take precedence over gender in analyzing oppression." [...] It should be always conscious in our minds that gender is just as important as sex, and that one does not <b>over</b> <b>ride</b> the other. Chicana Por Mi Raza makes this lesson stick and gives clout to the Chicana feminist that stepped up and made strides for their literature, art, and the feminist view in general.|$|E
50|$|Technical {{lettering}} is {{the process}} of forming letters, numerals, and other characters in technical drawing. It is used to describe, or provide detailed specifications for an object. With the goals of legibility and uniformity, styles are standardized and lettering ability has little relationship to normal writing ability. Engineering drawings use a Gothic sans-serif script, formed by a series of short strokes. Lower case letters are rare in most drawings of machines. ISO Lettering templates, designed for use with technical pens and pencils, and to suit ISO paper sizes, produce lettering characters to an international standard. The stroke thickness is related to the character height (for example, 2.5mm high characters would have a stroke thickness - pen nib size - of 0.25mm, 3.5 would use a 0.35mm pen and so forth). The ISO character set (font) has a seriffed one, a barred seven, an open four, six, and nine, and a round topped three, that improves legibility when, for example, an A0 drawing has been reduced to A1 or even A3 (and perhaps enlarged back or reproduced/faxed/ microfilmed &c). When CAD drawings became more popular, especially using US American software, such as AutoCAD, the nearest font to this ISO standard font was Romantic Simplex (RomanS) - a proprietary shx font) with a manually adjusted width factor (<b>over</b> <b>ride)</b> to make it look as near to the ISO lettering for the drawing board. However, with the closed four, and arced six and nine, romans.shx typeface could be difficult to read in reductions. In more recent revisions of software packages, the TrueType font ISOCPEUR reliably reproduces the original drawing board lettering stencil style, however, many drawings have switched to the ubiquitous Arial.ttf.|$|E

40|$|Dual Processing theory {{proposes that}} the ability to <b>over</b> <b>ride</b> {{associative}} (System 1) in favour of analytical (System 2) processed in deductive reasoning may depend on inhibitory control. The present study applies this association to a spatial reasoning task by adapting a mental rotation task to a multichoice format including System 1 (mirror) and System 2 (rotated image) responses. Fifty undergraduate volunteers from the University of Canterbury responded to a Stroop task as a measure of inhibitory control that was compared with System 1 and System 2 responding from a spatial and a deductive reasoning task. It was expected that people with weaker inhibitory potential would make more System 1 and fewer System 2 responses in both deductive and visual-spatial reasoning tasks. Contrary to expectation System 2 responding dominated for both tasks and correlations between both reasoning tasks and measures of inhibitory control were non-significant. The differing idiosyncratic demands of each task may have obscured any common variables associated with inhibitory control. This research initiated a test for the presence of System 1 and System 2 in spatial reasoning...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the recognition of}} diphthong and triphone signs useful in automatic generation of English text from Pitman Shorthand Language (PSL) document. The PSL is used to note down the dictated/spoken text and is widely practiced in all organizations where English is the transaction medium. This has a built-in practical advantage because {{of which it is}} universally acknowledged. This recording medium will continue to exist in spite of considerable developments in Speech Processing Systems, which are not universally established yet. Because of wide usage of PSL and the effort in its automation, PSL processing has emerged as a potential problem for research in the areas of Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Document Analysis. There are six long and six short vowels in PSL. These vowels are represented by signs /symbols that <b>over</b> <b>ride</b> a stroke symbol and require recognition for composing English text from phonetic text documented through PSL. The work pertaining to other constructs of PSL is already carried out at word level by the authors 7, 8], But during dictation, it is common that the vowels are joined to form one syllable, called Diphthong. The diphthong appended with a tick-mark is called Triphone and represents any vowel that immediately follows the diphthong in a stroke. The diphthongs are to be cognized and recognized to generate the correct English equivalent text. The present work comprises of the definition of diphthong primitives, creation of knowledge base and the development of an algorithm for their recognition. A suitable shape recognition algorithm is assumed available here. This work is new and this module serves as a prerequisite for the complete recognition of PSL document and generation of an equivalent and correct English text...|$|E

40|$|Obesity is {{a costly}} and growing health {{concern for the}} modern world and puts {{individuals}} {{at increased risk for}} chronic illnesses. Although obesity is associated with many detrimental peripheral effects, food over consumption is centrally mediated. The hypothalamus and brainstem regions control homeostatic food intake, while hedonic food intake is mainly controlled by the central reward system. Palatable foods are rewarding and <b>over</b> <b>ride</b> the homeostatic system and cause over consumption. Foods high in sugar and fat acutely activate dopamine neurons in the classical reward pathway consisting of the ventral tegmental area projecting to the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Chronic intake of palatable foods is associated with neuroadaptations that can lead to behavioral changes and further over consumption. This dissertation characterizes the behavioral, transcriptional, and circuitry changes in the central dopamine system after chronic high fat diet and high fat withdrawal in male and female mice. Four models of diet-induced obesity were examined. Chapters 2 and 3 examined diet induced obesity models and standard chow intervention in different age groups in order to reveal a developmental period sensitive to programming effects. We discovered that both age and sex were critical factors in the development and the reversal of neuroadaptations seen in obesity. Early life nutrition is particularly important to the developing brain and overnutrition during this time period leads to epigenetic changes that may contribute to the neuroadaptations that persist after intervention. In chapter 4, we examined exercise as an intervention to prevent the neuroadaptations and neuroinflammation associated with high fat diet intake. We discovered that although exercise had a beneficial effect of weight gain, it was not able to reverse reward dysfunction or neuroinflammation in all cases of high fat intake. It is possible that the neuroadaptations that occur after high fat consumption contribute to the difficulty individuals have with weight loss. Understanding how age and sex impact brain and behavior in the high fat withdrawal stage will have implication for obesity management and interventions. We know now that the brain of an individual is markedly different than the brain of a lean individual and these differences can predispose one to overconsumption during dietary intervention. Since both pharmacological and behavioral therapies are often combined with diet replacement, understanding the brain during this switch and factors that can raise adherence rates will help the success of therapies in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|Once a Cinderella subject, the {{employment}} of people aged 50 and above (often {{referred to in the}} literature as 'older workers') has become an issue of major prominence in recent years. This is no more evident than in the passage of the Age Regulations (October 2006) and with it, New Labour's pledge to encourage age diversity in the workplace. Older people are thus being encouraged to re-enter the labour market through schemes such as the New Deal 50 plus and Pathways to Work or to take up volunteering under the rubric of 'active citizenship'. There is now a variety ofways in which people approaching later life would, on the face ofit, be able to access work, education and training opportunIties. However, past research and current data suggest that there are number ofbarriers to the take up ofsuch opportunities. For instance, research has shown that older workers receive lower performance ratings than their younger counterparts (Saks and Waldman, 1998). The suggestion here is that. negative stereotypes regarding an individual's chronological age may <b>over</b> <b>ride</b> employers' appraisal oftheir older workers. Ageism has been cited as the main barrier to employability and occupational progression for the majority of older workers. Past research in this field has highlighted the discriminatory power of economic myths and stereotypes concerning the work ability of older age groups (for example Taylor and Walker, 1998). The picture to emerge is that older workers are perceived by employers to be less productive, harder to train, and more expensive and difficult to manage than younger workers. It is therefore hoped that policy intervention will have the long term effect of supporting older age groups who have consistently been undervalued and often discarded by employers for simply being 'too old'. Laudable aims, but are employers ready to listen? Moreover are older people (and society at large) ready to refuse to conform to or accept negative images oftheir age group? This research considers the nature and salience of ageism in the UK labour market. It also asks whether ageism alone is enough to explain the extent of the discrimination experienced by older wQmen and men. It looks at these issues through the eyes ofolder people themselves and the organisations that impact upon their lives in an effort to understand the barriers they face in the realm ofwork and employment. Qualitative and quantitative evidence is presented from older individuals and employers across the UK. Analysis of the data supports the existence of ageism in the workplace. It also reveals a gender dimension to the ageism experienced, which works to the detriment of older women and, in a qualitatively different way, older men as well. Yet self-reported examples of ageism were often more implicit than explicit, based around wider cultural stereotypes about people of a certain age. These findings are, of course, in accordance with much related past theory and research. Yet in contrast to previous work, consideration is also given to the part played by individual difference and to broader societal and psychological influences (i. e. life satisfaction). Such an approach indicates that older peoples' experiences of employment are more complex than previously assumed. For example, individuals' experiences of gender and age discrimination are not static, nor isolated from wider personal, historical and social contexts in which they had grown up and grown older. It is therefore argued that the study ofageism should be broadened out and linked to a variety offactors that concern how we as individuals and a society view old age...|$|E
