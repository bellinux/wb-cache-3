5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols <b>or</b> <b>because</b> their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
50|$|At Townsend {{we believe}} that every person is equally {{important}} and that no-one {{has a right to}} harass, insult or cause offence to any other person for any reason. We particularly reject the way that some people abuse others: because they are richer or poorer, older <b>or</b> younger, <b>because</b> they are small or tall, thin <b>or</b> fat, <b>because</b> of the colour of their skin, because they are a teacher <b>or</b> a pupil, <b>because</b> of their religion <b>or</b> beliefs, <b>because</b> of disability <b>or</b> personal problems, <b>because</b> of gender <b>or</b> sexual orientation, <b>because</b> of their looks or what they wear, because of their likes and dislikes, because they are popular <b>or</b> unpopular, <b>because</b> of their ability or lack of ability, because of their nationality or accent,We are all individuals with differences, but we are all members of Townsend and can learn from each other.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, {{a person}} wishes {{something}} good, but God doesn’t help him — maybe because the intention {{came from the}} devil and is not for our benefit; <b>or</b> maybe <b>because</b> it is beyond our strength as we have not attained the necessary spiritual level; <b>or</b> maybe <b>because</b> it doesn’t correspond to our calling; <b>or</b> maybe <b>because</b> the time is not right to initiate it; <b>or</b> maybe <b>because</b> we don’t have the necessary knowledge or strength to accomplish it; <b>or</b> maybe <b>because</b> circumstances will not contribute to its success. Besides this, the devil contrives in every way to paint it as something good so that having inclined us toward it, he could upset our spiritual tranquility or inflict harm on us. That’s why {{it is necessary for}} us to diligently examine all our good desires. Better still, do everything after seeking counsel." ...|$|R

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable <b>or</b> <b>because</b> they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with all}} the success, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> of it, he was resented among some of Johnson's circle. Hawkins, member of Johnson's second club, the Literary Club {{established}} 1764, resigned over a dispute with others of Johnson's circle. The relationship between Hawkins {{and the rest of}} Johnson's friends became so tense that many criticised Johnson for choosing Hawkins in 1784 as one of his executors for his will. However, within hours of Johnson's death, Thomas Cadell and William Strahan asked Hawkins to write a biography and an edition of Johnson's literary works.|$|E
5|$|Following the June 29, 1889 elections, several {{suburban}} townships {{voted to}} be annexed to the city, which offered better services, such as improved water supply, sewerage, and fire and police protection. Hyde Park Township, however, had installed new waterworks in 1883 {{just north of}} 87th Street. Nonetheless, the majority of voters in 1889 supported annexation {{perhaps because of the}} city’s water system for fire prevention <b>or</b> <b>because</b> of the belief that township government had become too unwieldy. After the 1889 annexation Chicago was able to leverage efficiencies as the largest United States city in area and second largest in population.|$|E

5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In addition, medieval cases {{referred}} to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation. Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics <b>or</b> <b>because</b> they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E

5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way to negotiate with the rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety <b>or</b> <b>because</b> Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
5|$|King William, {{using the}} {{treatment}} of Bishop John as a cause for war with Harald, brought a large army north in 12011202. The army, it is said, was so large that Harald capitulated without a fight and agreed to give {{a quarter of the}} revenues of Caithness to William. During this time, Earl Harald's son Thorfinn was captured by the Scots. Whether in revenge for {{the treatment of}} Bishop John, or to cow Harald, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> Thorfinn may have had some claim to the throne through his mother (the lady of Moray), he was blinded and castrated, dying soon later in prison.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water <b>or</b> <b>because</b> it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E

5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|More {{recordings}} {{as leader}} ensued following Hope's return to New York, {{but they did}} little to gain him more public or critical attention. Further drug and health problems reduced the frequency of his public performances, which ended a year before his death, {{at the age of}} 43. He remains little known, despite, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> of, the individuality of his playing and composing, which were complex and stressed subtlety and variation rather than the virtuosity predominant in bebop.|$|E
5|$|Narcosis {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of narcosis. Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of narcosis results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den {{where they}} can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, either because they have arrived as scavengers, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> they have survived capture.|$|E
5|$|Others are obscure {{because of}} the damnatio memoriae {{surrounding}} the lives of antipopes, <b>or</b> <b>because</b> they were refused burial due to excommunication.
