5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> {{with her}} head rested on her hand, while Jones is seated on the floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3, is a {{painting}} by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows two women dressed in white, one sitting <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sofa</b> and the other resting on the floor. The model on the sofa is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. By calling the painting Symphony in White, No. 3, Whistler intended to emphasise his artistic philosophy of corresponding arts, inspired by the poet Charles Baudelaire. The presence of a fan on the floor shows the influence of Japonisme, which was a popular artistic trend in European art at the time. Whistler was also greatly influenced by his colleague and friend Albert Joseph Moore, and their works show considerable similarities.|$|E
