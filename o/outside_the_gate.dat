25|$|Vehicles {{then proceed}} from the Highway 34 {{entrance}} {{north to the}} main gate via Gate Road, a desert dirt road with a speed limit of 10mph. All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass, and all occupants are required to have valid ticket, {{in order to get}} in. Vehicles are also searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at Will Call, the booths are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate. All tickets and vehicle passes must be bought in advance; they are not directly sold <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> or at the Will Call booths. Furthermore, unless they have a valid early arrival pass for the pre-event set up, any vehicle who arrives before the gate opens is turned away and told to go back to Reno, and not to wait {{along the side of the}} road on either Highways 34 or 447 (which would be a safety hazard), nor stay in Gerlach (and overcrowd the small town).|$|E

500|$|Andriamasinavalona {{is remembered}} in Imerina as a king of {{significant}} achievements.

He created the Andohalo town square <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> of Antananarivo, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public. Andriamasinavalona gave the city - previously called by the name of its hill, Analamanga - its current name of Antananarivo, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city, based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely. During his reign the production of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo was dramatically increased. He also increased the number of guns and quantity of gunpowder in Imerina through trade with neighboring kingdoms, and imported the kingdom's first cannons for its defense. Other innovations included the importation and fabrication of plates made from sea turtle skin. He strengthened the social order by creating two new noble castes, putting in place further restrictions and responsibilities for each, and decreeing the right of every woman to choose her own husband.|$|E

The slinky leaves the train, and passes Middleton busking in the train station. The slinky ventures to find the boy, facing a range of challenges along the way; these include avoiding fruit falling on it and riding a skateboard. In {{the middle of the}} music clip, the slinky is shown making its way through a music room in which Powderfinger are performing [...] "My Happiness". It rests on the bar and the band finishes playing, while the background music continues. As Powderfinger leaves, the slinky is picked up by Haug. He gets into a car and places the slinky on the car's dashboard, but it falls out the window as the car turns a tight corner. It lands <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> of a house and is picked up and brought inside to the boy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resulting}} album, <b>Outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> (1988), is Killing Joke's {{most controversial}} album, {{due to its}} synth-led sonics and disagreement over {{the quality of the}} material. Sounds said of the album: [...] "It's a stodgy, inconclusive LP that fails in all but the most basic of senses to achieve its end, leaving us feeling soured and unimpressed". NME shared the same point of view and depicted it as [...] "a private breakfast of ideas, depicting poor old Jaz wading through quicksand with his jeans rolled down yet again. Worse ... he seems to be wandering off in exactly the same direction". <b>Outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> strays from Killing Joke's signature sound, being built around Coleman's orchestral keyboards instead of Geordie's distinctive guitar riffs, which were all but drowned out in the final mix. Two singles, [...] "America" [...] and [...] "My Love of This Land", were released from the album but did little to improve its fortunes. The video for the former song featured Coleman and Geordie with Copley and session bassist Jerome Rimson, who never actually recorded with the band. Virgin dropped the group two months after the release of the album; it also marked the end of their collaboration with the E.G. label.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1970 season, Hershey Park began a {{redevelopment}} plan {{which called for}} the park to become a theme park.

The Miniature Railroad, however, continued to operate despite the addition of the park's gate in 1971. The addition of the gate and the location of the ride placed a portion of the track within the park gate, and a portion of the track outside the park gate. The Comet Hollow station was inside the park, and the Park Boulevard station was <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b> Guests of the park could get their hand stamped so {{they would be able to}} renter the park by taking the Miniature Railroad back to Comet Hollow.|$|E
