Danny changed his name to Dee at Jay Jay's suggestion and thus began TS line up number six. This version lasted just six weeks, with Kevin John Grace departing. When version seven began on April 1, 1976 with new drummer Tony Petri, the group took a heavier musical direction, influenced by Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Slade, and Alice Cooper.|$|E

Though it is {{regarded}} as seminal to the growth of punk rock in England and elsewhere, Lydon has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that it influenced the Sex Pistols: [...] " [...] were all long-haired and of no interest to me.

Move on." [...] On 11 May, the Pistols began a four-week-long Tuesday night residency at the 100 Club. They devoted the rest of the month to touring small cities and towns in the north of England and recording demos in London with producer and recording artist Chris Spedding. The following month they played their first gig in Manchester, arranged by Devoto and Shelley. The Sex Pistols' performance of 4 June at the Lesser Free Trade Hall set off a punk rock boom in the city.|$|E

Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly provided a favorable review, calling the track {{one of the}} best included on Bangerz and describing it as [...] "a merry rap-off with Britney". Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian opined that Spears' inclusion was [...] "a stroke of skewed inspiration", which contributed in making its parent album Cyrus' [...] "game-changer". Writing for Slant Magazine, Kyle Fowle called the song an [...] "Auto-Tuned Euro-house jam" [...] that helped make the album both [...] "a message of empowerment" [...] and [...] "a straightforward party album". In contrast, Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club provided a more mixed review, saying that [...] "Cyrus absolutely cannot rap, as horrifyingly evidenced by her Kreayshawn-like turns" [...] highlighted in the track. Evan Sawdey from PopMatters cautioned that [...] "braggadocio can <b>only</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> (especially with a song that features such a formless sense of melody)", and felt that Mike Will Made It has a [...] "horrid sense of how hooks work, leaving a slew of missed-attempts and mangled opportunities in his wake." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, fellow wrestler Bruno Sammartino {{mentioned}} to McMahon that Albano, a mediocre wrestler who was nonetheless an entertaining speaker, {{might be better}} utilized as a manager. In professional wrestling, a manager might be tasked with behind-the-scenes efforts to help push forward a charge's career or handle his booking, but plays an equal or even greater role in the ring, speaking for his charge and helping rile up the crowd for or against him. Sammartino recalled: [...] "One day I said to Vince Sr., this guy [...] isn't the best wrestler, as a team, they [...] can <b>only</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> But he'd be a great mouthpiece for some guy. Lou has such a gift of gab that he can help out some people. As a wrestler, he just seemed limited. He was always the same. He was never looked upon by promoters as someone who could be anyone special. But as a manager, he shined. That was his calling." [...] Albano, realizing that wrestlers had only a limited lifespan in the ring, and still dealing with his old football injury, agreed. Although it was his decision to split up his ten-year tag team partnership with Altomare, the two remained very close until the latter's death in 2003.|$|E

[...] However, the pacifism and {{concern for the environment}} that formed the basis of Franquin's politics and would be expressed much more bluntly in Idées noires were already surfacing in Gaston (and Spirou et Fantasio). [...] Very occasionally, Franquin stepped over the mark, as in an uncharacteristically angry strip where Gaston uses a toy Messerschmitt plane to strafe the whole office in protest at their (real life) appearance in the magazine's modelling column (while building the model, he says: “… and now, the swastikas. They are very popular amongst retards”). [...] Outside of Spirou however, Franquin had a free rein, and used Gaston in promotional material for diverse organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In the former, activists scare whales away from whalers by plucking the dreaded gaffophone. [...] For the latter, Franquin produced a gut-wrenching sequence where Gaston is beaten and tortured and forced to watch M'oiselle Jeanne raped in front of him, before being sent to a prison camp. In the penultimate frame he faces capital punishment which the punters hope [...] "serves as an example". Awaking in a sweat, Gaston shouts at the reader that [...] "although this was a nightmare, it's happening right now around the world", urging membership.|$|E

[...] Thus far they have succeeded in seeing Grade II listing applied by English Heritage to six buildings on the estate including St. Mark's Church. [...] The conservation of the estate has been spearheaded by the Twentieth Century Society; claiming that the overall layout and planning of the estate is key to its uniqueness and that just keeping six buildings and surrounding them with new houses does not suffice. [...] Despite the Twentieth Century Society campaigning for the entire estate to be made a conservation area and English Heritage recommending 21 buildings be listed, the Department for Culture would <b>only</b> <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as to list six of the buildings. [...] Under listing guidelines for twentieth-century buildings, only buildings with few moderations should be listed; {{in the case of}} Excalibur, most buildings have modified windows and doors. [...] A prominent local resident favouring conservation stated: [...] "The Excalibur Prefab Estate is the largest of its kind now left in Europe. Europe values its war time history, we on the estate think it’s time we did too." [...] Emily Gee of English Heritage said of the estate: [...] "The historical resonance of the estate is considerable. The design of the buildings, with their subtle modern influences, and the community-focused planning of the estate testifies to the thoughtfulness of post-Blitz reconstruction." ...|$|E
