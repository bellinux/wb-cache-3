5000|$|In 2001, the National Railway Museum in York {{discovered}} a November 1971 document featuring sandwich recipes, issued by Director of <b>Rail</b> <b>Catering</b> Bill Currie. The document states its {{aim to make}} BR meals [...] "the best on the track" [...] and describes the precise amount of sandwich filling {{to be placed on}} the sandwich. The recipe also specifies, {{in order to make the}} sandwiches attractive - and to be able to tell what was inside - at least a third of the filling be placed in the centre, so that when cut diagonally, the customer would see the contents. For luncheon meat and sardines, the filling should total two-thirds of an ounce of meat. On an egg and cress sandwich, each sandwich was to contain one-twelfth of a punnet of cress. The document was featured in a 2002 exhibition of the National Railway Museum, [...] "British Rail - A Moving Story". A typical ham sandwich would contain one slice of ham with another slice folded in half and placed diagonally over the first one. When the sandwich was cut diagonally it would make it appear that it contained three slices of ham when in reality it only contained two.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} wavelet decomposing {{technique}} using {{the average of}} the vertical vibration signatures generated at bogie frame with a view to developing the technique as an <b>on-board</b> <b>rail</b> wheel flat monitoring system. Although vibration signatures are affected by a large number of design and operational parameters, such as the track irregularities, the train bogie system damping and variation in loading pattern, the proposed method aims at overcoming these difficulties to provide clear insight into the identification of the existence of wheel flats even at higher operating speeds. The wavelet decomposition method presented in this paper shows that the absolute values of the 4 th level detail component of the acceleration signature averages clearly exhibit the existence and location of the wheel flat damages. One of the advantages of the method is its ability to display the 4 th level detail component as a 2 D plot that is easy to interpret rather than the 3 D plots traditionally used by other researchers as presented in the literature. To illustrate this approach, vertical acceleration signatures of a railway containing flat wheels in the front axles have been generated using a 2 D Matlab-Simulink dynamic simulation system model previously developed by the authors. The simulation results obtained for different operational speeds on a track containing large irregularities presented in this paper, demonstrate that the wavelet decomposition model is an efficient and easy method to identify wheel flats such that it could be integrated into whole-of-train on-board real-time condition monitoring systems...|$|R
5000|$|The total {{road network}} in the city's {{metropolitan}} area is 2,780 km. With Chennai's vehicular population having experienced a surge in the late 1990s, several flyovers were built to reduce the traffic congestion in the city. Of about [...] 15,600 million invested by the state government between 2005 and 2014, Chennai cornered a major chunk of the investment. As of 2017, there are 35 functional flyovers {{in the city and}} around 150 bridges including 12 <b>rail</b> over bridges, <b>catering</b> to the city's vehicular population of about 3.9 million, including about 600,000 cars.

40|$|Lubrication of wheel/rail {{systems has}} been {{recognized}} {{for the last two}} decades as a very important issue for railroads. Energy savings and less friction and wear can be realized if a lubricant can be used at the wheel/rail interface. On the other hand, adverse influences are seen in operating and wear conditions if improper or excessive lubrication is used. Also, inefficiencies in lubrication need to be avoided for economic and environmental reasons. The top-of-rail (TOR) lubricant concept was developed by Texaco Corporation to lubricate wheels and rails effectively and efficiently. Tranergy Corporation has been developing its SENTRAEN 2000 {trademark} lubrication system for the last ten years, and this revolutionary new high-tech <b>on-board</b> <b>rail</b> lubrication system promises to dramatically improve the energy efficiency, performance, safety, and track environment of railroads. The system is fully computer-controlled and ensures that all of the lubricant is consumed {{as the end of the}} train passes. Lubricant quantity dispensed is a function of grade, speed, curve, and axle load. Tranergy also has its LA 4000 {trademark} wheel and rail simulator, a lubrication and traction testing apparatus. The primary task of this project was collecting and analyzing the volatile and semivolatile compounds produced as the lubricant was used. The volatile organic compounds were collected by Carbotrap cartridges and analyzed by adsorption and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The semivolatile fraction was obtained by collecting liquid that dripped from the test wheel. The collected material was also analyzed by GC/MS. Both of these analyses were qualitative. The results indicated that in the volatile fraction, the only compounds on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund List of Analytes detected were contaminants either in the room air or from other potential contamination sources in the laboratory. Similarly, in the semivolatile fraction none of the detected compounds are on the EPA's Superfund List of Analytes. The major compound in the semivolatile fraction is 1, 2 -propanediol, which was also found as the major component of the TOR lubricant before testing. Other compounds found in trace quantities either were present in the TOR lubricant or were small fragments from the polymeric component of the TOR lubricant. The second task for Argonne in this project was to investigate the effects of axle load, angle of attack, and quantity of lubricant on lateral friction forces, as well as the consumption time of the TOR lubricant. The second task was to collect and qualitatively identify any volatile and semivolatile compounds produced upon use of the TOR lubricant...|$|R
40|$|Counties, {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing regions in the nation. Transportation has been a major {{planning}} issue in southeast Florida due to the region's rapid growth. Costs associated with highway expansion projects to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic have skyrocketed. Ironically, expanded highway capacity only seems to attract more traffic and create greater congestion. Interstate 95 (1 - 95), the major north-south arterial in the region, has been carryi ng an excessive amount of traffic generated by the rapid growth of the region. In 1983, the Florida Department of Transportation (FOOT) commissioned a study to determine whether a feasible public transportation system could be developed (FDOT, 1984). After a review of forty-four possible public transportation options, a decision was made in 1986 to develop a commuter rail system extending from the West Palm Beach Amtrak station to the Miami International Airport along the 1 - 95 corridor (Figure 1).

40|$|To keep {{safe and}} {{efficient}} operations of {{high speed rail}} (HSR), a great endeavor is being devoted to developing smarter railways by integrating sensors, information technology, database and predictive modelling tools, aiming at online evaluation of the HSR operational condition and prognosis of breakdown before it occurs. In addition to the <b>on-board</b> instrumentation for <b>rail</b> assets including tracks, trains and pantographs, the sensory system involves monitoring external actions (aerodynamic and earthquake) and detecting obstacles as well. The analytic and predictive modelling tools {{would be able to}} tackle the highly heterogeneous data, uncertainties associated with changing operation and interface status, false positives resulting from sensor fault/malfunction, as well as evolutionary updating and self-adapting of data-driven prognostic models in real time or near real time. Such a smart rail technology is anticipated to empower rail operators to sense and respond quickly to irregular operations and to act appropriately once a breakdown is forecasted.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the need to reduce global energy {{consumption}} and CO 2 emissions in the environment, has been involved even in the railways sector, aimed at the highly competitive concept of new vehicles/transportation systems. The requirements hoped by the operating companies, particularly as concerns tramway and metro-train systems, are increasingly focused on products with so far advanced features in terms of energy and environmental impact. In order to accomplish this possible scenario, this could be put into effects in technological subsystems and critical components, which are able to fulfill not only functional and performance requirements, but also regarding the new canons of energy saving. On the other hand, the regional and national energetic political strategies impose a continuous effort in the eco-sustainability and energy saving direction both for the vehicles and for the infrastructure management. In this scenario, the thesis aims {{to fill the gap}} in the technical literature and deals with improving the energy efficiency of urban rail transport systems by proposing both design methodologies and effective control strategies for supercapacitor-based energy storage systems, to be installed <b>on-board</b> urban <b>rail</b> vehicles or along the rail track. Firstly, a deep, rigorous and comprehensive study on the factors which affect energy issues in a DC-electrified urban transit railway system is carried out. Then a widespread overview of the currently available strategies and technologies for recovery and management of braking energy in urban rail is presented, also by providing an assessment of their main advantages and disadvantages alongside a list of the most relevant scientific studies and well established commercial solutions. Afterwards, some effective control strategies for the optimal energy management of the supercapacitor-based energy storage system have been studied. Extensive simulations have been performed with the aim of validating the proposed techniques by employing a methodology which is based on tests carried out by means of scale models of the real systems. A wide range of experimental tests has been developed and carried out on a laboratory-scale simulator for a typical urban service railway vehicle, in order to fully confirm the theoretical performances, validity, and feasibility of the studied controls, and quantify the technical and economic advantages obtained in terms of global energy saving, voltage regulation, power compensation and infrastructure power loss reduction. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} gain an understanding of the methods and approaches for assessing the use of supercapacitor storage systems in urban rail transit oriented to the optimization of the energy saving and the reduction of the vehicle energy consumption, for whatever technological solutions are adopted...|$|R
