An overall total of 17 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes was forecast, above the average.

The organization noted that when the Atlantic basin was busier than average, as expected in 2005, the eastern Pacific generally saw lesser activity. That same day, NOAA issued a {{forecast for}} activity across the central Pacific, expecting 2 to 3 tropical cyclones to occur across the basin. A normal season averaged 4 to 5 tropical cyclones, including 1 hurricane.

The Last Glacial Maximum {{climate is}} one of the {{classical}} benchmarks used both to test the ability of coupled models to simulate climates {{different from that of the}} present-day and to better understand the possible range of mechanisms that could be involved in future climate change.
