40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) {{was isolated}} from a pig during a survey for possible routes of viral transmission after a SARS epidemic. Sequence and epidemiology analyses {{suggested that the}} pig was infected by a SARS-CoV of human origin. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first identified in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 (1). A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the pathogen; several possible <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coronavirus</b> were suggested from wild animal reservoirs, such as Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs (2 – 8). The virus infects many other wild and domesticated animals, such as Mustela furo, Felis domesticus, and Nyctereutes procyonoides (9, 10), but infection of domesticated pigs has not been previously reported. The Study We surveyed 6 major domestic animal species that are {{in close contact with}} humans and could be infected by SARS-CoV if transmission were possible. The survey was conducted in a suburban area and its extended farming villages, Xiqing County of Tianjin, China, where a SARS outbreak occurred in late spring of 2003. Animal samples, blood and fecal swab specimens, for antibody and RNA detection were collected from the sites and transported on ice to a biosafety level 3 laboratory within 24 hours. We used 2 types of assays for the initial viral screen, immunologic assays to identify antibodies and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the viral genome.

40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) is {{a deadly}} form of pneumonia {{caused by a}} novel coronavirus, a viral family responsible for mild respiratory tract infections {{in a wide variety}} of animals including humans, pigs, cows, mice, cats, and birds. Analyses to date have been unable to identify <b>the</b> precise <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SARS <b>coronavirus.</b> We used Bayesian, neighbor-joining, and split decomposition phylogenetic techniques on the SARS virus replicase, surface spike, matrix, and nucleocapsid proteins to reveal <b>the</b> evolutionary <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> this recently emerging infectious agent.

A bootscan recombination analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spike gene revealed high nucleotide identity between the SARS virus and a feline infectious peritonitis virus throughout the gene, except for a 200 - base-pair region of high identity to an avian sequence. These data support the phylogenetic analyses and suggest a possible past recombination event between mammalian-like and avian-like parent viruses.

It seems that the space inside the envelope would be inadequate for a coronavirus to encapsulate loosely packed RNPs.
