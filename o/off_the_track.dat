5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, who pulled away from Hülkenberg (who went <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E

5|$|On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a {{malfunctioning}} crossover switch {{south of}} the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed. The other rail car slid <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this crash occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.|$|E

This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|The second {{practice}} session {{was held in}} wet but drying weather conditions. During the session, Schumacher went <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at the exit of turnfive, damaging his car's front wing in the process. However, he still set the fastest time of the session (1:23.607) after a change to his car's ride height proved beneficial to its performance. The top six was completed by Berger, Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, and Olivier Panis' Ligier.|$|E

5|$|After {{qualifying}} {{fifth in}} Bahrain, Webber {{had been as}} high as third place in the race but he ultimately finished sixth, taking his points tally to 7 for the season. He followed this up by qualifying fourth and finishing a disappointing 10th after twice running wide <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> in the , although his position was revised to 7th after the disqualification of the BAR team and a resulting penalty to Ralf Schumacher. The race was a poor one for Williams (Heidfeld was 9th before the reclassification), but Webber hit back at the , qualifying 2nd and finishing 6th– his fourth points scoring finish {{in the first five}} races.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E

5|$|As per his contract, Webber {{started the}} year in Melbourne with Red Bull Racing. He {{recorded}} top-six lap times {{in each of the}} three practice sessions, and was on his way to the top ten in the qualifying session when the front right brake disc in his car failed going into turn 6 during Q2, sending him spinning off into the sand trap ending his qualifying session, and resulting in 15th position on the grid. Although starting well, he momentarily went <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at turn 1 to avoid being involved in contact that had already erupted. Webber made several positions by turn 3 but an incident involving himself, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson when he was slightly contacted by Davidson whilst trying to avoid the struggle between the other two drivers, ended his race.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rain {{continued}} {{to affect the}} track in the second practice session. Conditions deteriorated as the session advanced, and several cars elected not to improve their quickest times to avoid driving <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> after going through standing water. Conditions allowed the fastest LMP2 and LMGTE vehicles {{to reach the top}} five quickest overall times. Bamber recorded the fastest time at 2:25.495, nearly half a second faster than Bernhard in the sister Porsche in second. Lotterer was third-fastest and had the fastest time early in the session. Evans achieved the only time under the 2:34.500 mark in LMP2 with a lap of 2:34.370. Lietz led LMGTE Pro with No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari of Rui Águas the fastest driver in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen pitted on lap 53 and {{remained}} in the lead, having built a 20-second lead over Michael Schumacher. Frentzen became the last driver to make a scheduled pit stop on lap 56. At the end of lap 57, with the scheduled pit stops completed, the running order was Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Frentzen, Button, Trulli, Diniz, Irvine, Salo, Wurz, Herbert, Villeneuve, Verstappen, Zonta, Gené, Mazzacane and de la Rosa. Herbert spun while battling for 13th position with Villeneuve. Diniz retired from the race when his engine failed on lap 63. Herbert came under pressure from Verstappen on lap 67 and suffered his second spin, losing the position to Verstappen. Herbert retired on lap 69 {{as the result of}} gearbox problems. Mazzacane pulled <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> on lap 70 and retired because of an engine failure.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{led from}} the start, {{preventing}} Fernando Alonso from overtaking at turn one. Alonso ran wide allowing Nick Heidfeld to overtake him and move into second place. Alonso damaged his car {{in the process and}} subsequently ran <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at turn one a further three times during the race. Jenson Button had a gearbox problem {{at the start of the}} race and was unable to select first gear causing him stall on the grid. Christijan Albers started from pit lane. The first accident of the race involved Scott Speed who clipped the rear wing of Wurz' Williams and went into the hairpin with a broken suspension.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no more rain falling, it dried out as the practice progressed, with drivers soon switching to intermediate tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite going <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new power unit. A gearbox problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second quicker than teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E

5|$|The 39th and 2/14th Infantry Battalions withdrew {{south along}} the track {{on the western side}} of Eora Creek, passing through the 53rd which was holding Alola. The 2/16th withdrew south from Abuari along the eastern side of Eora Creek. Withdrawing in contact, several groups of Australians– {{including}} the 2/14th's headquarters company– found themselves isolated from the main body of Maroubra Force. In the confusion, an Australian counter-attack against the 3/144th caught a group of their own troops in a fierce crossfire. Although the counter-attack was ultimately successful in breaking through the Japanese blocking force, it also forced a large group of Australians <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> Over several days large numbers trekked through the jungle in an effort to rejoin their units. Several were captured by the Japanese in the days that followed, including Key, who was executed by the Japanese after interrogation.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} moved westward {{due to a}} {{high pressure}} ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: the first was around peak intensity and was completed when the hurricane moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after the hurricane began to weaken. The last advisory was issued while the hurricane was west of Mexico, {{but it was not}} until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated. Elida's rapid intensification and unsteady weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in the intensity forecasting of the hurricane. Although the intensity forecasts were <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> forecasts were better than usual compared to the ten-year period prior to that year.|$|E

Trulli drove to his garage for repairs. Button, who was in fifth, started to place Massa under pressure on the same lap. Kobayashi passed Yamamoto on lap twenty-six but ran wide and fell down the order, while Trulli rejoined the race. Di Grassi lost control of his car at turn fourteen after trying to pass Yamamoto on lap twenty-seven; he made light contact with the wall which caused him to retire.|$|E
