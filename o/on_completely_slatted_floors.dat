To understand {{to what extent}} the actual environment has affected the <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> the carbonation depth and corrosion will be examined. The tests showed no mechanical differences between <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> which had been in service for a certain amount of years and newly produces ones. Corrosion could be observed on some of the samples but it was not because of the carbonation process. When comparing the calculations of reinforced and pre-stressed concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> the result showed that the pre-stressed floor could carry up to double the load of what the reinforced <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> could.

Three batches of 17 pigs were kept on each floor type. Pens with litter were not cleaned {{until the end}} of the third fattening period. On average 100 kg of sawdust or 49 kg of straw were used per pig. The growth rate of pigs on litters was higher (P < 0, 01) than that of pigs on <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> : 739 g/d on sawdust, 745 g/d on straw and 686 g/d on <b>slatted</b> <b>floor.</b> Carcass quality at slaughter was not different according to the floor type.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find whether {{laminitis}} like changes in beef cattle were affected by flooring systems and different breeds. Studied breeds were Bayerisch Fleckvieh and Holstein Frisian and the different <b>flooring</b> systems were <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> of iron, concrete and rubber. At slaughter the hind-claws were collected and investigated for the angle between distal phalanx and sole, between distal phalanx and dorsal wall of the claw, haemorrhages of toe and heel area, and the concavity of the dorsal wall. Animals kept on rubber <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> showed a greater angle between distal phalanx and dorsal wall of the claw (P< 0, 01). This change is caused by a greater activity and due to a change of the position of the claw. No relationship was found for concavity and different <b>slatted</b> <b>floors.</b> However claws from bulls kept on concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> showed a convex shape. Most likely the roughness of the concrete is the cause of it. Less haemorrhages of the toe area were found (P< 0, 05) for animals kept on rubber <b>slatted</b> <b>floors.</b> Furthermore, Holstein Frisian bulls showed a smaller angle between the distal phalanx and the sole (P< 0, 05) compared to Fleckvieh.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the emission, proper {{understanding}} of the transportation behaviour of gaseous ammonia inside the slurry pit is required. Numerical simulation by the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique can be used for this purpose. However, direct modelling of <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> is complicated and may be replaced by the porous media model (PMM) as shown in earlier studies. The objective of our study is {{to improve the quality of}} simulation results by PMM, and to assess the effects of air velocity above the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (as affected by wind), pit headspace height (as affected by amount of slurry in the pit) and sidewall height (as affected by the dairy house sidewall) on the airflow features inside the pit and ammonia emission from the pit. Three different CFD models of a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> were developed to evaluate whether porous media is capable to represent a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> for modelling the airflow inside and ammonia emission from the slurry pit, and to study the effect of turbulence treatment in the porous media on the modelling results: a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> model (SFM) which models the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> as it is, a turbulent porous media model (PMM-T) and a laminar porous media model (PMM-L). Both PMM-T and PMM-L represent the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> by porous media, the PMM-T assumes turbulent airflow and the PMM-L assumes laminar airflow in the porous media. The SFM was verified for a dataset acquired from a 1 : 8 scale wind tunnel model of the slurry pit. Results showed that the PMM (PMM-T and PMM-L) were able to predict both the airflow features inside the slurry pit and the ammonia emission from the slurry pit if the resistance parameters and flow regime of the porous media were properly set. In comparison to the SFM, the PMM-T predicted the flow pattern better, but overestimated the turbulence intensity and the consequent emission rate. PMM-L performed better in predicting the ammonia emission rate because of the relatively accurate prediction of turbulence intensity. Simulation results also showed that the ammonia emission rate increased with a higher mean airflow velocity, a smaller headspace height and the presence of sidewalls. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} from barns have a severe {{impact on the}} environment. Especially dairy cattle, kept in loose housing, contribute to the total emission of ammonia up to 50 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} study the influence of airflow on ammonia emissions from pig house slurry in a model growing/finishing pig house with slurry in the pit and a clean <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> with various opening areas, 100 %, 33. 3 %, and 16. 7 %. The 100 % opening area meant that the headspace {{was an integral part}} of the room air space, and this configuration was used as the reference treatment. The pig house model had two sidewall inlets and exhaust in the middle of the ceiling. The liquid slurry used was from a growing/finishing pig building and consisted of 1 % to 2 % dry matter, had pH of 8. 05, and TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) of 2. 38 g/L. Experiments in a model growing/finishing swine barn were conducted to determine the effects of room ventilation rate, slurry pit air exchange rates, <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> openings, and pit headspace on ammonia emissions. The results showed that ammonia emission rate increased as ventilation rate increased with a constant inlet opening. Increase in the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio increased the air exchange rate in the slurry pit, resulting in a higher ammonia emission rate. Different correlations between the ammonia emission rate and the air headspace height in the slurry pit caused by the type of flow in the boundary layer influenced the ammonia transport from the slurry surface to the ventilation air. A statistical model was developed to calculate the ammonia emission rate as a function of ventilation rate, <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio, and slurry pit headspace (R 2 = 0. 93). It was found that the NH 3 emission rate was more sensitive to the ventilation rate than to the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio and air headspace height in the pit. In addition, the NH 3 emission rate was much more sensitive to variations in the ventilation rate at low ventilation rates than at high ventilation rates. Similar sensitivity responses were obtained for both <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio and air headspace height...|$|R

The field study was performed for three day. One large-scale pig house with capacity of 230 pigs operate with deep litter manure system under the fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and one small-scale pig feeding operation with capacity of 200 pigs operated by scraper and straw flow system, located at the Iksan city, South Korea, were investigated in this study.

40|$|Concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> {{has been}} the most common housing system for {{intensive}} beef cattle production in Sweden. The <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> is self-cleaning and does not require any bedding. The labour input therefore is minimal. Concerns have however, been expressed about the negative influence of systems with fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> on animal health and welfare. Consequently the interest in deep litter systems has grown in the recent years. These systems are considered to create better animal environment and they also allow cattle to be housed in uninsulated buildings. The aim of this report is to discuss suitable housing systems for beef cattle in Sweden in the 21 :st century. Both the economic and animal welfare aspects are considered. A housing system must primarily be evaluated based on the physiological and ethological demands of the animals. If the system does not fulfil these demands it should not be considered at all. A recommended housing system must furthermore be economic, both in terms of investment and operation cost. Animal health, aerial environment and the ethological suitability, are important not only to the animal welfare but also have a significant influence on the economic result of the production. The deep litter system is the most common alternative to the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system in Sweden. The main disadvantages of the deep litter system are the large requirement of straw and the relatively high labour demand. The labour input depends very much on the straw handling system, both in the field and at the farmstead. The straw handling system is typically effective and well mechanised in the field, while transfer from the store and distribution in the bedded court too often is a cumbersome and heavy work. Inventive farmers have come up with their own technical solutions to solve these problems. An alternative to decrease the straw requirement is the sloped floor. The sloped floor is another very interesting housing system. Various types of sloped floor have been developed and used around Europe for several years and in recent years a few have been built in Sweden. The sloped floor system takes advantage of cattle preference for an elevated laying area. Animal movements transport the manure down the slop to a scraped passage and the higher parts of the bedded area remains relatively clean and dry. The building investment costs are much lower than that of a building with <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and less straw is needed compared to a deep litter system. Labour input and costs directly connected to the housing system were compared in the fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> deep straw bedding and sloped floor housing systems. The daily straw requirement was set to be 4 kg in the deep straw bedding system and 3 kg in the sloped floor system. The main difference between the systems was the time required for the straw and manure handling. Thus the labour input was shown to be lowest in the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system and highest in the deep straw bedding system. The system related costs, i. e. the building, the manure handling system, straw material, straw handling and labour, were considered in the economic comparison. Eventually differences in daily gain, feed vonversion and energy input were not considered. Two alternatives were looked at. In the first cattle were kept indoor year round and in the second they were allowed a grazing period of 120 days/year. The differences between the systems were small, though the sloped floor had the lowest costs, irrespective of grazing period (see table below). The <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system is expensive to construct while operation costs are low. Hence, to be competitive the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system must be put to efficient use at all times to bring down the cost per animal. Big investment costs, such as systems with <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> pens, in combination with grazing, can be less profitable compared to straw bedded systems. The conclusion is that the same economic result can be achieved by raising beef cattle in considerably better animal welfare systems than <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> pens. Good alternatives are deep straw bedding or sloped floor in uninsulated buildings...|$|R
40|$|Curtain sided deep-pit swine {{finishing}} {{buildings are}} {{popular in the}} industry due to concerns related to odors from outdoor manure storage systems. Local regulators are requesting additional odor reduction from the building. Biofiltration is a technology that reduces odors exhausted from swine buildings if the exhaust air can be controlled. Upward air movement through the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> must be eliminated to treat all pit gasses when the ventilation is operating in a mode with the curtains lowered. Critical (minimal) pit ventilation rates were determined to insure downward air flow through the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> in a swine finishing barn with 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, and 36 percent floor opening. The critical air velocity through the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> averaged 36. 2 ft/min (SD = 1. 2 ft/min). Using a safety factor of 1. 5, the design criterion is 50 cfm/pig for pit ventilation rate before the curtains are lowered for full-slatted barns to assure no upward air movement from the pit after the curtains are lowered. This recommendation will provide continuous biofilter treatment of pit gasses for all ventilation modes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} at experimental stations of IFIP, located in Romillé (France, Trial 1), and INRA, located in Saint Gilles (France, Trial 2), on pregnant sows equipped with individual ear tag accelerometers {{to record their}} activity level: duration of lying, standing and moving sequences. The first trial involved 72 sows penned on a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> in a dynamic group with connected drinkers and automatic feeders, whereas the second trial was carried out on 4 small groups of 6 sows penned on a concrete floor with straw and fed in individual stalls. Firstly, an algorithm was built from video recordings of 24 sows on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (2 x 2 h sequences per sow, 96 h). Secondly, {{the accuracy of the}} algorithm was assessed by recording and sequencing 96 h and 109 h, respectively, on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and concrete floor with straw. The respective sensitivities of the lying, standing and moving behaviours on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> were 94. 4 %, 66. 9 % and 68. 4 %. With straw, lower sensitivity values were found: 93. 65 % for lying, 68. 35 % for standing and 38. 83 % for moving, linked to more investigative behaviours using the head. The final step was to use these data to improve the feeding practices of pregnant sows, taking their activity level into account. The strong inter- and intra-individual variability shown in the physical activity is a limiting factor for detection of health problems, such as lameness, through the accelerometers. Thus we need additional information, especially the behaviour data generated by identified drinkers and automatic feeders...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous {{emissions}} from agriculture {{contribute to a}} number of environmental effects. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are greenhouse gases taking part to the global problem of climate change. Ammonia (NH 3) emissions are responsible of soil acidification and eutrophication and contribute also to indirect emissions of N 2 O. This work evaluated the influence of the type of floor on the emissions of these gases in the raising of weaned pigs. Two trials were carried out. In the first trial, the animals were kept either on fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> or on straw-based deep litter and, in the second one, either on fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> or on sawdust-based deep litter. For each trial and on each type of floor, 2 successive batches of weaned pigs were raised without changing the litter or emptying the slurry pit between the 2 batches. The rooms were automatically ventilated to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The performance of the animals was not significantly different according to the floor type. In trial 1, the nitrogen contents of the straw deep litter (including the substrate) and slurry were respectively 276 and 389 g pig- 1. In trial 2, the sawdust deep litter and slurry nitrogen contents were respectively 122 and 318 g pig- 1. Raising pigs on straw deep litter produced proportionately around 100 % more NH 3 than raising pigs on <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (0. 61 vs. 0. 31 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 05). Differences in CO 2, H 2 O and CH 4 emissions were not significant between systems. Raising pigs on sawdust deep litter produced also proportionately more NH 3 (+ 52 %; 0. 55 vs. 0. 36 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 01) but also more CO 2 (+ 25 %; 427 vs. 341 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and H 2 O (+ 65 %; 981 vs. 593 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and less CH 4 (- 40 %; 0. 52 vs. 0. 86 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) than raising pigs on <b>slatted</b> <b>floor.</b> Practically no N 2 O emission was observed from rooms with <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> while the N 2 O emissions were 0. 03 and 0. 32 g N 2 O-N d- 1 per pig for the straw and sawdust deep litter respectively. The warming potential of the greenhouse gases (N 2 O + CH 4), were about 22, 34 and 168 g CO 2 equivalents per day and per pig on fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> straw or sawdust deep litter respectively.

40|$|Given that exposing {{rapidly growing}} pigs to high ambient {{temperatures}} can induce heat stress, which reduces their welfare and production, this study {{looked at the}} influence of floor cooling on pigs¿ behavior and performance. Pens in room 1 had a solid floor (60 %) and a metal <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (40 %). The pens in room 2 had a concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> at the front (15 %), then a convex solid floor (45 %), and a metal <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> at the back (40 %). Each room was stocked with 144 pigs with a starting weight of around 29. 3 kg (± 4. 1 kg). The area per pig was approximately 1. 0 m 2. In half of the pens in each room, the floor could be cooled by cold water. The floor cooling was activated at ambient temperatures above 25 °C in week 3 and above 20 °C from week 7 onwards. Feed and water were accessible ad libitum. Cooling lowered the surface temperature of the solid floor (25. 0 °C vs. 26. 8 °C, P < 0. 001), reduced the percentage of pigs lying on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (15. 0 % vs. 22. 2 %; P < 0. 001), and increased feed intake (2. 04 vs. 1. 95 kg d- 1 pig- 1, P < 0. 01) and growth rate (753. 2 vs. 720. 4 g d- 1; P = 0. 017). Cooling and pen design affected fouling of the solid floor. The cooled pens were cleaner than the uncooled pens, and the pens in room 2 were cleaner than those in room 1.

The overall prevalence of foot lesions was 39. 6 % in 2283 pigs from 90 representative pig farms in England. The most prevalent lesions were heel/sole bruising (7. 1 %), heel/sole erosion (10. 8 %), heel flaps (8. 4 %) and toe erosion (11. 6 %). Pigs were kept on either solid (41 %), partly slatted (28 %) or fully <b>slatted</b> (31 %) <b>floors.</b> Of the 104 pens with a solid floor, 26 % of pens were outside with straw bedding on a soil base, 33 % were indoors with deep bedding on solid concrete, 25 % were partly deeply bedded on solid concrete and 16 % were sparsely bedded on solid concrete. Only six of the pens with partly <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> were bedded. Multilevel logistic-regression models were built using data from 100 farms to examine the risks for individual foot lesions with prevalences > 5 %. The prevalence of toe erosions was positively associated with deep bedding, whereas deep bedding and soil floors were negatively associated with the prevalence of heel/sole erosions. Heel flaps and heel/sole bruising were both associated with <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> possibly indicating a common aetiology. The greatest reduction in prevalence of all these lesions, from AFp calculations, would be achieved by moving pigs from <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> onto solid floors...|$|R

40|$|Five {{successive}} {{batches of}} fattening pigs were raised, each during a four month period, on a totally concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> in one experimental room and on straw based deep litter in another. The rooms were automatically ventilated {{to maintain a}} constant ambient temperature. Available floor space was of 0. 75 in m(2) per pig kept on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and 1. 20 m(2) per pig kept on the deep litter. With this last system, about 46 kg of straw were supplied per pig throughout a fattening period. The slurry pit was emptied and the litter removed after each batch. Once a month, the emissions of ammonia (NH 3) nitrous oxide (N 2 O), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and water vapour (H 2 O) were measured continuously for 6 consecutive days by infra-red. photoacoustic detection. The performance of the animals was not significantly different according to the floor type. Gaseous emissions from pigs raised on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and on the deep litter were, respectively, 6. 2 and 13. 1 g per pig per day for NH 3, 0. 54 and 1. 11 g per pig per day for N 2 O, 16. 3 and 16. 0 g per pig per day for CH 4, 1. 74 and 1. 97 kg per pig per day for CO 2 and 2. 48 and 3. 70 kg per pig per day for H 2 O. Except for the CH 4 emissions, all the differences were significant (P< 0. 001). Thus, pig fattening on deep litter releases nearly 20 % more greenhouse gases than on <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> with 2. 64 and 2. 24 kg of CO 2 equivalents, respectively (P< 0. 001). Whatever the floor type, emissions increased {{from the beginning to}} the end of the fattening periods by about 5 times for NH 3, 4 times for N 2 O, 3 times for CH 4 and 2 times for CO 2 and H 2 O. Correlation coefficients between CO 2 -emissions and H 2 O, NH 3 and CH 4 emissions were, on average for both floor types, 0. 82, 0. 77 and 0. 74, respectively. Although rearing pigs on straw generally has a good brand image for the consumer, this rearing system produces more pollutant gases than keeping pigs on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Histological {{investigation}} of the dorsal carpal joint integument of differently housed fattening bulls Aim of this trial was to investigate - both macro- and microscopically - the effects of various surfaces on the integument of dorsal carpal joints, the main stress zones when cattle rest and rise, using differently housed fattening bulls as samples. The histological differences, which result from the varying housing types, were described to assess possible postural deformities and their subsequent consequences for animal protection {{with the help of}} the respective re-sults. Additionally the functional circle “rest behaviour” with its respective motion sequence, which is important to the question at hand, was also included in the trial. Fattening bulls are usually held on concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> which serves as surface for moving and resting. Postural integument lesions at the joint regions exposed during the resting and rising process were previously not of scientific interest. They do, however, have a high rele-vance, not only for the assessment of the animals’ well-being, but also regarding possible sub-sequent clinical illnesses and their economic consequences. In this trial animals were divided in four groups (concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> with 2, 5 - 3 m 2 = con-crete group, 32 animals; rubber topped <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> with 2, 5 - 3. 0 m 2 /animal = G 1 -group, 40 animals; rubber topped <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> with 4, 5 - 5. 0 m 2 /animal = G 2 -group, 40 animals; straw housing, 6 animals = straw group). The resting, rising and lie down behaviour of the animals was documented (only <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> groups) and the integument in the dorsal carpal joint area was macroscopically examined. Samples of the respective integument areas of each carpal joint were histologically examined after slaughtering. In addition samples were laterally taken from the animals housed on straw at the carpal joint integument. These were examined and analyzed as reference specimen for non-pressure-exposed integument (lateral control). The analysis of the resting, rising and lie down behaviour showed that the position change and in particular the stress on the carpal joints is delayed or avoided by animals using atypical motion patterns on concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor.</b> The macroscopic inspection of the integument within the area of the dorsal carpal joints con-cerning the trial parameters scab and swelling of connective tissue showed significantly in-creased values in the concrete group in comparison to G 1 and G 2. The carpal joints of the straw group could not be examined at the relevant time of trial due to high defilement. The histological {{investigation of}} the respective pressure-exposed integument areas showed a thickness increase in all experimental groups compared to the results of the lateral control group not exposed to pressure. All integument layers were affected by this increase in thick-ness, its effects increased from the straw over the rubber to the concrete group, while no dif-ferences could be accounted for between the two rubber groups. The so called bursae subcutis occurred in subcutaneous tissue areas with the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> groups, which is to be regarded as adaption to extreme chronic pressure. As reaction to the increased epidermal proliferation rate an accordingly higher developed stratum papillare, which had and increased amount of elastic fibres in the dermis, was found in the concrete group, probably due to the increased shearing forces of the concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor.</b> Within the epidermis were the largest morphometric dif-ferences, to which the stratum corneum contributed the most in terms of numbers. Here the results of the concrete group displayed extreme values, which were about 8 -times increased in comparison to the straw group. For the three <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> types the mitosis rates and the frequency of occurring paraceratosis hyperplasia (nucleated cells in the stratum corneum) correlated as signs of accelerated horni-fication with the layer thickness growth of the epidermis. Deviating values were documented in the straw group. An accumulated presence of inflammation cells could be observed in the concrete and the straw group; it was, however, not statistically significant. While the histological results sug-gested mechanically caused integument lesions as an inflammation cause in the concrete group, various findings pointed to a damage of the integrity of the epidermal barrier function, due to the chemical-physical influence of a wet, liquid manure-impregnated lie down area in the final weeks of life with the straw group. Various histochemical colourings were prepared for the assessment of the keratinisation and hornification of the epidermis. Significant differences between the investigated groups could, however, not be determined. The implemented investigations produced a comprehensive overview of the development of the dorsal carpal joint’s integument under the effects of various housing types and led to a histological explanation of macroscopically visible integument changes. The determined in-tegument changes at the dorsal carpal joint are to be regarded as an attempt of the integument to form a protection against increased mechanical stress. Nevertheless, in case of animals housed on concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> it does lead to the conclusion that a motion pattern which is covering demand and avoids damage is not possible with the rising and lying down process. This demonstrates the high animal-protection risk of this housing type...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} different production systems in pig farming including economic, animal welfare and environmental aspects with computer simulation. The computer model considers a vertically integrated system with farrowing, weaning, fattening and slaughtering stage as well as the transportation of pigs between theses stages. Housing systems were distinguished in individual and group housing with partly/fully <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> or straw. Housing conditions were scaled to animal welfare in a decreasing order from straw, social contact to movement. Environmental issues were measured by nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) excretion. With standard pork production (<b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> individual housing of sows, small groups of fattening pigs) the cost per fattening pig accounted for € 131. 72, N- and P-excretion were 7. 1 and 1. 2 kg per head. Group housing for gestating sows (<b>slatted</b> <b>floor)</b> and a higher number of fattening pigs per group increased welfare scoring by 25 %. Cost, N- and P-excretion were reduced by 3. 5, 5. 1 and 5. 2 %. Group housing of sows during lactation, mating and gestation (with prolonged lactation length 5 weeks; welfare scoring 100 %) and straw in each stage raised production cost by 24. 6 % (€ 32. 31), N- and P-excretion were enhanced to 8. 0 kg (12. 7 %) and 1. 3 kg (10. 5 %) per head...|$|R

40|$|Few {{issues in}} swine {{production}} are {{as complex as}} floor space allowances. One method for pork producers to calculate floor space allowance (A) is to convert BW into a 2 -dimensional concept yielding an expression of A = k * BW 0. 667. Data on ADG, ADFI, and G:F were obtained from published peer-reviewed studies. Five data sets were created: A = grower-finisher pigs, fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> and consistent group size; B = grower-finisher pigs and fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (group size {{did not need to}} be consistent); C = grower-finisher pigs, partially <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> and consistent group size; D = grower-finisher pigs, partially <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (group size {{did not need to be}} consistent); and E = nursery pigs, fully slatted or woven wire floors (group size did not need to be consistent). Each data set was analyzed using a broken-line analysis and a linear regression. For the broken-line analyses, the critical k value, below which a decrease in ADG occurred, varied from 0. 0317 to 0. 0348. In all cases the effect of space allowance on ADG was significant (P < 0. 05). Using the linear analyses based on data with k values of 0. 10); however, none of the linear regressions explained a significant proportion of the variation in ADG. The slopes for the nonplateau portion of the broken-line analyses based on percent values varied among data sets. For every 0. 001 decrease in k (approximately 3 % of the critical k value), ADG decreased by 0. 56 to 1. 41 %, with an average value of 0. 98 % for the 5 %-based analyses. The use of an allometric approach to express space allowance and broken-line analysis to establish space requirements seem to be useful tools for pig production. The critical k value at which crowding becomes detrimental to the growth of the pig is similar in full- and partial-slat systems and in nursery and grower-finisher stages. The critical point for crowding determined in these analyses approximated current recommendations to ensure the welfare of pigs...|$|R
40|$|The ban by 2013 in the EU of {{individual}} accommodations for gestating sows and the renewed interest for litter systems could promote {{in the future}} the group-housing of gestating sows on litter. But what are {{the environmental impacts of}} this rearing technique? To answer this question, a study was scheduled to quantify pollutant gas emissions (nitrous oxide -N 2 O-, methane -CH 4 -, carbon dioxide -CO 2 - and ammonia -NH 3 -) according to floor type in the raising of group-housed gestating sows. The trial was carried out in experimental rooms located at Liège University (Belgium). Three successive batches of 10 gestating sows were used for this trial. Each batch was divided into 2 homogeneous groups randomly allocated to one of two treatments: concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> or straw-based deep litter. The groups were kept separately in two identical rooms equipped with a pen divided into a lying area (<b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> or deep litter) and five individual feeding stalls. The feeding stalls were equipped with front feeding troughs and rear gates preventing access to the stalls outside of the feeding time. Between each batch of sows, the pens were cleaned. In both rooms, ventilation was automatically adapted to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The gas emissions were measured 3 times (weeks 2, 5 and 8 of stay) during 6 consecutive days by infra red photoacoustic detection. Sow performance (body weight gain, backfat thickness, number and weight of piglets) was not significantly affected by floor type. With sows kept on <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> gaseous emissions were significantly greater for NH 3 (12. 77 vs. 9. 05 g d- 1 sow- 1; P 0. 05). In conclusion, the main environmental disadvantage of the deep litter system pointed to in this study was the greater N 2 O-emissions and thus greater CO 2 eq-emissions compared to <b>slatted</b> <b>floor.</b> However, the use of deep litter was related to reduced NH 3 - and CH 4 -emissions.

Housing conditions of both groups differed in kind of cubicles. EBG had soft rubber mat mattresses, BBG had cubicles with straw manure mattresses. Data analysed originated from the official milk performance testing of the "Landeskuratorium der Erzeugerringe für tierische Veredelung in Bayern e. V. " and from activity counters worn by the cows. Statistical analysis resulted in a significant higher activity level of the EBG versus BBG.

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study of 103 {{indoor and outdoor}} British pig farms {{was carried out in}} 2003 - 2004. Over 12, 000 pigs aged from 3 days up to multiparious breeding sows were examined. Prevalence of foot, limb and body lesions and lameness was recorded using clear case definitions. Detailed data were also collected on the pen or paddock that the pigs were housed in with particular reference to the floor design, material and condition. Associations between prevalence of disease and the environment the pig was housed in were analysed using multilevel regression models. Post-mortem examination of a small sample of foot and limb lesions was carried out to better understand the pathology. There was a lower prevalence of body and limb lesions in pigs of all ages, and foot lesions in preweaning piglets, housed outdoors compared with indoors. However, there was little difference in the prevalence of foot lesions and lameness in gilts and pregnant sows kept indoors compared with outdoors. In most pigs housed indoors, there was a trend for an increased risk of limb and body lesions and lameness in pigs housed on hard and <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> compared with solid concrete floors with bedding. Although, in contrast to this the prevalence of wounds on the limbs in piglets was lower on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> compared with solid concrete floors. The associations between foot lesions and indoor floor type varied with the age of the pig and the type of lesion. In piglets, sole bruising was associated with housing on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> while sole erosion was associated with housing on solid concrete floors without bedding. In gilts and sows, heel flaps were associated with housing on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> while toe erosion was associated with solid floors with deep bedding.
