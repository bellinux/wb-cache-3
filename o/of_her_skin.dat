25|$|At age forty-six, Digby {{traveled}} to the Middle East, {{and fell in love}} with Sheik Abdul Medjuel el Mezrab (also known as Sheikh Mijwal Al Mezrab in accounts by contemporary Western travellers in Syria). Medjuel was a sheik of the Mezrab section of the Sba'a, a well-known sub-tribe of the great 'Anizzah tribe of Syria'. However, Abdul Medjuel or Abdul Mijwal (Slave of Medjul dates) is a nonsensical name. Arabic sources give the Shaikh's name as Mijwal al-Musrab. He was twenty years her junior, and the two were married under Muslim law and she took the name Jane Elizabeth Digby el Mezrab. Their marriage was a happy one and lasted until her death twenty-eight years later. It has been written that Jane Digby was referred to as Shaikhah Umm al-Laban (literally Shaikhah Mother of Milk, i.e., Milky lady) due to the colour <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E

25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|The Wicked Witch of the West also changes {{significantly}} between {{books and}} movie. In the books no mention is ever made <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> color, {{whereas in the}} movie she is green without explanation, although the Winkies she has enslaved and turned into soldiers are also green. In the book it is implied but not stated that she dresses in yellow, as yellow is the official dominant color of the Winkie Country where she rules, whereas in the movie she dresses entirely in black. In the book she is portrayed as having only one eye, which is so powerful it could see distant objects like a telescope, but in the movie she uses a crystal ball to watch Dorothy and her friends from afar. The 1939 MGM film makes the first reference to The Witches of the East and West being sisters, which {{was not the case}} in the book; none of the Witches in Baum's Oz are related.|$|E

At an unspecified time in her youth, she had suffered from migraines.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} {{precedent for}} Larsen's depiction of Clare and Jack's relationship was the 1925 legal trial {{known as the}} [...] "Rhinelander Case" [...] (or Rhinelander v. Rhinelander). On the urging of his family, Leonard Kip Rhinelander, a wealthy white man, sued his wife, Alice Beatrice Jones, for annulment and fraud; he alleged that she had failed to inform him of her [...] "colored" [...] blood. The case concerned not only race but also status and class, as he had met {{her when she was}} working as a domestic. Although the jury eventually returned a verdict for Alice (she contended that her mixed race was obvious, and she had never denied it), it came at a devastating social cost for both parties; intimate exchanges between the couple were read out in court, and Alice was forced to partially disrobe {{in front of the jury}} in the judge's chambers in order for them to assess the darkness <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
500|$|After {{a string}} of films {{in which she was}} cast to add glamour, Kaif {{appeared}} in Kabir Khan's terrorism drama New York (2009). Featuring John Abraham and Neil Nitin Mukesh in lead roles, the film tells the story of how three friends' lives are changed when the former is wrongly detained after 9/11. Kaif played Maya, a college student who later marries a terrorist. The actress said that she identified with Maya, since she experienced similar isolation because <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> colour {{when she was growing up}} in London. Kaif also remarked that she was tired of [...] "arm candy" [...] roles and was looking for more substantial parts. New York did well at the box office and received favourable reviews. According to Subhash K. Jha, Kaif [...] "comes into her own as an actress of substance... From the carefree effervescent campus girl to the anguished wife, Katrina makes the journey look plausible all the way". New York brought Kaif her first Filmfare Award nomination for Best Actress. She then appeared in a cameo for India's first underwater thriller Blue.|$|E
500|$|The stream's course leads Olivero to a mill, where {{through a}} lighted window {{he sees a}} woman tied to a chair, forced by the miller to drink the blood of a freshly {{slaughtered}} lamb. Instinctively, Olivero hurls himself through the open window, his [...] "leap {{into the world of}} fantasy". The miller initially offers no resistance and allows Olivero to release the woman, whom he recognises by the colour <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin</b> to be Sally, one of the two green children who had mysteriously arrived in the village on the day he left, thirty years earlier; Olivero also recognises the miller as Kneeshaw, an ex-pupil at the village school where he had once taught. During a struggle between the two men Kneeshaw is accidentally drowned in the mill pond. The next morning Olivero and Sally continue on Olivero's quest to find the stream's destination, a pool in the moors high above the village. Paddling in its water, Sally begins to sink into the silvery sand covering its bed. Olivero rushes to her, and hand in hand they sink beneath the water of the pool.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Unger curated a {{show called}} “In a Dark Vein,” at the Sculpture Center in New York. It {{featured}} work by women who used the human figure to shape feelings of fear, loss, and pain and was inspired by Unger's own struggle with cancer. [...] In this show, she {{tried to focus on}} a more naked and physical reality and the search for experience that is shared and elemental. [...] Unger included her bonded iron sculpture, Guardian, which both expresses and mediates suffering. [...] It shows a nude woman, cut off at the waist, with her hands on her hips. [...] The sculpture's mouth is like a pit facing the sky and her arms are like wings. [...] The earthly figure suggests a fertility goddess insisting on her ability to reproduce and crying to get out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>skin.</b> “In a Dark Vein” was filled with representations of the female body shaped by a woman’s hand.|$|E
