The affairs either ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> or were halted after Caitlin discovered his infidelity. In March 1943 Caitlin {{gave birth to a}} daughter, Aeronwy, in London. They lived in a run-down studio in Chelsea, made up of a single large room with a curtain to separate the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|In May 1969, {{discontent with}} Krieger's {{economic}} policies led to riots {{in the cities}} of Corrientes, Rosario and Córdoba. Krieger was removed, but the Onganía administration was unable to agree on an alternative economic policy. By 1970, the authorities were no longer capable of maintaining wage restraints, leading to a wage-price spiral. As the economy started to languish and import substitution industrialization ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> urban migration slowed. Per capita income fell, {{and with it the}} standard of living. Perón’s third term of office was characterized by an expansive monetary policy, which resulted in an uncontrolled rise in the level of inflation.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was complicated for the Americans by {{the launching of}} two smaller attacks by the North Vietnamese: the first aimed to seize Kon Tum in the Central Highlands, and threatened to cut South Vietnam in two; the second prompted a series of savage battles in and around An Lộc, the capital of Bình Long Province. A total of 14 PAVN divisions were now committed to the offensive. On 13 May 1972, South Vietnam launched a counteroffensive with four divisions backed by massive U.S. air support. By 17 May, Quảng Trị City was retaken, but the South Vietnamese military ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam.</b> The PAVN thrusts against Kon Tum and An Lộc were contained. During these operations, the North Vietnamese suffered approximately 100,000 casualties while the South Vietnamese suffered 30,000 fatalities during the fighting.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, two ALCO RS-3 1,500 h.p. {{diesel-electric}} locomotives were purchased. With the phasing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>steam</b> power, by 1970 Jamaica's railways had fourteen {{diesel-electric locomotives}} {{and only one}} steam locomotive was still in operation. Between 1972 and 1976, an additional 18 ALCO RS-8's, manufactured by MLW in Canada, were purchased in three batches of six locomotives.|$|R
25|$|These later, {{and much}} larger, {{compound}} Mallet locomotives were built by Ansaldo in Genova in 1938 to largely replace the earlier types, both the 440 Series and the unsuccessful 441 Series. The latter were simple locomotives (i.e., non-compound) and found liable to run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> on the heavy grades of the line. Four {{of them are}} still in existence of which three are in running order.|$|E
25|$|As {{the poor}} quality of coal {{available}} after World War II exacerbated {{the problems of}} firing the C class and industrial action in the mines threatened supply, the entire class was converted to oil firing from 1946 onwards following an initial conversion of C 15 in 1946.

25|$|For {{the fourth}} series, the title {{sequence}} was changed, and other changes including DCI Haskins being absent {{from a number}} of episodes. The final series has been criticised as the weakest. This decline in quality led John Thaw and Dennis Waterman to the realisation that the show was in danger of running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> and to take the decision to end it while it was still at the peak of its popularity.|$|E

25|$|Malinovsky hastily {{rushed the}} 48th Guards Rifle Division and two {{anti-tank}} artillery regiments {{forward from the}} front reserve, and the 82nd Guards and 152nd Rifle Divisions were concentrated to defend the city. The German counterattack ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> but the 8th Guards Army was significantly weakened due to bad road conditions causing its artillery and tanks to lag behind, as well as ammunition shortages. On 10 February the 4th Guards Mechanized Corps was withdrawn to the reserve in the Apostolovo area due to losses.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Awdry, {{for whom}} the stories were first devised, {{continued}} writing the stories almost by accident. He was a keen railway enthusiast like his father, {{and it was on}} a visit to the Nene Valley Railway that he received the inspiration for his first story. A railwayman's account of a locomotive running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> short of its destination became Triple Header, a story in which Thomas, Percy and Duck take on Gordon's Express but find it more than they can handle. Christopher devised three other stories, Stop Thief!, Mind That Bike and Fish.|$|E
25|$|He debuted for the Danish {{national}} team under manager Rudi Strittich in the July 1972 friendly match against Iceland. He scored two goals as Denmark won 5–2, and Simonsen {{was included in}} the Danish squad for the 1972 Summer Olympics. At the Olympics, he scored three goals in the first three matches to help Denmark advance beyond the first group stage. In the second group stage, Simonsen ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> and he was substituted at half time in two of the last three games as Denmark were eliminated.|$|E

25|$|The project ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> {{following}} ministerial {{changes and}} the start of World War I which affected the economy of Argentina and the input of technology and investment required from Europe. The northern main line from the coast reached Ingeniero Jacobacci in 1916. 282km of the southern main line from Deseado to Las Heras, and the 197km branch line from Comodoro Rivadavia to Sarmiento were laid, but never connected with each other or the northern network. After 1916, the only further work was the completion of the link from Jacobacci to Bariloche, finished in 1934.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{logistics}} had now {{improved to}} the point where a steady rhythm of limited attacks could be kept up, as opposed to single large attacks which ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> like the Spring German offensives. Byng's Third Army launched the Battle of Albert between the Scarpe and the Ancre on 21 August. Byng had fewer tanks (156) than Rawlinson had had at Amiens, and apart from the elite New Zealand and Guards divisions, many of his troops were teenaged British conscripts. Haig - as with his previous offensives in 1916 and 1917, but now also urged on by Foch - encouraged his subordinates to aim for ambitious objectives, in this case urging Byng to revise his plans to thrust from Albert to Bapaume as quickly as possible, although Byng appears to have largely ignored him and made little use of cavalry. The attack reached Amiens-Arras railway.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{program of}} {{lend-lease}} {{was extended to}} Soviet Union in September 1941, supplying planes, tanks, trucks and other war materials. Eventually the Soviets managed to slow the Wehrmacht's blitzkrieg, halting the Nazi offensive in December 1941 outside the gates of Moscow, in part because mobilized troops with winterized clothing from Siberia were transferred from there after Stalin realized that Japan {{was not going to}} attack the Soviet Union (Japan had just attacked Pearl Harbor). The Red Army launched a powerful winter counteroffensive which pushed the Germans back from the outskirts of Moscow. At the start of 1942, the weakened Axis armies abandoned their march on Moscow and advanced south towards the Caucasus and Volga river. This offensive, in turn, ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam</b> in autumn 1942, allowing the Soviet forces to stage a devastating counteroffensive on the overextended enemy. The Red Army encircled and destroyed significant German forces at the Battle of Stalingrad, which ended in February 1943 and reversed the tide of the war in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The German Spring Offensive {{in early}} 1918 saw them gain a {{considerable}} amount of ground as the Allies were forced back. During this time, the 35th Battalion was dispatched to defend the town of Amiens, taking up positions around Villers-Bretonneux. As the German onslaught began to run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> the Australians launched a counter-attack at Hangard Wood on 30 March 1918. On 4 April, the Germans made another attempt at taking Villers-Bretonneux, and the 35th Battalion was heavily engaged in turning this back. Casualties during this time were heavy, consisting of an estimated 70 per cent of the battalion's strength. On 8 August 1918, the Allies launched their own offensive, the Hundred Days Offensive, and the 35th was again committed to the fighting around Amiens. Following this they were involved in several engagements as Allied forces advanced towards the defences of the Hindenburg Line. Their final involvement in the war came in September when the battalion was called upon to provide reinforcements for the joint Australian–American operations to breach the German line.|$|E
25|$|The {{negotiations}} dragged on, and Colonel Zorbas {{lacked the}} political skills {{to keep up}} with the seasoned veterans on the government side. Mavromichalis, in securing passage of a large number of mildly reformist bills, implemented part of the programme demanded by the Military League, this time under threat of an actual military takeover. Thus, the general staff was reorganised and those close to Constantine (such as Ioannis Metaxas) were removed while budget cuts were made in order to finance army modernisation. But his government clearly showed that the old system endured: only Finance Minister Athanasios Eftaxias had reformist ideas. With the revolution running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steam,</b> the League began to crumble. It was not a real political movement: its ideology and programme lacked coherence; its leaders were popular but unskilled. They were above all soldiers ill at ease outside their barracks. The League had known how to link its corporatist demands to public discontent by using populist and nationalist slogans, but it unsettled the bourgeoisie. Although it saw the necessity of modernising the country, the middle classes feared the drift towards a military dictatorship, considered deleterious to the normal progress of affairs.|$|E
