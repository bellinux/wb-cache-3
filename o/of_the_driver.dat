5|$|The {{commander}} version {{incorporates a}} 5-door hard top cab {{allowing for the}} quick and convenient entrance and exit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and all passengers or troops. A large rear compartment enables the storage of both cargo and communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, {{a passing}} {{motorist}} spotted the fugitives by Interstate 80 and called police. The men fled when authorities {{arrived at the}} scene shortly after, but Bostic was tackled by a state trooper shortly after 6 p.m., while Ellis managed to escape. At 8 a.m. the next morning, Ellis was cornered near I-80 by two police dogs. Both men were extradited to New York from Pennsylvania on July 12. Police brought Timoshenko's handcuffs and used them to apprehend Ellis during his arrest. Police did not release the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> who assisted the suspects.|$|E
5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to the doctrine of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract. Under the Married Women's Property Act 1882 a husband can take out insurance in his own name, but make it enforceable by his wife and children despite the doctrine of privity.|$|E
50|$|Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> {{who failed}} to finish the race had crashed during the race. <b>The</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> {{who failed to}} finish the race had {{problems}} with their camshaft, engine, shocks, head gasket and an overheating vehicle.|$|R
30|$|Condition 2 : The {{corresponding}} mean absolution {{deviation of}} all <b>drivers</b> (belonging to <b>the</b> same <b>driver</b> group) is less {{or equal to}} 20  % (15  % for 100  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> is rationally equal to 20  % for <b>the</b> 75  % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers).</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{change in}} threat {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> ties {{in with the}} psychometric paradigm that hypothesises people’s subjective risk assessment changes with <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> information they are supplied. A specific warning about <b>the</b> likelihood <b>of</b> an attack increased its perceived probability in <b>the</b> minds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> [45].|$|R
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E
5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower {{that can not be}} damaged by the car's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it.|$|E
25|$|Apart from that, the {{passenger}} can place the sectional fare into the farebox. However, this is permitted {{at the discretion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
30|$|Thirty two (8.0 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> were {{visually}} impaired (VI) {{in one eye}} with cataract, <b>the</b> leading cause <b>of</b> visual impairment in <b>the</b> better eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected <b>drivers.</b>|$|R
25|$|US {{standards}} specify <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> eye {{is defined}} as 1080mm (3.5ft) above the pavement, and <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> needs to see as 600mm (2.0ft), which is equivalent to <b>the</b> taillight height <b>of</b> most passenger cars.|$|R

25|$|Thiele/Small {{parameters}} (individual drivers only)– {{these include}} the driver's Fs (resonance frequency), Qts (a driver's Q; more or less, its damping factor at resonant frequency), Vas (the equivalent air compliance volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver),</b> etc.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 1972, {{locomotive}} E6001 was hauling {{a freight}} train that ran into the rear of a passenger train at , London due to inattentiveness on the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> Twelve people were injured.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{lower edge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cab window forward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> door and <b>the</b> lower edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> {{windscreen}} were horizontal, whereas on pre-war examples they curved downwards towards <b>the</b> corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cab. Also, the lower offside bodyside, behind the rear wheel, did not curve in, {{as it did}} ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> cabs {{are made}} from 4 mm thick steel plate. The front window panes can be {{utilised}} on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive, and are simply glued into the body without window frame. <b>The</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> cab is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, not the roof. The four doors on the sides lead directly into <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> cabs and are made of light alloy.|$|R
50|$|Teenagers {{and male}} drivers drive faster than <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R
25|$|A new safety-oriented {{instrument}} panel featured a steering column designed to collapse under impact, and the gauges and controls were grouped in a hooded binnacle front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> with the dashboard pushed forward {{and away from}} the passengers.|$|E
25|$|When the {{practical}} exam is completed by a 17-year-old, {{he or she}} also needs a pass to get their licence. The pass includes the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and the name(s) of the supervisors: only the supervisors named on the pass can supervise.|$|E
25|$|Other {{enclosure}} types {{alter the}} rear sound radiation {{so it can}} add constructively to the output {{from the front of}} the cone. Designs that do this (including bass reflex, passive radiator, transmission line, etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
50|$|Relatively few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> have {{individual}} sponsors, {{although this}} is permitted.|$|R

25|$|The {{exterior}} styling of the X308 {{was similar}} to the X300 with minor refinements such as a change to oval indicator lenses and amber style round fog lights. The interior was also updated to eliminate the instrument binnacle used on the X300; instead, three large gauges were set into recesses in the walnut-faced dashboard in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{second test}} {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> driving on a route set {{by a government}} supervisor, who also supervises the driver himself. This test is considered especially difficult in the larger cities and the failure statistics show similar results. This test demands perfection as the driver {{is not allowed to}} make any mistakes at all.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal {{alignment}} in {{road design}} consists of straight sections of road, known as tangents, connected by circular horizontal curves. Circular curves {{are defined by}} radius (tightness) and deflection angle (extent). The design of a horizontal curve entails the determination of a minimum radius (based on speed limit), curve length, and objects obstructing the view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E

25|$|Licence used by {{drivers who}} are {{residents}} of the associated countries of the European Union have a standard look and contain the information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> common to all countries, developed in 1998. Exceptions to this general rule apply to small parts of this document. Polish driving licences issued from the late 1990s comply with these standards.|$|E

25|$|The 1958 Corvette {{received}} a body and interior freshening {{which included a}} longer front end with quad headlamps, bumper exiting exhaust tips, a new steering wheel, and a dashboard with all gauges mounted directly in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> Exclusive to the 1958 model were hood louvers and twin trunk spears. The 1959–60 model years had few changes except a decreased amount of body chrome and more powerful engine offerings.|$|E
