2500|$|Jacob Leisler is an {{important}} figure in the early histories of both New Rochelle and the nation.

When word reached New York City of the invasion of England by William of <b>Orange,</b> <b>forcing</b> King James to flee to France, militia officers deposed the royal authority by force of arms (but without actual combat) and named Leisler their commander-in-chief. [...] He went on to take control of Albany, and appointed himself lieutenant governor of the province, collected taxes and launched an unsuccessful invasion of New France (Canada). The New York City government did not acknowledge his legitimacy, but he had effective control of the city. It was during this time that he acted on behalf of the Huguenots. [...] When the new king William finally sent a representative and troops to re-establish royal control, Leisler was convicted by him of treason and executed, even though the rationale for Leisler's rebellion had been to take control on behalf of the new king and to prepare the province to defend itself from an expected invasion by France, which had immediately declared war when William took the throne. [...] Leisler was posthumously pardoned by parliament and his property, which had been confiscated as part of the punishment for treason, was restored to his heirs.
