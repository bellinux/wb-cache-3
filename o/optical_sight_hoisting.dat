40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>sight</b> {{is a new}} {{metaphor for}} {{selecting}} distant objects or precisely pointing at close objects in virtual environments. <b>Optical</b> <b>sight</b> combines ray-casting, hand based camera control, and variable zoom into one virtual instrument {{that can be easily}} implemented for a variety of Virtual, Mixed, and Augmented Reality systems. The <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> can be modified into a wide family of tools for viewing and selecting objects. <b>Optical</b> <b>sight</b> scales well from desktop environments to fully immersive systems...|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} day <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> available for the M200 Intervention. The standard <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 variable magnification telescopic sight with a 56 mm objective. The alternative <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is the US Optics SN-9. The night vision system is the AN/PVS-14 GEN III Pinnacle monocular, which attaches to the day optic using the Monoloc device. An AN/PEQ-2 infrared laser provides additional lighting in low-light conditions. The device {{is attached to a}} titanium strut.|$|R
25|$|The {{ergonomic}} {{design of the}} controls such as handles, launcher, barrel shape and <b>optical</b> <b>sight,</b> is predefined standard. All controls are easy to handle in all shooting positions (lying, kneeling or standing). After the weapon is fired, the firing mechanism with the attached <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> is removed and the barrel thrown away, the firing mechanism is reusable. The effective combat range of Panzerfaust 3 is between 15 and 300 metres against moving and 400 and 600 metres against static targets. An <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> with line pattern fixed to the reusable firing mechanism enables to engage moving or static targets. To ensure night combat capability, a night-vision device or residual light amplifier {{can be set up}} in front of the <b>optical</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2014 the Irish Army began issuing {{upgraded}} Steyr AUG bullpup {{assault rifles}} to its operational units. The modularity of the AUG allowed the Irish AUG A1 model rifles to be modernized without any gunsmithing, by replacing the original A1 housing/receiver group (with 1.5× <b>optical</b> <b>sight)</b> with an A3 housing/receiver group (with MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail {{on top and}} right side) allowing a modern <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> to be fitted.

50|$|During the Crimean War, {{the first}} <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> were {{designed}} to fit onto rifles. Much of this pioneering work {{was the brainchild of}} Colonel D. Davidson, using <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> produced by Chance Brothers of Birmingham. This allowed a marksman to observe and target objects more accurately at a greater distance than ever before. The telescopic sight, or scope, was originally fixed and could not be adjusted, which therefore limited its range.|$|R
5000|$|For the 5.45×39mm AK-74, the East German Zeiss ZFK 4×25, 1P29, Belorussian BelOMO PO 3.5×21P, PO 4×24P and the 1P78 Kashtan {{dedicated}} {{side rail}} mounted <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> were developed. These <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> are primarily designed for rapid target acquisition and first round hits out to 400 m, but by various means these <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> also offer bullet drop compensation (BDC) (sometimes {{referred to as}} ballistic elevation) for aiming at more distant targets. The BDC feature compensates for the effect of gravity on the bullet at given distances (referred to as [...] "bullet drop") in flat fire scenarios. The feature must be tuned for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of gun and cartridge at a predefined muzzle velocity and air density. Since the usage of standardized ammunition is an important prerequisite to match the BDC feature to the external ballistic behaviour of the employed projectiles, these military <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> are intended to assist with field shooting at varying medium to longer ranges rather than precise long range shots.|$|R

Purpose-built sniper rifles and anti-materiel rifles are accurate to ranges of more than 2000 m.|$|R

50|$|Today, several militaries issue {{telescopic}} sights {{to their}} infantry, usually compact, low-magnification sights suitable for snap-shooting. The US military issues the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG), {{designed to be}} used on the M16 rifle and M4 carbine. American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan frequently purchase their own combat optics and carry them from home. The British army fields the SA80 rifle with the SUSAT 4× <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> as standard issue. The Canadian Forces standard C7 rifle has a 3.4× Elcan C79 <b>optical</b> <b>sight.</b> Both Austria and Australia field variants of the Austrian Steyr AUG which has built an integral 1.5× <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> since its deployment in the late 1970s. The German Army G36 assault rifles have {{a more or less}} built in dual combat sighting system consisting of a ZF 3x4° telescopic sight combined with an unmagnified electronic red dot sight. The dual combat sighting system weighs 30 g due to a housing made out of glass fibre reinforced polyamide. All German G36 rifles are adapted to use the Hensoldt NSA 80 II third-generation night sight, which clamps into the G36 carry handle adapter in front of the <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> housing and mates with the rifle's standard dual combat sighting system.|$|R

5000|$|The C7A1 (Diemaco C7FT) {{replaces the}} iron sight/carrying handle {{used on the}} C7 with a {{modified}} Weaver rail for mounting optics. Canadian development of rails preceded U.S. standardization of the MIL-STD-1913 [...] "Picatinny rail", so the [...] "Canadian Rail" [...] or [...] "Diemaco Rail" [...] differs slightly. There are 14 slots instead of 13, and each slot is narrower. The height of the rail is also higher, allowing the use of normal-height front sight post whereas a Picatinny rail {{requires the use of}} a higher F-marked front sight post. During development, the original rails were vacuum-bonded {{to the top of a}} bare receiver. For production, the rail and receiver were made out of a single forging. The mount can use traditional iron sights or the ELCAN C79 <b>Optical</b> <b>Sight</b> 3.4× power <b>optical</b> <b>sight,</b> both of which can be adjusted for individual eye relief. The <b>optical</b> <b>sight</b> was designed for the C9 light machine gun and includes horizontal and vertical mil-bars used for range determination and deflection, and a tritium glow-in-the-dark aiming post rather than the traditional crosshairs. The 3.4× is powerful enough to properly see targets at the maximum accurate range of 400 m, though like most magnified <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> it is prone to criticism for creating tunnel vision in close quarters situations. While the wide aperture helps to speed target acquisition, Canadian soldiers generally forgo the C79 sight in favour of non-magnified <b>optical</b> <b>sights</b> or backup iron sights when engaged or training in close quarters battle. The front sight was changed from the square post to a round post 0.05 in in diameter.|$|R
2500|$|Optical or {{prismatic}} hand-bearing compass, {{most often}} used by surveyors, but also by cave explorers, foresters, and geologists. These compasses generally use a liquid-damped capsule and magnetized floating compass dial with an integral <b>optical</b> <b>sight,</b> often fitted with built-in photoluminescent or battery-powered illumination. [...] Using the <b>optical</b> <b>sight,</b> such compasses can be read with extreme accuracy when taking bearings to an object, often to fractions of a degree. Most of these compasses are designed for heavy-duty use, with high-quality needles and jeweled bearings, and many are fitted for tripod mounting for additional accuracy.|$|R
