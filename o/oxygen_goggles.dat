Its theoretical part describes physiology of breathing and the oxygen therapy as such. It describes individual sources of oxygen and indications for oxygen administration. It also describes principles to be observed during oxygen administration. Specific aids are used for oxygen administration, particularly oxygen masks or <b>oxygen</b> <b>goggles.</b> Quality pulmonary rehabilitation is also necessary to make oxygen therapy more effective. Pulmonary rehabilitation is particularly important for patients after a cardiac surgery {{and it should be}} practiced even before the surgery. This approach is critical because in the post-surgery period the therapy makes it possible for the patient to breathe and to expectorate properly. Pulmonary rehabilitation is practiced with patients by general nurses at the cardio surgery ward, as well as by physiotherapists. There are various techniques available to determine efficiency of oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation. The techniques may be classified as invasive and non-invasive; the most frequently used non-invasive method is pulse oxymetry and the most frequently used invasive technique is blood collection for ABR. Two objectives were set for the thesis. The first objective was to map knowledge of nurses about how to provide care to patients treated with oxygen therapy. The second objective was to determine how the patients feel after a cardiac surgery. Two hypotheses and two research questions were formulated. The first hypotheses were: Nurses working at the resuscitation care station have more knowledge about oxygen therapy than nurses working at the intermediate care station. The second hypothesis was: Nurses working at the resuscitation care station have more knowledge about pulmonary rehabilitation than nurses working at the intermediate care station. The first research question was: How do the patients feel during oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation? The second research question was: How are the patients after a cardiac surgery informed about oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation? In the research part of the bachelor thesis I have used both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Quantitative processing of data was used for questionnaires filled out by nurses working in the hospitals Nemocnice České Budějovice a. s., Nemocnice na Homolce in Prague and in the faculty hospital Královské Vinohrady in Prague. The method was used for evaluation and assessment of knowledge of nurses working at the resuscitation and intermediate care wards. Quantitative methods were used for processing of data obtained through semi-structured interviews with patients after a cardiac surgery. The data were transcribed and coded using a pencil and paper method. The data were categorized based on the identified codes. Two categories were created: oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation. Each of the categories was further divided into three sub-categories. Two categories were created for the research oxygen therapy and pulmonary therapy. Three sub-categories were subsequently created for the oxygen therapy and the pulmonary therapy. The quantitative research has shown that the knowledge of nurses about oxygen therapy is higher among the nurses working at the resuscitation care ward. However, the situation is different in case of their knowledge about pulmonary rehabilitation. In this case the knowledge of nurses working at the intermediate care ward was higher. The processed data from the qualitative research have shown that patients do have sufficient information about post-surgery oxygen therapy, as well as about pulmonary rehabilitation. For all patients in the post-surgery period after a cardiac surgery the frequency of pulmonary rehabilitation was higher than 1 per day...|$|E
5000|$|In 1931, John D. Craig {{was hired}} by a Hollywood studio to travel to Cedros Island off the southwestern coast of Baja California, Mexico, to film the sargassum farming {{industry}} established by expatriate Japanese. He {{was surprised to find}} that the farms were deep underwater on the seabed. [...] Because he and his crew were ill-equipped for deep-water diving (having only <b>oxygen</b> masks and <b>goggles),</b> Craig had to learn [...] "hard-hat" [...] diving from the Japanese [...] "sargassa" [...] farmers, who used decades-old diving equipment. For the next five years, while living on the Pacific coast, Craig worked on modernizing that equipment. At the same time, he hired on as a stunt diver for several movies, notably those of film director W. S. Van Dyke.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} iconic design of early leather flying helmet {{was known as}} the Type B helmet. This was {{designed}} to accommodate earphones in pockets in the ear-flaps and was easy to wear with <b>oxygen</b> masks and <b>goggles.</b> A detailed description of a typical Type B helmet {{can be found on the}} website of The Imperial War Museum (London, England). It is made from six vertical panels which meet at a central ridge panel running from front to back. There is a rectangular horizontal panel which goes across the forehead and it includes padded leather oval housings at the ears. The chinstrap, also made of leather, is stitched to the right side and buckled to a small strap on the left. The brown leather of the helmet is lined with buff-coloured chamois and has a rectangular length of brown-coloured material sewn to the inside of the forehead.|$|R
