2500|$|Ellison recalls [...] "I {{had played}} in the winning tour to India of 1984–85 and bowled well, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> But I was injured for {{the early part of}} the 1985 season, which was {{incredibly}} frustrating. I knew that if fit, I could make a compelling case for my inclusion in the Ashes team." [...] His determination to get back into the Test squad was not deterred by not being selected for the first three Tests, but he then had an opportunity to impress the then England captain, David Gower. Ellison's recollection is that [...] "Kent, my county, were playing a game against Leicestershire in July and I approached [...] David Gower and said: 'I'm going to make you pick [...] me.' I soon started to take wickets and was called into the squad for the fourth Test in Manchester." [...] Ellison took 3–58 in the first-class match, including Gower's wicket in the only innings in which he bowled.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 she was {{a student}} at the University of the Witwatersrand when she met her first husband, the finance magnate and art collector, Gordon Schachat. They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what happened and what I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong. The column was the all-consuming Moloch, when it had been put to bed, there was nothing left of me." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Too Dizzy" [...] was {{the first}} song Bowie and new {{collaborator}} Erdal Kizilcay wrote together for the album, and was written in homage to the 50s. Bowie said [...] "a real Fifties subject matter was either love <b>or</b> jealousy, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I’d stick with jealousy because it’s a lot more interesting". Bowie at the time called the song a [...] "throwaway" [...] and seemed surprised that he included it on the album. The song has been deleted from subsequent reissues of Never Let Me Down. Despite Bowie's dislike for the song, EMI briefly considered it for release as a fourth single from the album, and in fact it did appear as a promo release in the US.|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that {{technology}} has moved phenomenally forward in these past few years, the long-haul flights-such as those from Singapore to the USA still do provide a lot of time for rumination and contemplation. On my most recent such flight that took place about three weeks ago I read, reread and rereread two books of poetry that have just been released in Singapore. The reason why they have attracted my attention with such urgency is that they represent a small, but significant voice in the Singaporean poetic canon, a canon that has not usually been kind to what may be broadly termed the philosophical <b>or</b> reflective. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it might be useful to share my reading of these books with a wider audience, especially such as Kunapipi’s readers who will be somewhat familiar with creative writings from my tiny island republic of Singapore...|$|R
60|$|We won out of {{the reeds}} at last, for which I fervently thanked God, since to have crossed that endless marsh unguided, {{with the loss of}} only one man, seemed little less than miraculous. We emerged from them late in the {{afternoon}} and being wearied out, stopped for a while to rest and eat of the flesh of a buck that I had been fortunate enough to shoot upon their fringe. Then we pushed forward up the slope, proposing to camp for the night on the crest of it a mile <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we should escape from the deadly mist in which we had been enveloped for so long, and obtain {{a clear view of the}} country ahead.|$|R

5000|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Bounce" [...] {{was directed by}} BRTHR. It was filmed in Mumbai, India over a 10- to 12-day period with 16- to 18-hour working days.

6000|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--Indeed we haven't {{forgotten}} the Howellses, nor scored up a grudge {{of any kind}} against them; {{but the fact is}} I was under the doctor's hands for four weeks on a stretch and have been disabled from working for a week <b>or</b> <b>so</b> beside. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was well, about ten days ago, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> sent for a short-hand writer and dictated answers to a bushel <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of letters that had been accumulating during my illness. Getting everything shipshape and cleared up, I went to work next day upon an Atlantic article, which ought to be worth $20 per page (which is the price they usually pay for my work, I believe) for although it is only 70 pages MS (less than two days work, counting by bulk,) I have spent 3 more days trimming, altering and working at it. I shall put in one more day's polishing on it, and then read it before our Club, which is to meet at our house Monday evening, the 24th inst. I think it will bring out considerable discussion among the gentlemen of the Club--though the title of the article will not give them much notion of what is to follow,--this title being [...] "The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut"--which reminds me that today's Tribune says there will be a startling article in the current Atlantic, in which a being which is tangible bud invisible will figure-exactly the case with the sketch of mine which I am talking about!

60|$|And {{still no}} desire to drink. I possessed too many fine faiths, was living at too keen a pitch.

60|$|It may be {{wondered}} why, {{before things}} came {{to such a}} crisis, I had not placed my balance at the bank {{at the disposal of}} the senior partner for use on behalf of the farm. The fact was that my balance was at the moment small. I have not yet {{in the course of this}} narrative gone into my pecuniary position, but I may state here that it was an inconvenient one. It was big with possibilities, but of ready cash there was but a meagre supply. My parents had been poor. But I had a wealthy uncle. Uncles are notoriously careless of the comfort of their nephews. Mine was no exception. He had views. He was a great believer in matrimony, as, having married three wives--not simultaneously--he had every right to be. He was also of opinion that the less money the young bachelor possessed, the better. The consequence was that he announced his intention of giving me a handsome allowance from the day that I married, but not an instant before. Till that glad day I would have to shift for myself. And I am bound to admit that--for an uncle--it was a remarkably sensible idea. I am also of the opinion that it is greatly to my credit, and a proof of my pure and unmercenary nature, that I did not instantly put myself up to be raffled for, or rush out into the streets and propose marriage to the first lady I met. But I was making quite enough with my pen to support myself, and, be it never so humble, there is something pleasant in a bachelor existence, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> until very recently.|$|R
25|$|Bertrand Russell {{made the}} {{following}} {{comment on the}} Philosophical Investigations in his book My Philosophical Development:I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (<b>or</b> at least <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought)</b> of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1944, Wittgenstein {{returned}} to Cambridge {{around the same}} time as Russell who had been living in America for several years. Russell {{returned to}} Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;Russell’s books should be bound in two colours…those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages.

Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal Mind. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, [...] "The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background." [...] On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, [...] "Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{some time}} in the night I awoke suddenly, at what hour I do not know, as certain people wake, I among them, when their room is entered, even without the {{slightest}} noise. Before I opened my eyes I felt that some one was with us in the place. Nor was I mistaken. A little lamp still burned in the chamber, a mere wick floating in oil, and by its light I saw a dim, ghost-like form standing near the door. Indeed I thought almost that it was a ghost, till presently I remembered, and knew it for our corpse-like guide, who appeared to be looking intently at the bed on which Leo lay, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> for the head was bent in that direction.|$|E
