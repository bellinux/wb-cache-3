5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the <b>odds</b> <b>for</b> survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E

Brown, though conceding the skeptics' point, still thinks that there is enough data to mount a search for a new planet.|$|E
5|$|Leicester City won the 2015–16 Premier League, {{their first}} {{top-level}} football championship. They {{are one of}} only six clubs to have won the Premier League {{since its inception in}} 1992. A number of newspapers described their title win as the greatest sporting upset ever, considering {{at the start of the}} season they were favourites to face relegation. Multiple bookmakers had never paid out at such long <b>odds</b> <b>for</b> any sport. The club's previous highest ever finish was second place in the top flight, in 1928–29, then known as Division One. Throughout Leicester's history, they have spent all but one season within the top two leagues of English football. They hold a joint-highest seven second-tier titles (six Second Division and one Championship).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Leg length {{inequality}} (LLI) {{was identified}} as a problem of total hip arthroplasty soon after its introduction. Leg lengthening is {{the most common form of}} LLI. Possible consequences are limping, neuronal dysfunction and aseptic component loosening. LLI can result in an increased strain both on the contralateral hip joint and on the abductor muscles. We assessed the influence of leg lengthening and shortening on walking capacity, hip pain, limping and patient satisfaction at 2 -year follow-up. Methods 478 cases with postoperative lengthening and 275 with shortening were identified, and matched with three controls each. Rigorous adjustment for potential differences in baseline patient characteristics was performed by propensity-score matching of covariates. The arbitrarily defined desired outcomes were a walking capacity > 60 minutes, no hip pain, no limping, and excellent patient satisfaction. Differences in not achieving the desired outcomes between the groups were expressed as odds ratios. Results In the lengthened case group, the <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> not being able to walk for an hour was 1. 70 (95 % CI 1. 28 - 2. 26) for cases compared to controls, and the <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> having hip pain at follow-up was 1. 13 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 1. 64). The <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> limping was 2. 08 (95 % CI 1. 55 - 2. 80). The <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> not achieving excellent patient satisfaction was 1. 67 (95 % CI 1. 23 - 2. 28). In the shortening case group, the <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> not being able to walk for an hour was 1. 23 (95 % CI 0. 84 - 1. 81), and the <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> having hip pain at follow-up was 1. 60 (95 % CI 1. 05 - 2. 44). The <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> limping for cases was 2. 61 (95 % CI 1. 78 - 3. 21). The <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> not achieving excellent patient satisfaction was 2. 15 (95 % CI 1. 44 - 3. 21). Conclusions Walking capacity, limping and patient satisfaction were all significantly associated with leg lengthening, whereas pain alleviation was not. In contrast, hip pain, limping and patient satisfaction were all significantly associated with leg shortening, whereas walking capacity was not. </p...|$|R

5|$|Senate {{and house}} legislators who had favored Benton's renegotiated {{version of the}} Texas {{annexation}} bill had been assured that President Tyler would sign the joint house measure, but leave its implementation to the incoming Polk administration. But, during his last day in office, President Tyler, with the urging of his Secretary of State Calhoun, decided to act decisively to improve the <b>odds</b> <b>for</b> the immediate annexation of Texas. On March 3, 1845, with his cabinet's assent, he dispatched an offer of annexation to the Republic of Texas by courier, exclusively {{under the terms of}} the Brown–Foster option of the joint house measure. Secretary Calhoun apprised President-elect Polk of the action, who demurred without comment. Tyler justified his preemptive move on the grounds that Polk was likely to come under pressure to abandon immediate annexation and reopen negotiations under the Benton alternative.|$|E
5|$|In 1084, Guiscard {{returned}} to the Balkans and planned a new offensive against Corfu, where a combined Greek-Venetian fleet, commanded by Selvo, awaited his arrival. When the Normans approached the island, the combined fleets dealt Guiscard an even greater defeat than he had received in the naval battle at Durazzo. Guiscard ordered another attack three days later, but the results were still more disastrous for the Normans. Selvo was completely convinced of his fleet's victory and sent all damaged ships north to Venice for repairs, to free them for other uses, and to report of their victory. The Doge then retired with the remaining ships to the Albanian coast to await {{the departure of the}} Normans. Acting on the Doge's belief that a third attack would be unlikely and that the presence of a slightly depleted Venetian fleet meant greater <b>odds</b> <b>for</b> victory, Guiscard summoned every floating vessel he could find and led the Normans into a surprise attack. His strategy, though perhaps risky, was ultimately well-calculated as it caused mass confusion among the Venetians, who were overwhelmed on all flanks, while the Greeks fled what they assumed to be a losing battle. Selvo barely managed to retreat with the remainder of his fleet, but not before 3,000 Venetians died and another 2,500 were taken prisoner. The Venetians also lost 9 great galleys, the largest and most heavily armed ships in their war fleet.|$|E

40|$|Odds {{ratios for}} {{head and neck}} cancer {{increase}} with greater cigarette and alcohol use and lower body mass index (BMI; weight (kg) /height 2 (m 2)). Using data from the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium, the authors conducted a formal analysis of BMI as a modifier of smoking- and alcohol-related effects. Analysis of never and current smokers included 6, 333 cases, while analysis of never drinkers and consumers of ≤ 10 drinks/day included 8, 452 cases. There were 8, 000 or more controls, depending on the analysis. Odds ratios for all sites increased with lower BMI, greater smoking, and greater drinking. In polytomous regression, <b>odds</b> ratios <b>for</b> BMI (P = 0. 65), smoking (P = 0. 52), and drinking (P = 0. 73) were homogeneous for oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers. Odds ratios for BMI and drinking were greater for oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer (P < 0. 01), while smoking odds ratios were greater for laryngeal cancer (P < 0. 01). Lower BMI enhanced smoking- and drinking-related <b>odds</b> ratios <b>for</b> oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer (P < 0. 01), while BMI did not modify smoking and drinking <b>odds</b> ratios <b>for</b> laryngeal cancer. The increased <b>odds</b> ratios <b>for</b> all sites with low BMI may suggest related carcinogenic mechanisms; however, BMI modification of smoking and drinking <b>odds</b> ratios <b>for</b> cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx but not larynx cancer suggests additional factors specific to oral cavity/pharynx cancer...|$|R

Twenty-eight per cent of the patients had one or more complications (31 % {{of the men and}} 21 % of the women). General complications (pneumonia, thromboembolic, and cardiac) were most frequent. The postoperative mortality rate for resected patients was 8. 3 % (63 of 763). Complication and mortality rates were highest for proximal resections (52 % and 16 %) followed by total gastrectomy (38 % and 8 %), subtotal resection (28 % and 10 %), and distal resection (19 % and 7 %). By logistic regression analysis it was found that age, sex, operative procedure, prophylactic antibiotics, and splenectomy were significantly related to postoperative complications. The <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> complication for men versus women was 1. 75 : for no antibiotics versus antibiotic prophylaxis it was 2. 5. Relative to distal resection the <b>odds</b> ratio <b>for</b> complications after subtotal resection was 2. 2, for total gastrectomy was 3. 9, and for proximal resection was 7. 6.
