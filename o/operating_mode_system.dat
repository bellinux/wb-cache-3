Test and Simulation are {{the only}} {{verification}} techniques used for any biomedical devices such as pacemaker system, implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs) etc. The construction of formal models of Pacemaker systems is a considerable practical challenge. Formal modeling of an artificial Pacemaker system is a case study proposed by the software quality research laboratory at McMaster University 1 in the Grand Challenge Initiative. Using an incremental proof-based approach, we model functionalities of the Pacemaker. The approach is illustrated by developing a new formal model of the cardiac pacemaker system. Our contribution are in this report to model the single electrode pacemaker system using Event-B and prove it. The incremental proof-based development is mainly driven by the refinement between an abstract model {{of the system and}} its detailed design through a series of refinements. A series of refinements is progressively added the functional and the timing properties to the abstract system-level specifications using some intermediate models. The properties express system architecture, action-reaction and timing behavior. This paper uses all possible operational modes of a single electrode Pacemaker system that helps to develop better hardware. Every stage of refinement includes the detail information about <b>operating</b> <b>modes.</b> The models are expressed in Event-B modeling language and validated primarily by the ProB tool in different situation such as hysteresis and rate adapting pacing under real-time constraints.
