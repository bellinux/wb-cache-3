40|$|Atopy can {{manifest}} in childhood as infantile eczema (atopic dermatitis), allergic rhinitis and asthma. In practice, {{it is critical}} to identify the <b>offending</b> <b>allergen</b> in atopic individuals. This will not only influence therapeutic interventions, but may also {{have a significant impact on}} the individual’s quality of life. The most common clinical test for allergy detection is the introduction of an allergen directly into the skin in the form of a skin-prick test. Skin-prick testing is recommended in the diagnostic workup for allergies because it is reliable, safe, convenient, inexpensive, minimally invasive, and has the advantage of multiple allergen testing in one, 15 - to 20 -minute, test. Skin-prick testing can be performed from birth onwards. Although there is a small risk of developing anaphylaxis, the test remains safe to perform in a consultation room or at the patient’s bedside. Worldwide, a skin-prick test remains the test of choice for allergy because of its convenience and cost-effectiveness. A globally accepted guideline for skin-prick testing is still lacking and would be beneficial to both patient and physician. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Food allergies {{are very}} {{frequent}} in children (between 4 and 8 % of population). There are many clinical manifestations, {{that can be}} lifethreatening. In children, compared to adults, {{a limited number of}} food allergens are responsible for the disease: egg, cow milk, peanuts, nuts (hazelnut, nut,), fish, cereals, exotic fuits, and soya. Eviction of the offending food is the first treatment of allergy. This eviction diet is sometimes difficult to organize and can alter the quality of life (child and family). Diagnosis must be well established; sensitivity to an allergen must be differenciated from real allergy. This can lead to perform a provocation test (oral challenge) in the hospital. It is now proposed that the eviction diet will be less strict than before, adapted according to the allergen, symptoms in each case, age of patient and ideally to the reacted dose of the <b>offending</b> <b>allergen.</b> A collaboration with a dietist is necessary to optimalize the nutritionnal schedule. Induction of oral tolerance seems to be an interesting optional treatment for patients presenting persistant food allergy.

40|$|Abstract This review {{summarizes}} current {{evidence and}} rec-ommendations regarding cow’s milk allergy (CMA), {{the most common}} food allergy in young children, for the primary and secondary care providers. The diagnostic approach includes performing a medical history, physical examination, diagnos-tic elimination diets, skin prick tests, specific IgE measure-ments, and oral food challenges. Strict avoidance of the <b>offending</b> <b>allergen</b> is the only therapeutic option. Oral immu-notherapy is being studied, {{but it is not}} yet recommended for routine clinical practice. For primary prevention of allergy, exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months and up to 6 months is desirable. Infants with a documented hereditary risk of allergy (i. e., an affected parent and/or sibling) who cannot be breastfed exclusively should receive a formula with confirmed reduced allergenicity, i. e., a partially or extensively hydrolyzed formula, as a means of preventing allergic reac-tions, primarily atopic dermatitis. Avoidance or delayed intro-duction of solid foods beyond 4 – 6 months for allergy preven-tion is not recommended.

40|$|Abstract: The {{prevalence}} of food allergies, with associated risk for anaphylaxis, has increasingly become a significant public health concern with copious and pervasive implications for patients, families, clinical health care professionals, researchers, and society at large. While potential treatments for food allergy are being explored through clinical research trials, {{there is currently}} no widespread scientifically proven cure available. Daily management of this atopic disorder consists of strict avoidance of the <b>offending</b> <b>allergen.</b> Subsequently, many families make concerted, burdensome efforts to create an allergen-controlled home environment. When children with food allergies start elementary school, this transition can be quite anxiety provoking for parents/caregivers. Schools {{may be perceived as}} allergen ubiquitous settings coupled with staff having varying awareness and training regarding food allergy and anaphylaxis. Clinical nurse educators, clinical nurse case managers, {{and other members of the}} primary care and/or specialty clinic teams can play a critical role in spanning the informational gap between clinic and school community. Ongoing collaboration between clinic team members with school nurse coordinators, school administrators, and other members of the school health services team may serve to minimize fragmentation of patient care, maximize ease of the child’s school entry transition, expand food allergy/anaphylaxis educational opportunities, and provide support to school nurse colleagues...|$|E
40|$|Although {{food allergy}} {{is a major}} public health problem, {{currently}} there is no effective and safe treatment except to avoid the foods. But {{the need for new}} options is critical now as the number of children diagnosed with food allergies rises. Avoiding the <b>offending</b> <b>allergen</b> in the diet is the primary treatment of food allergy. Once a food to which the patient is sensitive has been identified, the food must be removed from the diet. People with severe food allergies must be prepared to treat an anaphylactic reaction. These individuals also always should carry a syringe of adrenaline (epinephrine [EpiPen]), and be prepared to self-administer it if they think they are developing an allergic reaction. Several medications are available for treating the other symptoms of food allergy. For example, antihistamines can relieve gastrointestinal symptoms, hives, sneezing, and a runny nose. Bronchodilators can relieve the symptoms of asthma. They are not effective, however, in preventing an allergic reaction when taken prior to eating the food. In fact, no medication in any form is available to reliably prevent an allergic reaction to a certain food before eating that food. Novel therapeutic approaches to food allergy can be classified as food allergen-specific therapy(immunotherapy with native or modified recombinant allergens, or oral desensitization) or food allergen-nonspecifictherapy (anti-IgE, traditional Chinese medicine).   Key Words: Children, Food Allergy, Management. ...|$|E

40|$|ASTHMA {{is one of}} the commonest {{causes of}} chronic {{handicap}} in childhood, is responsible for a great deal of intercurrent illness in childhood and occasionally has a fatal outcome. It is pre-eminently the concern of the generalist, either general practitioner or general paediatrician- or more commonly both working together. The different views of childhood asthma taken by various specialists remind one of the tale of the blind men examining an elephant. One feels the trunk and exclaims that it is like a rope: another the leg and likens it to a tree: a third feels the ear and says it is like a mat: while the fourth meets the side of the elephant and thinks it is like a wall.

40|$|BACKGROUND Allergic {{rhinitis}} is IgE-mediated nasal mucosal {{hypersensitivity reaction}} after {{exposure to the}} <b>offending</b> <b>allergen.</b> Treatment options for allergic rhinitis includes allergen avoidance, immunotherapy, local/systemic antihistamines and steroids. Nasal saline irrigation is a possible potential treatment or adjunct to pharmacological treatment. It produces improvement in nasal symptoms, reduction in medicine consumption, by acceleration of mucociliary clearance time and thus improvement in quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our prospective study was performed with 52 patients in {{between the ages of}} 20 - 60 years who presented with recurrent (more than 1 year) symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Isotonic saline nasal irrigation was added for a period of 8 weeks along with other measures of allergic rhinitis treatment such as allergen avoidance and pharmacotherapy and quality of life was assessed by the severity of symptoms. RESULTS This study was designed to evaluate the reduction in symptom score with the use of isotonic saline nasal irrigation given twice daily for 8 weeks in seasonal allergic rhinitis along with the standard treatment i. e. antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroid spray. Total of 52 patients were studied. The usage of isotonic saline nasal irrigation improved {{the quality of life in}} terms of reduction in the severity, frequency and duration of symptoms compared to the relief he had in the previous years when he used only intranasal steroids.

40|$|Symptomatic {{hypogammaglobulinaemia}} {{in children}} younger than 2 years of age was studied to rule out a primary immunodeficiency. Thirty-four patients were referred to the Immunology Service to study the hypogammaglobulinaemia-associated clinical picture. Food allergy was documented in 10 patients by personal and familial history, presence of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and elevated total serum IgE levels. Coeliac disease and human immunodeficiency virus infection were also ruled out. Protein loss through stools was assessed by clearance of α 1 -antitrypsin (AAT). Serum immunoglobulin levels were determined by nephelometry and functional antibodies were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cellular immune response was assessed by in vitro lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens and cell subsets were analysed by flow cytometry. In five patients of the 10 patients we suspected a protein loss through the mucosa. Four of these five patients showed an increased AAT and the other showed an extensive cutaneous lesion. Immunological studies revealed normal antibody function, in vitro lymphoproliferative responses and cell numbers {{in four of the}} 5 patients. One patient showed abnormally low numbers of CD 4 + T cells as well as a defective proliferative response to mitogens. After diagnosis of cow milk allergy, milk was replaced with infant milk formula containing hydrolysed proteins. Recovery of immunoglobulin values and clinical resolution were achieved.

40|$|Background: Recent {{reports of}} fatal asthma cases {{associated}} with swarms of locusts affecting African countries have highlighted {{the importance of}} this insect in causing asthma morbidity and mortality. However, only limited information is available about the allergic health outcomes such as asthma and its determinants in exposed individuals. In this study, workers exposed to the African migratory locust Locusta migratoria were evaluated for allergic health outcomes as well as the nature of the <b>offending</b> <b>allergens.</b> Methods: Ten scientists and technicians exposed to locusts in a laboratory were investigated for locust-related allergy using questionnaires and immunological tests. The presence of allergy was determined by quantification of specific IgE and IgG to L. migratoria using the UniCAP® system and via skin-prick testing (SPT). The allergens were characterized by Western blot and ImmunoCAP inhibition assays. Results: Six of the 10 workers experienced symptoms ranging from urticaria and rhinoconjuctivitis to asthma. Seven individuals demonstrated sensitivity on SPT and five had specific IgE antibodies to L. migratoria. Significant cross-reactivity was demonstrated for allergens in the locust faeces, body and wings but not to cockroach allergens. Novel allergens with molecular weights of approximately 70 kDa were identified in locust wings, which are distinctly different from other known allergen sources from locusts. Conclusion: Exposure to L. migratoria allergens is a potential sensitizer in exposed individuals. Raised levels of locust-specific IgE can be readily quantified.

In this study we evaluated the effect of a 4 -weeks treatment period with broxaterol, a new beta 2 -agonist, on BHR in asthmatic children living in two different environmental conditions. Two groups of patients', 24 domiciled at sea level, allergen exposed (group 1), and 24 resident at high altitude (Misurina, 1, 756 m) in an allergen-free environment (group 2), have been tested. Children were randomly treated with broxaterol 400 mug q. i. d. or sodium chromoglycate 10 mg q. i. d. (as control treatment) by the metered dose inhaler for 4 weeks. Pulmonary function tests and methacholine challenge were performed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study. Throughout the study period a diary card was completed and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was measured three times daily. Forty-two of the patients admitted concluded the study. No significant change was observed in the methacholine PC 20 throughout the study period regardless of the type of treatment and/or environment. The amplitude percentage mean of diurnal changes in PEFR during the study period showed no statistically significant differences between treatments or centres, or in the interaction of treatment with centre, time with treatment, time with centre, time with centre and treatment (p > 0. 05). Therefore in this pilot study regular treatment with broxaterol for 4 weeks did not cause an increase in BHR in asthmatic children both in conditions of allergen exposure and in an environment free of <b>offending</b> <b>allergens...</b>|$|R

Food-related reactions {{are associated with a}} broad array of signs and symptoms that may involve many bodily systems including the skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts, and cardiovascular system. Food allergy is a leading cause of anaphylaxis and, therefore, referral to an allergist for appropriate and timely diagnosis and treatment is imperative. Diagnosis involves a careful history and diagnostic tests, such as skin prick testing, serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) testing and, if indicated, oral food challenges. Once the diagnosis of food allergy is confirmed, strict elimination of the <b>offending</b> food <b>allergen</b> from the diet is generally necessary. For patients with significant systemic symptoms, the treatment of choice is epinephrine administered by intramuscular injection into the lateral thigh. Although most children “outgrow” allergies to milk, egg, soy and wheat, allergies to peanut, tree nuts, fish and shellfish are often lifelong. This article provides an overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management and prognosis of patients with food allergy. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to study the {{efficiency}} of the diet therapy against atopic dermatitis by means of the goat's milk based products among children at different age. The researchers observed 188 children aged between 3 months and 18 years, suffering from atopic dermatitis aggravated by the mycotic infection. Patients of the main group (102 children under 3) received goat's milk based products within the hypo allergic diet — «Nanny» and «Nanny — Zolotaya Kozochka» adapted milk formulas, while children over 3 received «Amal Tea» instant goat's milk. The research findings have showed that the introduction of the goat's milk based products into the food ration leads not only to the positive short term results — achievement of the clinical remission on 12 th– 20 th day from the moment the therapy starts, but also to the positive long term effect — remission extension, reduction of the disease recurrences, reduction of the general IgE level in blood serum and <b>offending</b> IgE <b>allergens</b> to the cow milk proteins and casein. Thus, the replacement of the cow milk based products within the ration of patients for «Nanny» and «Nanny — Zolotaya Kozochka» adapted milk formulas and «Amal Tea» instant goat's milk allows for optimization of the atopic dermatitis diet therapy among children at different age. Key words: atopic dermatitis, diet therapy, goat's milk. </strong...|$|R
40|$|Background: Food allergy, an {{abnormal}} immunologic response to food protein, has an estimated prevalence of 6 % {{in young children}} and 3. 7 % in adults in the U. S. The only proven therapy for food allergy is strict elimination of the <b>offending</b> <b>allergens.</b> As a result, caregivers and patients could experience constant anxiety and stress that affects their quality of life. Additionally, food allergy can lead to significant economic impact {{on the health care}} system, since severe reactions often lead to ED visits and hospitalizations. Objectives: The first major objective was to determine the economic burden of Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis (FAA) patients in the U. S. by estimating the direct medical and indirect costs. The second principal objective involved assessing the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of food allergic patients by measuring their health utilities and disease specific quality of life. Methods: Economic burden was estimated by measuring certain direct medical and indirect costs from a societal perspective. Costs were estimated using a bottom-up approach [...] calculating the average cost of illness per patient and multiplying it by reported prevalence estimates. FAA patients with an emergency department (ED) visit, office based physician visit, outpatient department visit, and hospital admission were identified from a list of federally administered databases using ICD- 9 codes. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to measure the robustness of the estimates. The cross-sectional HRQL study measured health utilities in food allergic adults and children, and quality of life in allergic adults using EQ- 5 D and FAQL-AF questionnaires respectively. These questionnaires were administered in an online survey format. Regression models were specified to explore the deviations in HRQL scores between patients with different disease related characteristics. Results: The findings reveal that for a given year (2007), direct medical costs worth $ 225 million and indirect costs worth $ 115 million were incurred. Owing to the irregularities in the reporting and diagnosis of food allergy, these values might be an underestimation. Simulations from probabilistic sensitivity analysis generated mean direct medical costs of $ 307 million and indirect costs of $ 203 million. Survey responses were collected online for eight months, during which 45 adults and 94 parents (acting as proxy for their food allergic child) responded. Adults reported a mean utility of 0. 874 compared to 0. 918 for children. Gender, number of food allergies and frequency of carrying epinephrine device had significant impacts on HRQL scores. An effect size of 0. 003 was estimated comparing health utilities of food allergic adults with the general U. S. population. Conclusions: This was the first research to examine economic burden of FAA, and elucidate health utilities for food allergic patients. A large proportion of costs were incurred due to ambulatory visits. Effect size calculation revealed that health utilities of food allergic patients were very similar to the general U. S. population...|$|R
40|$|Background and Design: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the hypersensitivity to cosmetic chemicals in patients with clinically suspected cosmetic-induced contact dermatitis in Bursa and the South Marmara Region (Turkey) by patch testing with standard and cosmetic series. Material and Method: Seventy-three patients with clinically suspected contact dermatitis due to cosmetics were patch tested by the European standard series and cosmetic series. The patch test results were analyzed as percentages. x 2 {{test was used to}} demonstrate the relationship between cosmetic products and cosmetic allergens. Results: 90. 4 % of patients in our study group were female and 9. 6 % were male; the median age was 37. 5 (range 16 - 71) years. The most commonly involved parts of the body were the face (49. 3 %), hands (16. 4 %), periocular region (6. 8 %), lips (6. 8 %), and the neck (5. 5 %). The most common offending cosmetic products causing allergic contact dermatitis were soaps and cleansing lotions (32. 8 %), moisturizer creams (21. 9 %), make-up (15. 0 %), and hair dyes (9. 6 %). 41. 0 % of patients showed positive reaction to at least one cosmetic allergen included in either standard or cosmetic series. The cosmetic allergens in the standard series and the rates of positivity were as follows: fragrance mix (6. 8 %), lanolin alcohols (5. 5 %), paraphenylenedaimine (2. 7 %), colophony (1. 4 %), paraben mix (1. 4 %), formaldehyde (1. 4 %), and methylchloroisothiazolinone (Kathon CG) in descending order. The most common <b>offending</b> cosmetic <b>allergen</b> groups were preservatives (21. 9 %), antioxidants (8. 2 %) and fragrances (6. 8 %). Conclusion: Allergic or irritant contact dermatitis due to cosmetics should be considered in cases of eczema involving face, neck, eyelids, lips, scalp or hands. Patch testing with cosmetic series beside standard series would be more helpful in detecting the responsible allergen(s) ...|$|R
