40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT Studies {{have been}} made of the biliary {{excretion}} of the antibiotic rifamide in patients with T-tube drainage of the bile ducts. Using a therapeutic dose, the concentration achieved is 100, 000 times the minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive and about 100 times that for Gram-negative micro-organisms. Concentrations in the gall bladder were less but were of thera-peutic value, particularly with Gram-positive organisms. Rifamide is a new semisynthetic derivative of the famnily of rifamycins, a group of antibiotics isolated by Sensi, Margalith, and Timbal in 1959 from the fermentation broths of S. mediterranei n. sp., which also includes rifamycin SV, fairly widely used in clinical practice. Rifamide is the diethylamide of rifamycin B, one of the compounds which are found in the fermenta-tion broths, and has the following structural formula:-The chemical and physico-chemical properties of this compound have been described by Maggi, Galo, and Sensi (1965); it is an <b>orange-yellow</b> <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder</b> of which the sodium salt is soluble in water (1 P 5 g. / 10 ml.). Toxicological studies were carried out in labpra-tory animals by Dezulian, Serralunga, and Maffi (1966).
