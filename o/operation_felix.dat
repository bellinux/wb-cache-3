5|$|The {{possibility}} of an attack from the land was not a theoretical concern, as Adolf Hitler sought Spanish support to carry out <b>Operation</b> <b>Felix,</b> an invasion of Gibraltar that would have enabled the Germans to close {{the entrance to the}} Mediterranean to the great disadvantage of the Allies. It was projected that Gibraltar would fall within only three days. In the event, Hitler failed to reach an agreement with the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. Gibraltar's defences were tested several times by air raids carried out by Italy and Vichy France, which only caused limited damage and light casualties, and by Italian submarine and sabotage attacks which damaged or sank a number of ships in the bay.|$|E

50|$|A {{particular}} {{concern was the}} defense of the strategic Atlantic islands of the Azores against a possible invasion. In 1941, islands began to be strongly reinforced with ground and air forces, with its garrison achieving 32 500 troops and more than 60 aircraft. The Portuguese Navy focused in {{the defense of the}} waters and ports of the Azores with patrol boats and destroyers deployed on rotation. These surface forces were supported by Fleet 10, Avro 626, Grumman G-21 and Grumman G-44 seaplanes that patrolled the waters from the reactivated Azores Naval Air Station at Ponta Delgada. In a smaller scale, similar reinforcements were also sent to Madeira and to Cape Verde islands. Although both the Axis and the Allied powers had plans to invade the islands and use them to control the Atlantic (including the planned British operations Alloy, Shrapnell, Brisk, Thruster, Springboard and Lifebelt, the US Operation Grey and the German <b>operations</b> <b>Felix,</b> Ilona and Isabella), the Portuguese military reinforcements were able to support Portuguese diplomacy in successfully deterring any attempt at performing that invasion.|$|R

25|$|Stalling of {{the process}} towards civil rights {{was due to the}} Second World War, which made {{military}} considerations paramount over civilian rights.

At the beginning of 1941, the Governor assumed all the powers of the City Council and the Executive Council was suspended.|$|E
25|$|Despite these problems, German {{military}} leaders proceeded {{to prepare for}} a large-scale operation against Gibraltar. Codenamed <b>Operation</b> <b>Felix,</b> the plan called for two German army corps to enter Spain across the Pyrenees. One corps, under General Ludwig Kübler, was to cross Spain and assault Gibraltar, while the other, commanded by General Rudolf Schmidt, was to secure its flanks. Air support would need one fighter and two dive-bomber wings. Overall command of Felix was to be assigned to Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau. The plan also made provisions for occupying Spanish possessions in North Africa: Spanish Morocco, Río de Oro, and the Canary Islands, whose ports could then be used as bases for German U-boats.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, {{to deter}} a {{possible}} {{invasion of the}} Portuguese islands and overseas territories, the [...] Army had to send several military expeditions to reinforce the local defense forces. As part of the defense measures of the Overseas, the colonial military forces were transitorily placed {{under the control of}} the Army, although continuing to be separate from it. The larger contingent of expeditionary forces went to the Azores, with its Army garrison achieving the 35 000 men. The defense of the Azores was crucial as these islands were planned to serve as retreat point and base of the Portuguese Government in case of an enemy occupation of Continental Portugal. Besides this, the Portuguese authorities received intelligence about the existence of both Axis and Allied plans to occupy the islands (including the planned British operations Alloy, Shrapnell, Brisk, Thruster, Springboard and Lifebelt, the US Operation Grey and the German <b>operations</b> <b>Felix,</b> Ilona and Isabella), to use them to control the North Atlantic. The defense of Continental Portugal was also reinforced, especially of the Lisbon area. The measures for the defense of Lisbon included the raising of a complex system of coastal and anti-aircraft defense and the raising of an army corps of three divisions for ground defense.|$|R

25|$|Operation Tracer was {{a highly}} {{classified}} World War II military operation based in Gibraltar, a British colony and military base. The impetus for the plan was the 1940 scheme by Germany to capture Gibraltar, code-named <b>Operation</b> <b>Felix.</b> Operation Tracer {{was the brainchild of}} Rear Admiral John Henry Godfrey, the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty. In 1941, he decided to establish a covert observation post at Gibraltar that would remain operational even if Gibraltar fell to the enemy. From the facility, the movements of enemy vessels would be reported back to the United Kingdom. Godfrey requested the assistance of several distinguished consultants to bring the plan to fruition. The plan was so top secret that Godfrey held meetings with his consultants at his private residence rather than at Whitehall. The decision was made to construct the facility using the existing tunnel system for Lord Airey's Shelter, the underground military shelter just north of Lord Airey's Battery. The artillery battery was located at the upper ridge of the Rock of Gibraltar, near the southern end of what is now the Upper Rock Nature Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Operation Tracer {{was based}} in Gibraltar, the British colony and then {{fortress}} {{at the southern end}} of the Iberian Peninsula. The facility that was constructed for the top secret, World War II military operation was located near the southern end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, in close proximity to Lord Airey's Battery. The impetus for Operation Tracer was a 1940 plan by Germany to move through Spain and capture Gibraltar in the scheme code-named <b>Operation</b> <b>Felix.</b> It was an offshoot of a larger scheme, entitled the Peripheral Strategy, in which Germany planned to cut Great Britain off from the rest of the British Empire. British Intelligence recognised the threat, and Operation Tracer was the result. In the summer of 1941, Rear Admiral John Henry Godfrey (1888–1971), the Director of the Naval Intelligence Division of the British Admiralty, decided to establish at Gibraltar a covert observation post which would remain operational even if Gibraltar fell into enemy hands. The scheme was sufficiently top secret that none of the Operation Tracer meetings took place at Whitehall. Rather, they were held at Godfrey's residence at 36 Curzon Street, Mayfair, Central London.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Gibraltar's {{civilian}} population was evacuated (mainly to London, {{but also to}} parts of Morocco, Madeira and Jamaica) and the Rock was strengthened as a fortress. The naval base and the ships based there {{played a key role}} in the provisioning and supply of the island of Malta during its long siege. As well as frequent short runs (known as 'Club Runs') towards Malta to fly off aircraft reinforcements (initially Hurricanes but later, notably from the USN aircraft carrier Wasp, Spitfires), the critical Operation Pedestal convoy was run from Gibraltar in August 1942. This resupplied the island at a critical time in the face of concentrated air attacks from German and Italian forces. Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's reluctance to allow the German Army onto Spanish soil frustrated a German plan to capture the Rock, codenamed <b>Operation</b> <b>Felix.</b> In the 1950s, Franco renewed Spain's claim to sovereignty over Gibraltar and restricted movement between Gibraltar and Spain. Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain under British sovereignty in the Gibraltar sovereignty referendum, 1967, which led to the passing of the Gibraltar Constitution Order in 1969. In response, Spain completely closed the border with Gibraltar and severed all communication links. The border with Spain was partially reopened in 1982 and fully reopened in 1985 before Spain's accession to the European Community.|$|E
50|$|The Chaco War was {{the first}} major Latin American {{conflict}} in which aircraft were used. This aerial war carried a large human and materiel cost. At that time, Bolivia possessed one of the greatest aerial forces in the region, however this fact didn't prevent its final defeat. Bolivia lacked the expertise to utilise its aerial forces, and was thus unable to maximise its use of military aviation. Paraguay had a small number of pilots and technicians, all veterans of the revolution of 1922. The 1922 revolution was a brief civil war in which the government and the rebels used aircraft in the <b>operations,</b> and José <b>Félix</b> Estigarribia could be considered an innovator in the military use of aircraft on the continent.|$|R
50|$|On {{his return}} to Paris, Reclus contributed to the Revue des deux mondes, the Tour du monde and other periodicals, {{a large number of}} {{articles}} embodying the results of his geographical work. Among other works of this period was the short book Histoire d'un ruisseau, in which he traced the development of a great river from source to mouth. During 1867 and 1868, he published La Terre; description des phénomènes de la vie du globe in two volumes.During the Siege of Paris (1870-1871), Reclus shared in the aerostatic <b>operations</b> conducted by <b>Félix</b> Nadar, and also served in the National Guard. As a member of the Association Nationale des Travailleurs, he published a hostile manifesto against the government of Versailles in support of the Paris Commune of 1871 in the Cri du Peuple.|$|R
50|$|Portugal was not {{directly}} involved in World War II, but had to defend its neutrality. The War caught the AM {{in the beginning of}} a modernization plan that could not proceed due {{to the start of the}} conflict, meaning that it largely lacked modern aircraft. One of the major Portuguese military priorities became the deterrence of a possible invasion of the strategic Azores Islands, which were coveted both by the Axis and by the Allies, with both having plans to invade them. Adolf Hitler wanted to used the Azores as the base for the Amerika Bomber, with their seizure being included in the German planned <b>operations</b> <b>Felix,</b> Ilona and Isabella. The Allies wanted to use the Azores as an air and naval base to control the North Atlantic in the scope of the Battle of the Atlantic, having plans to invade them if the Portuguese Government refused to cede its use. This invasion was part of the planned British operations Alloy, Shrapnell, Brisk, Thruster, Springboard and Lifebelt and of the US Operation Grey. Faced with the imminent danger, the Portuguese authorities decide to reinforce the Azores garrison, sending to there a great part of the available Army forces and most of the AM combat aircraft, including all its fighters. In June 1941, two expeditionary fighter flights - each with 15 Gloster Gladiators- are organized and deployed, as well as five Ju 52 bombers. One of the fighter flights and the bombers became based at Santana airfield (Rabo de Peixe), São Miguel Island and the other fighter flight became based at Achada airfield, Terceira Island (sooner transferred to the newly built Lajes airfield). In October 1941, the AM receives Curtiss 75 Mohawk fighters, with 12 forming a third expeditionary fighter flight to the Azores, being stationed at Rabo de Peixe. In 1942, the Rabo de Peixe and the Lajes airfields became, respectively, the No 4 and No 5 air bases.The sending of all the few available AM fighters to the Azores meant that Mainland Portugal remained without air defense. This issue will be gradually solved from 1943, thanks to the good relations of the Portuguese authorities with the Allies and the grant of air facilities at Lajes for the operation of anti-submarine aircraft. The AM starts then to receive modern fighters including Bell P-39 Airacobra, Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and Bristol Blenheim bombers (which replaced the Junkers Ju 86). The fighter and bomber flights that are formed with them are identified by a two-letter code that is painted on the fuselages. By the end of the World War II, the AM included the BA1, Sintra as a training unit, the BA2, Tancos with fighter flights MR (Spitfire), RL (Spitfire), XZ (Spitfire) and OK (Airacobra) and with bomber flight ZE (Blenheim), the BA3, Ota with Information and Reconnaissance Group (Westland Lysander) and Fighter Flight GL (Hurricane), BA4, Rabo de Peixe, with expeditionary fighter flights No 1 (Gloster Gladiator) and No 2 (Mohawk) and with the Ju 52 flight (used mainly in the air transport between Azores islands), BA5, Lajes with Expeditionary Fighter Flight No 2 (Gloster Gladiator), Lisbon Field with Fighter Flight VX (Hurricane) and Transport Aircraft Section (Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Lockheed Hudson and Douglas C-47) and Espinho airfield with Fighter Flight RV (Hurricane). The Lajes Air Base largely contributed for the Allied victory in Europe, first in its use by the British Royal Air Force in the elimination of the German submarine threat in the North Atlantic and then in its use by the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) in the air connection between the USA and Europe and North Africa, enable it to reduce the time of flight and largely increase the number of logistic flights that were able to supply the troops fighting the Axis.|$|R
500|$|Gibraltar {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Napoleonic Wars in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and in many later conflicts. Hitler drew up plans to besiege Gibraltar during the Second World War (<b>Operation</b> <b>Felix),</b> but the plans were never implemented and the Great Siege was the last military siege of Gibraltar. Some historians discuss the closure of the Gibraltar–Spain border (part of an attempt by Spain to coerce the United Kingdom into ceding Gibraltar) from 1969 to 1985 as a [...] "fifteenth siege"; as this differs from the other fourteen sieges in that it was not a conflict between opposing militaries, it is not included in this list.|$|E
500|$|Gibraltar was {{directly}} attacked, both overtly and covertly, {{on several occasions}} during the war. Vichy French aircraft carried out bombing attacks in 1940 after the surprise attack of their fleet by the royal navy and there were sporadic raids from Italian and German long-range aircraft, though the damage caused was not significant. Franco's position changed subtly from one of neutrality to [...] "non-belligerence", which in practice meant allowing the Axis powers to operate covertly against Gibraltar from Spanish territory. Despite Franco's willingness to overlook German and Italian activities {{in and around the}} Bay of Gibraltar, he decided not to join Hitler's planned <b>Operation</b> <b>Felix</b> to seize the territory. A major factor influencing his decision was the vulnerability of Spain's food supplies, as the country was unable to feed itself after the destruction of the Civil War. It relied on grain imports from the Americas, which would certainly have been cut off had Franco gone to war with the Allies. Hitler eventually abandoned Felix to pursue other priorities such as the invasions of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.|$|E

5000|$|One DEA agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, {{was working}} as an {{informant}} and grew close to many top drug barons, including Félix Gallardo. In November 1984, the Mexican military—acting on the intelligence information provided by Camarena—raided a large marijuana plantation owned by the Guadalajara Cartel and known as [...] "Rancho Búfalo". Angered by the suspected betrayal, Félix Gallardo and his men sought revenge by kidnapping, torturing, and killing the DEA agent in February 1985. The death of Camarena outraged Washington, and Mexico responded by carrying out a massive manhunt to arrest {{those involved in the}} incident. Guzmán took advantage of the internal crisis to gain ground within the cartel and take over more drug trafficking <b>operations.</b> In 1989, <b>Félix</b> Gallardo was arrested; while in prison and through a number of envoys, the drug lord called for a summit in Acapulco, Guerrero. In the conclave, Guzmán and others discussed the future of Mexico's drug trafficking and agreed to divide the territories previously owned by the Guadalajara Cartel. The Arellano Félix brothers formed the Tijuana Cartel, which controlled the Tijuana corridor and parts of Baja California; in Chihuahua state, a group controlled by Carrillo Fuentes family formed the Juárez Cartel; and the remaining faction left to Sinaloa and the Pacific Coast and formed the Sinaloa Cartel under the traffickers Ismael [...] "El Mayo" [...] Zambada, Palma, and Guzmán. Guzmán was specifically in charge of the drug corridors of Tecate, Baja California, and Mexicali and San Luis Río Colorado, two border crossings that connect the states of Sonora and Baja California with the U.S. states of Arizona and California.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wentworth {{was rather}} wide {{of the mark}} in suspecting that Clifford had begun to pay unscrupulous {{compliments}} to his brilliant cousin; for the young man had really more scruples than he received credit for in his family. He had a certain transparent shamefacedness which was in itself a proof that he was not at his ease in dissipation. His collegiate peccadilloes had aroused a domestic murmur as disagreeable to the young man as the creaking of his boots would have been to a house-breaker. Only, as the house-breaker would have simplified matters by removing his chaussures, it had seemed to Clifford that the shortest cut to comfortable relations with people--relations which should make him cease to think that when they spoke to him they meant something improving--was to renounce all ambition toward a nefarious development. And, in fact, Clifford's ambition took the most commendable form. He thought of himself in the future as the well-known and much-liked Mr. Wentworth, of Boston, who should, in the natural course of prosperity, have married his pretty cousin, Lizzie Acton; should live in a wide-fronted house, in view of the Common; and should drive, behind a light wagon, over the damp autumn roads, a pair of beautifully matched sorrel horses. Clifford's vision of the coming years was very simple; its most definite features were this element of familiar matrimony and the duplication of his resources for trotting. He had not yet asked his cousin to marry him; but he meant to do so as soon as he had taken his degree. Lizzie was serenely conscious of his intention, and she had made up her mind that he would improve. Her brother, who was very fond of this light, quick, competent little Lizzie, saw on his side no reason to interpose. It seemed to him a graceful social law that Clifford and his sister should become engaged; he himself was not engaged, but every one else, fortunately, was not such a fool as he. He was fond of Clifford, as well, and had his own way--of which it must be confessed he was a little ashamed--of looking at those aberrations which had led to the young man's compulsory retirement from the neighboring seat of learning. Acton had seen the world, as he said to himself; he had been to China and had knocked about among men. He had learned the essential difference between a nice young fellow and a mean young fellow, and was satisfied that there was no harm in Clifford. He believed--although it must be added that he had not quite the courage to declare it--in the doctrine of wild oats, and thought it a useful preventive of superfluous fears. If Mr. Wentworth and Charlotte and Mr. Brand would only apply it in Clifford's case, they would be happier; and Acton thought it a pity they should not be happier. They took the boy's misdemeanors too much to heart; they talked to him too solemnly; they frightened and bewildered him. Of course there was the great standard of morality, which forbade that a man should get tipsy, play at billiards for money, or cultivate his sensual consciousness; but what fear was there that poor Clifford was going to run a tilt at any great standard? It had, however, never occurred to Acton to dedicate the Baroness Munster to the redemption of a refractory collegian. The instrument, here, would have seemed to him quite too complex for the <b>operation.</b> <b>Felix,</b> on the other hand, had spoken in obedience to the belief that the more charming a woman is the more numerous, literally, are her definite social uses.|$|E
