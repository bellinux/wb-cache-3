5|$|For Dominion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> Djinn, the {{development}} team {{found that the}} Nintendo DS was best suited to the game's development.

Wrath of the White Witch was developed for the PlayStation 3. The team planned to bring the game to the console from the beginning of development, but opted to work on the DS version of the game beforehand due to the larger number of DS users in Japan at the time. The team found they could render the game world with great detail, using the hardware to its full potential to present the animation, world and music. Hino felt that the PlayStation 3 version allowed the game's music to accompany the imagery, which was not possible on the DS version.|$|E
