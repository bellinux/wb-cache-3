50|$|<b>Oxymorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{occurs as}} {{odourless}} white crystals or white to off-white powder. It darkens in colour with prolonged exposure to light. One gram of <b>oxymorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is soluble in 4 ml {{of water and}} it is sparingly soluble in alcohol and ether. It degrades upon contact with light.|$|E
5000|$|The {{brand name}} Numorphan is derived by analogy to the Nucodan name for an {{oxycodone}} product (or vice versa) {{as well as}} Paramorphan/Paramorfan for dihydromorphine and Paracodin (dihydrocodeine). The only commercially available salt of oxymorphone {{in most of the}} world at this time is the hydrochloride, which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.891, and <b>oxymorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> monohydrate has a factor of 0.85.|$|E
5000|$|Gottlieb {{has worked}} in {{multiple}} roles {{for the federal government}} of the United States, including as Deputy Commissioner for Medical and Scientific Affairs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in which capacity he served from 2005 to 2007. He helped initiate the early development of the FDA's generic drug user fee program and the agency's release of the Physician Labeling Rule. He also worked on development of the FDA's policies related to the tentative approval of fixed dose combination drugs for the treatment of HIV/AIDS under the PEPFAR program. He was appointed to the Senior Executive Service and granted a top secret security clearance during his appointment as the FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Medical and Scientific Affairs. He was also a a member of the White House Biodefense Interagency Working Group, which was convened after the September 11 attacks to help draft a strategic plan for the development of U.S. biodefense countermeasures. While working for the FDA, Gottlieb had to recuse himself from working on planning for a possible bird flu because he had done consulting work for companies whose products may be used to combat the bird flu. Before becoming the FDA's Deputy Commissioner, Gottlieb served as a senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner and as the FDA's Director of Medical Policy Development. While Commissioner of FDA, Gottlieb has advanced initiatives on addressing drug pricing [...] "in ways that the agency hasn’t done before" [...] according to the Wall Street Journal. He also committed to make fighting the crisis of opioid addiction one of his highest priorities as Commissioner. Under Gottlieb's leadership, [...] "The FDA stirred up a hornet's nest with an unprecedented request to Endo International plc to remove voluntarily its opioid pain medication, a tamper-resistant reformulation of Opana ER (<b>oxymorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride),</b> from the market." ...|$|E
30|$|Since the {{findings}} with Palladone XL™, {{a few other}} MR dosage forms have undergone a prescribing information label change to include drug-alcohol interactions. In an in vitro study with Avinza® (morphine sulfate extended release capsules), dose dumping was observed when Avinza® (30  mg) was mixed with 900  mL of buffer solutions containing either 20 or 40 % ethanol (Avinza Package Insert, Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc, San Diego, CA). Not surprisingly, the amount and rate of drug release was faster at higher alcohol concentrations. Though an in vivo study was not performed, results of the in vitro experiments were deemed sufficient to show acceleration of drug release from the extended release capsules. In another study with extended release tablets of <b>oxymorphone</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (Opana ER®), in vitro experiments did not show rapid drug release in 500  mL of 0.1  N HCl containing either 4, 20 or 40 % ethanol (Opana ER Package Insert, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., Chadds Ford, PA). However, the in vivo study indicated that mean AUC was 13 % higher, though not statistically significant, when a single dose of Opana ER® (40  mg) was co-administered with 240  mL of 40 % alcohol. No change in AUC was observed at the other concentrations of alcohol administered in the in vivo study (0, 4 and 20 %). Based on these findings with Avinza® and Opana ER®, their product labels contain black-box warnings to state that co-administration of alcohol with the drug {{may result in a}} potentially fatal overdose of the drug.|$|E
