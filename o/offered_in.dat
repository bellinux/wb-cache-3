40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that reactions to unfair <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the ultimatum game are correlated with negative emotion. However, {{little is known about the}} difference in neural activity between a proposer's decision-making in the ultimatum game compared with the dictator game. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study revealed that proposing fair <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the dictator game elicited greater activation in the right supramarginal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus and left anterior cingulate cortex compared with proposing fair <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the ultimatum game in 23 Chinese undergraduate and graduate students from Beijing Normal University in China. However, greater activation was found in the right superior temporal gyrus and left cingulate gyrus for the reverse contrast. The results indicate that proposing fair <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the dictator game is more strongly associated with cognitive control and conflicting information processing compared with proposing fair <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the ultimatum game...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} {{the reliance on}} emotional feelings as a heuristic influences the proposal of <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> negotiations. Results from three experiments based on the classic ultimatum game show that, compared to proposers who do not rely on their feelings, proposers who rely on their feelings make less generous <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the standard ultimatum game, more generous <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> {{a variant of the}} game allowing responders to make counteroffers, and less generous <b>offers</b> <b>in</b> the dictator game where no responses are allowed. Reliance on feelings triggers a more literal form of play, whereby proposers focus more on how they feel toward the offers themselves than on how they feel toward the possible outcomes of these offers, as if their offers were the final outcomes. Proposers relying on their feelings also tend to focus on gist-based, simpler construals of negotiations that capture only the essential aspects of the situation. ...|$|R
