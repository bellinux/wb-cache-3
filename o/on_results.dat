5|$|Braid was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} Windows title with possible console versions, though Blow was not committed to releasing either a PC or console version first. Blow signed up with Microsoft to release the game on Xbox Live in mid-2007, with that version officially announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. Blow was critical of the Xbox Live certification process, as he believed the effort to meet all the requirements could have been better spent on polishing the game. At the same time, the certification team allowed him to retain certain aspects of his vision for the game that were otherwise contrary to the process, including giving the player immediate control of the game instead of requiring a start-up title screen. Microsoft also requested that Blow include some additional hints to the player based <b>on</b> <b>results</b> of playtesting, but Blow held his ground, refusing to release the game if {{he was forced to}} add these. He said he would likely not release a game again on the Xbox Live service under the same business model. Blow later released a Braid theme for Xbox Live; though he wanted to release this theme for free, Microsoft required the theme to be priced at a nominal level.|$|E

Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of U.S. dollars, the highest of any eSport. The largest of them is known as The International, which is produced annually by Valve and held at the KeyArena in Seattle. Valve also manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, which {{are a series of}} tournaments held every year that award qualification points based <b>on</b> <b>results</b> for getting directly invited to The International. For most tournaments, media coverage is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events. Broadcasts of professional Dota 2 matches are streamed live over the internet, and sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak viewership numbers in the millions.|$|E

5|$|Freddie Stowers was {{the first}} of only two African American to receive the Medal of Honor for actions in World War I. Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, {{continuing}} to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died of his wounds, and was shortly afterwards recommended for the Medal of Honor; however, this recommendation was never processed. In 1990, the Department of the Army conducted a review and the Stowers recommendation was uncovered. An investigation was launched, and based <b>on</b> <b>results</b> of the investigation the award of the Medal of Honor was approved. Stowers' Medal of Honor was presented on April 24, 1991—seventy-three years after he was killed-in-action. Henry Johnson's Medal of Honor was presented on June 2, 2015-eighty five years after he died.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} bodies {{in each country}} operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending <b>on</b> <b>results.</b> Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At {{the end of a}} season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and {{one or more of the}} teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.|$|E
5|$|To placate {{demands from}} {{civilian}} politicians for {{the holding of}} elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections {{as well as the}} structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a parliament (Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat/MPR) with the power to elect presidents, consisting of a lower house (Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat/DPR) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based <b>on</b> <b>results</b> of general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.|$|E
