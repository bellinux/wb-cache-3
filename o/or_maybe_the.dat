500|$|Later that year, Paul {{received}} {{an offer of}} a trial with Colombian club Millonarios. Colombian clubs, who {{were not required to}} pay transfer fees as their governing body was not affiliated with FIFA, made similar offers to several British players. Paul was one of seven to make the trip to South America. Millonarios offered him a £3,000 signing on fee and £150 per month, far in excess of the £12 per week maximum wage in British football. Once in Colombia, Paul found himself unimpressed by the conditions. He remarked in his autobiography that seeing football pitches surrounded by barbed wire put him in mind of [...] "a concentration camp, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> monkey-house in the zoo". Paul stayed in Bogota for only ten days, without playing a single match. Swansea were angered by Paul's trip, and transfer-listed him upon his return. As a result, he transferred to Manchester City for £19,500, a British record for a half-back. Ken Barnes joined the club on the same day. The two became close friends; Paul was best man at Barnes' wedding.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Mitchell sisters {{featured}} {{heavily in}} a BBC marketing campaign preceding their arrival. Several promotional trailers aired on the BBC network in summer 2007.

[...] This was later recreated during Ronnie's 2017 wedding to Jack where Roxy and Ronnie danced to The Girls once again spraying guests with soda syphon's. This was also their last episode together as they later died showing that they came in together and left together. Two other trailers featured Ronnie and Roxy individually. To the instrumental sound of [...] "Little Green Bag" [...] by George Baker, each sister discussed their sibling, giving snippets of information on their personality and the dynamics of their relationship. Discussing Ronnie, Roxy stated that her sister would {{go to great lengths to}} prevent her from getting hurt. In turn, Ronnie said [...] "Roxy will always be my kid sister.

6000|$|He {{could not}} hope to see {{anything}} new upon this lane of the sea. He had been on these coasts {{for the last three}} years. From Low Cape to Malantan the distance was fifty miles, six hours' steaming for the old ship with the tide, or seven against. Then you steered straight for the land, and by-and-by three palms would appear on the sky, tall and slim, and with their disheveled heads in a bunch, as if in confidential criticism of the dark mangroves. The Sofala would be headed towards the somber strip of the coast, which at a given moment, as the ship closed with it obliquely, would show several clean shining fractures--the brimful estuary of a river. Then on through a brown liquid, three parts water and one part black earth, on and on between the low shores, three parts black earth and one part brackish water, the Sofala would plow her way up-stream, as she had done once every month for these seven years or more, long before he was aware of her existence, long before he had ever thought of having {{anything to do with her}} and her invariable voyages. The old ship ought to have known the road better than her men, who had not been kept so long at it without a change; better than the faithful Serang, whom he had brought over from his last ship to keep the captain's watch; better than he himself, who had been her captain for the last three years only. She could always be depended upon to make her courses. Her compasses were never out. She was no trouble at all to take about, as if her great age had given her knowledge, wisdom, and steadiness. She made her landfalls to a degree of the bearing, and almost to a minute of her allowed time. At any moment, as he sat on the bridge without looking up, or lay sleepless in his bed, simply by reckoning the days and the hours he could tell where he was--the precise spot of the beat. He knew it well too, this monotonous huckster's round, up and down the Straits; he knew its order and its sights and its people. Malacca to begin with, in at daylight and out at dusk, to cross over with a rigid phosphorescent wake this highway of the Far East. Darkness and gleams on the water, clear stars on a black sky, perhaps the lights of a home steamer keeping her unswerving course in the middle, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> elusive shadow of a native craft with her mat sails flitting by silently--and the low land on the other side in sight at daylight. At noon the three palms of the next place of call, up a sluggish river. The only white man residing there was a retired young sailor, with whom he had become friendly in the course of many voyages. Sixty miles farther on there was another place of call, a deep bay with only a couple of houses on the beach. And so on, in and out, picking up coastwise cargo here and there, and finishing with a hundred miles' steady steaming through the maze of an archipelago of small islands up to a large native town at the end of the beat. There was a three days' rest for the old ship before he started her again in inverse order, seeing the same shores from another bearing, hearing the same voices in the same places, back again to the Sofala's port of registry on the great highway to the East, where he would take up a berth nearly opposite the big stone pile of the harbor office till it was time to start again on the old round of 1600 miles and thirty days. Not a very enterprising life, this, for Captain Whalley, Henry Whalley, otherwise Dare-devil Harry--Whalley of the Condor, a famous clipper in her day. No. Not a very enterprising life for a man who had served famous firms, who had sailed famous ships (more than one or two of them his own); who had made famous passages, had been the pioneer of new routes and new trades; who had steered across the unsurveyed tracts of the South Seas, and had seen the sun rise on uncharted islands. Fifty years at sea, and forty out in the East ("a pretty thorough apprenticeship," [...] he used to remark smilingly), had made him honorably known to a generation of shipowners and merchants in all the ports from Bombay clear over to where the East merges into the West upon the coast of the two Americas. His fame remained writ, not very large but plain enough, on the Admiralty charts. Was there not somewhere between Australia and China a Whalley Island and a Condor Reef? On that dangerous coral formation the celebrated clipper had hung stranded for three days, her captain and crew throwing her cargo overboard with one hand and with the other, as it were, keeping off her a flotilla of savage war-canoes. At that time neither the island nor the reef had any official existence. Later the officers of her Majesty's steam vessel Fusilier, dispatched to make a survey of the route, recognized in the adoption of these two names the enterprise of the man and the solidity of the ship. Besides, as anyone who cares may see, the [...] "General Directory," [...] vol. ii. p. 410, begins the description of the [...] "Malotu or Whalley Passage" [...] with the words: [...] "This advantageous route, first discovered in 1850 by Captain Whalley in the ship Condor," [...] &c., and ends by recommending it warmly to sailing vessels leaving the China ports for the south in the months from December to April inclusive.|$|E
