25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what the learners do in the classroom than with what the teacher does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b>|$|E

25|$|The College was {{in great}} {{disrepair}} when Jan Standonck took over—some {{of the walls}} were falling down. It had {{become known as the}} Collège de Montaigu, after the Archbishop's brother, and Jan was to make it famous. He imposed a very severe regime <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> They could leave only with his permission and had to return before nightfall—he took the key from the porter every night. They wore only a single cloth gown and were given only a piece of bread each day to eat. They {{had to go to the}} door of a nearby monastery at eleven o'clock each morning to receive a hand-out of food. They were punished for the slightest fault, and were encouraged—out of pure charity—to inform of any misdemeanours, and to criticise each other's conduct. Erasmus, one of the students, later said he did not think anyone could forget—or even survive unscathed—their time at the College.|$|E

Speaking in French, he asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied [...] "no," [...] he answered: [...] "I am fighting feminism". One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, [...] "Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life." [...] Lépine responded that [...] "You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists." [...] He then opened fire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.

500|$|Around 1960, {{state law}} {{mandated}} [...] "an immediate cut-off of state funds to any white institution that admitted a black student". At {{a meeting in}} the Old Gym on January 17, 1961, {{an overwhelming majority of}} the 2,741students present voted to endorse integration of qualified applicants, regardless of race. Three years after the meeting, and one year after the University of Georgia's violent integration, Georgia Tech became the first university in the Deep South to desegregate without a court order, with Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr., and Lawrence Michael Williams becoming Georgia Tech's first three African American students; they registered for class on September 18, 1963 and started class on September 20. Members of the press were barred from the campus to discourage disruptive behavior, and plainclothes police officers were placed on the campus.
