5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the cathedral}} was overrun by Parliamentarian troops. Along with other destruction, the troops seized {{the books of}} the cathedral library, taking them to Cardiff Castle, where they were burned along with many copies of the Book of Common Prayer. Among those invited to the castle to warm {{themselves}} by the fire on that cold winter day, were the wives of some sequestered clergymen. Also during this time of unrest, a man named Milles, {{who claimed to be}} a practising Puritan, appropriated portions of the cathedral for his own gain. Milles set up a tavern in the cathedral, used part <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stable, turned the choir area into a pen for his calves and used the font as a trough for his pigs.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012 offseason, {{with the}} Predators {{unable to take}} Weber to {{arbitration}} again (a player can only be subjected to team-elected arbitration once in his career), Weber signed a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> signing bonus, from the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. The offer sheet was the richest in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season and length, surpassing the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek. The Predators, already having lost Weber's defensive partner Ryan Suter to unrestricted free agency, matched the offer sheet five days later. Following the 2012-13 NHL lockout, the CBA was changed to prevent teams from signing other players to similar deals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1907 Mahler, {{exhausted}} {{from the effects of}} the campaign against him in Vienna, took his family to Maiernigg. Soon after their arrival both daughters fell ill with scarlet fever and diphtheria. Anna recovered, but after a fortnight's struggle Maria died on 12 July. Immediately following this devastating loss, Mahler learned that his heart was defective, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by a Vienna specialist, who ordered a curtailment of all forms of vigorous exercise. The extent to which Mahler's condition disabled him is unclear; Alma wrote <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> virtual death sentence, though Mahler himself, in a letter written to her on 30 August 1907, said that {{he would be able to}} live a normal life, apart from avoiding over-fatigue. The illness was, however, a further depressing factor; at the end of the summer the villa at Maiernigg was closed, and never revisited.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{the mundane}} sight of pebbles {{rolling in the}} Baltic Sea surf {{in the summer of}} 1921, Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, {{conducting}} extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally conceived <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hymn to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature. He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923, and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year.|$|E
5|$|It was {{suggested}} that she would run for senator for the Buenos Aires Province at the 2017 midterm elections, but her former minister Florencio Randazzo wanted to run for those elections as well. Refusing to run in primary elections, Kirchner asked for a shared ticket as a condition to run for senator. Randazzo did not accept the proposal. The FPV was renamed as the Citizen's Unity Party at the province and registered as a coalition of minor parties only, leaving the PJ out <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, both parties would run to the elections as unrelated parties.|$|E
5|$|Richard Vines, whilst {{writing for}} Bloomberg, advised readers {{to not be}} put off the hype; and while the courses are not as life {{changing}} as those served at The Fat Duck, there are stand out dishes such as the meat fruit and the tipsy cake. He {{also noted that the}} meat fruit was a favourite of Pierre Koffmann. Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. She thought it was a well-oiled operation, but a little too much so, and questioned the originality <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E

5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues {{that it is impossible}} for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E

Then, he took a ten-week business course at Folsom's Commercial College, where he studied bookkeeping. Despite his father's absences and frequent family moves, young John was a well-behaved, serious, and studious boy. His contemporaries described him as reserved, earnest, religious, methodical, and discreet. He was an excellent debater and expressed himself precisely.

25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kind of thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing (because it isn't a particular thing at all).|$|E

25|$|The {{fruit is}} not {{poisonous}} to humans or livestock, {{as shown by}} several studies. However, it is mostly inedible due to its taste and its extremely hard texture.
