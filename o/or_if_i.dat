500|$|Television critics scribed mostly {{positive}} {{reviews for}} [...] "Stowaway". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting {{in response to}} it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't {{know if she was}} planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E
2500|$|Her {{professional}} tennis career, however, {{was going}} nowhere. [...] "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, {{some of whom}} I had thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," [...] she wrote. [...] "Suddenly {{it dawned on me}} that my triumphs had not destroyed the racial barriers once and for all, as I had—perhaps naively—hoped. <b>Or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did destroy them, they had been erected behind me again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "What I {{worry about}} is kids {{growing up in a}} society where they say 'if I send this email <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> visit this website, then {{somebody}} may think I'm a terrorist. I'm {{not going to talk about}} this issue, I'm not going to read this book, I'm not going to explore this idea.' I don't want anyone thinking about that. It upsets me very much and is not the kind of free society I think we should be living in." ...|$|E

God never have care of my soul, but utterly renounce me, if the least word or syllable in it proceeded from my pen, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were any way privy to the writing or printing of it. [...] I am grown at length to see into the vanity of the world more than ever I did, and now I condemn myself for {{nothing so much as}} playing the dolt in print.|$|E
2500|$|Beck's {{previous}} album, Modern Guilt, {{was released}} in 2008, and was the final album released under his Interscope Records contract. In the interim between album releases, Beck worked {{on a wide variety}} of projects, including new studio material, most of which went unreleased for several years. In October 2012, bassist and frequent collaborator Justin Meldal-Johnsen commented: [...] "I would estimate that there are currently about three or four albums’ worth of material floating around," [...] and Beck himself said that [...] "I wasn't sure if I was going to put out a record – <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should put out a record. It felt like I was standing still, while everything else was in such flux." ...|$|E
2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year. [...] "It's just something that it's never possible for me to go back and change." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Boxer Campaign, {{the couple}} had at first {{exchanged}} letters, which Beatty signed 'Jack', as Ethel was still a married woman and discretion was advised. Ethel became involved with another man and the exchange of letters ceased but on Beatty's return she sent him a telegram and letter inviting him to resume their friendship. Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, [...] "I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not care if I ever saw you again, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were killed or not. And now I have arrived with the firm determination not to see you at all in my own mind... Unfortunately I shall go on loving you to the bitter end... To me always a Queen, if not always mine, Good-bye." ...|$|E
2500|$|If I {{send someone}} {{out of the}} room - for example, the mother and child - I {{carefully}} move father from his chair and put him into mother's chair. <b>Or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe it will give you somewhat of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, and yet that family grouping is being rearranged, which is what you are after when changing a family." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 27, 2010 it was {{announced}} by Hamilton during {{an interview that he}} had checked himself into a Psychiatric hospital stating: [...] "My stay here is like identical to my stay in the industry. As far as being the new guy in here having to deal with politics and people trying to control you. The critics would have to be the doctors and the rounds. So you can say this is like an experiment to see if the industry is really like an asylum <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was the one bugging. Some say the industry is like high school but its just like a [...] All I wanted to do and still want to do is make music, he explained. It {{got to the point where}} I started talking in rhymes all the time, even in just regular conversations. And music just became me, so I thought it be a good idea if I checked into the hospital just to get my mind right." ...|$|E

"It is {{not correct}}, and if I said so, I was not correct – I cannot recall if I said it, but I did not say, <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did, I {{did not mean}} to say it – that these issues could not be dealt with {{until the end of the}} Mahon Tribunal." [...] In 2004, Joe Higgins {{described}} Ahern's response to questions as [...] "like playing handball against a hay stack. You hear a dull thud but the ball never comes back to you". Ahern features as one of the main characters portrayed in spoof radio comic strips Gift Grub and Nob Nation. The fortnightly magazine The Phoenix featured [...] "De Diary of a Nortsoide Taoiseach", a satirical column written from Ahern's point of view in a phonetic transliteration of his broad north Dublin accent. His idiosyncratic delivery made Ahern a doyen of satirists and impersonators, from Dermot Morgan (in the 90's) to Mario Rosenstock (RTÉ 2 TV, 2012). Ahern was satirised in a spoof publication Bertie's little book of ethics.|$|E
2500|$|After Lindros criticized Worley in March 2000 {{for failing}} to {{diagnose}} a concussion (his second of the season), Clarke stripped Lindros {{of the role of}} team captain. A few weeks after suffering a third concussion during practice, Lindros returned to the Flyers lineup for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals and sustained his fourth concussion of the season (his sixth in 27 months) during Game 7. Afterwards, Clarke said he did not dislike Eric, but he had a problem with his parents, saying, [...] "If he's going to come back, he can't have his dad calling us and telling us who to trade for and who he wants to play with Eric and who can't play with Eric." [...] Lindros never played for the Flyers again, as he rejected the Flyers qualifying offer in the off-season and sat out the 2000–01 season. Lindros pushed for a trade to Toronto but that move fell apart at last minute when Clarke and Leafs manager Pat Quinn could not agree on terms. [...] Clarke finally traded Lindros to the New York Rangers in August 2001. Following the trade, Clarke said, [...] "I don't give a crap whether he ever plays again <b>or</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever see him again. All he ever did was cause aggravation to our team." ...|$|E
