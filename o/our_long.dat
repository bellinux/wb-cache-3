The weather was cold, that damp coldness of some mornings in June which makes you search for a light jacket and freezes your hands; but we were full of ardour, replete with good advice and lots of energy and it was happily that Richard and I on the tandem and our trainer Lambert on a bicycle started <b>our</b> <b>long</b> journey for the record from Paris to Agen.|$|E

Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked <b>our</b> <b>long</b> boom. He's here with us tonight.

500|$|By the 1570s, Sir Henry Sidney and {{his wife}} had become {{somewhat}} disillusioned and embittered about lacking financial rewards on the Queen's part for their long service. In 1572 Mary Dudley even had to decline a barony for her husband in a letter to William Cecil, himself Baron Burghley since the previous year: The expenses such a title implied were simply too great, Sir Henry's mind being [...] "dismayed [...] hard choice" [...] between choosing financial ruin and royal displeasure [...] "in refusing it". Two years later, in 1574, she quarrelled with the Lord Chamberlain (her brother-in-law, the Earl of Sussex) over accommodation at court. She refused to exchange her accustomed rooms with a cold chamber that had previously been [...] "but the place for my servants". All in all though, she explained, [...] "old Lord Harry and his old Moll" [...] would accept [...] "like good friends the small portion allotted <b>our</b> <b>long</b> service in court; which as little as it is, seems something too much." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{friendship}} and professional association lasted {{until the end}} of Richardson's life. Gielgud wrote in 1983, [...] "Besides cherishing <b>our</b> <b>long</b> years of work together in the theatre, where he was such an inspiring and generous partner, I grew to love him in private life as a great gentleman, a rare spirit, fair and balanced, devotedly loyal and tolerant and, as a companion, bursting with vitality, curiosity and humour." [...] Among Richardson's other parts in his first Old Vic season, Enobarbus in Antony and Cleopatra gained particularly good notices. The Morning Post commented that it placed him in the first rank of Shakespearean actors. At the beginning of 1931 Baylis re-opened Sadler's Wells Theatre with a production of Twelfth Night starring Gielgud as Malvolio and Richardson as Sir Toby Belch. W. A. Darlington in The Daily Telegraph wrote of Richardson's [...] "ripe, rich and mellow Sir Toby, [...] I would go many miles to see again." ...|$|E

500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of <b>our</b> <b>long</b> association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

Charles had been retired for many years and lived in recent times in Chalfont St. Giles. He spent much of his early career with Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell and was involved in many of their famous productions like The Red Shoes and The Battle of the River Plate. He also had a long standing working relationship with John Boorman. The last time I worked with him was on [...] Khartoum way back in 1965 and I remember his stiff upper lip British reserve of being something of a comfort to a young and inexperienced second A.D. in the oppressive heat of Cairo. I thought of him as 'posh' in those days but in fact he was a thorough professional and someone you could rely on in any kind of adversity. He was a credit to our business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Woodward's {{reconstruction}} included ape-like canine teeth, {{which was}} itself controversial. In August 1913, Woodward, Dawson and Teilhard de Chardin began a systematic {{search of the}} spoil heaps specifically to find the missing canines. Teilhard de Chardin soon found a canine that, according to Woodward, fitted the jaw perfectly. A few days later, Teilhard de Chardin moved to France and took no further part in the discoveries. Noting that the tooth [...] "corresponds exactly with that of an ape", Woodward expected the find to end any dispute over his reconstruction of the skull. However, Keith attacked the find. Keith pointed out that human molars {{are the result of}} side to side movement when chewing. The canine in the Piltdown jaw was impossible as it prevented side to side movement. To explain the wear on the molar teeth, the canine could not have been any higher than the molars. Grafton Elliot Smith, a fellow anthropologist, sided with Woodward, and at the next Royal Society meeting claimed that Keith's opposition was motivated entirely by ambition. Keith later recalled, [...] "Such was the end of <b>our</b> <b>long</b> friendship." ...|$|E
