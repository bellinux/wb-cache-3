2500|$|The oval-section {{fuselage}} was a frameless monocoque shell {{built in}} two vertically-separate halves formed over a mahogany or concrete mould. Pressure was applied with band clamps. The shell sandwich skins comprised birch three-ply <b>outers,</b> with cores of Ecuadorean balsa. In many generally smaller but vital areas, such as around apertures and attachment zones, stronger timbers, including aircraft-quality spruce, replaced the balsa core. The main {{areas of the}} sandwich skin were only [...] thick. Together with various forms of wood reinforcement, often of laminated construction, the sandwich skin gave great stiffness and torsional resistance. The separate fuselage halves speeded construction, permitting access by personnel working in parallel with others, as the work progressed.|$|E

40|$|The {{accessory}} <b>outer</b> segment, a cytoplasmic structure running {{alongside the}} photoreceptor <b>outer</b> segment, {{has been described}} in teleost fishes, excluding the model organism zebrafish. So far, {{the function of the}} accessory <b>outer</b> segment is unknown. Here, we describe the ultrastructure of the zebrafish cone accessory <b>outer</b> segment by electron microscopy. Starting at the connecting cilium, the accessory <b>outer</b> segment runs parallel alongside the cone <b>outer</b> segment (COS). A thin plasma bridge connects the <b>outer</b> segment with the accessory <b>outer</b> segment, whose surface is enlarged by foldings and invaginations. Beside the morphological descriptions, we demonstrate that the Usher protein myosin VIIa (Myo 7 a) is a specific marker for the zebrafish cone accessory <b>outer</b> segment. Zebrafish cone photoreceptors possess a large and well-differentiated accessory <b>outer</b> segment, in which the unconventional motor protein Myo 7 a is highly enriched. The direct cytoplasmic contact with the COS as well as the surface enlargement of the accessory <b>outer</b> segment suggests an important role of this structure in transport and exchange of metabolites between the COS and the surrounding retinal pigment epithelium. In future studies of the <b>outer</b> retina, more attention should be paid to this often neglected structur...|$|R

5000|$|Although The Quiet War and Gardens of the Sun {{can be read}} as {{standalone}} novels, {{taken together}} they form the two halves of the story of the [...] "Quiet War" [...] of the title. The primary conflict is between the radical environmentalism of the inner system, led by the new superpowers governments (such as Greater Brazil) and the posthumanism of the <b>Outers.</b> Having narrowly avoided the destruction of Earth's ecosystems, the feudal Greater Brazil attempted to return most of the planet to a [...] "natural" [...] state, to the extent that most of Earth's population inhabits a few megacities. The <b>Outers,</b> by contrast, survive by terraforming the moons of Jupiter and the other outer planets and practicing genetic engineering, which caused ideological tension with Greater Brazil, ultimately flaring into a full-scale conflict called the [...] "Quiet War".|$|E

40|$|Since {{long-term}} {{sustainability of}} <b>outer</b> space activities {{is an extension}} concept of sustainable development {{in the field of}} <b>outer</b> space law,there are not only some connections but also a few differences between them. According to the juridical status of the principle of sustainable development,the principle of long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> space activities should be an important principle in the law of <b>outer</b> space,and contains the following aspects:inter-generation fair; within-generation fair; long-term sustainable use,integration between environment and activities in the <b>outer</b> space. In the case of the existing <b>outer</b> environment worsening,emphasizing and practicing principle of long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> space activities has important practical significance. Now the challenges related to the long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> space activities include the issues of space debris; the increasing decrease in geostationary orbit resources; space pollution. The international community is working on the guidelines of thelong-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> space activity guidelines which {{plays a key role in}} solving the above problems. More importantly,the principle of long-term sustainability of <b>outer</b> space activities should be put into the <b>Outer</b> Space Treaty or developed to be a generally accepted rule of customary international law so that it can play the role of legal norms. 外空活動長期可持續性是可持續發展概念在外空領域的延伸,所以它與可持續發展概念既有聯系也有區別。對比可持續發展原則,外空活動長期可持續性原則應是外空法的一項重要原則,其內涵包括代際公平、代內公平、長期可持續利用和外空環境與外空活動一體化等四個方面。在現有外層環境日益惡化的情形下,強調并踐行外空活動長期可持續性原則具有重要的現實意義。目前,外空活動長期可持續性所面臨的問題包括空間碎片問題、地球靜止軌道問題和空間環境污染問題。國際社會正在制定《外空活動長期可持續性準則》,這對解決上述問題發揮很大的作用,但更為重要的是把這一原則規定到《外空條約》中來,或有意推動使其成為一項公認的國際習慣法規則,使其發揮法律規范的作用...|$|R
