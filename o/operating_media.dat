But in late-December 1972, RBS was allowed {{by the government to}} return on the air this time by its blocktime agreement with the National Media Production Center (NMPC), however with limited three-month permits. But due to limited licenses, difficulty in financial obligations, and disallowing foreign citizens and entities from owning and <b>operating</b> <b>media</b> companies in the Philippines, Stewart and the American Broadcasting Company, who owned a quarter of the company, was forced to cede majority control to a triumvirate composed of Gilberto Duavit Sr., a Malaca√±ang official; Menardo Jimenez, an accountant; and Felipe Gozon, an attorney of the Stewarts in 1974 and the station changed its name to GMA Radio-Television Arts (GMA stood for Greater Manila Area, the station's initial coverage area), though Republic Broadcasting System, Inc. remained as its corporate name until 1996. His wife Loring was the president when the takeover happened. The relaunched GMA, aside from sporting a light blue square logo with the network name in white, also (until 1980) had a circle 7 logo in use, in its final years the blue circle 7 logo used was similar to those used by the ABC in some United States cities.|$|E
40|$|The {{most recent}} efforts in {{developing}} the Dense Medium Separation (DMS) technology have been particularly directed towards {{the treatment of the}} fines (in the range 0. 5 to 0. 1 / 0. 3 mm), the separation at high density, the high sharpness separation and the use of multistage dynamic separation system. To this end, the control of the rheological properties of the suspensions used in dense medium separation is of primary importance. This means that: (a) a knowledge of the influence of the <b>operating</b> <b>media</b> composition on the rheological properties is necessary; (b) the medium cleaning circuits have to be properly designed in order to obtain the required composition of the medium. This implies the need of a model for describing the rheological behaviour of dense media. The model has been developed after test programmes conducted on suspensions of magnetite, ferrosilicon and various non-magnetic contaminants, under different conditions of volume concentration, proportion of components of the solid phase and shear rate. Basic data for using the model are the rheological properties of media made up of pure components or corresponding to selected compositions. In this paper the model has been checked for suspensions of ferrosilicon containing different types of contaminants. The principles underlying the design of medium regeneration circuits in modern dynamic DMS plants are highlighted. Some workable enhancements of the complex plant circuitry aimed at obtaining and controlling the required composition of the medium and, hence, modulating the viscosity of <b>operating</b> <b>media</b> are described...|$|E

In the case of MOS technology, we employ a quadratic functional equation similar to that found in standard MOS transistors to implement synapses in ANNs. A structure has been proposed in [3] to imple-ment a MOS device with extemally-controllable threshold voltage to be employed as a synapse. In the present work, we develop and compare practical architectures within which these synapses can be utilized optimally. A simula-tor and proper training algorithms have been developed to simulate different hardware-based architectures. 1...|$|E

30|$|Some {{reasons of}} nickel-zirconia SOFC anodes {{structural}} degradation in <b>operating</b> <b>media</b> have been explained. The dual effect of water vapor on the anodes durability has been revealed. Small {{amount of water}} vapor in Ar‚Äì 5 ¬†vol%¬†H 2 mixture (water vapor pressure below 0.03 ¬†MPa) {{did not affect the}} reduction of the nickel phase in YSZ‚ÄìNiO ceramics, but causes some changes in the YSZ‚ÄìNi cermet structure, in particular, growth of nanopores in tiny Ni particles. Resulting strength of the YSZ‚ÄìNi cermet decreased by 10 ‚Äì 12 % as compared to the material reduced in the atmosphere without water vapor. High concentration of water vapor in the mixture (water vapor pressure above 0.03 ‚Äì 0.05 ¬†MPa) caused a converse change in the kinetics of reduction. The water vapor was an obstacle for the as-received material reduction and also caused re-oxidation of the nickel phase in YSZ‚ÄìNi cermet at 600 ¬†¬∞C. Better physical and mechanical properties were revealed for material treated by redox cycling after holding at 600 ¬†¬∞C in the water-depleted gas mixture. Thus, the water vapor content in operating hydrogenous media of SOFCs has to be limited, and water vapor pressure should be below 0.03 ‚Äì 0.05 ¬†MPa.|$|E

40|$|The wear of {{polyoxymethylene}} (POM) {{is considered}} a key design parameter of polymer gears and some mechanical applications, and it determines the service time span. This work investigates the influence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the specific wear rate of POM/CNT nanocomposites by using a pin-on-disk test rig (sliding only). The CNTs were synthesized with a fully automatic machine via the arc-discharge multi-electrode technique and subsequently dispersed in a POM matrix to manufacture test specimens. The CNT weight percentages were varied within the range 0 - 0. 03 wt. % in three different <b>operating</b> <b>media</b> (air, distilled water, and mineral oil). The wear mechanism was examined by microscopy. The mechanical and thermal properties of POM/CNT were studied by using calorimetric analysis and by mechanical tensile testing. In addition, the thermal and mechanical properties were improved to an optimum CNT ratio of 0. 02 wt. % due to the improvement in crystallinity of POM {{and a decrease in}} the fusion defects. The crystallinity degree increased by 7 %, and the melting temperature also increased. The results further indicate that the specific wear rate (Ws) for POM/CNT containing 0. 03 wt. % CNT in air and water media was improved by 73 % and 66 %, respectively, compared with virgin POM. In addition, the tensile strength of the mechanical properties and Young's modulus increased by 31 % and 29 %, respectively. Emmag- Erasmus Mundus Maghreb & Egyp...|$|E
40|$|Two-phase heat {{transfer}} in mini/micro-channels {{is capable of}} meeting the high cooling demands of modern high heat flux applications. The phase change process ensures better temperature uniformity and control for local hot spots. Furthermore, these compact channels could be helpful in reducing the required charge and material inventories. Environmental concerns‚Äîmainly ozone depletion and global warming‚Äîhave instigated a search for new alternatives in refrigeration industry. While new compounds are being developed to address stringent legislative demands, natural alternatives are also coming into prominence. A limited number of investigators have reported on thermal performance of such alternatives. The current study is therefore focused on saturated flow boiling {{heat transfer}}, pressure drop and dryout characteristics for three low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants (R 152 a, R 600 a and R 1234 yf) in a vertical mini-channel. In this study experiments were carried out by uniformly heating a test section (stainless steel tube with 1. 60 mm inside diameter and 245 mm heated length) at 27 and 32 ¬†oC saturation temperature with 50 - 500 kg/m 2 s mass velocities. The effects of various parameters of interest (like heat flux, mass flux, system pressure, vapor quality, <b>operating</b> <b>media)</b> on flow boiling heat transfer, frictional pressure drop and dryout characteristics were recorded. R 134 a, which has been widely used in several applications, is utilized as a reference case for comparison of thermal performance in this study. Experimental results for saturated boiling heat transfer showed strong influence of heat flux and system pressure with insignificant contributions from mass flux and vapor quality. Two phase frictional pressure drop increased with mass flux, vapor quality and with reduced operating pressure. The dryout heat flux remained unaffected with variation in saturation temperature, critical vapor quality in most cases was about 85 %. The experimental results (boiling heat transfer, two-phase pressure drop and dryout heat flux) were compared with well-known macro and micro-scale correlations from the literature.

In this study, we device a digital game, which possessed scientific and fun, base on the conception of insects (DGBI), then can use it to test elementary school student‚Äôs conception about insect. The DGBI materials creating pattern use as the ADDIE model. First step is to analyze the DGBI materials. We analyze student‚Äôs alternative conceptions of insect and what the teaching staff needs to teach in the section of insect, and then we develop three teaching units, namely the ‚ÄïBugs Adventure‚Äñ, ‚ÄïLegs and Wings "and" Mouthparts and feeding habits‚Äñ. Second, design the DGBI. Making DGBI has a clear teaching aim, multi-learning strategy like conception puzzle, computer simulation and conception mapping etc, an artistic and convenient <b>operating</b> <b>media</b> interface and a learning content that is easy to understand by the words and video in the DGBI materials. Third, develop the DGBI. Developing DGBI includes making animation component and composing animation component, these animation components makes 94. 4 % of students prefer to use DGBI materials to learn the conceptions of insect, especially the constructional detail magnify function and interactive game design in the teaching materials increase the student‚Äôs learning interest. Forth, implement DGBI. We invite Two national college professors and four senior science teachers to use DGBI, and then we interview them to collect the testing amendments, and corrected it. Fifth, evaluate DGBI. We use quasi-experiment design and questionnaire survey to evaluate DGBI. In the quasi-experiment design, we select 111 students for four classes in an elementary school in New Taipei City and ask them to use DGBI, and then we tested them by the ‚ÄïInsects Conceptions test‚Äñ. We found that after using the DGBI materials, the student's post-test scores (13. 64) is higher than the pre-test scores (7. 55), and there are significant differences (t = 16. 47,p =. 00) and helps the student to establish the correct concept of insect [...] In the questionnaire survey, we ask 6 elementary school teachers to write down the ‚Äïdigital materials quality certification evaluation form‚Äñ after using DGBI. The teachers think that DGBI has an organizational integrity of the insect teaching material. When using DGBI, they can teach the insect unit as a game, and student can learn the insect unit on student's own initiative, which allows students to study the conceptions of insect step-by-step. ...|$|E

In the modern capitalistic society, long working hours and limited personal time are common among in the society. Although the limited personal time restricted our leisure time, our media consuming habit is also shifted to adapted to the limited personal time thanks to the advanced information communication technologies (ICTs). ICTs not only help us to consume vast amount of information around the world, but also inviting us to access to the internet regardless of the physical place and time. It also helps us to digitalise different format of information, such as texts, audio, videos, etc., in the same digital bit so users can access to different formats of resources through various types of digital device now. The above media convergence provides many entertainment for the internet users and it suits the contemporary capitalistic society lifestyle. With the vast amount of information available on the internet, the conventional media is facing severe competition from the cyberspace counterparts. The static and fixed TV schedule is a thing of past because audience can consume various TV programmes regardless of time and place on the internet now. As such, media convergence brings difficulties in <b>operating</b> <b>media</b> business in the contemporary society. TV ratings of the conventional media are affected by the prevalentce of using ICTs. However, some conventional media view the media convergence and digitalisation are new opportunities for development. The high definition resolution and advanced technical quality of the digital footages and increasing channels or platforms for broadcasting the media products mean there are more channels for the users to approach or learn about own media products. The key is how to make their media products adapt to different media platforms on the internet and invite more internet users to consume the programmes afterwards. In this Thesis, we will use a conventional media in Hong Kong ‚Äì RTHK to study the transformation of conventional media in adapting to the network society. Media convergence brings many possibilities to this 87 -year-old Public Service Broadcaster (PSB). Media convergence also helps this institution to produce many niche and edgy programmes in a more attractive way for the general public to understand different social issues. RTHK case not only helps us to understand the media convergence in a conventional media, but also gives us an insight to learn about the nature of PSB {{as well as the}} difference between PSB and private media business. published_or_final_versionMedia, Culture and Creative CitiesMasterMaster of Social Sciences in Media, Culture and Creative Citie...|$|E
