5|$|Soviet air assaults {{against civilians}} in Estonian towns {{were a part}} of the offensive, aimed at forcing the Estonians away from {{supporting}} the German side. The Soviet Long Range Aviation branch assaulted the Estonian capital of Tallinn on the night of 8–9 March. Approximately 40% of the housing was destroyed in the city; 25,000 people were left homeless and 500 civilians were killed. The result of the air raid was the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Soviets intended, as people felt disgusted by the Soviet atrocities; more men answered the German conscription call.|$|E
5|$|The Jersey Act's major {{effect was}} the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was intended. In {{the years before}} the Second World War, British and Irish breeders had relied on {{imported}} Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding lines, a source that was unavailable during the war, and concerns were beginning to be expressed that the situation might lead to excessive inbreeding. Additionally, {{by the end of}} the war American-bred lines were some of the most successful racing lines in the world, effectively making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them second-rate, and harming the rebuilding of English racing. There were even calls for the creation of an international stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees, thus eliminating any perceived slight on the bloodlines that were excluded from the General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane clathrates or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E

5|$|Thơ also {{retained}} {{a degree of}} influence over domestic economic policies, which ran far behind Diệm's priorities of absolute control over the military and other apparatus through which he maintained his rule. Despite never having been trained in economic matters, Thơ had a prominent hand {{in the administration of}} the Commodity Import Program, an American initiative akin to the Marshall Plan, whereby aid was funnelled into the economy through importing licenses rather than money, in order to avoid inflation. However, Thơ's administration of the program led to {{the vast majority of the}} imports being consumer goods for the upper classes, rather than capital goods to develop South Vietnam's economic capacity. Under Thơ's watch, the foreign trade deficit hovered between 150 and 200%, and the gap between the urban elite and the peasant majority grew. American advisers thought Thơ and the Ngô brothers continually went against their counsel because they were either incompetent or simply distrustful and thus did the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was recommended.|$|E
5|$|Titania is {{the largest}} and most massive Uranian moon, and the eighth most massive moon in the Solar System. Its density of 1.71 g/cm³, which is much higher than the typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and dense non-ice components; the latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by infrared spectroscopic observations made in 2001–2005, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are slightly stronger on Titania's leading hemisphere than on the trailing hemisphere. This is the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is observed on Oberon, where the trailing hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to the bombardment by charged particles from the magnetosphere of Uranus, which is stronger on the trailing hemisphere (due to the plasma's co-rotation). The energetic particles tend to sputter water ice, decompose methane trapped in ice as clathrate hydrate and darken other organics, leaving a dark, carbon-rich residue behind.|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much of the shot clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E

5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

Thanks to the hormone injections Rosie has had, it only took a day for Lilith to be born and she will age one year, every day, and take Callie's place as Twayne's bride. After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie {{take on the task}} to raise Lilith. In just a few weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just like her father forced her, and tells Lilith that she does not want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to a lower level of Hell. Later, Callie kicks Mark out of her apartment as she does not have to marry Twayne anymore.|$|E

50|$|Magic {{and death}} also appear {{commonly}} as literary devices. Conflict often arises between beings with innate magical powers {{and those who}} acquired their powers through magical objects or helpers. Death, wherever it occurred in native stories, was always reversible, and was usually undone {{with the aid of}} the aforementioned magical powers or special “medicines” bearing similar supernatural powers. Another commonly used literary device was inversion, where the <b>opposite</b> <b>of</b> <b>what’s</b> to be expected occurs, ex. supernatural beings consume only toxic materials, or events occurring at day versus night in the human world are chronologically switched in the underworld.|$|R

25|$|Later, {{the house}} was owned briefly by Sir Henry Cavendish, Receiver-General for Ireland. For a time, it housed Reverend Craig's boys' school which began in 1804.

25|$|The ancient Greek {{city that}} existed within the modern day {{boundaries}} of Benghazi was founded around 525 BC; at the time, {{it was called}} Euesperides.

Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of Love in a Forest, his 1723 adaptation of As You Like It.
