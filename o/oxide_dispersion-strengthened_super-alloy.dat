Tensile test specimens were exposed to creep at various stress levels at 1365 K and then tensile tested at room temperature. Low residual tensile properties, change in fracture mode, appearance of dispersoid free bands, grain boundary cavitation, and/or internal oxidation are interpreted as creep degradation effects.

Fine-grain regions are found to tbe the primary source of crack-initiation by the formation of creep damage. A finite difference approach to modelling of these damage processes is introduced. Results of the model are compared with experimentally determined crack initiation life. In order to explain waveform effects it is suggested that, in analogy with prestraining experiments, rapid plastic deformation can introduce residual stresses in the neighbourhood of hard particlds such as oxide dispersoids during asymmetric creep-fatigue ccycling.

Dislocation density and grain growth between 20 and 1100 degrees C were quantified by coupling-modified Williamson-Hall and Warren-Averbach methods. During the early stages of heating, recovery through the rearrangement of dislocations increases the coherent domain size from 23 to about 60 nm. Once the annealing temperature reaches 800 degrees C, recrystallization starts. Using a specific analysis of 2 -D detector signal, it has been possible to grasp the occurrence of abnormal growth leading to bimodal grain size distribution with both ultrafine grains and coarser micronic grains. The grain growth kinetics upon heating were determined for both populations and separately quantified. Ultrafine grains exhibit a continuous moderate growth rate, leading to continuous recrystallization, whereas specific grains experience a rapid abnormal growth up to their final size after a short incubation time...|$|R

The grain size distribution can be tailored by selecting a combination of sintering temperature and holding time while retaining a full densification, which shows the elaboration flexibility of this SPS processing. Increase of the global hardness by reducing average grain size down to the sub-micrometer scale is straightforward.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{possible}} to measure the average interfacial velocities of grain boundaries {{during the process of}} recrystallisation of an <b>oxide</b> <b>dispersion-strengthened</b> iron-base alloy manufactured using the mechanical alloying technique. The measurements could be made using optical microscopy because the recrystallised grains are orders of magnitude larger than the surrounding unrecrystallised material. Furthermore, the peculiar way in which the alloy recrystallises, made it possible to observe large, flat segments of boundaries as they advanced into the higher energy matrix. The data have been analysed bearing in mind the pinning effect of the non-random distribution of oxide particles. It is concluded that the boundaries have a high mobility. This conclusion adds to the growing evidence that the alloy has great difficulty in nucleating recrystallisation because of the ultrafine and uniform starting-microstructure in which the grain boundary junctions are so closely spaced that they prevent strain-induced grain boundary migration; in other words, the junctions themselves are powerful pinning points.

The results have shown that a nearly pure alumina scale is formed irrespective of the exposure time, {{which is consistent with}} previous results on oxidation of NiAl or doped NiAl alloys. From the analysis of the kinetics results and the surface scale morphology it follows that below 1100 °C metastable alumina control the oxidation kinetics, even after long exposure times. The presence of yttria seems to account for this increase in the transient oxidation period. Preoxidation of the alloy (1200 °C/ 3 h) leads to a substantial reduction of the oxidation rate and precludes void formation at the scale/gas interface. Furthermore, formation of uniform scale, which would diminish the probability of failure of the scale due to thermal stresses, is favoured. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mechanism of crack initiation at fine grains is creep-type cavitation on boundaries transverse to the applied stress. Experimental results indicating the influence of temperature, loading frequency, and waveshape on the crack initiation rate are presented and discussed in detail.

40|$|Since <b>oxide</b> <b>dispersion-strengthened</b> (ODS) FeCrAl-based alloys have {{sufficient}} creep strength and good oxidation resistance {{at the very}} high temperatures of interest for the primary heat exchanger in advanced, closed-cycle gas turbine systems, they constitute viable alternative candidates to ceramics. A major life-limiting factor of these alloys {{is the ability to}} continue to form a protective scale of aluminum oxide, a factor proportional to the total amount of aluminum contained in the alloy. Fe{sub 3 }Al has oxidation resistance comparable to that of the FeCrAl-based alloys, and significantly superior sulfidation resistance. Also, because of its larger reservoir of aluminum, Fe{sub 3 }Al would be expected to exhibit longer lifetimes at the temperatures of interest. Since the strengthening effects of ODS processing are expected to confer similar high-temperature creep properties to those found for the FeCrAl-based alloys, ODS-Fe{sub 3 }Al is considered to have excellent potential for the very high-temperature heat exchanger application. The program effort on ODS Fe{sub 3 }Al includes examination of the properties of available ODS-FeCrAl alloys; development of mechanical alloying parameters for ODS-Fe{sub 3 }Al; determination of the effects of a dispersion of reactive element oxides on the high-temperature oxidation behavior of Fe{sub 3 }Al; and evaluation of methods for joining them...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{investigation of the}} phase and microstructure, the thermodynamic behavior within the molten pool, and the growth mechanism of in situ <b>oxide</b> <b>dispersion-strengthened</b> (ODS) aluminum-based composites processed by a selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacturing/ 3 D printing process. The phase and microstructure were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning electronic microscope (SEM) equipped with EDX, respectively. The thermodynamic behavior within the molten pool was investigated for a comprehensive understanding on the growth mechanism of the SLM-processed composite using a finite volume method (FVM). The results revealed that the in situ Al 2 Si 4 O 10 ODS Al-based composites were successfully fabricated by SLM. Combined with the XRD spectrum and EDX analysis, the new silica-rich Al 2 Si 4 O 10 reinforcing phase was identified, which was dispersed around the grain boundaries of the aluminum matrix under a reasonable laser power of 200 W. Combined with the activity of Marangoni convection and repulsion forces, the characteristic microstructure of SLM-processed Al 2 Si 4 O 10 ODS Al-based composites tended to transfer from the irregular network structure to the nearly sphere-like network structure in regular form by increasing the laser power. The formation mechanism of the microstructure of SLM-processed Al 2 Si 4 O 10 ODS Al-based composites is thoroughly discussed herein...|$|R
