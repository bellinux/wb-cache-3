Introduction In this paper we present a modied version of the <b>operational</b> <b>drift</b> criterion from Markov chain theory in Meyn and Tweedie (1993). The drift criterion implies stationarity, ergodicity and existence of appropriate moments for the Markov chain. We apply this to discuss (strong) stationarity of a simple version of the multivariate autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (ARCH) process presented in Engle and Kroner (1995) [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} Viability Assessment (VA) work, this QAP- 3 - 9 {{document}} {{presents and}} evaluates a comprehensive set of viable concepts for collecting Performance Confirmation (PC) related data. The concepts include: monitoring subsurface repository air temperatures, humidity levels and gaseous emissions via the subsurface ventilation systems, and monitoring the repository geo-technical parameters and rock mass from bore-holes located along the perimeter main drifts and throughout a series of human-rated Observation Drifts to be located in a plane 25 meters above {{the plane of the}} emplacement drifts. A key element of this document is the development and analysis of a purposed multi-purpose Remote Inspection Gantry that would provide direct, real-time visual, thermal, and radiological monitoring of conditions inside <b>operational</b> emplacement <b>drifts</b> and close-up observations of in-situ Waste Packages. Preliminary finite-element analyses are presented that indicate the technological feasibility of operating an inspection gantry inside the <b>operational</b> emplacement <b>drifts</b> for short inspection missions lasting 2 [...] 3 hours. Overall reliability, availability, and maintainability of the PC data collection concepts are discussed. Preliminary concepts for PC data collection network are also provided...|$|R
40|$|Research on the {{relationship}} between Information Technology (IT) and organizations emphasizes the complexity of adaptation processes and the potential of drifting. Drifting means that an organization encounters unexpected circumstances that show the incompleteness and possible failure of an initial technological design without organizations having yet feasible alternatives. This conceptual and empirical paper investigates the origins and nature of drifting, and strategies for dealing with drift. Three strategies have been proposed to deal with drifting: control, incremental, and drift containment. We explore the third option that seems most realistic and relevant from an organizational point of view. We empirically investigated how drift containment could be accomplished in practice in a multi-site ERP implementation project. Our results suggest three phases of dealing with drift. Organizations must first recognize when drifting occurs. Next, they must develop a dual focus. On one hand, they must differentiate between a projectâ€™s overarching objectives (which remain relatively stable). On the other hand, they attend to and resolve their <b>operational</b> <b>drifting</b> experience. The dual focus thus means that while organizations stay focused on their objectives, they address the causes of drifting. During the final phase, lessons learnt during drifting resolution must be shared and applied to accelerate accomplishment of project objectives. Implications for research and practice are elaborated...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} part of a larger project {{currently}} underway to develop an <b>operational</b> iceberg <b>drift</b> and deterioration model for the Canadian Ice Service (CIS), Environment Canada. This new iceberg model, as distinct from previous drift computations, will include estimates of iceberg calving and production of smaller ice pieces in the bergy bit and growler size ranges. These smaller size pieces can cause large forces upon impact with offshore structures. It is important to have information about the probability of encountering these small ice pieces in the neighborhood of the parent iceberg. Calving can result from wave-induced erosion at the waterline of a floating iceberg. When the waterline notch caused by wave erosion reaches a critical size, the weight of the overhanging slab will be large enough to cause it to break off and fracture into many thousands of small ice pieces. The focus of the present paper is on the size-frequency distribution function for the ice pieces that are generated. The correlations presented are based primarily on the field observations of calving by Crocker [Crocker, G. B., 1993, Size distributions of bergy bits and growlers calved from deteriorating icebergs. Cold Reg. Sci. Technol., 22, 113 - 119. ]. The initial size distribution of the calved pieces forms an essential starting point for the subsequent analyses of small ice piece deterioration and drift that are embodied in the operational model.

This thesis attempts {{to estimate the}} power spectral density of low frequency semiconductor noise over a range of 10 decades, from a microcycle (10 [superscript - 6] cps) to 10 kilocycles (10 [superscript + 4] cps). It is concluded that the behavior {{is more complex than}} a simple inverse proportionality to frequency. The spectrum is approximately 1 /f in the region around 100 cps and changes gradually to 1 /f [superscript 2] as the frequency decreases to the microcycle region. These spectra represent the noise properties of the first stage transistors of a grounded input dc differential amplifier. The estimated spectra at very low frequencies still reflect strong temperature influences. In order to obtain these measurements it was necessary to control the temperature environment of the noise source. This was accomplished first by passive attenuation and later by active control. The noise source was placed in a circulating oil bath whose temperature was sensed electrically and controlled to a. 001 [degree] C range. In conjunction with the temperature control activity the power spectral density of room temperature variations was estimated in the frequency range from. 1 cps down to 5 x 10 [superscript - 8] cps. Other spectra of interest estimated over the low frequency range were for line voltage amplitude fluctuations and <b>operational</b> amplifier <b>drift.</b> A brief description of the equipment constructed to obtain sample functions of the noise processes is included. The analytical portion of this work is concerned with the mathematical techniques employed in obtaining power spectral density estimates. The basic scheme employed is that of Blackman and Tukey which consists of estimating the auto-correlation function and Fourier transforming the result. A formula is developed for calculating the variance of the spectral estimator actually employed in the computations. The bias and variability are presented for the estimator when estimating a spectra containing a spectral line. A confidence interval approach to the variability of the spectral estimator is examined. A confidence interval which depends only on the data is constructed around the spectral density estimate. A technique for utilizing the available knowledge concerning the expected variability of the spectral estimate is developed. The result is formulated in terms of a maximum liklihood estimator for the average spectral density when several independent estimates are available. Some possible sources of low frequency bias in the spectral estimate are considered in detail. Among these are the effect of mean removal and certain deterministic disturbances such as steps. Prewhitening for 1 /f and 1 /f [superscript 2] spectra is examined and shown to lead to very great improvement in the spectral estimate. Some suggestions as to more efficient methods of spectral estimation data collection and processing are offere...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{wind tunnel}} {{measurements}} at the CSTB (Jules Verne) facility in Nantes {{and based on}} field observations at the SLF experimental site Versuchsfeld Weissfluhjoch, two acoustic wind drift sensors are evaluated against different mechanical snow traps and one optical snow particle counter. The focus {{of the work is}} the suitability of the acoustic sensors for applications such as avalanche warning and research. Although the acoustic sensors have not yet reached the accuracy required for typical research applications, they can, however, be useful for snow drift monitoring to help avalanche forecasters. The main problem of the acoustic sensors is a difficult calibration that has {{to take into account the}} variable snow properties. Further difficulties arise from snow fall and high wind speeds. However, the sensor is robust and can be operated remotely under harsh conditions. It is emphasized that due to the lack of an accurate reference method for snow drift measurements, all sensors play a role in improving and evaluating snow drift models. Finally, current <b>operational</b> snow <b>drift</b> models and snow drift sensors are compared with respect to their usefulness as an aid for avalanche warning. While drift sensors always make a point measurement, the models are able to give a more representative drift index that is valid for a larger area. Therefore, models have the potential to replace difficult observations such as snow <b>drift</b> in <b>operational</b> applications. Current models on snow drift are either only applicable in flat terrain, are still too complex for an operational application (Lehning et al., 2000 b), or offer only limited information on snow drift, such as the SNOWPACK drift index (Lehning et al., 2000 a). On the other hand, snow drift is also difficult to measure. While mechanical traps (Mellor 1960; Budd et al., 1966) are probably still the best reference, they require more or less continuous manual operation and are thus not suitable for remote locations or long-term monitoring. Optical sensors (Schmidt, 1977; Brown and Pomeroy, 1989; Sato and Kimura, 1993) have been very successful for research applications, but suffer from the fact that they give a single flux value at one specific height. In addition, they have not been used, to our knowledge, for long-term monitoring applications or at remote sites. New developments of acoustic sensors have taken place recently (Chritin et al., 1999; Font et al., 1998). Jaedicke (2001) gives examples of possible applications of acoustic snow drift sensors. He emphasizes the advantages of acoustic sensors for snow drift monitoring at remote locations, but could not present any evaluation of the accuracy of the measurements. We present a complete evaluation of the new acoustic sensors for snow drift and discuss their applications for research or avalanche warning. We compare the suitability of sensors for operational applications...|$|R
