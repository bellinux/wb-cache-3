500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} over-speed limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for [...] and an <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|E

50|$|Steam engines used many {{separate}} oil boxes, dotted {{around the}} engine. Each one was filled before starting and often refilled during running.

To control the flow rate of oil from the reservoir to the bearing, the oil would flow through an oil wick by capillary action, rather than downwards under gravity.|$|E

The <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> (reservoir) was now at the left rear of the engine so a catcher for oil thrown up by the flywheel is no longer necessary. Lubrication pipes had been mounted lower. There was a new partition between sump and clutch housing so oil was not thrown to the clutch. Rover's engine braking system was fitted, it has the ability to close the engine's valves.|$|E

In 1698, eight individuals signed a document acknowledging that they had received chalices, pyxes, cups, an <b>oil</b> <b>box,</b> ciborium, a bell and vestments of the friary for safekeeping. Michael Shiell was one of the eight signatories, as was one William Shiell, who received at least three of the items.

On the Tuesday following the race, NASCAR announced that the No. 11 team of Joe Gibbs Racing - the car of Denny Hamlin, who had finished the race in third place - had been penalized for a rules infraction in post-race inspection. This infraction was levied as a P5 penalty - the second-highest level - outlined in Section 12-4.5 A (9) of the 2014 NASCAR rule book. Per the subsequent Section 12-4.5 B of the regulations, any P5 penalty resulted in a 50-point penalty for both the driver and team owner, a fine of between $75,000 and $125,000 as well as race suspension and probation periods for team members {{in relation to the}} infraction. As the infraction was detected during a post-race inspection, a further 25 championship points were deducted as well as a further fine of $50,000.|$|E

Some examples of waste oil are used oils such as hydraulic oil, transmission oil, brake fluids, motor oil, crankcase <b>oil,</b> gear <b>box</b> <b>oil</b> and synthetic oil. Many {{of the same}} problems associated with natural petroleum exist with waste oil. When waste oil from vehicles drips out engines over streets and roads, the oil travels into the water table bringing with it such toxins as benzene. This poisons both soil and drinking water.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, {{the water and}} oil are {{initially}} arranged {{on the top of}} the silicon dioxide substrate and the oil cube is surrounded by three water cubes with different sizes. The oil cube has a dimension of 5 [*]×[*] 15 [*]×[*] 5  nm 3 and is located at the central part of the substrate. The dimensions of the left- and right-side water cubes are the same as that of the oil cube, while that of the top-side water cube is 15 [*]×[*] 15 [*]×[*] 5  nm 3. The number of water and decane molecules is determined by the sizes of the cubes and the water and oil densities under the condition of 300  K and 1  bar. The densities of water and oil are 1.000 and 0.725  g/cm 3, respectively; accordingly, the number of water and decane molecules is 58, 319 and 1150, respectively. The arrangement of molecules is implemented in the Material Studio software; originally, they are randomly distributed in the special boxes. Then, a calculation of energy minimization is conducted to optimize the molecular geometry. As the simulation reaches to an equilibrium state, the <b>oil</b> <b>box</b> evolves into a cylindrical droplet, while the three water boxes can merge together forming a continuous phase surrounding the oil droplet.|$|E

40|$|MADS box genes {{code for}} a large family of {{transcription}} factors which regulate development in higher plants, notably flower formation. We describe here a study {{of members of the}} MADS box gene family in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), a representative of the family Arecaceae and order Arecales, a key group of monocotyledons which has been unreported in previous phylogenetic reconstructions of the different recognized clades of MADS box genes. In this study, 13 <b>oil</b> palm MADS <b>box</b> genes were identified and characterized. They were found to belong to five different subfamilies, namely, the previously defined SQUAMOSA, AGAMOUS, AGAMOUS-like 2, DEFICIENS, and GLOBOSA groups. Genes belonging to each of these groups {{play a critical role in}} the determination of flower structure as defined by the ABCDE model. The in planta expression profiles of the <b>oil</b> palm MADS <b>box</b> genes were studied by RT-PCR and phylogenetic sequence diversity within individual subfamilies was investigated by comparing their deduced protein sequences with those of other angiosperms. Most of the oil palm sequences studied were observed to group with distinct supported clades within their subfamily.

The percentage seed germination was {{not significantly different from}} that of the control in oil treated paddy though, in C. citratus treatment the seed germination was reduced.

5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic <b>oil</b> separator <b>box</b> that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|R

The Yezdi Roadking was originally based on 1974 CZ, where the original bore and stroke of 70 x 64 mm was retained as it was, but with less power than its Motocross original. The engine block is smaller and different from the Yezdi Classic in appearance. Also the CZ original had the famous Porcupine Head while the same was used only in initial models, later reverted to regular straight fin design. The cylinder block (Type 980.5) was from CZ.Just like in the older Ideal Jawa or the Ideal Yezdi,the Roadking too came with an original Tesla (Czechoslovakian) headlight bulb as standard.|$|R
