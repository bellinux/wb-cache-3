40|$|High {{performance}} turbomachinery often experiences severe {{dynamic loads}} that produce large amplitude rotor motions. Well-engineered squeeze film dampers (SFDs) provide adequate damping to ameliorate rotor vibrations {{and to ensure}} system reliability. Open ends SFDs are prone to air ingestion during large amplitude rotor whirl motions and high excitation frequencies, all the while demanding of a significant flowrate, an undesirable operating feature. Piston ring (PR) end seals are commonly installed in SFDs in aircraft engines to amplify the available damping while reducing the demand of oil flowrate and also to avoid air ingestion. This dissertation investigates experimentally the dynamic forced performance of a SFD with a short land length (L/D= 0. 2), nominal clearance 0. 254 mm and lubricant supplied via three <b>orifice</b> <b>feed</b> holes (?= 2. 5 mm). There are two configurations, one has its ends open to ambient while the other has sealed ends with PRs. The dynamic load tests are of three types (single frequency, sine-sweep frequency dynamic loads and impact loads). Single frequency dynamic load tests reveal that the piston ring end seals effectively reduce leakage through {{the ends of the}} film land; thus the sealed SFD provides 11 - 13 times more damping coefficient and eleven times more added mass coefficients than those provided by an open ends SFD configuration. Further tests of two PR sealed ends SFDs (one with a seal flow conductance = 0. 56 LPM/bar, and the other with = 0. 89 LPM/bar) operated at a supply pressure Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg, show that small differences on their damping and added mass coefficients are within the measurement uncertainty range. The second pair of piston rings (Cave-S 2 >Cave-S 1) has a larger slit gap than the first pair, hence providing a lesser flow resistance. The effect of lubricant supply pressure on the sealed ends SFD force coefficients is also quantified experimentally by increasing the lubricant supply pressure by a factor of four (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg?Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg). For the sealed ends SFD with Cave-S 1 and Pin- 2 ~ 2. 76 barg, both the damping and added mass coefficients show a ~ 20 % increase compared to those coefficients from the damper supplied with a low oil feed pressure (Pin- 1 ~ 0. 69 barg). Further experiments with the sine-sweep frequency dynamic load tests aim to validate the SFD force coefficients identified from a single-frequency dynamic load. The estimated SFD damping and inertia force coefficients from a sine-sweep frequency load tests with a low time rate of change in sine-sweep excitation frequency ?= 6. 5 Hz/s agree with the coefficients obtained from a single-frequency dynamic load over the same test conditions while substantially reducing the time of data collection. Furthermore, single impact load tests are performed to quantify their effect on the response of an elastically supported open ends SFD and sealed ends SFD. Test system transient responses due to a single impact show the peak amplitude of motion (ZMAX) is proportional to the magnitude of applied load (FMAX). The identified system damping ratio (?) is proportional to the peak dynamic displacement as a linear system shows. The dissertation discloses the full detail of the test dampers geometry and the experimental results which will provide a design reference to the practitioners...|$|E

40|$|Aerostatic {{spindles}} offer {{low heat}} generation and high rotation accuracy, which make them an ideal choice for ultra-precision drum lathe, where extremely high motional accuracy and thermal stability are required. However, the limitations such as insufficient load capacity and stiffness have restricted their permissible application range {{and make them}} not suitable for large ultra-precision machine tools including drum lathe. In order to improve the load capacity and stiffness, this paper presents a high load capacity aerostatic spindle with pocketed orifice-type restrictors. Fluent is adopted and three-dimensional simulation models of aerostatic spindle with <b>orifice</b> and <b>feeding</b> pocket are set up to analyze the load characteristics. The simulation results show that this restrictor can enhance the throttling effect of orifice and suppress the pressure drop away from the orifice. Moreover, for aerostatic journal bearing, when eccentricity ratio is {{in the range of}} 0. 2 – 0. 3 and gas supply pressure is 0. 6 [*]MPa, carrying capacity and stiffness can reach up to 9499. 4 [*]N and 2813. 1 [*]N/μm. Finally, a group of loading experiments are carried out which prove that the novel three-dimensional simulation method is feasible and accurate to calculate the load characteristics of aerostatic spindles...|$|R
30|$|After coating and baking, this homeotropic {{polyimide}} {{film was}} bombarded by an argon ion beam {{to change the}} LC aligning properties of the surface. In this experiment, various ion beam exposure conditions such as the irradiation energy, exposure angle, exposure time, and current density are modulated to examine how the surface property is changed according to them. As an ion source, a cold hollow cathode [CHC] is used to yield a highly collimated ion beam. In order to collimate the ion beam, two perforated grids are used as electro-focusing lenses. The CHC represents a separate cooled chamber which {{is equipped with a}} magnetic system and is connected to a discharge chamber through an <b>orifice.</b> Argon gas <b>feeding</b> into the ion source is carried out through the CHC only.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A bulk-flow model for determination of the leakage and dynamic force characteristics of angled injection Lomakin bearings is presented. Zeroth- and first-order equations describe the equilibrium flow for a centered bearing and the perturbed flow for small amplitude rotor motions about the equilibrium position, respectively. The computational analysis accounts for the flow interaction between the injection <b>orifices,</b> the <b>feed</b> circumferential groove and the film lands through adequate Bernoulli-type relationships at the interfaces. The influence of the holes and the groove is considered with a one control-volume model in the groove and coupled with an existing bulk-flow program for annular pressure seals. Flow turbulence is accounted for with turbulent shear stress parameters and Moody's friction factors. The zeroth- and first-order flow equations are solved numerically using a robust computational method. Comparisons between predictions and experimental results for a tangential-against-rotation injection Lomakin bearing configuration show that the current bulk-flow model predicts well the leakage and the direct stiffness and damping force coefficients. Trends for the cross-coupled stiffness coefficient with respect to the rotor speed and the supply pressure are correct, but quantitative agreement remains poor despite the introduction of an additional groove-film land parameter in an effort to improve the determination of the important circumferential velocity at the film land entrance. A parameter investigation evidences the effects of the groove geometry on the Lomakin bearing leakage and dynamic force coefficients. The orifice injection angle in the groove does not have a sensible influence on the leakage and the direct rotordynamic coefficients, yet it is the main design parameter considering the Lomakin bearing stability characteristics, through the determination of the cross-coupled stiffness coefficient. This confirms the promising stabilizing effect of the tangential-against-rotation injection configuration. Besides the impact of the orifice injection angle, the analysis shows that, given the operating conditions and the film lands geometry, the static and dynamic force characteristics of the Lomakin bearing depend on two typical groove numbers defined from the groove geometry parameters. The analysis also shows that the film land clearance and length have a larger impact on the Lomakin bearing performance than its groove depth and length...|$|R
40|$|A fixed {{geometry}} hybrid {{thrust bearing}} is investigated {{with three different}} supply orifice diameters. The test rig uses a face-to-face thrust bearing design, with the test bearing acting as the rotor loading mechanism. A hydraulic shaker applies the static axial load, which is reacted by a second thrust bearing. The rotor is supported radially by two water-lubricated fluid film journal bearings and {{is attached to a}} 30, 600 rpm motor via a high speed coupling with very low axial stiffness. Thrust bearings with three different orifice diameters (1. 63, 1. 80, and 1. 93 mm) are tested for a range of supply pressures, fluid film thicknesses, and rotational speeds. The water-lubricated test bearings have eight pockets, with <b>feed</b> <b>orifices</b> located centrally in each pocket. Experimental results are comparted to predictions found using bulk flow model HYDROTHRUST. Analysis of the data reveals generally good agreements between predictions and measurements. Thrust-bearing inlet supply and inner radius flow rates all decreased with decreasing orifice diameters and bearing axial clearances. In most cases, the bearings with larger orifice diameters exhibit higher recess pressure ratios, operating clearances, and flow rates. The largest orifice diameter configuration does not display higher recess pressure ratios or operating clearances at high speeds for some supply pressures, but it does continue to require additional lubricant flow rate compared to the smaller orifice bearings. In these cases, the results are not reflected in predictions, which otherwise correlate very well with experimental measurements. Estimations of static loading axial stiffness are obtained using experimental results. An optimum hybrid thrust bearing orifice diameter will depend on the conditions of individual applications. Larger orifices generally provide larger operating clearances and higher stiffnesses, but also require higher flow rates. For most applications, a compromise of bearing performance parameters will be desired. The test results and comparisons presented will aid in sizing orifice diameters for future hybrid thrust bearing designs...|$|R
40|$|Thermostatic {{expansion}} valves (TEV) and electronic {{expansion valves}} (EEV) are expansion devices {{commonly used in}} air-conditioning system which involves the spray and atomization process of the refrigerant. Most previous studies focused on the macro-features of the expansion valve, such as the refrigerant pressure drop through the valve, the response time of the valve to the change of superheat in the evaporator, or {{the relationship between the}} location of the valve and the system efficiency, etc. However, few studies have looked into the valve and fundamentally studied the physical process of the refrigerant taking place near the orifice, where the refrigerant goes through the major pressure drop. The atomization and spray process are crucial to the performance of the expansion valve since the downstream refrigerant are mainly determined by these processes in terms of mass flow rate, quality and homogeneity. Non-homogenous flow can cause poor refrigerant distribution among the circuit inside the evaporator, and essentially decrease the efficiency of the entire air-conditioning system. The other issue involved with the TEV and EEV is the mass flow control, which is namely called as ???valve hunting???. One of the greatest advantages such expansion valves can provide compared with traditional expansion valves is their capability to control the refrigerant mass flow rate according to the superheat degree of the evaporator, so that the system can always run in the most efficient mode and achieve the desired cooling capacity at the same time. Yet TEV or EEV can either starve or over feed the evaporator, due to the response time to the change of superheat degree, and inaccurate control of the valve opening and closing. Either starving or over feeding the evaporator can hurt the system performance: the former can decrease the cooling capacity while the later can result in liquid refrigerant going into the compressor, and cause damage to the compressor, in the worst scenario. Although the ???valve hunting??? has been addressed for a long time, few papers have tried to explain and solve this problem regarding to the refrigerant spray and atomization process. In this study, such techniques were applied {{to the study of the}} TEV and EEV. The expansion process was studied by introducing a valve with optical access. The break-up and atomization of the refrigerant were visualized near the outlet of the <b>orifice</b> under different <b>feeding</b> conditions on micro-second scale applying backlit illumination technology. A new image processing method is proposed for cone angle and film thickness determination. A Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) system was used later to measure the size and velocity of individual droplets passing the location at the outlet of the orifice. It is found that the increase of the feeding pressure tends to expand the spray cone angle while its impact on the film thickness is not quite obvious. The expansion of the cone angle resulted in more drops splashed from the edge of the needle base and the presence of the drops becomes more random. To further evaluate the impact of the feeding pressure, the drops size distribution under different pressure difference along the radial directions is measured. The drops size dependency on radial distance and pressure difference are acquired based on curve fit of the results...|$|R
