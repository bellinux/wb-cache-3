25|$|Sanctification is {{the part}} of {{salvation}} in which God makes the believer holy, by enabling them to exercise greater love for God and for other people. The good works accomplished by believers as they are sanctified are considered to be the necessary <b>outworking</b> of the believer's salvation, though they do not cause the believer to be saved. Sanctification, like justification, is by faith, because doing good works is simply living as the son of God one has become.|$|E

25|$|An early January 1999 {{poll showed}} Giuliani {{trailing}} Clinton by 10 points. In April 1999, Giuliani formed an exploratory committee {{in connection with}} the Senate run. By January 2000, Giuliani had reversed the polls situation, pulling nine points ahead after taking advantage of several campaign stumbles by Clinton. Nevertheless, the Giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses; so closely identified with New York City, he had somewhat limited appeal to normally Republican voters in Upstate New York. The New York Police Department's fatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond in March 2000 inflamed Giuliani's already strained relations with the city's minority communities, and Clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue. By April 2000, reports showed Clinton gaining upstate and generally <b>outworking</b> Giuliani, who stated that his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more. Clinton was now 8 to 10 points ahead of Giuliani in the polls.|$|E

2500|$|A Royal Commission {{was held}} in 1927, with Lord Bledisloe acting as its chairman, to {{consider}} land drainage in the United Kingdom. It concluded that existing laws were [...] "vague and ill-defined, full of anomalies, obscure, lacking in uniformity, and even chaotic." [...] It recommended that new structures were needed, which would have both the powers {{to carry out the}} work necessary for efficient drainage, and sufficient financial resources to enable them to do so. It proposed having catchment boards responsible for each main river, with powers over individual drainage boards, and was essentially the same as had been proposed in 1877 by a select committee of the House of Lords. The Land Drainage Act 1930 enshrined these proposals. For South Holland, the practical <b>outworking</b> was the creation of five internal drainage boards, Holland Elloe IDB, South Holland IDB, South Holland Embankment Drainage Board, South Welland IDB, and Sutton Bridge IDB. From the early 1940s, they formed a pool, sharing resources and manpower when required, and the five constituents amalgamated on 1 August 1974, to become the South Holland IDB. There have been some minor changes to the geographical area covered and to the organisational structure subsequently.|$|E
2500|$|Interest in {{the canal}} was {{sparked by the}} {{publication}} in 1965 of P.A.L. Vine's book London's Lost Route to the Sea. As a result, the Daily Telegraph weekend magazine carried a 5-page article about the canal. In 1968, a local group of enthusiasts {{became interested in the}} canal, and having carried out some research into its history, formed the Wey & Arun Canal Society in 1970, with a view to reopening it. The Society evolved into The Wey & Arun Canal Trust in 1973, a private company limited by guarantee with no share capital, the present custodians of the canal restoration. In 1990, the restoration was identified by the Inland Waterways Association's Restoration Committee as one of those where significant progress was being made, and which would benefit from the backing of the Association. The Waterway Recovery Group, which gave active support to restoration schemes, developed a strategy of [...] "a guaranteed labour force for guaranteed work" [...] in 1992, which ensured that local societies would have the funding and relevant planning permission in place before a group of volunteers arrived to carry out the work. The Wey and Arun Canal was one of three schemes where working parties were run in this way. The practical <b>outworking</b> of this approach was demonstrated in the following year, when a section of the canal at Billingshurst was cleared, and three accommodation bridges were rebuilt by a working party of 250 people, as part of a Waterway Recovery Group initiative called [...] "Dig Deep".|$|E
