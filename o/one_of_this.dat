5|$|Building {{on what is}} now Mayfair {{began in}} the 1660s, {{initially}} {{on the corner of}} Piccadilly, and progressed along the north side of that street. Burlington House was constructed between 1664–5 by John Denham, but was sold two years later to Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Burlington who asked Hugh May to complete it. The house was extensively modified through the 18th century, and is the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> era to survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere in {{the years}} 416–415 BC, a complex {{struggle}} took place between Hyperbolos {{on one side and}} Nicias and Alcibiades on the other. Hyperbolos tried to bring about the ostracism of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> pair, but Nicias and Alcibiades combined their influence to induce the people to expel Hyperbolos instead. This incident reveals that Nicias and Alcibiades each commanded a personal following, whose votes were determined by the wishes of the leaders.|$|E
5|$|The Early Woodland {{period in}} Indiana came between 1000 BC and 200 AD and {{produced}} the Adena culture.

5|$|Windsor Castle was {{originally}} built by William the Conqueror {{in the decade}} after the Norman conquest of 1066. William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march– about – {{from the city and}} from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis. Windsor Castle, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames, a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest, a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings. The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer, was an old Saxon residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep {{on the top of a}} man-made motte, or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier, or bluff, rising 100ft (30m) above the river. A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward. By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle. In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle, another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle.|$|E

25|$|Many of Thévenot's {{maps of the}} Middle East were {{published}} in his Relations de Divers Voyages Curieux (Paris, 1663), a collection of translations of voyages of discovery (such as that of Cosmas Indicopleustes). One of these {{was one of the}} earliest and most detailed depiction of southern Iraq (his nephew Jean de Thévenot later visited this region). Thévenot makes reference to the Mandaeans of the Basra region, and includes a printed page from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sect’s holy books, one of the first printed appearances of the Mandaean language in Europe.|$|E
25|$|He {{soon found}} that such work {{did not pay}} enough to keep his retinue, and so he sought {{employment}} from the French foreign office, either as a writer or a diplomat. He first sent Mme de Nehra to Paris {{to make peace with}} the authorities, and then returned himself with hopes of getting a job through an old literary collaborateur of his, Durival, who was at this time director of finance at the department of foreign affairs. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> official's functions was to subsidize political pamphleteers, and Mirabeau hoped to be so employed.

25|$|In 1893–1894 Merezhkovsky {{published}} numerous books (the play The Storm is Over and {{the translation}} of Sophocles' Oedipus the King among them), but the money all this hard work brought were scant. Now writing his second novel, he had to accept whatever work was offered to him. In the late 1893 Merezhkovskys settled in Saint Petersburg again. Here they frequented the Shakespearean Circle, the Polonsky's Fridays and the Literary Fund gatherings. Then the pair started their own home salon with Filosofov and Akim Volynsky becoming habitués. All of a sudden Merezhkovsky found that his debut novel was {{to be published in}} Severny Vestnik after all. What he didn't realise was that this came {{as a result of a}} Gippius' tumultuous secret love affair with Akim Volynsky, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> magazine's chiefs.|$|E

25|$|After the {{discovery}} at Manson's Creek in July of '71, more large strikes {{were made on}} nearby creeks. Among these were Blackjack Creek, Kildare Creek, Mosquito Creek, Slate Creek and Nugget Gulch. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> richest creeks was found by accident by James Carson, H. Guest and J Griffith, who had gotten lost while looking for Manson's Creek and literally stumbled across it, thus they called it Lost Creek. The very first panful taken from Lost Creek yielded 3/4 of an ounce of gold. With all these new strikes in the district, new towns sprang up practically overnight: Manson's Creek, Howellton and Dunkeld. The residence of the Gold Commissioner's would be built at Dunkeld. There would be three Gold Commissioners for the Omineca district in the 1870s and they were, Peter O'Reilly, WH Fitzgerald and D. Ballentyne, who would also act as Stipendary Magistrates.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{and most}} importantly, {{it is well}} known that the chief foreman of Deir el-Medina, a certain Neferhotep, was killed in the reign of king Amenmesse on the orders of a certain 'Msy' who was either Amenmesse himself or <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> king's agents, {{according}} to Papyrus Salt 124. However, Neferhotep is attested in office in the work register list of Ostraca MMA 14.6.217, which also recorded Seti II's accession to the throne and was later reused to register workers' absences under this king's reign. If Seti II's 6-year reign followed that of the usurper Amenmesse, then this chief foreman would not have been mentioned in a document which dated to the start of Seti II's reign since Neferhotep was already dead. This indicates that the reigns of Amenmesse and Seti II must have partly overlapped with one another and suggests that both rulers were rivals who were fighting each another for the throne of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, the Howard Hall, {{built with}} the benefactions of T.B. Davis to commemorate his son, Howard Davis, who died during World War I, was opened by the Prince of Wales. Davis {{had set up}} the Howard Leopold Davis {{scholarship}} trust in Jersey. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> educational trust's provisions was that it should benefit boys who, like he, had attended an elementary school. The majority of boys benefiting from this trust went to Victoria College and a number went up to Cambridge or Oxford. In 1934 Davis decided he wanted his old friend, John St Helier Lander, a Jersey artist, to paint a portrait of King George V, to commemorate the endowment of the scholarship. When the commission was complete, the artist and Davis visited the College to discuss where the portrait might be hung. When Davis discovered {{there was no room}} remaining in the College's great hall he decided to build another hall for the school. On 18 October 1934 Davis and his wife laid the foundation stone to Howard Hall. It was built of granite from Ouaisné and matched the gothic style of the older Victoria College buildings. Inside there was seating for 238, almost exactly the number of boys at school when the building was opened. The paneling and woodwork were of teak, and the clock an exact replica of that at the Greenwich Observatory. On 23 July 1935 the Prince of Wales came to Jersey to open the Hall and unveil the portrait of King George V. The Hall was refurbished in 1996 and now exists as the Howard Davis Theatre where numerous types of drama are performed by the pupils.|$|E
