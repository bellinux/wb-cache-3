5|$|By {{performing}} a blood compact, it preserves the bond of friendship between two tribes. This ceremony {{was the first}} treaty or bond of friendship between the natives, and the Spaniards. In honor of this ceremony, the former President of the Philippines Elpidio Quirino established the Order of Sikatuna, a presidential decoration conferred upon politicians. Juan Luna, a Filipino painter, depicted this event in his painting entitled The Blood Compact (Spanish: El Pacto de Sangre) in 1883. El Pacto de Sangre obtained the first prize in Paris in 1885 and at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition of St. Louis in 1904. At that period, {{it was an important}} part for tribes to perform the sandugo as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process.</b> A monument was constructed in Tagbilaran City by the Philippine Historical Committee and the National Historical Institute.|$|E
5|$|In {{the three}} decades {{following}} 1969, {{the army was}} heavily deployed in Northern Ireland's Operation Banner to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (later the Police Service of Northern Ireland) in their conflict with republican paramilitary groups. The locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment was formed, becoming home-service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment in 1992 before it was disbanded in 2006. Over 700 soldiers were killed during the Troubles. Following the 1994–1996 IRA ceasefires and since 1997, demilitarisation has been part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> and the military presence has been reduced. On 25 June 2007 the 2nd Battalion of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment left the army complex in Bessbrook, County Armagh, ending the longest operation in British Army history.|$|E

Otherwise, it will be part of your legacy to be always hesitant, flip-flopping.” He criticized Aquino, who is also the commander-in-chief of the PNP and the AFP, for his apparent poor strategic direction and asserts that it is the soldier, the policeman, the law enforcer, the guardian of security that suffers because of his decisions. Ramos also insists that Aquino should have made consultation with retired police officers and soldiers before the security operation in Mamasapano.|$|E

25|$|The ongoing {{political}} conflict between Israel and Palestine has {{played an important}} role in the development and expression of antisemitism in the 21st century, and in Italy as well. The Second Intifada, which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes. In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).|$|E
25|$|In August, {{the first}} meeting between 12 victims of the {{conflict}} and the negotiators took place in Havana, an event hailed as a highly symbolic solemn exchange between the victims face-to-face with their victimizers. In a joint communiqué for the occasion, both sides reiterated that victims were {{at the core of}} the agreement. The second victims' delegation was received in September. Notwithstanding these encounters, victims of the FARC feeling that they had not been sufficiently taken into account organized a forum to have their voices taken into account. The forum brought together both opponents and supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|Negotiations {{to end the}} Troubles {{had failed}} in 1996 {{and there was a}} {{resumption}} of political violence.

Sinn Féin had accepted the Mitchell Principles, which involved commitment to non-violence, in September 1997 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> <b>process</b> negotiations. Dissident members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), who saw this as a betrayal of the republican struggle for a united Ireland, left to form the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA) in October 1997.|$|E
