5|$|At 6:35pm, as {{many workers}} in the city were {{finishing}} their shifts, the alarm was sounded to gather the troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments. This {{was the first time}} such an alarm had been used in the city, and it caused a great deal <b>of</b> <b>excitement,</b> and attracted yet more citizens into the streets to witness events.|$|E
5|$|This episode saw the {{introduction}} of the redesigned Romulans, with prosthetic forehead pieces designed by makeup supervisor Michael Westmore, and the first appearance of the Romulan Warbird which was designer Andrew Probert's final work for the Star Trek franchise. The episode was mildly received by critics who viewed it {{after the end of the}} season, who criticised the two-plot nature of the episode and the general lack <b>of</b> <b>excitement.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

5|$|In {{retrospective}} {{reviews of}} the Genesis version, Dynamite Headdy has continued to receive considerable praise. Critics agreed that the game is excellent despite not receiving the same legendary status as some of Treasure's other works such as Gunstar Heroes, Ikaruga, and Radiant Silvergun. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said the game is overload on the eyes, but it makes sense with respect to Treasure's chaotic design. Frank Provo of GameSpot noted the game's impressive graphical effects, large bosses, and bizarre premise providing the same level <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> as Gunstar Heroes. Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life called {{it one of the}} best Treasure games of the Genesis era {{and one of the best}} platformers on the system.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{establishment}} of USSOCOM provided its own measure <b>of</b> <b>excitement.</b> A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command. United States Readiness Command (USREDCOM), with an often misunderstood mission, {{did not appear to}} have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era, and its Commander in Chief, General James Lindsay, had had some special operations experience. On 23 January 1987, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the Secretary of Defense that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM. President Ronald Reagan approved {{the establishment}} of the new command on 13 April 1987. The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command (USCINCSOC). The Senate accepted him without debate.|$|E
5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was to be}} {{a morning}} <b>of</b> <b>excitements.</b> As he was leaving an hour or so later, Whacker, the younger of the other two physicians, joined him--an {{unprecedented}} condescension this, for hitherto neither of them had addressed him beyond an occasional and surly [...] "good-day!" ...|$|R

Also, TLC plates can be visualized if the compounds or a coloring reagent is fluorescent.

25|$|In {{a minimum}} of 12 of the murders, Bonin was {{assisted}} {{by one or more}} of his four known accomplices. According to one attorney present throughout Bonin's subsequent confession, the escalating levels of brutality he had exhibited towards his victims had been similar to that of a drug addict requiring an ever-greater increase of dosage to attain a satisfactory level of euphoria, and Bonin later emphasized to neurologists he had felt an intense sense <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> as he searched for his victims.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{read the}} poems with, as he later recalled, a {{mounting}} sense <b>of</b> <b>excitement.</b> Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet {{in the same}} class as W. H. Auden or Dylan Thomas. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of Angry Penguins and commissioned a painting by Sidney Nolan, based on the poems, for the cover.|$|E
25|$|Munro's {{interest}} in speed began {{at an early}} age, riding the family's fastest horse across the farm, despite the complaints of his father. Trips via train to the port at Invercargill were a rare source <b>of</b> <b>excitement,</b> {{and the arrival of}} cars, motorcycles and aircraft added to Burt's eagerness to join the world outside his farm. As Munro's family discouraged his endeavours outside farm life, he became constantly bored with daily routine. At the outbreak of the First World War, he intended to go to war {{as soon as he was}} old enough, for a chance to see the world.|$|E
50|$|Sexual arousal is {{an aspect}} of a person's {{sexuality}} and a part <b>of</b> sexual <b>excitement.</b> It is accompanied by physiological changes in the aroused person. It is difficult to conceal full sexual arousal, or indeed lack of it, while fully nude. Penile erection is an obvious indicator <b>of</b> sexual <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> a male; while {{in the case of}} a female, physiological changes such as vaginal lubrication and swelling, coloring and engorgement of the labia and clitoris, may be less visible to others.|$|R

25|$|In its {{depiction}} of violence, Leone used his signature long drawn and close-up style of filming, {{which he did}} by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching on a holstered gun. This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to savor the performances and character reactions, create a feel <b>of</b> <b>excitement,</b> as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful landscapes. Leone also incorporated music to heighten up the tension and pressure {{before and during the}} film's many gunfights.|$|E
25|$|In {{quality of}} play, the match itself never {{measured}} {{up to the}} press headlines that it generated, although as a sporting contest it had its share <b>of</b> <b>excitement.</b> The match {{would go to the}} first player to win six games, draws not counting. After 17 games, Karpov had an imposing 4–1 lead. Korchnoi won game 21, but Karpov won game 27, putting him on the brink of victory with a 5–2 lead. Korchnoi bravely fought back, scoring three wins and one draw in the next four games, to equalise the match at 5–5 after 31 games. However, Karpov won the very next game, and the match, by 6–5 with 21 draws.|$|E
25|$|Not all bands {{took part}} in Traoré's roots revival. Les Ambassadeurs du Motel formed in 1971, playing popular songs {{imported}} from Senegal, Cuba and France. Les Ambassadeurs and Rail Band were the two biggest bands in the country, and a fierce rivalry developed. Salif Keita, perhaps the most popular singer of the time, defected to Les Ambassadeurs in 1972. This {{was followed by a}} major concert at which both bands performed as part of the Kibaru (literacy) program. The audience fell into a frenzy <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> and unity, and the concert is still remembered as one of the defining moments in 1970s Malian music.|$|E

25|$|The true {{identity}} of the discoverers of carbon nanotubes is a subject of some controversy. A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal Carbon described the interesting and often-misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991. He published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> and could be credited by inspiring the many scientists now studying applications of carbon nanotubes. Though Iijima has been given {{much of the credit}} for discovering carbon nanotubes, {{it turns out that the}} timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than 1991.|$|E

By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
25|$|Gamow was {{a highly}} {{successful}} science writer, with several of his books still in print more than a half-century after their initial publication. As an educator, Gamow recognized and emphasized fundamental principles that were unlikely to become obsolete, even as the pace {{of science and technology}} accelerated. He also conveyed a sense <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> with the revolution in physics and other scientific topics of interest to the common reader. Gamow himself sketched the many illustrations for his books, which added a new dimension to and complemented what Gamow intended to convey in the text. Wherever it was essential, he was unafraid to introduce mathematics, but he tried to avoid scaring off potential readers with too many equations that did not illustrate essential points.|$|E
