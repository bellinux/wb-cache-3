5|$|The actual {{separation}} of technetium-99 from {{spent nuclear fuel}} is a long process. During fuel reprocessing, it comes out as a component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible. A series of chemical processes yields technetium-99 metal of high purity.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} {{are also important}} in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are {{largely responsible for the}} production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more dramatically, in the 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E

The boliviensis group is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> diverse genus Akodon and thereby of the tribe Akodontini, which includes about 90 species of South American rodents. Akodontini is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae and the family Cricetidae, which includes hundreds of mainly small rodents distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas.|$|E

5|$|Aside from humans, {{octopuses}} may be preyed on by fishes, seabirds, sea otters, pinnipeds, cetaceans, {{and other}} cephalopods. Octopuses typically hide or disguise themselves by camouflage and mimicry; some have conspicuous warning coloration (aposematism) or deimatic behavior. An octopus may spend 40% {{of its time}} hidden away in its den. When the octopus is approached, it may extend an arm to investigate. 66% of Enteroctopus dolfleini in one study had scars, with 50% having amputated arms. The blue rings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> venomous blue-ringed octopus are hidden in muscular skin folds which contract when the animal is threatened, exposing the iridescent warning. The Atlantic white-spotted octopus (Callistoctopus macropus) turns bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. Displays are often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big and threatening as possible.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>highly</b> skilled nature {{required}} {{for playing the}} agung, {{it is not uncommon}} to see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks in an attempt to throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E
