5|$|Several {{buildings}} already existed {{within the}} park when it was created. One of these was a manor house at Petersham which was renamed Petersham Lodge.

5|$|Around 1770 {{the neoclassical}} {{architect}} Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, a three-arched bridge spanning the Avon. He used as his prototype an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became {{not just a}} means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge, is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, {{the owners of the}} Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath.|$|E
5|$|Coupled {{with his}} {{interest}} on cars, Lee's project of building SMI {{as a global}} automotive company started out with technical assistance from Nissan, a company {{which at the time}} of SMI's early stages was in dire financial straits. SMI's affiliation with Nissan could {{have been one of the}} reasons for Renault buying a major share of the company, as Renault had become a major shareholder of Nissan by then. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> early planners for SMI has stated that technical affiliations for SMI were initially considered with Volkswagen, BMW or Honda. From 1998, Renault Samsung Motors sold cars in Chile with the introduction of the SQ5 (the current SM5).|$|E
5|$|Given {{the ferocity}} of the Russian defense, {{everyone}} was aware that {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, who was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E

5|$|Groundwater {{levels have}} been dropping, to varying degrees, {{in many areas}} of the city, due in part to an {{increase}} in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground. A city agency, the Boston Groundwater Trust, coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells. However, Boston's drinking water supply, from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west, is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few genera {{where the}} workers lay trophic eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs {{have only been}} reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this {{is most likely to}} happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few Old Kingdom kings {{for whom}} there is {{evidence}} that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate Period, when the central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.|$|E
2500|$|Kill the Moon {{is notable}} for {{receiving}} widely polarising reviews from critics and audiences alike. Whilst some labelled the episode an instant classic [...] and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's <b>very</b> best, others found it poorly written with weak characters and themes. However, despite the polarizing reviews, critics were unanimous in their acclaim for Jenna Coleman's {{performance and the}} final sequence in the TARDIS.|$|R

5|$|Open {{heart surgery}} in India {{was at a}} nascent stage in the 1970s and early 1980s. After Panday {{returned}} to India from Canada, he joined the King Edward Memorial Hospital and Seth Gordhandas Sunderdas Medical College (KEM), in which he performed hundreds of open heart surgeries. The hospital was run on a government grant and generally catered {{to the middle class}} and poor, as the surgery was at the cost of the government. The hospital was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few places in India where heart surgery was performed. Panday was the chief of the second unit at KEM.|$|E
5|$|Polonium has {{no common}} {{compounds}}, {{and almost all}} of its compounds are synthetically created; more than 50 of those are known. The most stable class of polonium compounds are polonides, which are prepared by direct reaction of two elements. Na2Po has the antifluorite structure, the polonides of Ca, Ba, Hg, Pb and lanthanides form a NaCl lattice, BePo and CdPo have the wurtzite and MgPo the nickel arsenide structure. Most polonides decompose upon heating to about 600°C, except for HgPo that decomposes at ~300°C and the lanthanide polonides, which do not decompose but melt at temperatures above 1000°C. For example, PrPo melts at 1250°C and TmPo at 2200°C. PbPo is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few naturally occurring polonium compounds, as polonium alpha decays to form lead.|$|E
5|$|The castle's Norman stone fortifications {{were added}} {{possibly}} {{as early as}} the 1080s onwards, and were finished before 1115, based around what is now the inner bailey of the castle, forming a stone version of a ringwork. It had four towers and a gatehouse tower along the walls, with a ditch dug out of the rock along two sides, the excavated stone being reused for the building works, and would have been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> first masonry castles in England. With its circular design and grand entrance tower, it has been likened to the earlier Anglo-Saxon burgheat designs. In 1096, Roger was stripped of his lands after rebelling against William II and they were reassigned to Roger's brother, Hugh.|$|E
50|$|Akoya Condominiums is a 47 story, {{high-rise}} residential condominium {{located in}} Miami Beach, Florida. Built in 2004 and rising 150 meters (492 feet), Akoya Condominiums {{is the third}} tallest building in Miami Beach, after the 170 meter Blue and Green Diamonds. It was built as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last <b>very</b> tall buildings permitted in Miami Beach before a 1998 height ordinance, capping buildings at 200 feet, went into effect.|$|R
25|$|The X11 {{protocol}} design, led by Scheifler, was extensively discussed on open {{mailing lists}} on the nascent Internet that were bridged to USENET newsgroups.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on home video in May 1999 with a VHS release that earned over $44 million. The DVD release became available in November of the same year, {{and was one of}} the best-selling titles of the year, with over 1.5 million units sold. The DVD was released in two separate versions: one with Dolby Digital and the other with DTS 5.1 surround sound. Besides the different 5.1 tracks, the two DVDs are identical. The film was also issued in a very limited 2-disc LaserDisc release in November 1999, making it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> last feature films to ever be issued in this format, as LaserDiscs ceased manufacturing and distribution by the year's end, due in part to the growing popularity of DVDs.|$|E
5|$|There {{were those}} {{concerned}} that the theatre was failing in its role as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> few permitted to show legitimate drama. Management of the theatre after it reopened in 1813 fell to Samuel James Arnold, overseen by an amateur {{board of directors and}} a subcommittee focusing on the theatre as a centre for national culture. (Lord Byron was briefly on this subcommittee, from June 1815 until leaving England in April 1816.) Actor Edmund Kean was the on-stage highlight; like Macklin before him, he made his reputation as Shylock, premiering in the role in 1814. Kean remained until 1820 through praise and notorious disputes with local playwrights such as Charles Bucke.|$|E

It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, {{the owners of the}} Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. The Georgian streets {{in the vicinity of the}} river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place South of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.|$|E
