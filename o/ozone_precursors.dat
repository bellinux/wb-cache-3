A new method is suggested to express how {{the length of the}} period during the year when coniferous and evergreen trees are sensitive to ozone might be affected by climate change. <b>Ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emission changes from the RCP 4. 5 scenario were combined with climate simulations based on the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario and used as input to the Eulerian Chemistry Transport Model MATCH from which projections of ozone concentrations were derived. The ozone exposure of vegetation over Europe expressed as AOT 40 was projected to be substantially reduced between the periods 1990 – 2009 and 2040 – 2059 to levels which are well below critical levels used for vegetation in the EU directive 2008 / 50 /EC as well as for crops and forests used in the LRTAP convention, despite that the future climate resulted in prolonged yearly ozone sensitive periods. The reduction in AOT 40 was mainly driven by the emission reductions, not changes in the climate. For the toxicologically more relevant POD 1 index the projected reductions were smaller, but still significant. The values for POD 1 for the time period 2040 – 2059 were not projected to decrease to levels which are below critical levels for forest trees, represented by Norway spruce.

40|$|Ground level ozone poses a {{significant}} threat {{to human health}} from air pollution in the European Union. While anthropogenic emissions of precursor substances (NOx, NMVOC, CH 4) are regulated by EU air quality legislation and will decrease further in the future, the emissions of biogenic NMVOC (mainly isoprene) may increase significantly {{in the coming decades}} if short-rotation coppice plantations are expanded strongly to meet the increased biofuel demand resulting from the EU decarbonisation targets. This study investigates the competing effects of anticipated trends in land use change, anthropogenic <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions and climate change on European ground level ozone concentrations and related health and environmental impacts until 2050. The work is based on a consistent set of energy consumption scenarios that underlie current EU climate and air quality policy proposals: a current legislation case, and an ambitious decarbonisation case. The Greenhouse Gas-Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) integrated assessment model was used to calculate air pollutant emissions for these scenarios, while land use change because of bioenergy demand was calculated by the Global Biosphere Model (GLOBIOM). These datasets were fed into the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to calculate the impact on ground level ozone concentrations. Health damage because of high ground level ozone concentrations is projected to decline significantly towards 2030 and 2050 under current climate conditions for both energy scenarios. Damage to plants is also expected to decrease but to a smaller extent. The projected change in anthropogenic <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions is found to have a larger impact on ozone damage than land use change. The increasing effect of a warming climate (+ 2 – 5 °C across Europe in summer) on ozone concentrations and associated health damage, however, might be higher than the reduction achieved by cutting back European <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions.

Improved understanding of ozone formation in response to different precursor emissions is imperative to address the highly nonlinear ozone problem and to provide a solid scientific basis for efficient ozone abatement in these regions. A comparative study on ozone photochemical production in summer has thus been carried out in the megacities of Tianjin (NCP) and Shanghai (YRD). Two intensive field campaigns were carried out respectively at an urban and a suburban site of Tianjin, in addition to routine monitoring of trace gases in Shanghai, providing data sets of surface <b>ozone</b> and its <b>precursors</b> including nitrogen oxides (NO x) and various non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs). Ozone pollution in summer was found to be more severe in the Tianjin region than in the Shanghai region, based on either the frequency or the duration of high ozone events.
