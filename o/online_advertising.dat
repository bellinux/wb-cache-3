40|$|Authors: Malin Karlsson, Sandra Karlsson, Amanda Malmberg Tutor: Dr. Setayesh Sattari Examiner: Prof. Anders Pehrsson Background: Consumers {{increasingly}} purchase products online due to {{the widespread}} use of the Internet. The decision for consumers to purchase online is predicted by their purchase intentions, which in turn is affected by their information privacy concerns. There is a lack of research on IPC and purchase intentions in the context of <b>online</b> personalized <b>advertising.</b> Purpose: To extend the understanding of purchase intentions considering information privacy concerns and involvement in the context of <b>online</b> personalized <b>advertising.</b> Methodology: A survey in form of a questionnaire was conducted in order to gather the information necessary to be able to analyse the relationship between IPC and purchase intentions in the context of <b>online</b> personalized <b>advertising.</b> The sample consists of 18 - 70 year olds from cities in southern Sweden. Conclusion: Conclusions drawn in this thesis is that when applied in the context of <b>online</b> personalized <b>advertising,</b> there is no significant relationship between IPC and purchase intentions. However, involvement is suggested as having a positive relationship to purchase intentions, as well as a positive moderating effect on the relationship between IPC and purchase intention in the context of <b>online</b> personalized <b>advertising.</b> Keywords: Purchase intentions, Information privacy concerns (IPC), <b>Online</b> personalized <b>advertising,</b> Involvement...|$|R

25|$|Multimedia {{advertising}} {{is the result}} of animation and graphic designs used to sell products or services. There are various forms of multimedia advertising through videos, <b>online</b> <b>advertising</b> and DVDs, CDs etc. These outlets afford companies the ability to increase their customer base through multimedia advertising. This is a necessary contribution to the marketing of the products and services. For instance, <b>online</b> <b>advertising</b> is a new wave example towards the use of multimedia in advertising that provides many benefits to the online companies and traditional corporations. New technologies today have brought on an evolution of multimedia in advertising and a shift from traditional techniques. The importance of multimedia {{advertising is}} significantly increased for companies in their effectiveness to market or sell products and services. Corporate advertising concerns itself with the idea that “Companies are likely to appeal to a broader audience and increase sales through search engine optimization, extensive keyword research, and strategic linking.” The concept behind the advertising platform can span across multiple mediums, yet, at its core, be centered around the same scheme.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} {{advertising}} revenues affected both the print and online media {{as well as}} all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of <b>online</b> <b>advertising</b> are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news aggregators, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to add understanding to the role of <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> (voluntarily consumed <b>online</b> video content produced for commercial purposes) in building brand equity (the additional value created by a brand). The focus is on answering the research question: What is the role of <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> in building brand equity? As earlier research acknowledges that brand equity can be increased through its dimensions, the present study will also utilize brand awareness, brand associations, perceived quality and brand loyalty in the examination. The study aims to expand the body of research on the crossroads of modern advertising and branding in the increasingly interactive communication environment. The managerial interest towards the topic arises mainly from the potential to reach consumers in the volunteer content consumption, as online video keeps on growing its share as the dominant content format of the internet. Simultaneously, the ability to build strong brands is recognized as one of the very few ways to build sustainable competitive advantage. The research problem was approached through qualitative multiple-case study of four prominent Finnish brand marketers: Valio, Fazer, Cloetta and Paulig. 12 semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted among the company representatives, media partners and creative partners. The data analysis was executed as an abductive content analysis, guided by a conceptual framework created for the purposes of this study. The study resulted in identification of four versatile and inter-related roles of <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> in building brand equity: (1) Channel, as <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> can be seen as a tactical choice among other marketing efforts in brand building, however, benefitting from the ability to reach fragmented audiences; (2) Facilitator, as <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> can be seen as a strong enabler of more innovative and creative advertising concepts, building stronger activation and experiences to consumers; (3) Challenger, as <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> encourages the marketer to re-evaluate the old conventions and brand control; and (4) Participator, as <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> creates great potential in making the advertiser a true member of consumer’s everyday life through discussion and continuous content. The overall findings of the study imply that <b>online</b> video <b>advertising</b> has strong perceived potential in increasing brand equity across its dimensions Additionally, crucial barriers of online video advertising’s success were identified: relevance, technical & creative implementation and transparency. The concluding chapter presents a refined framework where the original conceptual framework is enriched with the new empirical findings...|$|R
25|$|Some {{changes made}} to Internet search engines {{included}} that of Google's search engine. Beginning in 2009, Google {{began to run}} a new system where the Google search became personalized. The item that is searched and the results that are shown remembers previous information that pertains to the individual. Google search engine not only seeks what is searched, but also strives to allow the user to feel like the search engine recognizes their interests. This is achieved by using <b>online</b> <b>advertising.</b> A system that Google uses to filter advertisements and search results that might interest the user is by having a ranking system that tests relevancy that include observation of the behavior users exude while searching on Google. Another function of search engines is the predictability of location. Search engines are able to predict where one's location is currently by locating IP Addresses and geographical locations.|$|E
25|$|WMUR was {{the first}} {{television}} station {{in the country to}} develop a significant Internet presence beginning in 1996. It {{was the first}} television station to hire a full-time employee dedicated to streaming its newscast live and archived online for later viewing. It was also the first television station to use the Internet to supplement its broadcast news by posting additional information online like the Megan's Law list. After posting a 3D virtual tour of its TV studio facilities online it briefly became the most visited attraction online in the world. Beginning in 1998 the station made significant financial, technical and staff investments into its internet strategy. This included 24-hour original news segments, weather coverage from a professional meteorologist and Sales Executive dedicated to TV and <b>online</b> <b>advertising.</b> In 2000 WMUR, CNN and WMUR.COM simulcasted their New Hampshire Primary Debates held at the TV station. This was the first widely promoted and executed worldwide live streaming video event.|$|E
25|$|Few social {{networks}} charge money for membership. In part, {{this may be}} because social networking is a relatively new service, and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers' minds. Companies such as Myspace and Facebook sell <b>online</b> <b>advertising</b> on their site. Their business model is based upon large membership count, and charging for membership would be counterproductive. Some believe that the deeper information that the sites have on each user will allow much better targeted advertising than any other site can currently provide. In recent times, Apple has been critical of the Google and Facebook model, in which users are defined as product and a commodity, and their data being sold for marketing revenue. Social networks operate under an autonomous business model, in which a social network's members serve dual roles as both the suppliers and the consumers of content. This is in contrast to a traditional business model, where the suppliers and consumers are distinct agents. Revenue is typically gained in the autonomous business model via advertisements, but subscription-based revenue is possible when membership and content levels are sufficiently high.|$|E
