40|$|Thin {{films of}} gold and {{platinum}} have been deposited onto superpolished fused silica substrates using thermal evaporation, ion assisted deposition (IAD), and ion assisted sputtering. The influence of ion beam flux, thin film material, and deposition rate on the films microroughness have been investigated. Short range surface microroughness of the films has been examined using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Long range surface microroughness has been characterized using an angle resolved <b>optical</b> <b>scatterometer.</b> Results indicate that ion beam deposited coatings have improved microstructure over thermally evaporated films...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from measurements {{in the lower}} 15 m of the marine atmospheric surface layer. The paper is focussed on the comparison of the profile data obtained with the Rotorod and the <b>optical</b> <b>scatterometer.</b> These instruments are based on different physical principles. Results show that fluctuations of particle total area concentrations are correlated with {{the motion of the}} waves under the sampler. Simultaneous time-series measurements of relative humidity do not reveal a distinct wave influence. This suggests that water vapour is transported by turbulent (molecular) diffusion on a time scale that is much faster than the time scale for particle transport. -from Autho...|$|E
40|$|The {{bidirectional}} reflectance {{distribution function}} (BRDF) {{that describes the}} scattered energy distribution is the most fundamental radiative property to calculate other properties. Although recent progress in surface metrology allows topography measurement in an atomic level, most studies still assume statistical distributions of roughness because of difficulty in roughness modeling. If the BRDF of rough silicon wafers is modeled with assumptions, predicted radiative properties may be inaccurate because non-Gaussian and anisotropic roughness of some wafers cannot be approximated with known statistics. Therefore, this thesis focuses on development of BRDF modeling that accounts for anisotropic roughness to accurately predict radiative properties of rough silicon surfaces with thin-film coatings. Monte Carlo ray-tracing methods are developed to consider multiple scattering and the change of polarization states and to satisfy physical laws such as the reciprocity principle. Silicon surface topographic data measured with an atomic force microscope are incorporated into the ray-tracing algorithms to model anisotropic roughness statistics. For validation, BRDF and emittance predictions are compared with measurements using an <b>optical</b> <b>scatterometer</b> and an integrating sphere. Good agreement between prediction and measurement demonstrates that the incorporation of topography measurement into BRDF modeling is essential for accurate property prediction. Roughness effects on the BRDF are so strong that BRDFs also reveal anisotropic features regardless {{of the presence of}} coating. Anisotropic roughness increases multiple scattering although first-order scattering is dominant, and thus enhances emittance noticeably. Silicon dioxide coating changes the magnitude of BRDF and emittance and reduces the anisotropic roughness effect on emittance enhancement. The research in this thesis advances the method to predict radiative properties by incorporating anisotropic rough statistics into BRDF modeling. Ph. D.

40|$|The visual {{ecology of}} deep-sea animals {{has long been}} of {{scientific}} interest. In the open ocean, {{where there is no}} physical structure to hide within or behind, diverse strategies have evolved {{to solve the problem of}} camouflage from a potential predator. Simulations of specific predator-prey scenarios have yielded estimates of the range of possible appearances that an animal may exhibit. However, there is a limited amount of quantitative information available related to both animal appearance and the light field at mesopelagic depths (200 m to 1000 m). To mitigate this problem, novel optical instrumentation, taking advantage of recent technological advances, was developed and is described in this dissertation. In the first half of this dissertation, the appearance of mirrored marine animals is quantitatively evaluated. A portable <b>optical</b> imaging <b>scatterometer</b> was developed to measure angular reflectance, described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), of biological specimens. The instrument allows for BRDF capture from samples of arbitrary size, over a significant fraction of the reflectance hemisphere. Multiple specimens representing two species of marine animals, collected at mesopelagic depths, were characterized using the scatterometer. Low-dimensional parametric models were developed to simplify use of the data sets, and to validate the BRDF method. Results from principal component analysis confirm that BRDF measurements can be used to study intra- and interspecific variability of mirrored marine animal appearance. Collaborative efforts utilizing the BRDF data sets to develop physically-based scattering models are underway. In the second half of this dissertation, another key part of the deep-sea biological camouflage problem is examined. Two underwater radiometers, capable of low-light measurements, were developed to address the lack of available information related to the deep-sea light field. Quantitative comparison of spectral downward irradiance profiles at blue (̃ 470 ̃nm) and green (̃ 560 ̃nm) wavelengths, collected at Pacific and Atlantic field stations, provide insight into the presence of Raman (inelastic) scattering effects at mesopelagic depths. The radiometers were also used to collect in situ flashes of bioluminescence. Collaborations utilizing both the downward irradiance and bioluminescence data sets are planne...|$|R
