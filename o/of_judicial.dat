5|$|Alternative views {{have been}} {{expressed}} that the amendments were not seeking {{to replace the}} common law <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review. Instead, they borrowed from the common law by turning the clock back, and merely clarified the limits <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> power {{in relation to the}} ISA. It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} form <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review {{available}} under the ISA, whether a person remains under detention depends largely on the Ministry of Home Affairs. This raises the question quis custodiet ipsos custodes? – who guards the guardians? If preventive detention is applied illegitimately {{in a manner that}} cripples lawful democratic opposition, the absence <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review would preclude the exposure of such abuse. It has been submitted that the voice of public opinion is most suited for this purpose.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and legal rules, though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E

The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> power.

5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics.

40|$|Abstract: The {{publication}} {{proposes a}} concept for new model {{for evaluation of}} the “reform <b>of</b> the <b>judicial</b> system”, different from those applied by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund where the economic growth rate of each country is measured. Their models, based on performance indicators, examine the “reform <b>of</b> the <b>judicial</b> system” as constant and floating in time, evaluated in certain periods of time. This fact obstructs {{the identification of the}} relative legislative miscarriages <b>of</b> every single <b>judicial</b> reform. The new model, proposed by the current study, discusses the possibilities how the presence of a single reform <b>of</b> the <b>judicial</b> system could be identified by a group of indicators. In this way it can be determined both the effectiveness of the reform <b>of</b> the <b>judicial</b> system and the government will for reform during its mandate. The model is especially useful to be implemented by countries with transitional economies when evaluating the correlation between the reform <b>of</b> the <b>judicial</b> system and the economic growth. As an example, in the current study the model is applied to the <b>judicial</b> system <b>of</b> Bulgaria...|$|R

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{suggested}} that, in {{the light}} of Chng Suan Tze, the validity of an order for preventive detention made by the Minister under section 30 of the CLTPA is dependent on the objective satisfaction of the Minister. Moreover, in Re Wong Sin Yee (2007), which also involved judicial review of an applicant's detention under section 30 of the CLTPA, the High Court, following the decision in Chng Suan Tze, held that the absence of the need to establish a jurisdictional or precedent fact meant that the scope <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 30 was limited to the GCHQ grounds <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review. The Court thus applied an objective test to the subjectively worded powers in section 30; if it Court had applied a subjective test, it would have deferred to the subjective satisfaction of the Minister that the detention was in the interests of public safety, peace and good order.|$|E

5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope <b>of</b> <b>judicial</b> review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
