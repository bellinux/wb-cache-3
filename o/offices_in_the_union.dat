50|$|In December 2005, the University {{declined}} {{to renew the}} Student Union's lease on catering outlets and outsourced catering operations to private operators. In March 2006, the union {{was the subject of}} controversy after the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ian Young, announced that the university would not renew the Union's funding for 2006 - an expected payment of A$1.5 million. Media reports speculated on the collapse of the organisation as a result. The organisation was under considerable financial pressure, and was forced to reduce staff numbers considerably in order to remain solvent. In 2006, SSU terminated the employment of its executive officer, Balrama Krishnan for alleged gross and willful misconduct. He was the Union's most senior employee, having worked there for over 26 years.The Swinburne Student Union has implemented a range of strategies designed to ensure its survival despite VSU. They began rolling out financial membership packages from 1 July 2006. In 2009, SSU's <b>offices</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> building at Swinburne's Hawthorn campus were occupied by the SSAA, and the Union moved their offices to the Administration building. This left the unique situation of the Union building, built in the 80's solely to house SSU activities, having no Union presence.|$|E

40|$|The risk {{involved}} with dental radiography is certainly small {{in comparison with}} many other risks that are a common part of everyday life.

50|$|According to Romanian law, union representatives must be {{employees}} of the institutions/companies whose workers they represent.
