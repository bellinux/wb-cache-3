5|$|With O'Sullivan, Hadley has {{conducted}} research on utilitarianism {{and the relationship}} between <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> animals and <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> needy humans. The scholars argue that there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals, and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, euthanise severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the developing world.|$|E

This legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report results from Article 162 of the Penal Code. Partly because of parliamentary questions about this legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report, the need has arisen to gain insight into the value of this leg-islative article and to explore whether the present form of the legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report is satisfactory. Moreover, since the Dutch Cabinet has indicated its intention to pro-mote attention for recognizing, signalling and reporting corruption, the Dutch Scientific Research and Documentation Centre of the Ministry of Justice has commissioned Beke Consultancy and Research to conduct a study into the way the civil servants’ legal <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> report functions...|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{beginning}} of the Giro d'Italia, it was reported that many of the team's sponsors in Kazakhstan had not paid their full <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> the team, and that most of the riders had been underpaid to that point in the season as a result. One sponsor, the Kazkhstani state carrier Air Astana, dropped its sponsorship entirely.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis was to use serious games as a tool <b>to</b> teach about <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> give notice. <b>Obligation</b> <b>to</b> give notice means that certain {{professionals}} need to report to social services {{if a child is}} being harmed. This thesis studied if case-based storytelling could bring a relevant teaching experience, if storytelling could help participants learn about <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> give notice and how instant and delayed feedback affect the learning. Participants played a story-based game with either instant or delayed feedback and answered three questionnaires about <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> give notice. The study found that participants did find that the storytelling was useful for learning and gaining more knowledge about about <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> give notice. For the feedback it was found that both types of feedback made the participants learn significantly more but {{there was no significant difference}} when comparing the feedbacks to each other...|$|R

5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding <b>obligations</b> <b>to</b> animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number of rights, and that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E
