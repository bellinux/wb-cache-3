25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} date of the {{shooting}} match, Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward. A certificate is currently <b>on</b> <b>file</b> <b>with</b> the Archives of Ontario, Registration Number 49594, reporting Butler and Oakley being wed on June 20, 1882, in Windsor, Ontario. Many sources say that the marriage took place on August 23, 1876, in Cincinnati, {{yet there is no}} recorded certificate to validate that date. A possible reason for the contradicting dates may be that Butler's divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876. An 1880 U.S. Federal Census record shows Saunders as married. Sources mentioning Butler's first wife as Elizabeth are inaccurate; Elizabeth was actually his granddaughter, her father being Edward F. Butler. Throughout Oakley's show-business career, the public was often led to believe that she was five to six years younger than her actual age. Claiming the later marriage date would have better supported her fictional age.|$|E
500|$|An {{unpublished}} manuscript <b>on</b> <b>file</b> <b>with</b> the Montana State Historical Society describes life in Basin between 1906 and 1910 {{in great}} detail. Two railroads, the Northern Pacific {{on the north}} side of the Boulder River, and the Great Northern on the south side, served the city; both had depots and warehouses in Basin and carried passengers as well as freight. The Glass brothers' smelter had been set up {{on the north side}} to process concentrated ore delivered by rail from out of town or from the mills on the south side. Infrastructure included a weight scale for ore cars and an overhead tram to carry ore across the river from the reduction mill to the smelter. Although the smelter was a [...] "massive unit" [...] equipped with furnaces, conveyors, and machinery ready for operation, it [...] "never turned a wheel".|$|E
