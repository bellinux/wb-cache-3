5|$|Using {{draconian}} drills {{that required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> to zero. For {{the most part they}} were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical Research Unit to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin resistant strain <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> had arisen. The ability <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E
5|$|Although Allied {{casualties}} {{during the}} battle had been light, {{in the wake of}} the battle, Milne Bay suffered an epidemic <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> that posed a threat to the base as great as that from the Japanese attack. Over one-sixth of Milne Force, including Clowes, came down with the disease. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> soared to 33 per thousand per week in September (equivalent to 1,716 per thousand per annum), and to 82 per thousand per week in December (equivalent to 4,294 per thousand per annum). At this rate, the whole force could have been incapacitated in a matter of months. It placed enormous strain on the medical units and the supplies of anti-malarial drugs. The Chief Pathologist of New Guinea Force, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford went to see Blamey, who was now in personal command of New Guinea Force, and told him that 1,000 men and a large quantity of anti-malarial supplies were urgently required at Milne Bay to avert a disaster. Blamey took a personal interest in the matter. He expedited supply shipments, and made the required personnel available. The arrival of quantities of the new drug atabrine allowed this more effective drug to be substituted for quinine. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> dropped dramatically after December, the month in which atabrine became the official Australian prophylactic drug, and by March 1943 the crisis had passed. After this, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> amongst the garrison at Milne Bay was similar to other bases in Papua and New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to control}} the spread <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> {{suffered}} a major setback in 1930: entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis). This species of mosquito is a particularly efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa. In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest epidemic <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> ever seen in the New World. However, complete eradication of A. gambiae from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by the systematic application of the arsenic-containing compound Paris green to breeding places, and of pyrethrum spray-killing to adult resting places.|$|E

The study was an observational research with cross sectional design which conducted in Sambelia Subdistrict East Lombok District. The sample size was 347 children under five years.

The nature of breeding places were 134, 70  750 m 2 in average width, with algae, grass, and moss area in water biota, and mostly muddy on turbidity level except at breeding places in two sub-villages. The study founded two genus of mosquitoes, Culex and Anopheles. The species of Anopheles that are found in the study area are An. sundaicus, An. subpictus, An. aconitus, An. barbirostris, An. minimus dan An. Anullaris. There were 9 sub villages near from the breeding places (less than 1000 m), 7 sub-villages with midlle distance from the breeding places (1000  2000 m), and 8 sub-villages far from it (more than 2000 m).

40|$|P-selectin is a {{leukocyte}} adhesion receptor expressed on {{the surface}} of activated platelets and endothelial cells. Its role in the pathogenesis <b>of</b> cerebral <b>malaria</b> was explored in a murine model <b>of</b> cerebral <b>malaria.</b> Infection <b>of</b> mice with Plasmodium berghei ANKA led to P-selectin up-regulation in brain vessels of cerebral malaria-susceptible mice but not of cerebral malaria-resistant mice. Treatment of susceptible mice with anti-mouse P-selectin mAb failed to prevent the development of the neurological syndrome. However, P-selectin-deficient mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA had a cumulative incidence <b>of</b> cerebral <b>malaria</b> which was significantly reduced compared to wild-type animals (4. 5 % versus 80 %, respectively), despite identical levels of parasitemia, platelet and leukocyte accumulation. To determine whether P-selectin on platelets and/or endothelium was responsible for the microvascular pathology, cerebral malaria was assessed in chimeric mice deficient in platelet or endothelial P-selectin, which were generated by bone marrow transplantation.

40|$|Abstract. Plasmodium falciparum rosetting (the {{spontaneous}} binding {{of infected}} erythrocytes to uninfected erythro-cytes) is a well-recognized parasite virulence factor. However, {{it is currently}} unclear whether rosetting is associated with all clinical forms <b>of</b> severe <b>malaria,</b> or only with specific syndromes such as cerebral malaria. We investigated the rela-tionship between rosetting and clinical malaria in 209 Malian children enrolled in a case-control study <b>of</b> severe <b>malaria.</b> Rosetting was significantly higher in parasite isolates from severe malaria cases compared with non-severe hyperpara-sitemia and uncomplicated malaria controls (F 2, 117 = 8. 15, P < 0. 001). Analysis of sub-categories <b>of</b> severe <b>malaria</b> (unrous-able coma, severe anemia, non-comatose neurological impairment, repeated seizures or a small heterogeneous group with signs of renal failure or jaundice) showed high levels of rosetting in all sub-categories, and {{no statistically significant differences}} in rosetting between sub-categories (F 4, 67 = 1. 28, P = 0. 28). Thus rosetting may contribute to the pathogenesis <b>of</b> all severe <b>malaria</b> syndromes in African children, and interventions to disrupt rosetting could be potential adjunctive therapies for all forms <b>of</b> severe <b>malaria</b> in Africa...|$|R
