US 213 along with MD 280 were replaced by MD 213, which ran from MD 662 in Wye Mills north to the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill.

With the re-alignment, US160 was re-routed into Arizona instead of Utah. US163 also absorbed the former route of US160 to its former terminus at Interstate 70 at Crescent Junction. In 1981, AASHTO approved a new iteration <b>of</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 191 that absorbed much of the alignment of US163. Utah truncated US163 at Bluff. The truncation was made without approval from AASHTO, as the AASHTO logs placed the northern terminus of US163 at I-70 at Crescent Junction.|$|E

5|$|MD355 is the {{original}} route <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 240, which was planned in 1926 to run from Washington, D.C. north to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; however, the route was designated a part of US15 north of Frederick. This route served as the primary connector linking Frederick and points west to Washington, D.C. During the 1950s, US 240 was relocated in stages to the Washington National Pike, a freeway between Bethesda and Frederick shared with I-70S (now I-270). MD 355 was designated onto the former alignment <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 240 between Bethesda and Frederick as each stage of freeway was built. MD 355 was also designated through Frederick along Market Street, which was the former alignment <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 15 through the city before it was moved to a bypass in 1959. US 240 was decommissioned in 1972, and MD 355 was extended south along the former US 240 to the Washington, D.C. border. In 2006, the interchange with US15 at the route’s northern terminus was removed, resulting in MD355 ending just short <b>of</b> <b>US</b> 15 at a dead end. By 2009, a four lane divided bypass of Urbana for MD355, funded by private developers, was completed. The former alignment of MD355 through Urbana was designated as MD355 Business (MD355 Bus.) The same year, the portion of MD355 north of I-70 {{was transferred to the}} city of Frederick and is no longer considered part of the route.|$|E
