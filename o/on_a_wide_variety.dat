5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of bony fishes, {{as well as}} eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of equal size when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As {{with other members of}} its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins.

The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of fishes and invertebrates from {{on or near}} the sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E

Its preferred fruits {{including those of}} the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E

5|$|Hawaiian {{monk seals}} mainly prey on reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they also}} prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and sub-adults prey more on smaller octopus species, such as Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis, nocturnal octopi species, and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus species such as O. cyanea. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of available prey. Tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian Monk Seal.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{are usually}} solitary, with a South-East Queensland study {{estimating}} densities of only 50 per hectare (compared {{to some other}} Australian species nearly two orders of magnitude more dense). The adult floury baker normally perches facing downwards and on branches of trees rather than trunks. It is found <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>variety</b> of plants, most commonly on species in the family Myrtaceae, more specifically various species of Melaleuca and Callistemon plants, as well as brown hazelwood (Lysicarpus angustifolius) and pegunny (Bauhinia hookeri). These are expected to also be nymphal food plants. The species was associated with white feather honeymyrtle (Melaleuca decora) in a study at three sites in western Sydney. The broad-leaved paperbark has been confirmed as a nymphal food plant.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius blennius is {{very common}} and is found in {{broad-leaved}} woodland, favouring beech; it is most associated with Fagus sylvatica, the European Beech, though {{it has also been}} observed growing in association with species of oak.
