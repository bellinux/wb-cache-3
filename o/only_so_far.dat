25|$|Race kallaura, Moore. Of {{this form}} I have seen {{only a few}} specimens. Judging by the types, which {{are now in the}} {{collection}} of the British Museum, it differs less from the typical form than do any of the other races. As in N. soma, the markings are small and narrow; the subbasal band of the hindwing is, however, attenuated at each end, and not of even width, underside: ground colour very much paler and somewhat ochraceous, the anterior and posterior sets of spots of the discal series closer together respectively; the postdiscal band on the hindwing equal in width to the subbasal band. Recorded <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> from Travancore.|$|E
25|$|Other body casts {{which were}} used in decades past to protect an injured spine {{or as part of}} the {{treatment}} for a spinal deformity (see scoliosis) which are rarely seen today include the Minerva cast and Risser cast. The Minerva cast includes the trunk of the body (sometimes extending down <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as the rib cage) as well as the patient's head, with openings provided for the patient's face, ears, and usually {{the top of the head}} and hair. The Risser cast was similar, extending from the patient's hips to the neck and sometimes including part of the head. Both of these casts could, with care and the doctor's permission, be walked in during convalescence. However, in some cases the Risser cast would extend into one or more pantaloons, in which case mobility was far more restricted.|$|E

One level is “genetic inheritance.” The Qur'an refers to this level as one’s “physical stamp” that “determines one’s temperamental nature” including one’s sexuality. One {{the basis of this}} reading of the Qur'an, Kugle asserts that homosexuality is “caused by divine will,” so “homosexuals have no rational choice in their internal disposition to be attracted to same-sex mates.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike {{the ancient}} sandals, which {{consisted}} merely of soles {{fastened to the}} foot by straps, the episcopal sandals are {{in the form of}} low shoes, and resemble slippers. The sole is of leather; the upper part, generally ornamented with embroidery, is made at the present day of silk or velvet. No cross is required upon the sandals; at Rome this is an exclusively papal privilege. With the sandals are worn the liturgical stockings, caligæ. [...] The privilege of wearing the sandals and caligæ belongs only to bishops. They may be worn by abbots and other prelates only by special privilege from the pope and <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as this privilege grants. The pontifical footwear is used only at Tridentine Pontifical Solemn Mass and at functions performed during the same, such as ordination, but not on other occasions, as, for example, Confirmation, Solemn Vespers, etc. It is therefore in the most exact sense of the word a vestment worn during the Mass. The liturgical color for the day decides the colour of the sandals and stockings; there are, however, no black stockings or sandals, as the bishop does not make use of either of these pontifical footwear at Requiem Masses.|$|E

"it {{would seem}} {{necessary}} to underline {{the fact that}} the three types of exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied <b>only</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as they go and no further. This implies above all that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon the conviction {{that the best way to}} combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them – those of the child's habitual residence – are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, did Congress {{have the}} [...] "power to proscribe any opinion or belief {{which has not}} {{manifested}} itself in any overt act"?

He agreed that [...] "The law sometimes does inquire as to mental state, but <b>only,</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as I recall, when it is incidental to, and determines the quality of, some overt act in question." [...] Citing Cramer v. United States, 325 U.S. 1 (1945), Jackson observed that the Constitution barred punishment even of the very serious crime of treason unless there was some overt act. But under the majority's decision, Jackson said, [...] "since Congress has never outlawed the political strike itself, the Court must be holding that Congress may root out mere ideas which, even if acted upon, would not result in crime." [...] That was anathema to the Constitution. Agreeing that the Bill of Rights was not a suicide pact (as the majority had pointed out), Jackson nonetheless concluded that Congress had narrower, just as effective means of preventing the violent overthrow of the government than attempting to regulate thought. [...] "I think that, under our system, it is time enough for the law to lay hold of the citizen when he acts illegally, or in some rare circumstances when his thoughts are given illegal utterance. I think we must let his mind alone." ...|$|E
