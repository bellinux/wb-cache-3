5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Saturday</b> Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies opened May {{against the}} division-rival New York Mets, losing the opening {{game of the}} month, 7–4. Back-to-back walks in the tenth inning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Saturday</b> {{afternoon}} game gave the Phillies their first win of the season over the Mets. After a rainout, the Phillies opened their first series in St. Louis with the Cardinals. They won {{the first game of}} the series on Howard's second grand slam in as many weeks after a pitchers' duel between starters Kyle Lohse and Joe Blanton and completed the two-game series sweep with a 10–7 victory on May 5, capped by a Jayson Werth three-run home run and a 4-for-5 performance from Victorino. The Phillies' brief stop in New York was marred by a two-game series sweep; Phillies hitters were shut down by Mets starters Johan Santana and Mike Pelfrey, and closer Francisco Rodríguez recorded saves in both games of the series. The following series was barely better, as the Phillies dropped two games to the Braves.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created in}} November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Saturday</b> Evening Post. All {{of the people in}} the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in Arlington, Vermont, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on Thanksgiving Day to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. The Post published Freedom from Want with a corresponding essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Despite many who endured sociopolitical hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the socioeconomic hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.|$|E

50|$|As {{the video}} starts, Vanessa is seen singing {{to a picture}} of {{what appears to be a}} superhero team made <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Saturdays</b> and an extra male. Vanessa looks out of her {{apartment}} window, to see a press conference centred on the man. The video then skips to Una standing in an alleyway where a poster <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male is put up over an older poster <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Saturdays</b> and <b>the</b> male. Una rips this down and sets it on fire using her superpower. It is obvious from this that the man has betrayed <b>The</b> <b>Saturdays</b> and they want revenge. Una's power also causes the real man to start to heat up and become uncomfortable. The scene switches to Frankie, now hidden amongst the paparazzi at the press conference. She uses her superpowers to amplify the camera's flash to dazzle the man. As the second chorus kicks in, Vanessa displays telekinetic power, being able to pull and push the man around from a distance. This causes him to flee and try to escape in a car. Rochelle stops the car from moving with her superpower stopping the man from escaping. He then runs down an alleyway. Mollie flies down from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a building and blows the man back down the alleyway. The video closes with <b>The</b> <b>Saturdays</b> walking calmly down a deserted road with the man crawling pathetically backwards from the girls.|$|R
