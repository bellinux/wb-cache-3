The episode was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia in early spring to give it a [...] "gray" [...] and [...] "bleak" [...] look. The decision to film in Vancouver was to give the show the same dark feel as its sister show The X-Files, which had also been created by Carter. The strip club, Ruby Tip, was inspired by a club in Seattle named the Lusty Lady, which is located on that city's main street. Director David Nutter had been a long-time staff member of The X-Files crew. Carter said the episode was [...] "directed beautifully by David Nutter who added to the project in so many ways, even as it came <b>on,</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he saw visually that were able to actually change and make the script more concise". Although [...] "Pilot" [...] did not open with a literary quote as the series would do from the next episode onwards, its plot heavily features the 1919 poem [...] "The Second Coming" [...] by Irish poet William Butler Yeats.|$|E
500|$|In Cowboys & Aliens, Director Jon Favreau sought [...] a {{plausible}} approach to how humans {{from the late}} 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, [...] "It was very well laid out, well planned, {{and there were a}} lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step." [...] The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, [...] "It's very easy to just cut the string and then all of a sudden the action starts and you're in Independence Day." [...] Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own, referencing Alien, Predator, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He said of both genres, [...] "It's about finding the intersection of those two genres [...] [...] [...] If you do it right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before." ...|$|E

500|$|Former advisors {{commented that}} Perot, who had {{achieved}} ballot access in 24 states, was unwilling [...] "to spend money <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> mattered" [...] including Rollins' and Jordan's proposed $150 million advertising campaign, was [...] "obsessed" [...] with his image, and {{lost interest in}} running after receiving negative press. Supporters were angry and distraught at Perot's decision, and his popularity dropped among the American public. One woman called Perot and commented that [...] "the tears have not stopped." [...] A class action lawsuit was filed in Florida {{to force him to}} remain in the race, but it was dropped. Later in July, the economic plan that Perot's campaign had been working on was released. The fifty-page proposal included cuts in domestic spending, investment in education, communication and transportation programs, an increase in income taxes for the wealthy, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The plan was projected to eliminate the budget deficit in five years. [...] At the end of August, Perot promised to give his endorsement to any candidate that supported his economic plan, but hinted that he may reenter the race. These hints increased in September, as Perot looked to buy advertising time on the major networks to discuss his economic plan, which could only occur if he was a declared candidate. Meanwhile, petitions for ballot access were approved in all 50 states, and polls showed Perot still in double digits with 14% support, behind Clinton and Bush with 44% and 39%, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term has}} also {{been used in the}} {{different}} sense of [...] feminism as it applies to mothers. Dr. Andrea O’Reilly of York University in Toronto said at a 2011 Women’s Worlds conference in Ottawa, Canada that feminist mothering must focus <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are denied to women by patriarchal motherhood. Feminist mothers must take control of their lives and act according to their own beliefs rather than society's expectations.|$|E
2500|$|Reed {{was born}} on March 2, 1942 at Beth El Hospital (now Brookdale) in Brooklyn {{and grew up in}} Freeport, Long Island. Contrary to some sources, his birth name was Lewis Allan Reed, not Louis Firbanks, a name that was coined as a joke by Lester Bangs in Creem magazine. Reed was the son of Toby (née Futterman) (1920–2013) and Sidney Joseph Reed (1913–2005), an accountant. His family was Jewish, and {{although}} {{he said that he was}} Jewish, he added, [...] "My God is rock'n'roll. It's an obscure power that can change your life. The most important part of my religion is to play guitar." [...] Reed attended Atkinson Elementary School in Freeport and went on to Freeport Junior High School, notorious for its gangs. His sister said that as a teenager, he suffered panic attacks, became socially awkward and [...] "possessed a fragile temperament" [...] but was highly focused <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he liked [...] principally music.|$|E

If it be so, and {{so it seems to}} be, must we {{come to the conclusion that}} life is little better than a dream, and little worth the loves and strivings that we crowd into it? ...|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2008, Scot McCloud said that in Reinventing Comics he was [...] "shooting for the moon, in hopes that we could create these radical departures from traditional comics," [...] noting that [...] "most online comics are still pretty conservative in format and style" [...] but also that [...] "there have been some impressive strides in that direction." [...] McCloud specified {{that he was still}} keeping an eye <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> needed to happen for the infinite canvas to take off, saying that [...] "the notion of Web applications being as robust as desktop applications has placed us closer to that hope that we may finally be able to create those spaces in a seamless way online. Right now, it's very difficult to do that." [...] In {{an interview}} in 2014, McCloud said that [...] "without a reliable financial structure to support these experimental webcomics, {{a lot of people just}} turn away and get a real job, or start doing three-panel gag strips. Those have an economic model that works." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Raiul găinilor, Lungu's {{extends his}} focus on the provincial and {{suburban}} environments into novel form. The book, written over one summer, carries the subtitle [...] "A faux novel of rumors and mysteries" [...] and is defined by its author as a work on [...] "the circulations of rumors". Its heroes are feeble {{men and women who}} interpret the larger world based <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> occur in their immediate vicinity, Acacia Street. The narrative borrows from the conventions of the frame story, and, Terian notes, owes direct inspiration to Hanu Ancuței, an interwar volume by the classic Romanian author Mihail Sadoveanu. While Terian believes Raiul găinilor to be primarily calm and distant, his colleague Mircea Iorgulescu, who prefaced the work, argued: [...] "Under a benign and slow-going appearance, the novel's world is actually terrifying. It lives mechanically, though automatisms which provide it with a kind of demented functioning, similar to one of the characters, a woman who endlessly knits pullovers without watching her own hands." [...] One fragment which drew critical attention is that in which the humble Milică, who has once been allowed into the house of the reclusive, imposing and envied Colonel, embellishes the account of its luxurious standards in order to captivate his peers. Similarly, the mythomaniacal factory worker Mitu obsesses over his supposed chance encounter with communist leader Ceaușescu. In addition to these topical aspects, the novel fictionalizes professional incompetence, feud, adultery and working class drinking culture. It ultimately deals with the impact of post-Revolution economic transition, reflected in the characters' ambiguous memories of Ponzi schemes, or projected in the account of how the closure of non-lucrative factories prevented the employees from continuing to steal industrial materials. According to Andrei Terian, the book is primarily relevant for the way in the [...] "captivating" [...] and [...] "discreet" [...] narrative supports events of marginal importance, with [...] "the absence of any demonstrative intent" [...] for a defining characteristic. Lungu however recounted having written it with [...] "pleasure, a masochistic pleasure".|$|E
