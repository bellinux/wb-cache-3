5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by King Hussein. The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people</b> to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E

5|$|Jifna {{is governed}} by a village council {{consisting}} of ten members including the chairman. The council was founded in 1954, when a prominent resident, Nasri Ilias Samara, pressured the Jordanian authorities to recognize the institution, even though a village was normally required to have a population of at least 1,000 inhabitants for permission to establish a village council. The decision was approved by Jordan's then prime minister. Representatives from Jifna's largest families formed the original council's body, appointing Smara as chairman and Salim Issa Musleh as vice chairman. Jabi Na'im Kamil was elected as the chairman in 2005 and the Badil (Alternative) list—which represents a leftist alliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Front for <b>the</b> Liberation <b>of</b> Palestine and <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>People's</b> Party—won most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council seats.|$|R

25|$|There are {{divergent}} {{views on}} the peace process held by US officials, citizens and lobbying groups.

2500|$|In his 1997 book, <b>Palestinian</b> Identity: <b>The</b> Construction <b>of</b> Modern National Consciousness, {{historian}} Rashid Khalidi {{notes that}} the archaeological strata that denote <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Palestine—encompassing <b>the</b> Biblical, Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, Fatimid, Crusader, Ayyubid, Mamluk and Ottoman periods—form part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern-day <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people,</b> as {{they have come to}} understand it over the last century, but derides <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> some <b>Palestinian</b> nationalists to attempt to [...] "anachronistically" [...] read back into history a nationalist consciousness that is in fact [...] "relatively modern." [...] Khalidi stresses that Palestinian identity has never been an exclusive one, with [...] "Arabism, religion, and local loyalties" [...] playing an important role. He argues that the modern national identity of Palestinians has its roots in nationalist discourses that emerged among <b>the</b> peoples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century which sharpened following <b>the</b> demarcation <b>of</b> modern nation-state boundaries in the Middle East after World War I. He acknowledges that Zionism played a role in shaping this identity, though [...] "it is a serious mistake to suggest that Palestinian identity emerged mainly as a response to Zionism." [...] Khalidi describes <b>the</b> Arab population <b>of</b> British Mandatory Palestine as having [...] "overlapping identities," [...] with some or many expressing loyalties to villages, regions, a projected nation of Palestine, an alternative of inclusion in a Greater Syria, an Arab national project, as well as to Islam.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people</b> {{have many}} symbols, {{and one of}} them is Bir Zeit {{university}} near Ramallah - the secular intellectual center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society. For years, Bir Zeit has also been a symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> coexistence between <b>the</b> two peoples. Even during <b>the</b> darkest periods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupation (when the university would be immediately closed by a military order), they called for a solution based on recognizing <b>the</b> rights <b>of</b> both peoples. Even when their position was far from being popular in their community, and there were those who accused them of collaboration, they called for cooperation with Israeli peace forces which opposed the occupation. In the eighties, I acquired, like many others, my political education in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> civil and democratic struggle from the young and idealistic lecturers of Bir Zeit. There is no doubt that Bir Zeit had an important role in <b>the</b> triumph <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> compromise and reconciliation within <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> society, at <b>the</b> eve <b>of</b> Oslo, when <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>people</b> extended their hand to peace with us, with hope and faith.
