40|$|Bacterial extradiol ring-fission dioxygenases play a {{critical}} role in the transformation of multiring aromatic compounds to more readily biodegradable aromatic or aliphatic intermediates. Arthrobacter sp. strain GFB 100 utilizes an extradiol meta-fission dioxygenase, 3, 4 -dihydroxyxanthone dioxygenase (DHXD), in the catabolism of the three-ring <b>oxygen</b> <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compound</b> xanthone. In this paper, we show that DHXD is a cytosolic enzyme, induced by growth on xanthone and maximally expressed during the stationary phase of growth. In addition, we characterize the DHXD activity in terms of its basic enzymological properties. 1, 10 -Phenanthroline and H 2 O 2 treatments eliminated DHXD activity, indicating that the enzyme required Fe 2 + ions for activity. Other divalent cations were either inhibitory or had no effect on activity. DHXD had a temperature optimum of 30 degrees C and a pH optimum of 7. 0. DHXD followed typical saturation kinetics and had an apparent Km of 10 microM for 3, 4 -dihydroxyxanthone. The dye celestine blue served as a noncompetitive DHXD inhibitor (Ki, 5 microM). Several other structural analogs served neither as substrates nor inhibitors. DHXD was thermally labile at temperatures above 40 degrees C. The half-life for thermal DHXD inactivation was 5 min at 40 degrees C. DHXD activity was completely stable through one freeze-thaw cycle, and about 80 % of the DHXD activity remained after 2 days of incubation at 0 degree C. The apparent tight binding of the Fe 2 + cofactor to DHXD may be a factor contributing to the stability of this extradiol dioxygenase when it is stored...|$|E

30|$|Mild {{steel is}} a {{familiar}} material employed widely {{in a variety of}} industries. But the main problem of using mild steel is its dissolution in acidic solutions. In various industrial processes, acid solutions are commonly used for removal of rust and scale. Use of inhibitors in these processes to prevent metal dissolution is very common [1, 2, 3]. Most of the well-known acid inhibitors are organic compounds containing nitrogen, sulfur, <b>oxygen,</b> <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>compounds</b> with a polar functional group and conjugated double bond [4, 5, 6, 7]. These compounds are adsorbed on the metallic surface and block the active corrosion sites [8]. Most of the synthetic chemicals are costly, toxic to both human being and the environment. To solve the above defects, it is necessary to develop cheap, non-toxic and environmentally friendly natural products as corrosion inhibitors. These natural organic compounds are either synthesized or extracted from aromatic herbs, spices and medicinal plants. Plant extracts are an incredibly rich source of naturally synthesized chemical compounds that can be extracted by simple procedures with low cost and are biodegradable in nature. The use of these natural compounds extracted from leaves or seeds as corrosion inhibitors have been reported by several authors [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Subramania et al. [17] studied the corrosion inhibition of leaf extracts of curry leaves, henna leaves as well as extracts from seeds of Jack fruit and tamarind on mild steel corrosion in acidic solutions. Other than the plant extracts, pure organic compounds extracted from natural products such as piperine [18], Ellagic acid, tannic acid [19], tryptamine [20], caffeine [21], Pennyroyal oil [22], amino acids [23] and caffeic acid [24] have also been used for inhibition of corrosion. Hyptis suaveolens is easily available in India. It is a medium-sized forest tree which has 2  m height and belongs to Lamiaceae family. It is commonly known as Wilayati tulasi. It is also used for parasitical cutaneous diseases, infection of uterus, and as sudorific in catarrhal condition, skin disease, headache, stomachache and snuff to stop bleeding of the nose. The extract of this plant contains numerous naturally environmental organic compounds. The genus of H. suaveolens is known to contain significant amount of volatile oils, starch, protein, tannins, saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids and glycosides [25, 26]. The leaf of the plant is biodegradable and a renewable material.|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{effects of}} three (one major and two minor) Miocene diabase {{intrusions}} on Cretaceous black shales from DSDP site 41 - 368 have been analyzed. A concentration gradient was observed, {{especially for the}} hydrocarbons, decreasing towards the major intrusion and between the three sills. The thermally-altered samples in the proximity of and between the sills contained elemental sulfur and an excess of thermally-derived pristane over phytane. whereas, the unaltered sediments contained no elemental sulfur, and more phytane than pristane. A maximum yield of the extractable hydrocarbons was observed {{at a depth of}} 7 m below the major sill. Two classes of molecular markers were present in this bitumen suite. The first was sesqui-, di- and triterpenoids and steranes. which could be correlated with both terrigenous and autochthonous sources. They were geologically mature and showed no significant changes due to the thermal stress. The second class was found in the altered samples, which contained only polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons with low alkyl substitution and sulfur and <b>oxygen</b> <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic <b>compounds.</b> These compounds were derived from pyrolytic reactions during the thermal event. Kerogen was isolated from all of these samples, but only traces of humic substances were present. The H/C, N/C, d 13 C, d 34 S and dD all exhibit the expected effects of thermal stress. The kerogen becomes more aromatized and richer in 13 C, 34 S and D in the proximity of and between the sills. Maturation trends were also measured by the vitrinite reflectance and electron spin resonance, where the thermal stress could be correlated with an elevated country rock temperature and an increased degree of aromaticity. The effects of in situ thermal stress on the organic-rich shales resulted in the generation and expulsion of petroliferous material from the vicinity of the sills...|$|R
