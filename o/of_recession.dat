5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to date recessions in America {{beginning}} in 1790. These periods <b>of</b> <b>recession</b> were not identified until the 1920s. To construct the dates, researchers studied business annals during the period and constructed time series of the data. The earliest recessions for which there is the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects <b>of</b> <b>recession,</b> in accordance with Keynesian economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of two labor market institutions, {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) and job search assistance (JSA), on the output cost and welfare cost <b>of</b> <b>recessions.</b> The paper develops a tractable incomplete-market model with search unemployment, skill depreciation during unemployment, and idiosyncratic as well as aggregate labor market risk. The theoretical analysis shows that an increase in JSA {{and a reduction in}} UI reduce the output cost <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> by making the labor market more fluid along the job finding margin and thus making the economy more resilient to macroeconomic shocks. In contrast, {{the effect of}} JSA and UI on the welfare cost <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> is in general ambiguous. The paper also provides a quantitative application to the German labor market reforms of 2003 - 2005, the so-called Hartz reforms, which improved JSA (Hartz III reform) and reduced UI (Hartz IV reform). According to the baseline calibration, the two labor market reforms led to a substantial reduction in the output cost <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> and a more moderate reduction in the welfare cost <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> in Germany...|$|R
5|$|The dating <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> {{during this}} period is controversial. Modern {{economic}} statistics, such as gross domestic product and unemployment, were not gathered {{during this period}}. Victor Zarnowitz evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity <b>of</b> these <b>recessions.</b> From 1834 to 1929, one measure <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, {{which can be used}} to compare recessions.|$|R
5|$|He {{was elected}} the 33rd {{governor}} of Oregon in 1986, serving a single term. He faced significant challenges, particularly a rising anti-tax movement (leading to Measure 5 in 1990) and {{a doubling of}} the state's prison population. He worked across party lines to reduce regulation and to repair the state's infrastructure. During his term, Oregon emerged from nearly eight years <b>of</b> <b>recession.</b> His reforms to the State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF), a state-chartered worker's compensation insurance company were heralded at the time, but drew strong criticism in later years.|$|E
5|$|In the 17thcentury, Aarhus {{entered a}} period <b>of</b> <b>recession</b> as it {{suffered}} blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential {{treatment of the}} capital by the state. It {{was not until the}} middle of the 18thcentury growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city; particularly grain proved to be a remunerative export. The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade.|$|E
5|$|The coins met {{a hostile}} {{reception}} {{from the business}} community in Honolulu, who feared inflation of the currency in a time <b>of</b> <b>recession.</b> After legal maneuvering, the government agreed to use {{over half of the}} coinage as backing for paper currency, and this continued until better economic times began in 1885. After that, the coins were more eagerly accepted in circulation. They remained in the flow of commerce on the islands until withdrawn in 1903, after Hawaii had become a US territory.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} on the effects <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> on potential output. In contrast to the assumption in mainstream macroeconomic models that economic fluctuations do not change potential output paths, the evidence {{is that they do}} in the case <b>of</b> <b>recessions.</b> A model is proposed to explain this phenomenon based on an analogy with water flows in porous media. Because of the discrete adjustments made by heterogeneous economic agents in such a world, potential output displays hysteresis with regard to aggregate demand shocks and thus retains a memory of the shocks associated with recessions...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between recessions and productivity {{growth has been}} the focus of an important body of theoretical and empirical research in the last two decades. We contribute to this literature by presenting new evidence on the evolution of productivity in the aftermath <b>of</b> <b>recessions.</b> Our method allows us to distinguish between frontier and (in-) efficiency effects <b>of</b> <b>recessions.</b> We present international evidence for a panel of 70 countries for the 1960 - 2000 period. Our results reveal that the average cumulative impact <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> on productivity up to four years after its end is negative and significant. This, however, results from a mixture of mechanisms. The level of frontier production increases, but the rate of technical progress decreases, leading to a fall in frontier production. Efficiency also falls, lending support for the idea that recessions tend to reduce, rather than increase, economic restructuring. Long and deep recessions are also shown to have distinctive impacts on productivity...|$|R

25|$|Keynes' {{basic idea}} was simple: {{to keep people}} fully employed, governments have to run deficits {{when the economy is}} slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep {{production}} at the normal level and bring the economy out <b>of</b> <b>recession.</b> Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes.|$|E
25|$|On Monday to Thursday {{prior to}} the recession, the {{supplements}} carried substantial quantities of recruitment advertising, as well as editorial on their specialised topics. However, this has diminished since the onset <b>of</b> <b>recession,</b> {{to the point that}} the supplements have been seriously contracted or no longer appear as independent sections. The formerly sixty-page-thick Society supplement (Wednesday) is now no more and has been absorbed into the main part of the paper.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{beyond the}} prediction of the probability <b>of</b> a <b>recession</b> by also considering its severity in terms of output loss and duration. First, Probit models are used to estimate the probability <b>of</b> a <b>recession</b> at period t + h from the information available at period t. Next, a Vector Autoregression (VAR) augmented with diffusion indices and an inverse Mills ratio (IMR) is fitted to selected measures of real economic activity. The latter model is used to generate two forecasts: an average forecast, and a forecast under pessimistic assumption that a recession occurs at the forecast horizon. The severity <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> is then predicted as the gap between these two forecasts. Finally, a zero-inflated Poisson model is fitted to historical durations <b>of</b> <b>recessions.</b> Our empirical results suggest that U. S. recessions are fairly predictable, {{both in terms of}} occurrence and severity. Out-of-sample experiments suggest that the inclusion of the IMR in the VAR model significantly improves its forecasting performance...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In this thesis, I {{evaluate}} how {{fiscal and}} monetary stimulus policies {{contribute to the}} economic recovery process <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> in the United States. Using a case study approach, I will study ten major recessions over the 20 th century and early 21 st century to answer this question. I will study the different fiscal and monetary policies implemented during the following recessions: the Great Depression; the <b>Recession</b> <b>of</b> 1937, the <b>Recession</b> <b>of</b> 1945, the <b>Recession</b> <b>of</b> 1953, the 1973 - 75 Recession, the 1980 Recession, the Early 1980 s Recession, the Early 1990 s Recession, the Early 2000 s Recession, and the Late- 2000 s Recession. The literature suggests {{a wide range of}} conflicting viewpoints as to the most effective stimulus policies for economic recovery. I conclude that while both monetary and fiscal stimulus policies have been effective in contributing to GDP growth and reductions in unemployment, it is evident that each recession requires a unique policy response. In many cases, I find value in implementing both monetary and fiscal policy, jointly, as they complement one another. I also find that, generally, monetary policy is most effective in contributing to the economic recovery process <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> through open market operations that reduce the interest rate and that fiscal policy is most effective in contributing to the economic recovery process <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> through government spending. My systematic exploration of these policies and the recession case studies, provide valuable information of the effects of these policies and provide insight into the appropriate use of stimulus policies in the current economy and for future recessions and recoveries...|$|R

25|$|The United States {{has been}} the world's largest {{national}} economy in terms of GDP {{since at least the}} 1920s. For many years following the Great Depression of the 1930s, when danger <b>of</b> <b>recession</b> appeared most serious, the government strengthened the economy by spending heavily itself or cutting taxes so that consumers would spend more, and by fostering rapid growth in the money supply, which also encouraged more spending. Ideas about the best tools for stabilizing the economy changed substantially between the 1930s and the 1980s. From the New Deal era that began in 1933, to the Great Society initiatives of the 1960s, national policy makers relied principally on fiscal policy to influence the economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} of 1184 {{was very}} strong and damaged the castle and several churches, Rende experienced a period <b>of</b> <b>recession.</b> Since 1189 we witnessed {{in the kingdom of}} Sicily to a struggle for succession to William the Good, but in 1194 Henry VI, husband of Constance d’Hauteville (heir designated by William) came with his Forces in the kingdom of Sicily, reclaiming the crown. Passing in these lands Henry VI alleged payment of huge taxes that people would never have been able to honour. In defence of them intervened Gioacchino da Fiore, Constance’s confessor, because he knew the people there, spent almost a year in the Rende mountains before becoming Abbot of Corazzo. After the death of Henry VI occurred shortly after, Rende lived a florid period, thanks to the protection of Constance.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{consensus}} among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued {{through most of the}} Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt's New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out <b>of</b> <b>recession.</b> Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's words and actions portended. It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interrupting recession of 1937. One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935, which effectively raised reserve requirements, causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery. GDP returned to its upward trend in 1938.|$|E
40|$|Gingival {{recession}} {{represents a}} serious problem, for both patient and physician, especially when {{exposure of the}} radicular surface {{is related to the}} deterioration of the aesthetic aspect and to a more pronounced dental hyper‐ sensitivity. Scope of the study: to determine the preva‐ lence and severity <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> in young adults, correlated with the local dental, as well as socio‐economic and cultu‐ ral conditions. Materials and method: A number of 85 persons, having addressed the Department of Perio‐ dontology, Faculty of Dental Medicine of Iasi, between February‐May 2011, were examined. The following para‐ meters were recorded: sex, education level, total number <b>of</b> gingival <b>recessions</b> {{at the level of the}} oral cavity, type of brush employed, frequency of dental brushing, amount of attached gingiva, existence of labial phrenum, type of occlusion, presence of certain complications induced by the manifestation <b>of</b> <b>recessions,</b> such as hypersensitivity. Results and discussion: Analysis and correlation of data showed that the most important role in the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> was played by the local factors, which intensi‐ fied the action of the determining element, the bacterial plaque. Thus, the nature <b>of</b> periodontal <b>recessions</b> is <b>of</b> inflammatory type, those with traumatic causes being sta‐ tistically non‐significant. The type of periodontium influ‐ enced the development <b>of</b> <b>recessions,</b> so that, for a delicate periodontium, 10. 4 recessions/patient have been discove‐ red, while, in a thick periodontium, only 7 recessions/ patient. In cases of phrenectomies with insertion in the vicinity of the gingival margin, <b>recessions</b> <b>of</b> various sizes have been always present. In cases of dental occlusion, the obtained data suggest that the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> is not considerably influenced by the type of occlusion, the values being quite close. As to their sizes, most of the reces‐ sions were situated at a level of 2 ‐ 3 mm, a significant decre‐ ase being observed at levels exceeding 4 or 5 mm. A complication accompanying recessions in 39. 96 % of the affected teeth was hypersensitivity. Conclusions. Recessi‐ ons represent a complex pathology, with multiple etiology, sometimes difficult to identify, with special implications in the establishment of a therapeutical plan. Monitoriza‐ tion of the young adult, alongwith a precocious identifica‐ tion of the lesions and of their etiology may be therefore a starting point for the preservation of a healthy periodontal status...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> and booms on firm performance. We look at 70, 000 firms in over 100 countries between 1986 and 2014 and document the trends in firm entry over the business cycle. Our paper confirms some standard facts about firm dynamics: employment growth is decreasing with size and age; entry rate is pro-cyclical while the exit rate is countercyclical. For example, {{in case of}} advanced economies, 97 per cent of employment creation is by firms {{between the ages of}} 0 and 5 years, while for developing and emerging economies, it is 86 per cent of all employment. Our main results are: first, we do see selection effects <b>of</b> <b>recessions,</b> particularly when we look at employment, sales and capital. Specifically, when a firm enters the market during good times, they tend to have lower employment and capital than firms that enter the market during bad times. Second, when we look at total factor productivity (TFP), we don't see a clear "cleansing effect" <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> - more productive firms entering the market while less productive leaving. Third, the effects of entering during a boom or a recession tend to persist for a long time, over 15 years. Fourth, we find notable differences between income groups - while recessions tend to create stronger firms in the advanced economies, booms tend to create stronger ones in case of the emerging economies. Lastly, the effects <b>of</b> <b>recessions</b> on firms tend to vary by sector...|$|R
