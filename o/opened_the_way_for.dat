5|$|During the Macedonian dynasty (10th–11th centuries), the Empire again {{expanded}} and experienced the two-century long Macedonian Renaissance, {{which came to}} an end with the loss of much of Asia Minor to the Seljuk Turks after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.

5|$|Despite being outnumbered {{and poorly}} equipped, certain Bulgarian units offered fierce resistance, delaying the Entente advance in Zborsko. However, the {{collapse}} of the front line enabled the Allies to assault Bulgarian positions from multiple directions and eventually quell the last pockets of resistance. The Central Powers' defeat at the Dobro Pole {{played a role in the}} Bulgarian withdrawal from the war and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the subsequent capture of Vardar Macedonia.|$|E

5|$|Duyệt's death <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Minh Mạng {{to apply}} his {{policies}} in the south, as the viceroy's subordinates lacked the influence to defy the court. The emperor also tried to reduce Duyệt's followers’ political power by abolishing the post of viceroy and putting the south under his direct rule, thus making Duyệt the last holder of the post. Soon after Duyệt's death, Minh Mạng's new appointees arrived and took over the local administration. The new officials then launched an investigation and reported that Duyệt and his aides had engaged in corrupt and abusive practices.|$|E
5|$|In May 1868, the daimyō of Nagaoka inflicted high {{losses on}} the Imperial {{troops in the}} Battle of Hokuetsu, but his castle {{ultimately}} fell on May 19.

5|$|The Byzantine Empire's {{military}} {{position in}} the Balkans collapsed in the early 7th century {{as a result of}} disastrous military ventures against the Persians and then the Arabs in the East, which forced the effective abandonment of the Danube limes and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> large-scale penetration and settlement of the Balkan hinterland by various Slavic tribes. The Slavs raided as far as southern Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Most of the region's cities were sacked or abandoned and only a few, including Thessalonica, remained occupied and in imperial hands.|$|E
5|$|The numerically {{superior}} Byzantine {{army was}} initially successful, but when Theophilos resolved to lead an attack in person, his absence from his usual post caused panic among the Byzantine troops, who feared {{that he had}} been killed. Coupled with a fierce counterattack by Afshin's Turkish horse-archers, the Byzantine army broke and fled. Theophilos and his guard were besieged for a while in a hill, before making good their escape. The defeat <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the brutal sack of Amorion a few weeks later, {{one of the most serious}} blows Byzantium suffered in the centuries-long Arab–Byzantine Wars.|$|E
5|$|From the 1550s, in {{the reign}} of Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1542–67) and the {{minority}} of her son James VI (r. 1567–1625), cultural pursuits were limited {{by the lack of}} a royal court and by political turmoil. The Kirk, heavily influenced by Calvinism, also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless, poets from this period included Richard Maitland of Lethington (1496–1586), who produced meditative and satirical verses in the style of Dunbar; John Rolland (fl. 1530–75), who wrote allegorical satires in the tradition of Douglas and courtier and minister Alexander Hume (c. 1556–1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse. Alexander Scott's (?1520–82/3) use of short verse designed to be sung to music, <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the Castalian poets of James VI's adult reign.|$|E

5|$|On {{its return}} to England the {{expedition}} was coolly received by London's geographical establishment which was resentful of the pre-emption {{of a role}} they envisaged for their own National Antarctic (Discovery) Expedition. There were also questions about Borchgrevink's leadership qualities, and criticism of the limited amounts of scientific information which the expedition provided. Despite the groundbreaking achievements in Antarctic survival and travel, Borchgrevink was never accorded the heroic status of Scott or Shackleton, and his expedition was soon forgotten in the dramas which surrounded these and other Heroic Age explorers. However, Roald Amundsen, conqueror of the South Pole in 1911, acknowledged that Borchgrevink's expedition had removed the greatest obstacles to Antarctic travel, and had <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> all the expeditions that followed.|$|E
5|$|The 2/3rd Gurkha Rifles {{were then}} ordered {{to renew the}} attack at dusk. Owing to poor light, the {{artillery}} was {{no longer able to}} give much assistance, but nevertheless the Gurkhas quickly retook the hill with a bayonet charge, suffering 50 casualties, and in the process recovering two Lewis guns. The attacking battalion suffered over 400 killed or wounded, while the defending Ottoman 7th Division must have also suffered heavy casualties; 170 dead Ottoman soldiers were found on the battlefield. The fighting here has been described as equal to the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade's encounter at Sausage Ridge on 8 November. The success of these operations north of the Nahr Sukhereir <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the main attacks the following day, on the Ottoman armies' front line positions.|$|E
5|$|Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo, Co., Ltd. {{was heard}} at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge Robert W. Sweet. The trial lasted seven days, during which Universal, {{represented}} by the New York firm Townley & Updike, argued that the name Donkey Kong could be confused with King Kong and that {{the plot of the}} game was an infringement on that of the film. Kirby showed key differences between Donkey Kong and King Kong. He also alleged that Universal had no rights to the King Kong characters and that they had in fact successfully sued RKO Pictures in 1975 in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. RKO General, Inc., wherein they proved that the plot of King Kong was in the public domain and thus <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> Dino De Laurentiis's remake.|$|E

5|$|According to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's {{actions were}} {{motivated}} by several factors, which led him to regard Peter {{as a threat to}} himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, even if it had failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's recognition of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother William VI of Montferrat over Thessalonica <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica—whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus—strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin Principality of Achaea. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} mission of Cardinal Pelagius, the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.|$|E
5|$|Early synth-pop pioneers {{included}} Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox, the Human League and Berlin Blondes; the Human League used monophonic synthesizers {{to produce}} {{music with a}} simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like Japan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Eurythmics. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> synth-pop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development of inexpensive polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI {{and the use of}} dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet) in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September, German General Otto Liman von Sanders, the {{commander}} of the Yildirim Army Group, ordered Samakh's German and Ottoman garrison to prepare a strong rearguard defence of the town. By dawn on 25 September, when a regiment and two squadrons of the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade attacked Samakh, the rearguard was strongly entrenched. The assault, which began with a mounted cavalry charge, ended two hours later after close quarter fighting in the village and the railway station. After fierce fighting with bayonets and swords, from room to room in the railway buildings, the town was captured. This victory, which captured the centre of the rearguard line, concluded the Battle of Sharon section of the Battle of Megiddo and <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the cavalry pursuit to Damascus, which was captured on 1 October. By the time the Armistice of Mudros between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire was signed at the end of October, Aleppo had been captured and fighting was in progress further north.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat of}} the Qarmatians at Hama also <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the Abbasids to recover the provinces of {{southern}} Syria and Egypt, held by the Tulunids. The Tulunid regime had already been weakened by internal strife and the rivalries of the various {{ethnic groups in the}} army, which led to the defection of the commander Badr al-Hammami and other senior officers to the Abbasids; the regime was further weakened by the destructive raids of the Qarmatians and its inability to deal with it. On 24 May 904, Muhammad ibn Sulayman left Baghdad at the head of an army, numbering 10,000 according to al-Tabari, and tasked with recovering southern Syria and Egypt itself from the Tulunids. His campaign was to be assisted from the sea by a fleet from the frontier districts of Cilicia under Damian of Tarsus. Damian led a fleet up the river Nile, raided its coasts, and prevented supplies for the Tulunid forces from being ferried over it.|$|E
5|$|The fungus kingdom {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} diversity of taxa with varied ecologies, life cycle strategies, and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However, {{little is known}} of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species, of which only 120,000 have been described. Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus, Christian Hendrik Persoon, and Elias Magnus Fries, fungi have been classified according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or physiology. Advances in molecular genetics have <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. Phylogenetic studies published {{in the last decade}} have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one subkingdom, seven phyla, and ten subphyla.|$|E
5|$|While the Arab army {{returned}} to its base at Balkh, the Turgesh wintered in Tokharistan, where {{they were joined by}} Harith. The campaign had been a disaster for Asad and his now mainly Syrian army; Muslim control north of the Oxus had collapsed entirely, and while the Arab governor had been able to escape complete destruction, he had suffered considerable casualties. The losses suffered by the Syrians under Asad's command in the 737 campaign in Khuttal were of particularly grave importance in the long term, as the Syrian army was the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Its numerical decline in Khurasan meant that the Khurasan-born Arabs could no longer be completely controlled by force; this <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the appointment of a native Khurasani Arab governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, to succeed Asad, and, eventually, for the outbreak of the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad regime.|$|E
