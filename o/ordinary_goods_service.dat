50|$|Notwithstanding the {{deferral}} of passenger operation, {{an opening}} ceremony {{took place on}} 30 January 1865. An <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> was started on 8 February 1865, and {{it was decided that}} two trains a day would suffice. Messrs Griffiths and Thomas would maintain the line for twelve months, for £500 in cash.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1948 {{the network}} of the Great Western Railway passed into {{national}} ownership, under British Railways. Passenger business on the L&TVJR system was extremely poor, while the parallel bus service operated at a 30 minute frequency. With no prospect of a recovery, the passenger service was withdrawn from 31 March 1952. Porthcawl excursions ran over the line until 1959. In the following years the <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> collapsed also, being discontinued by 1964.|$|E
50|$|However {{the decline}} of <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> and {{a review of the}} need for the Food Buffer Depot {{resulted}} in total closure of the branch line; the last goods train ran on 30 September 1958. The line was totally closed, but an enthusiasts' excursion train organised by the Branch Line Society visited the line on 15 November 1958.|$|R
25|$|When income {{inequality}} is low, aggregate demand will be relatively high, because {{more people who}} want <b>ordinary</b> consumer <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> {{will be able to}} afford them, while the labor force will not be as relatively monopolized by the wealthy.|$|R
5000|$|Asset price {{inflation}} {{is an economic}} phenomenon denoting a rise in price of assets, as opposed to <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> Typical assets are financial instruments such as bonds, shares, and their derivatives, as well as real estate and other capital goods. Although the values of such assets are often casually said to [...] "inflate," [...] {{this should not be}} confused with inflation as a defined term. A more accurate description for an increase in the value of a capital asset is appreciation.|$|R
50|$|Secondly, the Technological Innovation System {{approach}} often {{focuses on}} system dynamics. The focus on entrepreneurial action has encouraged scholars {{to consider a}} Technological Innovation System as something to be built up over time. This was already put forward by Carlsson and Stankiewicz:‘Technological Innovation Systems are {{defined in terms of}} knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> They consist of dynamic knowledge and competence networks. In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass, such networks can be transformed into development blocks, i.e. synergistic clusters of firms and technologies within an industry or a group of industries.’This means that a Technological Innovation System may be analyzed in terms of its system components and/or in terms of its dynamics. Both perspectives will be explained below.|$|R
40|$|The {{threat to}} {{monetary}} policy from the electronic revolution in banking {{is the possibility}} of a decoupling' of the operations of the central bank from markets in which financial claims are created and transacted in ways that, at some operative margin, affect the decisions of households and firms on such matters as how much to spend (and on what), how much (and what) to produce, and what to pay or charge for <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> The object {{of this paper is to}} discuss how this possibility arises and what it implies, to dismiss as unessential to the argument various extreme characterizations that have arisen in the recent debate on this issue (for example, that no one will use money for ordinary economic transactions), and to address the specific arguments on the issue offered by Charles Goodhart, Charles Freedman and Michael Woodford. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} hybrid {{input-output}} model {{to estimate the}} intermediate requirements embodied in the final disposal [...] such as reclamation and incineration - of non-marketable scraps and wastes from industries or households. The model {{is based on a}} mixed technology assumption in order to connect the monetary distribution of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> with the physical distribution of the scraps and wastes as joint-products. Moreover, some demand-pulled invisible multipliers, in terms of the scraps and wastes, have been explored by performing a numerical simulation. From the invisible multipliers, we find the paradoxical phenomenon that the reduction in the amount of final disposal and the promotion of material recycling decreases the intermediate demand of the scraps and wastes for material recycling if there is a time-lag in the introduction of the appropriate recycling technology.

40|$|Albert Breton and Pierre Salmon {{argue that}} the effects of {{constitutional}} rules depend on the nature of political competition and on some meta-rules that contain procedures regulating the application and the modification of constitutional rules. They outline two models of competition - electoral competition and compound government competition - and describe the nature of the transactions between the parties involved in the two corresponding settings. In both, the transactions are over constitutional rules and <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> and <b>services,</b> all of which are arguments in the utility functions of citizens. To make the discussion more concrete, the paper focuses on the demand for political autonomy, a variable which, at the limit, becomes a demand for secession and independence. This allows the specification of some meta-rules applicable to secessionism. In this particular context, it appears that relatively small differences in the content of the meta-rules lead to large differences in equilibrium outcomes. 37 pages, figures, bibliographi...|$|R
40|$|In this Chapter {{the author}} {{addresses}} {{in its entirety}} the challenge of accounting for the communicative/affective side of face-to-face interactions, starting with {{a review of the}} various proposals that economists have advanced for doing this. Then he proposes to view such interactions as ‘encounters’, i. e., as peculiar productive processes in which agents – besides possibly exchanging <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> or delivering <b>services</b> – create and get pleasure (or displeasure) from ‘relational consumption goods’. He stresses the fact that the inputs of these processes include ‘relational capital goods’, i. e., durable relation-specific intangible entities, which in turn accumulate (or decumulate) over successive encounters. After discussing these concepts, he provides examples of how this conceptual framework can be used for getting new insights about various phenomena ranging from migration patterns to financial markets...|$|R
5000|$|Progressive {{taxation}} has {{a direct}} effect on reducing income inequality. This is especially true if taxation is used to fund progressive government spending such as transfer payments and social safety nets. However, the effect may be muted if the higher rates cause increased tax evasion. When income inequality is low, aggregate demand will be relatively high, because more people who want <b>ordinary</b> consumer <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> {{will be able to}} afford them, while the labor force will not be as relatively monopolized by the wealthy. High levels of income inequality can have negative effects on long-term economic growth, employment, and class conflict. [...] Progressive taxation is often suggested as a way to mitigate the societal ills associated with higher income inequality. The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.|$|R

5000|$|Since the {{existence}} of Giffen goods {{outside the realm of}} economic theory is still contested, the pairing of Giffen <b>goods</b> with <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods</b> has gotten less traction in economics textbooks than the pairing normal good/inferior good used to distinguish responses to income changes. The usage of [...] "ordinary good" [...] is still useful since it allows a simple representation of price and income changes.

I proposed and examined a notion of "Lindahl-Hotelling equilibrium" in which individuals were assigned Lindahl prices for the social overhead goods. These Lindahl prices depend on the effects of the social overhead goods on competitive prices for <b>ordinary</b> <b>goods.</b> This allows a nice application of duality and indirect utility functions...|$|R
