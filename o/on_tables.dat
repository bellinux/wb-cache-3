As Homer dances <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> selling items, there is a diversion: the empty {{house across the street}} is being moved into. It is {{occupied}} by former President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara. Bart decides to visit, and Barbara takes a liking to him, but his overall rebellious attitude annoys George. Eventually, after he accidentally shreds George's memoirs, the former President spanks Bart. An outraged Homer confronts George and both men vow to make trouble for each other.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding {{logarithmic}} scale, Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred enhanced it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based <b>on</b> <b>tables.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Korea, peaches {{have been}} {{cultivated}} from ancient times. According to Samguk Sagi, peach trees were planted during the Three Kingdoms of Korea period, and Sallim gyeongje also mentions cultivation skills of peach trees. The peach {{is seen as}} the fruit of happiness, riches, honours and longevity. The rare peach with double seeds is seen as a favorable omen of a mild winter. It is one of the ten immortal plants and animals, so peaches appear in many minhwa (folk paintings). Peaches and peach trees are believed to chase away spirits, so peaches are not placed <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> for jesa (ancestor veneration), unlike other fruits.|$|E
25|$|The French {{also had}} to deal with {{millions}} of civilian refugees fleeing the war in what became known as L'Exode (the Exodus); automobiles and horse-drawn carts carrying possessions clogged roads. As the government had not foreseen such a rapid military collapse, there were few plans to cope. Between six and ten million French fled, sometimes so quickly that they left uneaten meals <b>on</b> <b>tables,</b> even while officials stated that {{there was no need to}} panic and that civilians should stay. The population of Chartres declined from 23,000 to 800 and Lille from 200,000 to 20,000, while cities in the south such as Pau and Bordeaux rapidly grew in size.|$|E

25|$|The Great Pustaha {{is among}} the 150 pustahas kept in the Tropenmuseum. Written by nine generations of datu, the pustaha {{is among the}} oldest pustaha in the world. Reaching the height of 42 centimeters if seated, {{it is also the}} largest pustaha in the world. The Great Pustaha has been on display at the museum almost {{permanently}} from the very beginning. In 1923, before Tropenmuseum was officially opened, visitors could come and see the Anniversary Exhibition for Queen Wilhelmina's 25 years of reign in 1923. While most of the museum was still under construction, objects were displayed <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> in the museum galleries, including the Great Pustaha.|$|E
25|$|Go-go dancers {{perform as}} a dancer to fast, energetic, popular music are {{employed}} to entertain crowds {{in places such as}} bars, nightclubs and discotheques in a sexually exciting manner while wearing very little clothing, often a bikini. Go-go dancing originated in the early 1960s, by some accounts when women at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City began to get up <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> and dance the twist. Other accounts claim that go-go dancing originated at, and was named for, the very popular South L.A. rock club Whiskey A Go Go which opened in January 1964. Many 1960s-era clubgoers wore miniskirts and knee-high, high-heeled boots, which eventually came to be called go-go boots, to night clubs.|$|E
25|$|The {{meeting is}} held at 1 p.m. in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.|$|E

25|$|Paul Poiret had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in modern art {{for the purposes}} of self-promotion and the benefit of his diverse commercial enterprises. In 1911 he rented and restored a mansion built by the architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel for Louis XV, 1750, called Pavillon du Butard in La Celle-Saint-Cloud (not far from Albert Gleizes' studio and close to the Duchamp residence, where the Section d'Or group gathered) and threw lavish parties, including one of the more famous grandes fêtes dated 20 June 1912, La fête de Bacchus (re-creating the Bacchanalia hosted by Louis XIV at Versailles). Guy-Pierre Fauconnet (1882-1920) designed the invitation. Isadora Duncan, wearing a Hellenic evening gown designed by Poiret, danced <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> among 300 guests and 900 bottles of champagne were consumed until the first light of day.|$|E
25|$|The Steppe Military District {{was first}} formed during World War II on 15 April 1943 in {{accordance}} with a Stavka directive of 13 April by the renaming of the Reserve Front, which had been formed from the 41st Army headquarters shortly before. The district served as a strategic reserve for Stavka, and its headquarters was organized <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> of organization and equipment for a field front command. It was initially commanded and organized by Lieutenant General (later Colonel General) Markian Popov. The district headquarters was located near Voronezh in the villages of Somovo, Novaya Usman, Babilovo, Rykan, Khrenovoye, and others at various points in time. It initially included the 24th (redesignated the 4th Guards Army on 16 April), 46th, 47th, 53rd, 66th (redesignated the 5th Guards Army on 5 May), 5th Guards Tank, and 5th Air Armies, as well as separate units completing their formation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the family}} farm was {{suitable}} for raising livestock such as chickens and cattle, the land was not very fertile. Muriel's mother supplemented the family income by taking in summer boarders, while her father sold lightning rods. Muriel attended a local one-room country school until she was seven, then transferred to a larger school {{in the town of}} Magog where she boarded during the week with two siblings and an aunt. In 1917, when she was nine, her father sold the farm and bought a grocery and feed store in Magog. He also sold wood and oil. The next year, her mother opened a tea room and boarding home that catered to summer visitors who came by steamship and rail. As they grew older, Muriel and her two sisters helped their mother with cleaning, cooking, making beds and waiting <b>on</b> <b>tables.</b> Serving the public in the tea room helped Muriel cope with her chronic shyness.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the room has other signs of wealth; the brass chandelier is large and elaborate by contemporary standards, {{and would have been}} very expensive. It would probably have had a mechanism with pulley and chains above, to lower it for managing the candles (possibly omitted from the painting for lack of room). The convex mirror at the back, in a wooden frame with scenes of The Passion painted behind glass, is shown larger than such mirrors could actually be made at this date – another discreet departure from realism by van Eyck. There is also no sign of a fireplace (including in the mirror), nor anywhere obvious to put one. Even the oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may {{have been one of the}} items dealt in by Arnolfini. Further signs of luxury are the elaborate bed-hangings and the carvings on the chair and bench against the back wall (to the right, partly hidden by the bed), also the small Oriental carpet on the floor by the bed; many owners of such expensive objects placed them <b>on</b> <b>tables,</b> as they still do in the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of Mexico, Papantla celebrates Day of the Dead but has some local variations. “Ofrendas” (altars to the dead) {{can be set up}} <b>on</b> <b>tables</b> or on board which are {{suspended}} from the ceiling. The altar is called a pachau and the lack on one in the home can bring on social rejection for violating community norms. These are decorated with palm fronds, bananas, oranges, limes, anis and chocolate figures. Food stuffs include mole, candy, tamales, local breads and other regional specialties. A glass of water and “renio” (a type of local alcohol) are also placed. Day of the Dead celebrations begin on 31 October for those who had died of natural causes. On 1 November, the souls of deceased children (called Laqsq’at’an) are welcomed. Later on 1 November and 2 November the souls of adults are said to return. It is believed that the souls {{come in the form of}} insects to eat the meals laid out in offering. It is also believed that this food needs to be freshly prepared and hot. During the nights, groups of living children go house to house singing traditional songs.|$|E
25|$|Locks can {{be applied}} on {{different}} levels of granularity—on entire tables, pages, or even on a per-row basis <b>on</b> <b>tables.</b> For indexes, it can either be on the entire index or on index leaves. The level of granularity to be used is defined on a per-database basis by the database administrator. While a fine-grained locking system allows more users to use the table or index simultaneously, it requires more resources, so it does not automatically yield higher performance. SQL Server also includes two more lightweight mutual exclusion solutions—latches and spinlocks—which are less robust than locks but are less resource intensive. SQL Server uses them for DMVs and other resources that are usually not busy. SQL Server also monitors all worker threads that acquire locks {{to ensure that they}} do not end up in deadlocks—in case they do, SQL Server takes remedial measures, which in many cases are to kill one of the threads entangled in a deadlock and roll back the transaction it started. To implement locking, SQL Server contains the Lock Manager. The Lock Manager maintains an in-memory table that manages the database objects and locks, if any, on them along with other metadata about the lock. Access to any shared object is mediated by the lock manager, which either grants access to the resource or blocks it.|$|E
