5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance and wit {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an outlet for her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, where batik was {{originally}} imported by Dutch merchants from Indonesia (then the Netherlands East Indies), paste made from starch or mud {{is used as}} a resist instead <b>of</b> <b>wax.</b> The most developed resist-dyeing skills {{are to be found in}} Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths. Two methods of resist are used: adire eleso which involves tied and stitched designs and adire eleko that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the Soninke and Wolof people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.|$|E
30|$|Although {{the total}} amount <b>of</b> <b>waxes</b> in leaves was little difference, changes in {{specific}} components were obvious. Maybe AtOFP 8 only changed the conversion of some certain components in leaves, so {{the total amount}} <b>of</b> <b>waxes</b> in leaves changed little. For example, in the 35 S:HA-AtOFP 8 leaves, alkanes were significantly increased compared with the wild type plants, while primary alcohols were significantly reduced (Fig.  4 c, d). Another reason was the presence of functional redundancy. Loss of AtOFP 8 might induce expression of other genes that had the same function, so the content <b>of</b> epicuticular <b>waxes</b> in the Atofp 8 - 1 did not change significantly.|$|R
30|$|Here, {{we found}} AtOFP 8 maybe involve in {{transcriptional}} regulation <b>of</b> the epicuticular <b>waxes</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana. First, we {{observed that the}} distribution <b>of</b> epicuticular <b>waxes</b> <b>of</b> wild type plants {{was more than that}} of Atofp 8 - 1 deletion mutants, but less than that of 35 S:HA-AtOFP 8 transgenic overexpression lines not only on the leaves but also on the stems utilizing scanning electron microscopes. Second, we extracted waxes from leaves and stems of three types of plants respectively to measure the waxes content and composition by gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS), and the results of the total content <b>of</b> <b>waxes</b> were consistent with the results of scanning electron microscopes. Finally, we found that the expression of 12 genes related to the synthesis and metabolism <b>of</b> <b>waxes</b> was changed in the Atofp 8 - 1 mutants and 35 S:HA-AtOFP 8 transgenic lines compared with wild type plants.|$|R

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E

5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made <b>of</b> <b>wax.</b> The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, the city's Christmas decorations also {{included}} lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle. The 32 six-foot snowflake decorations cost just over $10,800, which were funded {{in part by}} a $6,000 Community Development Block Grant secured by the city. The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear that the Peace Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> candles and greeting cards. The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Pivljanin's tactics {{included}} quick raids {{and destroying}} bridges as he retreated. For example, the stone bridge on the Tara in Šiplje was destroyed after his band had raided Kolašin. In 1664, Pivljanin is {{mentioned as a}} hajduk commander active in the Republic of Ragusa. At the beginning of August 1664, hajduk leaders Stevo and Nikola Popović, Vukosav Puhalović, Pivljanin, Dijete, Čauš, and others, destroyed a merchant caravan {{on the border with}} Ragusa, and took 150 cargoes of very expensive goods; Armenian merchants, to whom the goods belonged, complained to the Doge of Venice. The Venetian government warned the hajduks against further provocations of the Ottomans, fearing new attacks from Sohrab Mehmed Pasha, the sanjak-bey of Herzegovina. In ca. 1665, Pivljanin suffered a great defeat by the Ottomans at the village of Grdijevići, losing most of his band and being forced to leave his home region. One hundred and fifty years later, rebels on the Tara used this event, among others, as justification for a revolt. At the beginning of May 1666, Pivljanin raided a Ragusan ship off the coast of Koločep that was bound for Venice with merchandise, unloading eight wagons <b>of</b> <b>wax</b> and freeing captured merchants, among whom were four Turks, in return for a high payment and a written statement that the wax and money had been given to him voluntarily. The Ragusans claimed {{that at the time of}} the raid, Pivljanin had shouted that the provveditore (district governor) of Venetian Dalmatia had given him the order to take all that he came across, both on the sea and the land. Five days later, Pivljanin raided a large and unusually rich caravan carrying Venetian merchandise through Ottoman territory. In September 1666, Pivljanin and Mato Njegošević attacked an Ottoman caravan in Mosko then retreated to Banjani.|$|E

All <b>of</b> the <b>waxes</b> affect the qualitative {{behavior of the}} photodegradation of I: the formation of photoproducts N-formylpirimicarb (II) and demethylpirimicarb (III) was hindered.
