5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial lobbyist. Over the next dozen years <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> was criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for {{several of the}} causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation, Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon's Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm {{in its attempt to}} take over Portland General Electric, a local utility company. In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed him to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had a sexual relationship with a minor girl 30 years earlier.|$|E

If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He would still have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E

5|$|On one occasion, the two {{scientists}} {{had gone on}} a fossil-collecting expedition to Cope's marl pits in New Jersey, where William Parker Foulke had discovered the holotype specimen of Hadrosaurus foulkii, described by the paleontologist Joseph Leidy (under whom Cope had studied comparative anatomy); {{this was one of}} the first American dinosaur finds, and the pits were still rich with fossils. Though the two parted amicably, Marsh secretly bribed the pit operators to divert future fossil finds to him, instead of Cope. The two began attacking each other in papers and publications, and their personal relations deteriorated. Marsh humiliated Cope by pointing out that his reconstruction of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus was flawed, with the head placed where the tail should have been (<b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> claimed, 20 years later; it was Leidy who published the correction shortly afterwards). Cope, in turn, began collecting in what Marsh considered his private bone-hunting turf in Kansas and Wyoming, further damaging their relationship.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} {{sets the}} tone for Flashman's life. Over the following 60 years <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> is involved in many of the major military conflicts of the 19th century â€” always in spite of his best efforts to evade his duty. He is often selected for especially dangerous jobs because of his heroic reputation. He meets many famous people, and survives some of the worst military disasters (the First Anglo-Afghan War, Charge of the Light Brigade, the Siege of Cawnpore, Battle of the Little Bighorn, Battle of Isandlwana), always coming out with more heroic laurels. The date of his last adventures seems to have been around 1900. He dies in 1915.|$|E
25|$|After Cornell, Harris {{traveled}} back to Logan {{to become}} a professor of agronomy and an agronomist at Utah State Agricultural College. In 1920, Harris was working {{as director of the}} Utah State Agricultural Experiment Station and was also head of the department of zoology and Entomology at Utah State Agricultural College (USAC). Although he held these administrative positions at USAC and was already the president of the American Society of Agronomy, the General Church Board of Education offered Harris the opportunity to take George H. Brimhall's place as president of Brigham Young University. After thinking about his decision for a week <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> accepted the offer on April 22, 1921. He was the first non-polygamous president of Brigham Young University.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} decade <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> {{published}} regularly in the University Review (later known as the Irish University Review), a relationship that culminated in the 1975 special issue. This featured an introduction by Dr. J. C. C. Mays, a selection of translations from the French, the satire Leo and Advent, a meditation on death inspired {{by the death of}} the poet's son in a motorcycle accident. The poem is in seven sections, based, according to Coffey in an interview with Parkman Howe, on the canonical hours of the Catholic Church. Another key work of this period was Death of Hektor, which uses the myth of Troy as a framework for a meditation on war and its victims. The trade editions of Advent and Death of Hektor were both published by the Menard Press. He also edited Devlin's Collected Poems, first for a University Review Devlin special issue and later as a book from Dolmen Press.|$|E

500|$|Troy Middleton was out dove {{hunting with}} his son, Troy Jr., {{and a friend}} on Sunday morning, 7 December 1941. Having had a {{successful}} morning, the trio {{decided to take a}} break for lunch, then come back out and get their bag limits in the afternoon. When they arrived at home for the mid-day meal, Mrs. Middleton greeted them with the news of the attack on Pearl Harbor. This {{put an end to the}} dove hunting, and Troy Middleton began to make plans. [...] The next day he reported to the LSU president announcing his intention to offer his services to the U.S. Army, and he sent a telegram to the War Department announcing his availability for service.

500|$|In the Bloom's Shakespeare Through the Ages {{volume on}} Hamlet, editors Bloom and Foster express a {{conviction}} that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded {{the capacity of the}} Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy: [...] "For once, Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet: it will not stick, and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot, who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> said. Who can believe Eliot, when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure?" [...] The book also notes James Joyce's interpretation, stating that he [...] "did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses, where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare, in this play, with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless, thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet." ...|$|E

500|$|On 16October, {{during the}} Battle of Leipzig, Merveldt's forces were arrayed {{on the right}} flank of the French center, {{commanded}} by Napoleon. [...] On his own right stood Wittgenstein's Corps, and beyond that, Johann von Klenau's. [...] His troops were interspersed among several wooded sections and surrounding several small villages: DÃ¶litz, Mark-Kleeburg and Gautsch. Opposite him were the forces of JÃ³zef Antoni Poniatowski and Pierre Augereau. He rode out to view the battlefield and to direct the disposition of his force. Near DÃ¶litz, which lay close to the French line, he wandered into a troop of Hungarians, <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> thought, but they were actually a mixed group of Saxons and Poles, whom he mistook for Hungarians, and was captured. Most of the action, on the first day, occurred to the north, where BlÃ¼cher's Prussians repelled Michel Ney's cavalry, but when Napoleon heard that Ney and Marmont had been forced back, he sought a cease-fire from the Allied monarchs. [...] He called for Merveldt, and, after a meeting, Merveldt carried Napoleon's proposal to the allied monarchs, which they refused.|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{he needed}} [...] "a period of rest", Ramsey {{returned}} to Ipswich {{to spend time}} with his wife. He became a director of sportswear manufacturer Gola Sports and of a local building firm, but kept {{out of the public eye}} for 18 months <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>He</b> then began watching Ipswich Town, and often acted as a television pundit. Speaking on ITV's On the Ball in February 1976, he was sharply critical of England's performance against the Netherlands, describing the players as [...] "poor individually" [...] and the team as [...] "completely disorganised". Asked if he had any sympathy for his successor, Don Revie, he said that Revie did not want sympathy: [...] "Having accepted the post of England team manager he has to accept the responsibility of his position in exactly the same way as I did." [...] His attitude to the media mellowed. Interviewed in June ahead of a five-a-side tournament between eight of the 1966 World Cup teams for a trophy named in his honour, Ramsey admitted that, having [...] "met so many more people, I know so much more about the world, and I'm so much more relaxed than I was three or four years ago", and said he would consider a return to management.|$|E
500|$|From 2006, {{according}} to Rinder, executives undergoing [...] "group confessions" [...] {{were made to}} stand in big trash cans {{in the middle of}} the floor with signs around their necks on which various derogatory statements were written. Rinder described how it became [...] "relatively routine" [...] for people to be [...] "slapped, punched, kicked, pushed, shoved, thrown up against the wall" [...] in order to make them confess. He told the Tampa Bay Times that he and other people were made to continuously crawl around a conference room table with their trouser legs rolled up, getting kicked from behind if they stopped, which resulted in them suffering severely contused and abraded knees after days of such treatment. There was an escalation in the level of confessions demanded, such that they became [...] "more and more dramatic and over the top in order to be acceptable." [...] He described how one executive was made to sit under an air vent with the cooling system turned up high, while cold water was poured over his head. After an hour <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "shaking so uncontrollably and his lips were so completely blue that he was incapable of talking".

500|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with stage II thymoma in the Season 8 episode [...] "Body and Soul". In {{the end of the}} subsequent episode (in which Wilson and House take an abrupt vacation, and Wilson assumes a much more carefree personality), House performed a CT scan to check the status of the cancer. House's stunned facial expression and silence when the results are displayed seemingly does not bode well for Wilson's future prognosis, which would be revealed in the final two episodes of the series. It is later revealed that Wilson, should he pursue the most extensive treatment, could live for one to three years, perhaps. He opts to cease the intensive chemotherapy treatment after the ultimately unsuccessful first round, choosing {{to make the most of}} the remaining five months <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> would likely have for as long as possible; ultimately, after many tense conversations, House accepts his decision. However, due to the serious vandalism House caused in the toilet system and plumbing, which ultimately destroyed a room containing an MRI scanner (where some of his team members were with a patient), Foreman and the hospital lawyer notify House that the matter became externally known to the police; subsequently, his parole officer had his parole revoked by the court. House must report to prison again to serve the remaining six months of his approximately year-long sentence he got earlier, in the last season, when he ran his car into Cuddy's house. In the series finale, at House's funeral, Wilson gives an honest description of House as opposed to everyone's kind words and gets a text message telling him to [...] "Shut up, you idiot." ...|$|E
