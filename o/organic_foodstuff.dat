40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how an organization which is based on ethic and social responsibility works with segmentation, positioning and brand. Do their specific need of credibility have any impact on how they work with segmentation, positioning and brand? How do they work with credibility? KRAV is an ingredient brand based on ethic and social responsibility, they operate in the Swedish <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuff</b> market offering organic standards, certification and inspections according to these standards and a KRAV-label. In other words, credibility is the base for KRAV’s operations. KRAV is also receiving national grants to finance information material/marketing material. Research questions: How does KRAV work with segmentation, positioning and brand? How does KRAV work with credibility? Method: I have chosen to do this study by studying documents published by KRAV; the main source has been KRAV’s annual reports from 1999 - 2006, the second source has been KRAV’s homepage and the third source has been folders published by KRAV. The analysis was done by combining findings about KRAV with theories about segmentation, positioning, brand and credibility to see how KRAV works with these areas. Result & Conclusions: By summarization, my study shows that KRAV both is adopting and actively working with segmentation, positioning and brand which may be business driven and at the same time trying to tone done the business incentive on how they formulate goals and missions. Marketing theories are getting more and visible over the years. KRAV has formulated its’ vision and mission based on four principals; Good environment, Animal welfare, Good health and Social responsibility but they also include inspected organic products with high credibility and they try to position itself not only as an eco-label but also with added value in the areas of the four principals. Suggestions for future research: One limitation in this study is that I have not studied competitors on the Swedish foodstuff market. Or the actual impact of the fact that KRAV receives national grants, does this disturb the competition? One interesting aspect is if an ingredient brand based on ethic and social responsibility can work with segmentation, positioning and brand without loosing any credibility? May this cause a conflict in the long run? One may also look at the fact that KRAV, by far the dominating label on the Swedish <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuff</b> market, is financing most of its information material/marketing material by national grants. Is it better for the increase of <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuff</b> market to support one large player (KRAV) or should national grants be used to increase knowledge of <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuff</b> and sustainability in general not supporting one specific actor? Which way would maximum the use of the tax money? Or is both needed? Contribution of the thesis: This study has shown that KRAV, which is based on ethics and social responsibility, has adopted theories such as segmentation, positioning and brand...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Organic food is {{perceived}} as being of better quality and healthier than conventional foods although the scientific research on organic foodstuffs is highly contradictory. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate if an intake of carrots from four different cultivation systems grown in two consecutive years would influence various biomarkers of health in a rat model. All rats were fed a diet with 40 % carrot content. The carrots were grown under conventional (C), “minimalistic” organic (O 1), organic (O 2), or “very” organic cultivation systems (O 3). A control group (CO) being fed standard rat chow was included. RESULTS: The plasma α-tocopherol concentration was higher in the O 2 carrot-based diet than in the C carrot based-diet in one year, while all other health biomarker or nutrient content differences were observed between the CO diet and the carrot-based diets. CONCLUSION: This well-controlled field study demonstrated no clear influence of cultivation methods on the quality of carrots or on health-related biomarkers in a sensitive rat model. However, the experimental set up and selected biomarkers could be used as a framework for further studies of health in relation to <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuff...</b>|$|E

Consumers are increasingly gravitating towards purchase behaviour dictated by the quality of the experience in addition {{to the quality of the}} service or goods. While industrial utilisation in the Reykjanes area failed in salt production, the Blue Lagoon spa in the same area, capitalising on the chemical composition of the geothermal waters for pleasure and health, has proven a success story. The number of visitors to the Blue Lagoon has risen sharply in recent years, reaching over 900, 000 in 2015 generating an unprecedented profit (Bláa lónið hagnast um milljarða [...] 2016). The impact of the geothermal utilisation on year-round greenhouse production has been impressive but it goes hand-in-hand with Icelandic producers increasing product development linked with the rising popularity of <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuff.</b> It has more to do with scope than scale. Access to abundant geothermal and unpolluted water as well as the use of state-of-the-art technology is becoming more a question of preferences rather than technological or economic limitations.

40|$|There is an {{ever-increasing}} demand for foods of local origin or cultivated using organic practices. However, the sector is becoming dominated by corporate players {{that might not}} strictly fulfill all the requirements of organic farming, with or without fraud intentions. This places an increased burden on certification bodies and traceability systems on which {{the authenticity of the}} organic products depends. Thus, to ensure the authenticity of foods marketed and labelled as organic, {{there is a need for}} robust, accurate and validated control methods. The objective of the AuthenticFood project is to combine novel analytical techniques to improve the reliability of organic authentication. In this framework, the present work describes the development of analytical methods for the determination of pesticides in food products. The main challenge of this study was to reach the highest sensitivity allowing the detection of very low contaminations, especially for organic products, while keeping a wide range of target molecules. Hence, a priority list of pesticides has been established, based on scientific literature and reports from food agencies, with a special focus on <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuff.</b> On the basis of this list of target pesticides, three complementary analytical methods were developed using Triple-Quadrupole LC-MS/MS (positive and negative modes) and GC-MS/MS. In addition, an extraction protocol, based on the QuEChERS method, has been optimized considering the matrices and pesticides of interest. The final methods allow the detection of ca 150 pesticides at the ppt level and have been applied on a series of organic and conventional food samples. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to enhance}} our {{understanding}} of the organic food supply chain among practitioners, academicians and researchers by underlining the major factors affecting the growth of the organic food business. Previous articles on organic food have been quantitative in nature; therefore, we proposed a qualitative study as a pathfinder for prospective researchers to understand the complex factors involved in the organic food supply chain (OFSC). To do so, this study reviewed eighty-four previous studies on organic foods and proposed a conceptual model for future research; customers' attitudes shall be influenced by sustainability, market deterrents, personal values, demographic and the socioeconomic environment. A customer's attitude has a direct impact on the purchase intention of the OFSC. The study also suggests an investigation of the indirect impact of sustainability, market deterrents, personal values and demographic and the socioeconomic environment on organic purchase intentions. The findings affirmed globally that environment protection, pesticide-free food and animal protection are major sustainability issues. In addition, premium price, insufficient availability and low awareness are the greatest deterrents, considering that personal values such as health benefits, natural contents, superior quality and better taste foster customers to purchase <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuffs.</b> In demographic and socioeconomic environmental contexts, education and income have emerged as major predictors of organic product purchases...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{farming is}} a {{production}} technique that imposes major {{restrictions on the}} use of fertilizers, pesticides, feed additives and veterinary drugs and for this reason consumers perceive organic foods to be healthier. The content of health-promoting molecules such as ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, lycopene and salicylic acid are important aspects of the nutritional quality of organic foods. AIM: To evaluate health promoting substances and the heavy metal content of tomato berries grown using conventional, integrated pest management (IPM) and organic farming techniques. METHODS: Moisture was determined by drying, crude protein by the Kjeldhal method, and ashes by incineration at 550 degrees C. Ergosterol, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, lycopene and salicylic acid were determined by HPLC. The levels of heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. RESULTS: Compared to crops grown using conventional and IPM methods, organic tomatoes contained more salicylic acid but less vitamin C and lycopene. Organic tomatoes had higher Cd and Pb levels but a lower Cu content. Organic fruits had a slightly higher protein content than conventionally cultivated fruits, but the difference was minimal and consequently the nutritive significance was poor. CONCLUSIONS: Farming techniques may {{have an impact on the}} quality of tomatoes. Their higher salicylate content supports the notion that <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> are more wholesome. However, the lower lycopene and ascorbic acid levels of organic tomatoes are not to be regarded as positive. No residues of pesticides and ergosterol were detecte...|$|R

Over 70 types of excitotoxins have been identified so far and many have a free access to our body in form of taste enhancing food additives like monosodium glutamate, aspartame, sodium casienate etc. They have been implicated {{for the development of a}} wide variety of neurological disorders like Alzheimer`s disease, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and even for early ageing. Objective: The purpose of this review is to sort out truth about extent of involvement of excitotoxins in neurodegeneration from the massive propaganda against them wherein they have been implicated in almost all disorders of unknown etiology. Method: A comprehensive search strategy was developed incorporating both the peer reviewed, non peer reviewed literature and electronic databases like Medline. These were scrutinized and relevant research papers were examined. Conclusion : There is considerable evidence based research pertaining to the neurodegenerative effect of excitotoxins to the human brain. Yet the autonomous food regulating bodies like FDA refuse to recognize the immediate and long term danger to the public caused by the use of such excitotoxic food additives.

Scientific research on <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> is contradictory, and knowledge regarding the effect of cultivation system on the nutritive value and the possible relationship with human health could be further explored. Although some systematic differences in the nutritional content, i. e. nitrogen, protein, vitamin C, phosphorous and phenolic compounds of plant products grown under different cultivation systems have been observed, it is a difficult task to prove the claim that organic food improves human well-being or health after consumption. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the research on nutritional quality of food, comparing conventional and organic agriculture; i. e. the nutrient content of plant products and livestock products, digestibility or bioavailability of the nutrients, preference and the potential health effects after consumption. We established a systematic approach for the identification of components and nutrients that can affect human health, and considered different models (animal and human) in which the potential health effects had been tested. In addition, we found it essential to identify suitable health-related biomarkers as measures for nutritive quality. Reviewing the existing scientific literature on potential relationships between agricultural practice and health, nutritional factors such as vitamin E/antioxidant status and the fatty acid composition appear to be interesting in relation to cultivation systems effect on health.

40|$|After the EU {{enlargement}} of May 2004, {{the exchange of}} agro-food goods between the EU 15 and the new member states (NMS) has accelerated considerably. In particular the expansion of Polish exports in 2005 resulted in the highest surplus registered by the NMS 4 (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia) in the past decade. Lower production costs in agriculture, especially for labour, are a fundamental cause of Poland's success to date. Despite remaining net importers, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also slightly improved their position on the EU agro-food markets. Hungary's great ambitions - prior to EU accession - to further expand to EU markets have so far not materialized. The Hungarian setback is rooted in higher production costs, in particular in the livestock sector, and delayed preparations needed to meet European standards. Backed mostly by direct payments and by high EU internal farmgate prices {{for a number of}} products, the economic situation in agriculture in the NMS- 4 has improved substantially after accession to the EU. In the years to come, price competitiveness in the NMS will erode as the slight deterioration in agricultural terms of trade visible in the past decade will continue. With ongoing integration into the EU, labour costs and land prices will be on the rise, while farmgate prices in the EU, under pressure from the WTO, will drop in the long run. Further liberalization of the agro-food markets and rising labour productivity will result in a reduction of agricultural jobs in the EU. Consequently, the production of <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> and other labour-intensive regional specialties may become an increasingly attractive option to survive. The size and structure of farms will vary between countries depending on the different natural and climatic conditions, as well as their previous histories. It can be expected that large market-oriented farms will continue to constitute the majority in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and, to a lesser extent, in Hungary; the significance of smaller market-oriented farms is likely to dwindle. In Poland, this concentration process will ensue at a much slower pace owing to the country's completely different post-war development. Mounting WTO pressure and the growing reluctance of rich EU member states to contribute to the Brussels budget for the development of poorer countries of the Union will lead to a weakening of redistribution processes. As a result, the total amount of money available from Brussels for redistribution under the CAP will be less than today.

40|$|The {{consumption}} of organic foods {{has been increasing}} {{during the last decade}} and organic products are becoming more visible on the market. Consumer perceptions of organic foods being of better quality, more nutritious and healthier are some of the main reasons driving the organic market. Scientific research on <b>organic</b> <b>foodstuffs</b> is very contradictory and conclusive research on possible impact on human and animal health is lacking. The definition of health and potential biomarkers of health is also debated heavily. One aspect {{is the fact that the}} immune system can be modulated by nutrients and that the immunological defense system is imprinted during gestation and the early lifespan. So optimization of plant-derived food by cultivation system could be a very cost effective method or disease prevention, since diet-induced healthimprovements would carry no costs for the health sector. The objective of this PhD thesis is to study if the intake of diets produced of crops from well-controlled field experiments leads to differences in biomarkers characterizing health and well-being using a rat model. Furthermore, the hypothesis that the intake of organically produced diets during pregnancy and lactation/suckling can affect the immunological status and function of both the mothers and the offspring is also investigated. To investigate the potential health effects of eating organic foods, it was decided to follow the whole food chain from field to fork, using a rat model for measuring the potential health benefits. Food products were obtained from continuing field studies and two long-term feeding studies with rats were performed to study the influence of cultivation system, year, and location on the nutritional composition of the crops and healthrelated biomarkers. The results from these two studies are presented in Paper I and Paper II. A single food item, carrots was used in Paper I and it was found that nitrate and protein in carrots was affected by cultivation system, while the measured health biomarkers in rats were not affected. In Paper II complete diets were used and it was found that cultivation system, harvest year and locations had a little impact on the nutritional quality. Besides from plasma IgG levels, none of the measured health biomarkers were affected by cultivation system. Paper III investigated if there was an effect of maternal {{consumption of}} organically or conventionally produced feed on the modulation of immunological tolerance in offspring. The first step was to develop an oral tolerance model (pilot study), which was employed on second generation rats who’s mothers originated from the study described in Paper II. Except from PGE 2, cultivation system had little of rats fed diets of organically versus conventionally grown crops in their response to a novel dietary antigen was observed.

Feeding an increasing world population without compromising the endowment of natural resources or worsening the environmental crisis is, indeed, a major challenge. The need to boost sustainable and productive farming systems and enhance resource efficiency has been acknowledged by European Union policy in its 2020 Strategy. This study assesses the impact of some Italian foodstuffs and agricultural products in terms of material requirement, using the Material Input Per Service unit (MIPS) indicator.

Moreover, a drastic enhancement of material efficiency is achievable using agronomic practices that minimize the employment of external inputs. As a tool for evaluating the environmental sustainability of agricultural products, MIPS allows focusing on a priority policy area, i. e., resource efficiency, which could be easily employed for driving agricultural systems towards a sustainable intensification.

Four samples of juices (one conventional and two organic apple, and one organic pear) contained patulin at concentrations above the limit of 50 μg kg- 1, four at concentrations between 10 and 25 μg kg- 1, and the remaining ones below 10 μg kg- 1. Patulin was detected (< 1 μg kg- 1) in {{only three of the}} 23 fruity baby food samples tested (homogenized fruits, 11 conventional and 12 organic). Based on the available data on Italian intakes of fruit juices, the estimated daily intakes of patulin, were 0. 38 and 1. 57 ng kg- 1 body weight (bw) from conventional and organic products, respectively. Estimated daily intakes of patulin for children were higher, 3. 41 ng kg- 1 bw from conventional and 14. 17 ng kg- 1 bw from organic products, but largely below the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of 400 ng kg- 1 bw. Patulin was also found in two samples of organic apple vinegar (< 5 μg kg- 1) and in fresh apples with rotten spots (12 out of 24 samples) with maximum levels at 16 402 and 44 572 μg kg- 1 for conventional and organic apples, respectively. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The full-value {{experiment}} is questionable in evaluation organic dairying. It is problem to do a trial under comparable conditions for comparison of organic and conventional farming because of legislative reasons and necessity of {{long period of}} such event. Most of comparisons are carried out as practice descriptive observations and any of them {{has been carried out}} about milk production. That is main reason, why the aim of this work is to carry out a opening of monitoring of some production conditions and results of bio-dairying in the Czech Republic (CR). The quality aspects of sources, procedures and products are main topics of solution of projects about organic farming philosophy, in particular in solution of <b>organic</b> dairy <b>foodstuff</b> chain. There were choosen twelve organic dairy farms (survey II, 2006) for more detail research of production conditions according to results of exploratory questionnaire (2006, survey I, n = 85 pieces of questionnaire and 58 organic farms, which practicise dairying) in the CR. The climatology characteristics of selected organic dairy farms were as follows: (I) 562 ± 149 m above sea level on the average (from 270 to 970 m a. s. l.); (II) 571. 0 ± 69. 9 m above sea level, mean year temperature 6. 0 ± 1. 1 ºC and average year rainfall sum 843. 0 ± 184. 3 mm. It is clear according to previously mentioned figures that the organic (ecology) dairy farming is realized mostly in the mountain or sub-mountain areas (less favourable areas, LFAs) as compared to climatic conditions of CR mean profile. The results of investigation of organic farm (E) and breeder conditions and dairy cow health state, reproduction performance and milk quality in organic farms (I data file) as compared to conventional dairy cow herds (K) were: milk yield (E) was 14. 2 ± 3. 4 kg of milk/cow/day on average and 5165 ± 1112 kg/cow/year; E farms have 50...|$|R
40|$|In the {{discussion}} regarding the climate-relevance of foodstuffs, the terms regionalism and non-regionalism are {{often at the}} center of public debate. Hereby the often much higher CO 2 -emissions which are generated in agriculture and its inputs as well as in foodstuff processing are regularly neglected. It is also the case that many CO 2 -balances do not pay due attention – or just do not incorporate - land use change or the climate specific advantages of <b>organic</b> farming. Every <b>foodstuff</b> causes greenhouse gas emissions (CO 2 -eq), during production and processing, which contribute toward global warming. A broad study conducted by FiBL Austria – for the organic brand „Zurück zum Ursprung“of the supermarket chain Hofer/Aldi Süd, investigated the CO 2 -emissions of organic products and compared these with similar conventional products. In this process the value chain, from agriculture - including its inputs (i. e. the production of fertilizer) - to the supermarket shelf, was taken into account. 95 <b>foodstuffs</b> from <b>organic</b> and conventional agriculture respectively, were subject to comprehensive CO 2 -balancing. On the basis of the CO 2 -savings ascertained, a CO 2 -label has been established, which placed on the packaging of every „Zurück zum Ursprung“-product, makes the climate advantages apparent...|$|R
40|$|Contrasted {{results are}} {{obtained}} when comparing contamination levels and frequencies of Fusarium mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol, HT- 2 toxin, T- 2 toxin, 3 -acetyl- DON, zearalenone, fumonisins) {{as well as}} Aspergillus and Penicillium mycotoxins (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A) in cereals and cereal-based products obtained using the organic and conventional route of production. Actually, there is no clear-cut trend in favour of organic cereals or in favour of their conventional counterparts. In contrast to older studies, most of the recent ones lead to the identification of slight {{differences between the two}} types of products. In addition, the high variation in mycotoxin content between the organic and conventional modes of production (even within the same year) makes comparison less obvious and calls for the use of quite powerful statistical tools, a call whic is not always met in the published studies. Hence, the interpretation of results requires a critical approach. The mycotoxin exposure assessment for consumers of organic and conventional cereal-based products is mainly carried out using data gathered from raw cereals. As a consequence the exposure levels are overestimated because cereal processing is not taken into account. Here also {{it was not possible to}} identify a clear trend in favour of either <b>organic</b> or conventional <b>foodstuffs.</b> However, it seems interesting to monitor both production systems because uncontrolled factors can sometimes play an important role and because production techniques and farmers' skills have highly improved...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} method {{based on}} real time PCR {{for the detection}} of the presence of Anisakis spp. and Pseudoterranova spp. parasites in fish fillets and fish- derived food products, such as babyfood, surimi, fish slices, fish sticks and the like, as well as for performing a relative quantification of nematode larvae content, comprises the steps of: - preparing a first amplicon from the ITS-I region specifically able to identify all species belonging to Anisakis and Pseudoterranova species, and a second amplicon able to amplify DNA from any host DNA, such as fish, and from any <b>organic</b> component or <b>foodstuff,</b> said amplicons being located on redundant genomic regions providing more power to detect a PCR product in degraded samples; - testing the primer pairs in the same real time PCR conditions on reference samples made from various mixtures of Anisakid nematodes and fish; - for fish fillets (not products) : quantifying the larval mass in the fish sample by calculation versus a known reference; - for fish fillets and products: calculating the amount of Anisakid DNA versus the amount of total DNA in each sample. A mo lecular method based on real time PCR f or discriminating dif f erent Anis akid species in order to test the geographic provenance of Anisakid-containing f ish, comprises : - aligning the ITS l sequences of dif f erent Anisakid species typical of dif ferent predetermined seas, - designing a real time PCR assay based on detection of sequence variations, - determining whether a fish (and product containing fish) coming from a predetermined sea is contaminated by a given Anisakid species...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite growing {{consumer}} demand for organically produced foods, information {{based on a}} systematic review of their nutritional quality is lacking. Objective: We sought to quantitatively assess the differences in reported nutrient content between organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs. Design: We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and CAB Abstracts {{for a period of}} 50 y from 1 January 1958 to 29 February 2008, contacted subject experts, and hand-searched bib-liographies. We included peer-reviewed articles with English ab-stracts in the analysis if they reported nutrient content comparisons between <b>organic</b> and conventional <b>foodstuffs.</b> Two re-viewers extracted study characteristics, quality, and data. The anal-yses were restricted to the most commonly reported nutrients. Results: From a total of 52, 471 articles, we identified 162 studies (137 crops and 25 livestock products); 55 were of satisfactory qual-ity. In an analysis that included only satisfactory quality studies, conventionally produced crops had a significantly higher content of nitrogen, and organically produced crops had a significantly higher content of phosphorus and higher titratable acidity. No evi-dence of a difference was detected for the remaining 8 of 11 crop nutrient categories analyzed. Analysis of the more limited database on livestock products found no evidence of a difference in nutrient content between organically and conventionally produced livestock products. Conclusions: On the basis of a systematic review of studies of satisfactory quality, {{there is no evidence of}} a difference in nutrient quality between organically and conventionally produced food-stuffs. The small differences in nutrient content detected are bio-logically plausible and mostly relate to differences in production methods. Am J Clin Nutr doi: 10. 3945 /ajcn. 2009. 28041...|$|R
