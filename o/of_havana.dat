5|$|Buena Vista Social Club is an {{ensemble}} of Cuban musicians established in 1996 {{to revive the}} music of pre-revolutionary Cuba.

To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, many {{of which had been}} retired for years.|$|E
5|$|In March 1854, {{the steamer}} Black Warrior {{stopped at the}} Cuban port <b>of</b> <b>Havana</b> on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E

5|$|On May31, Tropical Depression One {{developed}} in the western Caribbean Sea, a day {{before the start of}} the Atlantic hurricane season. The depression moved northeastward, passing just northwest of Isla de la Juventud before striking the Cuban mainland south <b>of</b> <b>Havana.</b> As it crossed the country, its strongest rainfall was east of the center, and the depression failed to intensify beyond winds of 30mph (45km/h). The National Hurricane Center never expected it to strengthen further, due to unfavorable wind shear. After a hurricane hunters flight could not detect a circulation, The depression degenerated into an open trough east of Florida on June2.|$|E
5|$|Oswaldo Payá {{was born}} on 29 February 1952 in Cerro, Havana. The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} a Marist Brothers school in Havana. Payá was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the Cuban Revolution. The school was later closed. In 1969, {{he was sentenced to}} three years of hard labor on Isla de Pinos when he refused to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service. While there, he discovered a locked Catholic church, Nuestra Señora de Dolores, that received permission from the Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Havana</b> to reopen as a mission, giving religious talks and caring for the sick.|$|E
5|$|The former {{hospital}} ship was repurchased by the Ward Line in 1927, who refitted her and placed {{her back in}} service on the Havana route under her original name <b>of</b> <b>Havana.</b> In January 1935, Havana grounded on a reef north of The Bahamas and remained there for three months. After being refloated and repaired, she was placed back in service as SS Yucatán in June. In 1940 the ship was removed from passenger service to be converted into a freighter. After capsizing in port in 1941, the ship was again refloated and renamed SS Agwileon.|$|E

5|$|After passing north <b>of</b> <b>Havana,</b> Cuba, Elena {{emerged into}} the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena {{intensified}} into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents {{through the morning}} of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east {{in response to the}} trough. Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.|$|E
5|$|Amelia and Kanyenke next {{fight the}} Circle at their last stronghold in Cuba, and, after allying with the Spanish colony <b>of</b> <b>Havana</b> and {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} the U.S. Navy, they destroy the Ossuary and the fixed guns guarding it. As the battle is ending, Amelia and Kanyenke pass under an archway in which Beaumont is concealed. Beaumont jumps down and attempts to stab Amelia but Kanyenke pushes her out of the way. All three tumble to the ground. Beaumont charges at Amelia, about to stab her, but when Beaumont gets near, Amelia kicks him and pushes him backwards. He quickly charges at her again, but she grabs her shotgun and shoots him. Amelia later uses the Circle's stored treasure to revive the Falcon Company and succeeds in building railroads to the west coast.|$|E
5|$|At Champotón, {{where the}} {{inhabitants}} had routed Hernández and his men, the fleet {{was approached by}} {{a small number of}} large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach. By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire, sailing as far north as Pánuco River. As the fleet returned to Cuba, the Spanish attacked Champotón to avenge the previous year's defeat of the Spanish expedition led by Hernández. One Spaniard was killed and fifty were wounded in the ensuing battle, including Grijalva. Grijalva put into the port <b>of</b> <b>Havana</b> five months after he had left.|$|E
