With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders to take a stand against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party's increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats' strong monopoly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform.

Neither joined the Communist party after the war; they both came back to the SPD in the early Twenties. From 1915 on theoretical discussions within the SPD were dominated by a group of former anti-revisionist Marxists, who tried to legitimize the support of the First World War by the German SPD group in the Reichstag with Marxist arguments. Instead of the class struggle they proclaimed the struggle of peoples and developed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> later used by Nazi propaganda (“Volksgemeinschaft” etc.). The group was led by Heinrich Cunow, Paul Lensch and Konrad Haenisch (“Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch-Gruppe”) and was close to the Russian-German revolutionary and social scientist Parvus, who gave a public forum to the group with his journal “Die Glocke”. From the teachings of Kurt Schumacher and Professor Johann Plenge, there is a link to the current right-wing “Seeheimer Kreis” within the SPD founded by Annemarie Renger, Schumacher's former secretary.|$|E

According to rhetorical historian William Harpine in his study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> of the 1896 campaign, [...] "Bryan's speech cast a net for the true believers, but only for the true believers."

His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt." [...] Regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric,</b> the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated [...] "you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause".|$|E

The Bay Area Reporter, a local gay weekly newspaper, summarized the intent with their headline, [...] "Pope to Gays: 'Drop Dead' [...] ", and took greatest offense with the Vatican's points that gays cause the violence against them, and that they were primarily responsible for the AIDS crisis.

2500|$|After the {{official}} physical {{boundary between the}} United States and Mexico was set, Mexicans that lived in territory now belonging to the U.S. faced {{a new kind of}} border. This border was much more than simply a line dividing two nations. Although the geographic boundary was permanently set to the south of them, these new Mexican Americans were still seen as foreigners and outcasts in their new country. [...] The rhetoric of dominance used by Euro-Americans prevented Mexican Americans from feeling like true American citizens. [...] The steadfast public opinion of white superiority prevented Mexican Americans from being treated as equals. [...] This racial difference is what caused a new type of border to form between the two groups. [...] This racial border unfairly discriminated against Mexican Americans even though they had the same status as citizens of the United States. [...] Due to the rhetoric of dominance utilized by whites, Mexican Americans were given a much lower social and economic status that they could not overcome. [...] It also caused many Mexican Americans to question their cultural identity. [...] As the border shifted and they became U.S. residents, the culture shifted around them, too. [...] Some homes that used to be on Mexican territory were now on American soil and were surrounded by a new, unfamiliar culture. [...] The decision each individual had to make was whether to embrace their new citizenship and assimilate into American society or hold tight to their culture and continue to self-identify as Mexican. [...] By way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> of dominance, Mexican Americans faced new social, economic, and identity crises in the United States.|$|E

60|$|Arrived in Oakland, {{with his}} snug pay-day in his pocket, {{he took up}} his old room at Bernard Higginbotham's and set to work. He did not even let Ruth know he was back. He would go and see her when he {{finished}} the article on the treasure-hunters. It was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her, because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him. Besides, the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to him. He {{did not know how}} long an article he should write, but he counted the words in a double-page article in the Sunday supplement of the San Francisco Examiner, and guided himself by that. Three days, at white heat, completed his narrative; but when he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read, he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks. He had never thought of such things before; and he promptly set to work writing the article over, referring continually to the pages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rhetoric</b> and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year. When he had copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully, he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners, and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written {{on one side of the}} paper. He had violated the law on both counts. Also, he learned from the item that first-class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column. So, while he copied the manuscript a third time, he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars. The product was always the same, one hundred dollars, and he decided that that was better than seafaring. If it hadn't been for his blunders, he would have finished the article in three days. One hundred dollars in three days! It would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount. A man was a fool to go to sea when he could write, he concluded, though the money in itself meant nothing to him. Its value was in the liberty it would get him, the presentable garments it would buy him, all of which would bring him nearer, swiftly nearer, to the slender, pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration.|$|E

The study was conducted via a questionnaire and carried out among 245 pupils.

We have analysed our results by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cognitive and the socio-cultural perspective. Results show that pupils feel that no phase is given sufficient time and that they believe the three first phases to be higher prioritised than the remaning phases. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> class hours is <b>of</b> importance to <b>the</b> perceived knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canons <b>of</b> <b>Rhetoric,</b> how easy pupils find it creating a presentation, their sense <b>of</b> preparation and <b>the</b> perceived development as a speaker. Regarding response, emendatio, the time for teacher response does not show any significant correlation to pupils’ perceptions of their oral presentation. If peer response is given before presentations, it has a positive effect on pupils’ satisfaction with the presentation, but has otherwise no influence. In addition, teachers’ scaffolding seems to have a larger effect on pupils’ perceptions of their oral presentation than teacher and peer response. Finally, self-assessment occurs to a low extent and is shown to affect <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canons <b>of</b> <b>Rhetoric</b> and how easy it is creating a presentation in a positive manner...|$|R
