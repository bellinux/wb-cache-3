500|$|The {{university}} {{decided that}} it was time to increase the size of the department and hired Dr. George C. McVittie as the next director. After his arrival in the fall of 1952, McVittie began the refurbishment of the Observatory's major instruments. [...] The 12-inch refractor and the 3-inch transit telescope were restored in 1954 by J.W. Fecker Company. He also began expanding the faculty. Dr. Stanley Wyatt joined the faculty in 1953, George Swenson and Ivan King in 1956, Kennth Yoss, John Dickel and James Kaler in 1964 and Edward Olson in 1966. With George Swenson's arrival, Illinois began a program of radio astronomy resulting in the Vermillion River Radio Observatory that opened in 1962. Prairie Observatory was an <b>optical</b> <b>observatory</b> consisting of a 40-inch telescope and was completed in 1967. By the time of Dr. McVittie's retirement in 1971, the one-astronomer department had expanded to nine faculty with research interests in relativity, cosmology, celestial mechanics, perturbation theory, dynamics of star clusters, planetary nebulae, planets, supernovae and radio astronomy.

40|$|We {{highlight}} the operational challenges and planned solutions faced by an <b>optical</b> <b>observatory</b> {{taking advantage of}} the superior astronomical observing potential of the Antarctic plateau.
