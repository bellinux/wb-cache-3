500|$|After {{trying out}} with the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Koufax did {{the same for the}} Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of Sam Narron, the team's bullpen coach. Branch Rickey, then the general manager of the Pirates, told his scout Clyde Sukeforth that Koufax had the [...] "greatest arm [...] ever seen". The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a {{contract}} until after he was already committed to the Dodgers. Dodgers scout Al Campanis heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an Ebbets Field tryout. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, [...] "There are two times in my life the hair <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> has stood up: The first time I saw the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the second time, I saw Sandy Koufax throw a fastball." [...] The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 ($ today) salary, with a $14,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Koufax planned to use the money as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.|$|E
60|$|I {{wandered into}} the dining-room, wedged myself into a screwed chair, and fell asleep, my head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> my arms on the table. And at quarter past seven the steward roused me by shaking my shoulders. It was time to set table.|$|E
60|$|I bowed my head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> for I {{had gone}} through a great deal that day, and this final example of Comyn's {{generosity}} overwhelmed me. Then I felt his hand laid kindly on my shoulder, and I rose up and seized it. His eyes were dim, as were mine.|$|E
60|$|OONA. Rest <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> These are no {{thoughts}} for any Christian ear.|$|R
60|$|I did so, and {{presently}} {{felt the}} weight of Martina swinging <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{was about}} to protest indignantly, but Marian laid her hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
60|$|And {{returning}} to my desk, I laid my head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> nor would I {{speak to him}} for two days afterwards. He pained and chagrined me. His affection had been very sweet and dear--a pleasure new and incomparable: now that this seemed withdrawn, I cared not for his lessons.|$|E
60|$|This {{was more}} than I could endure. The {{coincidence}} was too crushing. I bent down my head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and cried silently, bitterly. I hated Jane in my heart for even suggesting it. Yet I couldn't deny to myself {{for a moment the}} strength and suggestiveness of her half-spoken argument.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did I tell you? What {{do you say}} to the old prophecy now?" [...] he cried, {{dropping}} his hold <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and pacing backward and forward in the room. [...] "Own you were wrong. Own it, as all Naples shall own it, when once I have got him safe in his coffin!" ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{absorbed in}} these speculations, I was {{disturbed}} by a touch <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
60|$|Sergeant Cuff {{stopped short}} in the dark, and laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R

6000|$|He spoke quite naturally, and {{lay down}} again, while I {{returned}} to my charge, thinking that this paroxysm was probably his last. But by another hour I perceived a hopeful change, for the tremor had subsided, the cold dew was gone, his breathing was more regular, and Sleep, the healer, had descended to save or take him gently away. Doctor Franck looked in at midnight, bade me keep all cool and quiet, and not fail to administer a certain draught {{as soon as the}} captain woke. Very much relieved, I laid my head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> uncomfortably folded on the little table, and fancied I was about to perform one of the feats which practice renders possible,--"sleeping with one eye open," [...] as we say: a half-and-half doze, for all senses sleep but that of hearing; the faintest murmur, sigh, or motion will break it, and give one back one's wits much brightened by the permission to [...] "stand at ease." [...] On this night, the experiment was a failure, for previous vigils, confinement, and much care had rendered naps a dangerous indulgence, Having roused half a dozen times in an hour to find all quiet, I dropped my heavy head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and, drowsily resolving to look up again in fifteen minutes, fell fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{night was}} a windy one, and she swung {{backward}} and forward as she went down. By what chance it was I know not--for I had examined the rope and found it secure--but methinks in swaying backward and forward it may have caught a sharp stone, {{maybe it was a}} punishment from Heaven upon me for robbing a father of his child--but suddenly I felt there was no longer a weight <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> A fearful shriek rang through the air, and, looking out, I saw far below a white figure stretched senseless in the mud! ...|$|E
60|$|The insinuating {{softness}} was {{not more}} acceptable than the inquisitorial curiosity. I was silent. He {{came into the}} room, {{sat down on the}} bench about two yards from me, and persevered long, and, for him, patiently, in attempts to draw me into conversation--attempts necessarily unavailing, because I could not talk. At last I entreated to be let alone. In uttering the request, my voice faltered, my head sank <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and the table. I wept bitterly, though quietly. He sat a while longer. I did not look up nor speak, till the closing door and his retreating step {{told me that he was}} gone. These tears proved a relief.|$|E

60|$|Her face {{instantly}} saddened; {{her hand}} trembled as she laid it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> to silence me.|$|R
60|$|I was {{a little}} startled. She laid her hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> and sank her voice to a whisper.|$|R
60|$|What {{on earth}} could it be? I raised myself <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and gazed all round. The crater of Mauna Loa was a queer place indeed {{for even the}} most {{enthusiastic}} sportsman to come shooting in. The only game he could expect to find in such a spot would be surely salamanders. But firing was without doubt going on in the crater, not indeed on the floor on which I myself lay, but strange to say, on the other and still deeper ledges below me. As I strained my ear to listen, I heard frequent reports of pistols, one after another, in all directions down the hollow of the crater.|$|E
6000|$|... "Emerging on the lake, there, {{before my}} eyes, not {{a hundred yards}} away, I saw a man, a large man. He was {{standing}} on an outjutting rock and fishing. I was overcome. I stopped my horse. I tried to call out but could not. I waved my hand. It {{seemed to me that}} the man looked at me, but he did not appear to wave. Then I laid my head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> there in the saddle. I was afraid to look again, for I knew it was an hallucination, and I knew that if I looked the man would be gone. And so precious was the hallucination, that I wanted it to persist yet a little while. I knew, too, that as long as I did not look it would persist.|$|E

Fear and {{trembling}} have taken hold on her, but she trembles only at the pain and death of the body. Breathe upon her thy life-giving Spirit, and put a new fear within her--the fear of her sin. Make her dread to keep the accursed thing within her soul. Make her feel {{the presence of the}} living God, who beholds all the past, to whom the darkness is as noonday; who is waiting now, at the eleventh hour, for her to turn to him, and confess her sin, and cry for mercy--now, before the night of death comes, and the moment of pardon is for ever fled, like yesterday that returneth not.|$|E

60|$|And {{the train}} is going fast--faster than any train I have ever tackled. As the last coach comes by I sprint in the same {{direction}} with it. It is a swift, short sprint. I cannot hope to equal the speed of the train, but I can reduce the difference of our speed to the minimum, and, hence, reduce the shock of impact, when I leap on board. In the fleeting instant of darkness I do not see the iron hand-rail of the last platform; nor is there time for me to locate it. I reach for where I think it ought to be, and at the same instant my feet leave the ground. It is all in the toss. The next moment I may be rolling in the gravel with broken ribs, or arms, or head. But my fingers grip the hand-hold, there is a jerk <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> that slightly pivots my body, and my feet land on the steps with sharp violence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now listen," [...] Felix said, at last, {{after a long}} palaver, {{looking in}} the savage's face with a {{resolute}} air: [...] "Tu-Kila-Kila, we are not afraid of you. We are not afraid of all your people. I went out alone just now to rescue that child, and, as you see, I succeeded in rescuing it. Your people have wounded me--look at the blood <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and chest--but I don't mind for wounds. I mean you to do as I say, and to make your people do so, too. Understand, the nation to which I belong is very powerful. You {{have heard of the}} sailing gods who go over the sea in canoes of fire, as swift as the wind, and whose weapons are hollow tubes, that belch forth great bolts of lightning and thunder? Very well, I am one of them. If ever you harm a hair of our heads, those sailing gods will before long send one of their mighty fire-canoes, and bring to bear upon your island their thunder and lightning, and destroy your huts, and punish you for the wrong you have ventured to do us. So now you know. Remember that you act exactly as I tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{this trial}} was {{finished}} certain priests entered the hall clothed in sable robes, their matted hair hanging down their backs. They were fierce, wild-eyed men of great dignity, and I shivered when I saw them. I noticed also that they alone made small reverence to {{the majesty of}} Montezuma. The counsellors and nobles having fallen back, these priests entered into talk with the emperor, and presently two of them came forward and taking me from {{the custody of the}} guards, led me forward before the throne. Then of a sudden I was commanded to strip myself of my garments, and this I did with no little shame, till I stood naked before them all. Now the priests came forward and examined every part of me closely. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> were the scars left by de Garcia's sword, and on my breast the scarcely healed marks of the puma's teeth and claws. These wounds they scanned, asking how I had come by them. I told them, and thereupon they carried on a discussion among themselves, and out of my hearing, which grew so warm that at length they appealed to the emperor to decide the point. He thought a while, and I heard him say: ...|$|E
60|$|Cavor {{came to my}} {{side and}} laid his hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b> His pale and terrified face was ghastly in the blue light.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Nothing but myself.' Then {{the tears}} came, and {{she laid her}} head clown <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> sobbing,--'Keep me! oh, do keep me safe somewhere!'" ...|$|R
60|$|This was so {{absolutely}} true, that I had no remark to make. She {{came up to}} me, and put {{her hand}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at me}} like that!" [...] she cried, {{as though}} she were in acute pain. [...] "Curse me, or turn your back on me, but don't look that way. Am I a woman to be beaten? If I could show you--here <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and on my back are scars--and it has been more than a year--scars that he made in his brutal rages. A holy nun would have risen and struck the fiend down. Yes, I killed him. The foul and horrible words that he hurled at me that last day are {{repeated}} in my ears every night when I sleep. And then came his blows, and the end of my endurance. I got the poison that afternoon. It was his custom to drink every night in the library before going to bed a hot punch made of rum and wine. Only from my fair hands would he receive it-- because he knew the fumes of spirits always sickened me. That night when the maid brought it to me I sent her downstairs on an errand. Before taking him his drink I went to my little private cabinet and poured into it more than a tea-spoonful of tincture of aconite-- enough to kill three men, so I had learned. I had drawn $6,000 that I had in bank, and with that and a few things in a satchel I left the house without any one seeing me. As I passed the library I heard him stagger up and fall heavily on a couch. I took a night train for New Orleans, and from there I sailed to the Bermudas. I finally cast anchor in La Paz. And now what have you to say? Can you open your mouth?" ...|$|E
60|$|He was a tall, well-made, {{but rather}} fierce-looking gaucho, with keen black eyes, {{and a heavy}} black beard. He seemed {{suspicious}} of me--a very unusual thing in a native's house, and asked me a great many searching questions; and finally, still with some reluctance in his manner, he invited me into the kitchen. There I found a big fire blazing merrily on the raised clay hearth in {{the centre of the}} large room, and seated near it an old grey-haired woman, a middle-aged, tall, dark-skinned dame in a purple dress--my host's wife; a pale, pretty young woman, about sixteen years old, and a little girl. When I sat down my host began once more questioning me; but he apologised for doing so, saying that my arrival on foot seemed a very extraordinary circumstance. I told them how I had lost my horse, saddle, and poncho in the wood, and then related my encounter with the bull. They listened to it all with very grave faces, but I am sure it was as good as a comedy to them. Don Sinforiano Alday--the owner of the place, and my questioner--made me take off my coat to exhibit the bruises the bull's hoofs had inflicted <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and shoulders. He was anxious, even after that, to know something more about me, and so to satisfy him I gave him a brief account of some of my adventures in the country, down to my arrest with Marcos Marcó, and how that plausible gentleman had made his escape from the magistrate's house. That made them all laugh, and the three men I had seen arrive, and who appeared to be casual visitors, became very friendly, frequently passing me the rum-bottle with which they were provided.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Dear Colonel Keith,--I am {{just come}} out of court, and I am to wait at the inn, for Aunt Ailie does not like for me to hear the trial, but she says I may write to you to pass away the time. I am sorry I left my letter out to go this morning, for Aunt Ailie says it is very undutiful to say {{anything}} about the sheep's wool in Russia smelling of tobacco. Conrade says it is all smoking, and that every one does it who has seen the world. Papa never stops smoking but when he is with Aunt Ermine, he sat on the box and did {{it all the way to}} Avoncester, and Mr. Beechum said it was to compose his mind. After we got to Avoncester we had a long, long time to wait, and first one was called, and then another, and then they wanted me. I was not nearly so frightened as I was that time when you sent for me, though there were so many more people; but it was daylight, and the judge looked so kind, and the lawyer spoke so gently to me, and Mr. Maddox did not look horrid like that first time. I think he must be sorry now he has seen how much he has hurt papa. The lawyer asked me all about the noises, and the lions, and the letters of light, just as Mr. Grey did; and they showed me papa's old seal ring, and asked if I knew it, and a seal that was made with the new one that he got when the other was lost! and I knew them because I used to make impressions <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> with them when I was a little girl. There was another lawyer that asked how old I was, and why I had not told before; and I thought he was going to laugh at me for a silly little girl, but the judge would not let him, and said I was a clear-headed little maiden; and Mr. Beechum came with Aunt Ailie, and took me out of court, and told me to choose anything in the whole world he should give me, so I chose the little writing case I am writing with now, and 'The Heroes' besides, so I shall be able to read till the others come back, and we go home.--Your affectionate little friend, ...|$|E
