50|$|The next {{expansion}} of insider trading liability came in SEC vs. Materia 745 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1984), the case which first introduced the misappropriation theory of liability for insider trading. Materia, a financial printing firm proofreader, and clearly not an insider by any definition, {{was found to}} have determined the identity of takeover targets based on proofreading tender <b>offer</b> <b>documents</b> during his employment. After a two-week trial, the district court found him liable for insider trading, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the theft of information from an employer, and the use of that information to purchase or sell securities in another entity, constituted a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities. The misappropriation theory of insider trading was born, and liability further expanded to encompass a larger group of outsiders.|$|E

Although Abundance facilitates a process for Debentures to be bought and sold {{before the end of}} their life, {{there is no guarantee that}} this can be done, or what the value will be. 2015 saw Abundance raise over £2m for its first short-term (one year) Debenture supporting the construction of a wind turbine, which it expects to re-finance with a long-term Debenture.

By integrating two theoretical approaches to entrepreneurship research, the psychology of the entrepreneur and the entrepreneurship process, this paper examines, using content analysis, the language used by new venture founders in documents directly linked to their capital raising activity. The study examined the language of 108 <b>offer</b> <b>documents</b> (information memorandum’s) which were divided between 54 new ventures that were successful in raising capital and 54 new ventures that either did not proceed further or were not successful in raising capital through the Australian Small Scale Offerings Board.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an architecture which applies document similarity measures to the documentation produced during the phases of software development {{in order to}} generate recommendations of process and people metrics for similar projects. The application makes a judgment of similarity of the Service Provision <b>Offer</b> (SPO) <b>document</b> of a new proposed project to a collection of Project History Documents (PHD), stored in a repository of unstructured texts. The process is carried out in three stages: firstly, clustering of the <b>Offer</b> <b>document</b> with the set of PHDs which are most similar to it; this provides the initial indication of whether similar previous projects exist, and signifies similarity. Secondly, determination of which PHD in the set is most comparable with the <b>Offer</b> <b>document,</b> based on various parameters: project effort, project duration (time), project resources (members/size of team), costs, and sector(s) involved, indicating comparability of projects. The comparable parameters are extracted using the GATE Natural Language Processing architecture.

Any trade-off between auditor choice with either firm risk or retained ownership is confined to smaller IPOs and/or those using less prestigious underwriters, which are also those where support for the signaling role of auditors (and voluntary disclosure) is evident using a valuation model. Our results highlight the failure of “stylised” signaling models such as [Datar et al.
