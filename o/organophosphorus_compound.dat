The gene involved in the reduction of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> was cloned from this strain by the shotgun technique, and the deduced protein (named AKR 5 F 1) showed homology {{to members of the}} aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. The intact coding region for AKR 5 F 1 was subcloned into vector pET 28 a and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). Recombinant His 6 -tagged AKR 5 F 1 was purified in one step using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography.

A number of 107692 significantly different MDF members enter into a multiple linear regression analysis. A pair of descriptors (lGDmSMt, lAmrfEt), which have the best performing ability in prediction of molar refraction of cyclic <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>compounds,</b> was found and a bi-varied MDF SAR model was built. After performing leave-oneout cross-validation, satisfactory result was obtained with cross-validation r 2 cv and r 2 values of 0. 9999 and 0. 9999. The external validation of the bi-varied MDF SAR model and its ability in prediction of molar refraction of cyclic <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> is demonstrated by the results obtained in training vs. test experiment.

40|$|Title: Preparation of {{modulators}} of cholinesterases and cholinergic receptors Author: Jan Röder <b>Organophosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are widely}} used as pesticides and were also misused as chemical warfare agents. Up to date, the pre-exposure treatment of <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> intoxication consists in use of carbamate cholinesterase inhibitors. Carbamates act as reversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and thus protect it against irreversible inhibition with <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>compounds.</b> However, carbamates showed severe undesirable effects caused by carbamylation of AChE, and therefore there is trend to find novel compounds, which could more effectively act as protection against intoxication with <b>organophosphorus</b> <b>compounds.</b> Twenty modulators of cholinesterases and cholinergic receptors were prepared in this project. These compounds showed promising inhibition ability during in vitro testing and four of them were chosen for further molecular modelling studies. The former studies of AChE and its receptors features were also taken into account. The properties of newly prepared compounds were discussed. Based on promising results after in vitro evaluation, several compounds were recommended for further in vivo studies {{in order to prove}} or disprove their effectiveness in pre-exposure treatment with [...] ...|$|R
