5|$|This {{change was}} not welcomed {{by many people}} in Germany, who saw this new flag as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> {{following}} Germany's defeat in the First World War. In the , the old colours continued {{to be used in}} various forms. Many conservatives wanted the old colours to return, while monarchists and the far right were far more vocal with their objections, referring to the new flag with various derogatory names (see Colour above). As a compromise, the old black-white-red flag was reintroduced in 1922 to represent German diplomatic missions abroad.|$|E
25|$|For some people, gags have {{connotations of}} {{punishment}} and control, {{and thus can}} be used as a form <b>of</b> <b>humiliation.</b> To some, wearing a gag without restraints is still an act <b>of</b> <b>humiliation,</b> as is an open mouth gag. Some fetishists are sexually aroused by the sound gagged people make when they try to speak, or by seeing a person drool uncontrollably.|$|E

50|$|In Colonial America, common forms <b>of</b> public <b>humiliation</b> {{were the}} stocks and pillory, {{imported}} from Europe.

25|$|In some situations, people's hair is shaved as a {{punishment}} or a form <b>of</b> <b>humiliation.</b> After World War II, head-shaving {{was a common}} punishment in France, the Netherlands, and Norway for women who had collaborated with the Nazis during the occupation, and, in particular, for women who had sexual relations with an occupying soldier.|$|E
25|$|Máscara contra cabellera ("mask versus hair"): a masked wrestler and an unmasked one compete, {{sometimes}} {{after the}} unmasked one {{has lost his}} mask to the masked one in a prior bout. If the masked luchador wins, the unmasked one shaves his head as a sign <b>of</b> <b>humiliation.</b> If the unmasked luchador is the winner, he keeps his hair and the loser is unmasked.|$|E

25|$|He {{helped in}} {{the repeal of}} the Test and Corporation Acts in May 1828. They {{required}} many officials to be communicants in the Anglican Church and penalised both nonconformists and Catholics. They were no longer enforced but were a matter <b>of</b> <b>humiliation.</b> Peel at first opposed the repeal but reversed himself and led the repeal, after consultation with Anglican Church leaders. In future religious issues he {{made it a point to}} consult with church leaders from the major denominations.|$|E
25|$|After the {{formation}} of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese government named the Western nations, led by the United States, as the biggest threat to its national security. Basing this judgment on China's century <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> beginning in the early 19th century, U.S. support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the United States' crusade against Communism. As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the Chinese leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery.|$|E
25|$|Mark Epstein is an American {{psychiatrist}} who practiced Buddhism in Thailand under Ajahn Chah {{and has since}} written several books on psychoanalysis and Buddhism (Thoughts Without a Thinker 1995, Psychotherapy Without the Self, 2008). Epstein relates the Buddhist Four Noble Truths to primary narcissism as described by Donald Winnicott in his theory on the true self and false self. The first truth highlights the inevitability <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> in our lives of our narcissistic self-esteem. The second truth speaks of the primal thirst that makes such humiliation inevitable. The third truth promises release by developing a realistic self-image, and the fourth truth spells out the means of accomplishing that.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the war or soon after, the German Empire, Russian Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire {{ceased to}} exist. National borders were redrawn, with several {{independent}} nations restored or created, and Germany's colonies were parceled out among the victors. During the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the Big Four (Britain, France, the United States and Italy) imposed their terms in a series of treaties. The League of Nations was formed with the aim of preventing any repetition of such a conflict. This effort failed, and economic depression, renewed nationalism, weakened successor states, and feelings <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> (particularly in Germany) eventually contributed to the start of World War II.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the major studio, Nikkatsu took over the sexploitation genre in the early 1970s with its Roman Porno films, a {{distribution}} system for independent pink films had been established, with Ōkura and Shintōhō Eiga controlling most of the venues. Ōkura's production arm was eventually named OP Eiga, while the distribution retained the Ōkura name. Typical of the studio's output in the 1980s, director Kazuhisa Ogawa, with regular star Mayumi Sanjo specialized {{in a series of}} college girl films. This series had Ogawa seeking revenge for rape, but, unlike typical rape and revenge films, the first offense was not entirely unwelcomed, and the resulting revenge tends to be light-weight acts <b>of</b> <b>humiliation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Baumeister (2010) {{found that}} masochistic males {{experienced}} greater: severity of pain, frequency <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> (status-loss, degrading, oral), partner infidelity, active participation by other persons, and cross dressing. Trends {{also suggested that}} male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship should be noted because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister (2010) observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male masochism to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.|$|E
60|$|Adam {{going into}} the garden under these {{conditions}} and penalties, was therein a type <b>of</b> the <b>humiliation</b> <b>of</b> Christ; who at his coming into the world, was made under the law, under its command and penalty, even as other men, but without sin (Gal 4:4,5).|$|R

25|$|Milton {{married in}} Spring 1642, and shortly after, his wife Marie Powell, left him and {{returned}} {{to live with her}} mother. The legal statutes of England did not allow for Milton to apply for a divorce and he resorted to promoting the lawfulness of divorce. Although the laws did not change, he wrote four tracts on the topic of divorce, with The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce as his first tract. The first tract was created during a time <b>of</b> <b>humiliation,</b> and Milton was motivated towards writing on the topic after reading the work of Martin Bucer on divorce. Although {{it is impossible to know}} why exactly Powell separated from Milton, it is possible that Powell's family, a strong royalist family, caused a political difference that was exacerbated by the English Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The Lutheran {{practice}} has varied {{at different times}} and in different countries. Thus, according to the Württemberg Kirchenordnung of 1553, a funeral procession was prescribed, the bier being followed by the congregation singing hymns; the Brandenburg Kirchenordnung (1540) directed a cross-bearer to precede the procession and lighted candles to be carried, and this was prescribed also by the Waldeck Kirchenordnung of 1556. At present funeral processions survive in general only in the country districts; the processional cross or crucifix is still carried. In some provinces also the Lutheran Church has retained the ancient rogation processions in the week before Whitsuntide and, in some cases, {{in the month of}} May or on special occasions (e.g. days <b>of</b> <b>humiliation,</b> Busstage), processions about the fields to ask a blessing on the crops. On these occasions the ancient litanies are still used.|$|E
25|$|Ancient biographies often {{represent}} famous poets {{as going}} into exile to escape their ungrateful fellow citizens. Thus for example Homer {{was said to}} have left Cyme because the government there would not support him at public expense (Vit. Herod. 13-14), Aeschylus left Athens for Sicily because Athenians valued him less than some other poets (Vit. Aesch.), while Euripides fled to Macedonia because <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> by comic poets (Vit. Eur.). Similarly Vitae A and B tell us that Apollonius moved to Rhodes because his work was not well received in Alexandria. According to B, he redrafted the Argonautica in such fine style at Rhodes {{that he was able to}} return to Alexandria in triumph, where he was rewarded with a post in the library and finally a place in the cemetery next to Callimachus. These stories were probably invented to account for the existence of a second edition of Argonautica, indicated by variant readings in ancient manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|Like many spiritually minded Russians, Rasputin {{spoke of}} {{salvation}} as depending {{less on the}} clergy and the church than on seeking the spirit of God within. He also maintained that sin and repentance were interdependent and necessary to salvation. Thus, he claimed that yielding to temptation (and, for him personally, this meant sex and alcohol), even for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>humiliation</b> (so as to dispel the sin of vanity), was needed to proceed to repentance and salvation. Rasputin was deeply opposed to war, both from a moral {{point of view and}} as something which was likely to lead to political catastrophe. During the years of World War I, Rasputin's increasing drunkenness, sexual promiscuity and willingness to accept bribes (in return for helping petitioners who flocked to his apartment), as well as his efforts to have his critics dismissed from their posts, made him appear increasingly cynical. Attaining divine grace through sin seems to {{have been one of the}} central secret doctrines which Rasputin preached to (and practiced with) his inner circle of society ladies.|$|E
