5|$|On July 19, 1848, {{the morning}} of the first day of convention, the {{organizing}} committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked—an overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes.|$|E

The release date and time are an allusion to their 1994 song 6:00, the intro of which contains a repeated sample of the line [...] "Six <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Christmas morning" [...] as spoken by Helena Carroll in The Dead. Dream Theater's July 19, 2012 cover performance of King Crimson's 21st Century Schizoid Man with Crimson Projekct is notably omitted from this release due to copyright concerns.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was about}} four <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> uncommonly hot morning that the bugle sounded in Suakim, and soon the place was alive with men of all arms, devouring a hasty breakfast and {{mustering}} eagerly, for they were elated at the near prospect of having [...] "another slap at Osman!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was nearly}} one <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{intolerable}} day peculiar to the Dakota plain. A frightfully hot, withering, and powerful wind was abroad. The thermometer stood {{nearly a hundred}} in the shade, and the wind, so {{far from being a}} relief, was suffocating because of its heat and the dust it swept along with it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stone is}} {{released}} as the thrower approaches the hog line, {{at which point}} the turn is imparted by a slight clockwise or counter-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o'clock position to the twelve <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> release. <b>A</b> typical rate of turn is about [...] rotations before coming to a rest.|$|R
2500|$|In late December 1891, Warren {{walked out}} of a friend's house in Washington, D.C at 6 <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cold morning without an overcoat. [...] He {{disappeared}} for several days, finally showing up at his parents' house in New York on New Year's Day. [...] Warren's uncle told reporters that his nephew's story {{of what had happened}} over the past days was largely incoherent and that the family attributed his actions to his football injuries. [...] Warren's cousin told The World of New York the following:"In our opinion, he is temporarily out of his mind, and we will not allow anyone to see him. ... We think his mental troubles are caused by three things -- the injuries he received in the Thanksgiving Day football game, his disappointment in losing that game and his being so much behindhand in his college studies. [...] Ever since the game he has had fits of despondency." ...|$|E

6000|$|How {{exquisite}} it was--that {{dress in}} Evelina's shop off Shaftesbury Avenue! It was four <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fine day early in April, and was Fanny {{the one to}} spend four <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fine day indoors? Other girls in that very street sat over ledgers, or drew long threads wearily between silk and gauze; or, festooned with ribbons in Swan and Edgars, rapidly added up pence and farthings {{on the back of}} the bill and twisted the yard and three-quarters in tissue paper and asked [...] "Your pleasure?" [...] of the next comer.|$|E

2500|$|Jon Stewart of The Daily Show—in {{a moment}} of rare straight-faced sincerity—finished his otherwise-typical satirical {{coverage}} of the speech by calmly stating: [...] "And so, at 11 <b>o'clock</b> AM <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Tuesday, a prominent politician spoke to Americans about race {{as though they were}} adults." ...|$|R
60|$|At nine <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> morning, {{the place}} of {{business}} of Pubsey and Co. was not the liveliest object even in Saint Mary Axe--which {{is not a very}} lively spot--with a sobbing gaslight in the counting-house window, and a burglarious stream of fog creeping in to strangle it through the keyhole of the main door. But the light went out, and the main door opened, and Riah came forth with a bag under his arm.|$|R

60|$|Knapwater Park is the picture--at eleven <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> muddy, quiet, hazy, but bright morning--a morning {{without any}} blue sky, {{and without any}} shadows, the earth being enlivened and lit up rather by the spirit of an {{invisible}} sun than by its bodily presence.|$|E
60|$|It {{was four}} <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> August morning. Our little party {{had made the}} {{sleeping}} streets ring with jests and greetings, as it collected on the pier. Some dozen young men and women, {{sons and daughters of}} the wealthier coasting captains and owners of fishing-smacks, chaperoned by our old landlord, whose delicate and gentlemanlike features and figure were strangely at variance with the history of his life,--daring smuggler, daring man-of-war sailor, and then most daring and successful of coastguard-men. After years of fighting and shipwreck and creeping for kegs of brandy; after having seen, too-- sight not to be forgotten--the Walcheren dykes and the Walcheren fever, through weary months of pestilence, he had come back with a little fortune of prize-money to be a village oracle, loving and beloved, as gentle and courteous as if he had never 'stato al inferno,' and looked Death in the face. Heaven bless thee, shrewd loyal heart, a gentleman of God's making, not unrecognized either by many of men's making.|$|R

60|$|At four <b>o'clock,</b> <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> roseate summer's {{morning as}} even made Great Gaunt Street look cheerful, the {{faithful}} Tinker, having wakened her bedfellow, and bid her prepare for departure, unbarred and unbolted {{the great hall}} door (the clanging and clapping whereof startled the sleeping echoes in the street), and taking her way into Oxford Street, summoned a coach from a stand there. It is needless to particularize {{the number of the}} vehicle, or to state that the driver was stationed thus early in the neighbourhood of Swallow Street, in hopes that some young buck, reeling homeward from the tavern, might need the aid of his vehicle, and pay him with the generosity of intoxication.|$|R

60|$|At twelve <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bright {{summer day}} Mr. Brook drove {{up in his}} dog-cart, with two gentlemen, to the Vaughan mine.

60|$|It is four <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> May morning, and Claude and I {{are just}} embarking {{on board a}} Clovelly {{trawling}} skiff, which, having disposed of her fish at various ports along the Channel, is about to run leisurely homewards with an ebb tide, and a soft north-easterly breeze.|$|E
5000|$|The watch {{typically}} {{features a}} pair of pushbuttons at the 2 and 4 o’clock position. The dials for the minute and hour counters are at 9 and 3 o'clock respectively. There is a hand-applied date window at 6 o’clock. The watch also features chamfered square and oblong hours markers (dials with [...] "waffle" [...] type cross-hatched markers are later reproductions). In the original version, the crown {{is located at the}} 9 <b>o'clock</b> position <b>on</b> <b>a</b> square casing. The shape was revolutionary at the time for a chronograph watch.|$|R
5000|$|Activities officially {{begin the}} Thursday of the {{convention}} weekend with a lighting of the campfire and exercise of some hobo cultural traditions (Honoring the Four Winds) before the opening entertainment. On Friday morning many visit the hobo-corner of the cemetery {{to pay tribute to}} those who have [...] "Caught the Westbound," [...] with a hobo memorial service preceded by a local contingent of ex-military colorguard. Names of deceased hobos are recited (Roll Call). At around five <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> Friday afternoon <b>a</b> poetry reading attracts participants and a small crowd of onlookers.|$|R
5|$|About half-past one <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> the morning, <b>an</b> {{explosion}} {{took place}} in Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|R
60|$|But {{at three}} <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chilly morning one's moral {{sensibilities}} are not properly developed.

At three a.m. he will do things that {{at three in the}} afternoon his soul would revolt at.|$|E
60|$|Having {{received}} {{permission to}} stop work at four <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> beautiful summer afternoon, Cicely Drane put away her papers and walked rapidly home. She found her mother on Mrs. Brinkly's front piazza, fanning herself vigorously and watching some children, who, {{on the other}} side of the narrow street, were feeding a tethered goat with clippings from a newspaper.|$|E
6000|$|We {{had been}} out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had {{returned}} about six <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cold, frosty winter's evening.

5000|$|After {{acquiring}} the Movado in 1983, {{the firm was}} renamed the Movado Group.

60|$|At five <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> Sunday evening <b>a</b> {{council of}} war {{was held in}} Lord Howard's cabin, and it was determined, that as it was {{impossible}} to attack the Spanish Fleet where they lay at the edge of shallow water, an attempt must be made to drive them out into the Channel with fireships. Eight of the private vessels were accordingly taken, and such combustibles as could be found -- pitch, tar, old sails, empty casks, and other materials -- were piled into them. At midnight the tide set directly from the English fleet towards the Spaniards, and the fireships, manned by their respective crews, hoisted sail and drove down towards them.|$|R
60|$|We {{performed}} Auld Lang Syne {{the whole}} day; seeing nothing, out of towns and villages, but the track of stoats, hares, and foxes, and sometimes of birds. At nine <b>o'clock</b> at night, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Yorkshire moor, a cheerful burst from our horn, and a welcome sound of talking, with a glimmering and moving about of lanterns, roused {{me from my}} drowsy state. I found {{that we were going}} to change.|$|R
60|$|It {{was eleven}} <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> very hot {{morning when he}} and Macallister lighted a blow-lamp, the flame of which showed faint and blue in the strong sunshine, and they labored on until dusk fell between six and seven in the evening. Offers of food and {{refreshment}} were uncivilly declined, and Watson ignored Grahame's invitation to spend the evening on board.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past {{four o'clock}} (by the {{testimony}} of the land-surveyor, my authority for the particulars of this story, a gentleman with the faintest curve of humour on his lips); it was half-past four <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> May morning in the eighteen forties. A dense white fog hung over the Valley of the Exe, ending against the hills on either side.|$|E
60|$|We were {{to start}} at nine <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> certain night. At a quarter to that hour I went to the stable to see that {{everything}} was ready, and in the courtyard outside of it found Antonio seated against the water tank groaning and writhing with pains in the back. One looked showed {{me that he had}} developed the usual symptoms, so, feeling that no time was to be lost, I saddled the mules myself and took them round.|$|E
40|$|Contextual {{information}} can have <b>a</b> huge impact <b>on</b> our sensory experience. The tilt illusion {{is a classic}} example of contextual influence exerted by <b>an</b> oriented surround <b>on</b> <b>a</b> target’s perceived orientation. Traditionally, the tilt illusion has been described as the outcome of inhibition between cortical neurons with adjacent receptive fields and a similar preference for orientation. An alternative explanation is that tilted contexts could produce a re-calibration of the subjective frame of reference. Although the distinction is subtle, only the latter model makes clear predictions for unoriented stimuli. In the present study, we tested one such prediction by asking four naive subjects to estimate three positions (4, 6, and 8 <b>o’clock)</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> imaginary clock face within a tilted surround. To indicate their estimates, they used either an unoriented dot or a line segment, with one endpoint at fixation in the middle of the surround. The surround’s tilt was randomly chosen from a set of orientations (675 u, 665 u, 655 u, 645 u, 635 u, 625 u, 615 u, 65 u with respect to vertical) across trials. Our results showed systematic biases consistent with the tilt illusion in both conditions. Biases were largest when observers attempted to estimate the 4 and 8 o’clock positions, but there was no significant difference between data gathered with the dot and data gathered with the line segment. A control experiment confirmed that biases were better accounted for by a local coordinate shift than to torsional eye movements induced by the tilted context. This finding supports the idea that tilted contexts distort perceived positions as well as perceived orientations and cannot be readily explained by lateral interactions betwee...|$|R
5000|$|... ‘About five <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> Wednesday afternoon, <b>a</b> {{large body}} of people marched down Meadow-lane road from Holbeck, and {{effected}} an entrance into Messrs. Marshall's mills. They stopped the engines at Messrs. Benyon's mill, and all the hands turned out with apparent universal exultation … they proceeded to the shops of Messrs. Maclea and Marsh, where a number entered by the watch-house door, and opened the large gates. Immediately the yard was filled, the engine stopped, the bell rung, and as the men were turning out, the mob began to leave the yard. At this instant, Mr. Read, chief-constable, rode into the yard amongst them; he was quickly dismounted, but beat off the mob with his stick.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} five <b>o'clock</b> <b>on</b> as dreary <b>an</b> {{afternoon}} as I ever remember, when the slow train, which crawls always at a most miserable pace from Peterborough across the eastern counties, deposited me at Little Drayton. Besides the station-master there were but two people on the wet platform--one a porter, who made for my bags with almost wolflike alacrity after a moment's amazed stare, at me, presumably at the rare advent of a passenger with luggage; {{the other was a}} thin, dark young man, clad in a light mackintosh with very large checks, and smoking a long cigar. Whilst I was collecting my things he came leisurely up and accosted me.|$|R
