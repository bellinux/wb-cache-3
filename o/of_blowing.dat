5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series <b>of</b> <b>blowing</b> trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple flying controls to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat <b>of</b> <b>blowing</b> up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas' {{force of}} 480 {{men had been}} split into four teams, {{ranging in size from}} 60 to 198. On 15 June 1954 these four forces left their bases in Honduras and El Salvador, and {{assembled}} in various towns just outside the Guatemalan border. The largest force was supposed to attack the Atlantic harbor town of Puerto Barrios, while the others attacked the smaller towns of Esquipulas, Jutiapa, and Zacapa, the Guatemalan army's largest frontier post. The invasion plan quickly faced difficulties; the 60-man force was intercepted and jailed by Salvadoran policemen before it got to the border. At 8:20am on 18 June 1954, Castillo Armas led his invading troops over the border. Ten trained saboteurs preceded the invasion, with the aim <b>of</b> <b>blowing</b> up railways and cutting telegraph lines. At about the same time, Castillo Armas' planes flew over a pro-government rally in the capital. Castillo Armas demanded √Årbenz's immediate surrender. The invasion provoked a brief panic in the capital, which quickly decreased as the rebels failed to make any striking moves. Bogged down by supplies and a lack of transportation, Castillo Armas' forces took several days to reach their targets, although their planes blew up a bridge on 19 June.|$|E

As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming <b>of</b> <b>Blowing</b> Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination <b>of</b> <b>blowing</b> and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control the}} player {{character}} Kid Klown as {{he attempts to}} rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans <b>of</b> <b>blowing</b> up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown {{does not make it}} to the bomb in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At the end of each stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending could be of use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player gets all 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage.|$|E

25|$|To {{increase}} the stiffness of the molten glass, {{which in turn}} facilitates the process <b>of</b> <b>blowing,</b> there was a subtle change {{in the composition of}} glass. With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from Sepphoris of Israel, Fischer and McCray postulated that the concentration of natron, which acts as flux in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.|$|E

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{dynamic compaction}} {{test was used}} to study the effects of dynamic impact loads on the shear strength characteristics of loess. Loess specimens were compacted by different numbers <b>of</b> <b>blows</b> and their shear strengths measured. The experimental results revealed that the shear strength varies in stages with the number <b>of</b> <b>blows.</b> During the initial stage, the shear strength increases with the number <b>of</b> <b>blows.</b> It reaches a peak value and then decreases with the number <b>of</b> <b>blows.</b> To reveal the relationship between this alternation in shear strength and microstructural variation, quantitative microstructural analyses were performed on some tested specimens at different stages of strength evolution. This microstructural study demonstrated that the variation of shear strength {{is directly related to the}} alteration of microstructure. It is concluded that the shear strength of loess is basically controlled by its microstructural state. Growing particle size heterogeneity, varying particle orientations and increasing microstructural damage are the main causes of the alternation of shear strength. ¬© 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.
