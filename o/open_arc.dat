5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most <b>open</b> <b>arc</b> welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E

In this paper, we show that every Peano continuum is homotopy equivalent to a reduced form in which the one-dimensional points which are not homotopically fixed form a disjoint union of <b>open</b> <b>arcs.</b> In the case of one-dimensional Peano continua, this presents the space as a compactification of a null sequence of <b>open</b> <b>arcs</b> by the homotopically fixed subspace...|$|R

50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>Arc</b> lamps {{were used}} in the late 19th & early 20th century by many large cities for street lighting.

They were also widely used in film and stage. Arc lamps use high current between two electrodes (typically carbon rods) and require substantial maintenance. Arc lights have mainly been used where high lumen light was needed such as lighthouses. Today very few <b>open</b> <b>arc</b> lights remain in operation, primarily in a few lighthouses and some industrial uses.

These expansions justify the use of Richardson extrapolation for the acceleration of convergence of the method. The results are stated and proven for a single equation, corresponding to the parameterization of a boundary integral equation on a smooth closed curve. As a byproduct we obtain the nodal superconvergence of the scheme. These results are then extended to smooth <b>open</b> <b>arcs</b> and to systems of integral equations.

40|$|An {{outstanding}} {{question about}} the underdoped cuprates concerns {{the true nature of}} their Fermi surface which appears as a set of disconnected arcs.

5000|$|In {{optical sensor}} systems, {{problems}} occur {{due to the}} operation principle through the scattered light of the <b>open</b> <b>arc.</b> Therefore, measuring in the working point directly is in most cases not possible when optical sensors are used, a certain advance/distance must be maintained. Further process trouble stems from weld spatters which may exert a negative influence on the detection results. Screening systems between sensor and torch provide a remedy to a certain extent. The direct observation of the arc with special cameras for process monitoring remain an exception.The running of the sensor {{in front of the}} arc causes the limited accessibility of corners in the parts. In order to reduce this problem, a design/structure which is as compact as possible and a short advance distance are most important. The pre-defined orientation of the sensor is, moreover, restricting the working space of the robot. For untroubled operation of the optical components also stronger soiling/impurification (dust and deposition of weld fume particles) should be avoided, if possible. Exchangeable protective glasses and safety screens in the form of compressed air curtains provide a remedy. The quality of the surface which is to be measured has substantial influence on the measuring result. If the surface is strongly reflecting, unwanted reflection and faulty measurements may occur, lustreless surfaces are less difficult. Ever-changing surface qualities also lead to problems.Since optical systems are equipped with semiconductor detectors and comprehensive electronics, it is most important to pay attention to safe electro-magnetic screening. This applies to the sensor, the image processing unit and the connecting cables thereof. Sensor systems with active laser illumination are reacting particularly sensitive to strong temperature fluctuations since the emitted light wavelength of the used laser diodes depends on the temperature of the laser. If the ambient temperature and thus the wavelength of the active illumination are changing, the light is no longer capable to penetrate through the narrow-band optical filter to the photodetector. Therefore, appropriate screening against the welding process or the cooling of the sensor head is required. Depending on the applied laser power, particular caution must be taken when sensors with active illumination are applied. The wavelength of the applied systems are often in the field of vision, which means the classification into the hazard classes 3A and 3B. The respective accident prevention regulations must be strictly adhered to.The application of optical sensors demands the consideration of following points: ...|$|E

Unlike in the acoustic counterpart of this work, the kernel of the elastic double layer operator includes a periodic Hilbert transform that requires a particular choice of the mixing parameters.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} the topological and {{geometrical}} properties of a polymer ring can be clarified by establishing the entanglement trapped in any portion (arc) of the ring.

The rings have the same length and topological state (a trefoil knot) but have different degree of compactness. The comparison suggests that a novel method, called the minimally-interfering closure, can be profitably used to characterize the arc entanglement in a robust and computationally-efficient way. This closure method is applied to the knot localization problem which is tackled using two different localization schemes based on top-down or bottom-up searches...|$|R
