5|$|Although adult lions have {{no natural}} predators, {{evidence}} suggests that the majority die violently from humans or other lions. Lions often inflict serious injuries <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> either members of different prides encountering each other in territorial disputes, or members of the same pride fighting at a kill. Crippled lions and lion cubs may fall victim to hyenas, leopards, or be trampled by buffalo or elephants, and careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.|$|E

5|$|Fungus-growing ants {{that make}} up the tribe Attini, {{including}} leafcutter ants, cultivate certain species of fungus in the Leucoagaricus or Leucocoprinus genera of the Agaricaceae family. In this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for survival. The ant Allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a three-way association with the host plant, Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations {{came close to}} declaring war <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> {{although}} neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was too weak militarily {{to engage in a}} fight unaided.|$|E
5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E

5|$|For those reasons, Drusus {{was sent}} to Illyricum with proconsular imperium maius, and would be {{governor}} there from AD 17 to 20. Since Germanicus had left the Rhine in AD 16, the German tribes that formerly fought alongside each other against the Romans had turned <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The two major forces in the region, the Marcomanni under king Maroboduus and the Cherusci under Arminius clashed and, after an indecisive battle, Maroboduus withdrew {{to the heart of}} his kingdom in the forests of Bohemia. Before that, two tribes (the Semnones and Langobardi) had defected to Arminius.|$|E
5|$|Greece emerged victorious {{after the}} 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her {{territory}} almost doubled. The unstable international political {{climate of the}} early 20th century placed Greece in a difficult position. The ownership of the Greek occupied eastern Aegean islands was contested by the Ottoman Empire which claimed them as their own. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, was engineering revanchist strategies against Greece and Serbia. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. This caused Germany and Austria-Hungary, and countries allied with Serbia (the Triple Entente) to declare war <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> starting World War I.|$|E
5|$|Hammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty {{king of the}} {{city-state}} of Babylon, and {{inherited the}} power from his father, Sin-Muballit, in c. 1792 BC. Babylon {{was one of the}} many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for control of fertile agricultural land. Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi. The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam, Assyria, Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa for a century or so after its founding. However his father Sin-Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar.|$|E

5|$|Hope, Powell, and Monk were {{considered}} by their contemporaries to be influences <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{early in their}} careers, and all, therefore, helped affect the development of jazz piano. Powell was known for horn-like right-hand playing supported by simple left-hand chords, which was something he had worked on with Hope. Later pianists who have cited Hope as a major influence include Lafayette Gilchrist, Alexander Hawkins, Frank Hewitt, and Hasaan Ibn Ali. Hawkins said in 2013 that Hope was important {{because he had a}} highly individual style but does not have the iconic status of pianists such as Monk. Modern jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel has mentioned Hope's rhythms, phrasing, and compositions as influences.|$|E
5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried a weight of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found a weight of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying a weight of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E

The role of metacognition in small groups seems to be quite clear: ‘it is to structure the cognitive processes and the co-construction of knowledge in the activity between individuals and to monitor and control the learning processes of the individual group members’ (Molenaar et al. 2010, p. 1727).|$|R

5|$|Jacob is {{approached}} by a distressed Michael Newman, the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car. Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army’s chemical warfare division in Saigon. He designed “the Ladder”, a drug that massively increased aggression, taking people straight to their most primal urges. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit – causing them to turn <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in a homicidal frenzy. The revelation causes Jacob to fully remember the moment he was attacked in Vietnam, where it is revealed that a fellow American soldier bayoneted him.|$|E
5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events of Jason Goes to Hell. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often the center of attention among his peers.|$|E

They begin to fall in love and become attached to each other, thanks to the gentle prodding of their respective siblings. After several days, Harishchandra and his family return home to attend their business, which leaves Poonam and Prem the choice to communicate via telephone and letter. Prem joins the family business and takes on a heavy presentation in Japan. Upon returning, the family brings Poonam as a surprise and they celebrate their engagement.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{first met}} Sigmund Freud in 1919 {{when he asked}} Freud for a reading list for a seminar {{concerning}} sexology. It seems they left a strong impression <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Freud allowed him to start meeting with analytic patients in September that year, although Reich was just 22 years old and still an undergraduate, which gave him a small income. He was accepted as a guest member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Association, becoming a regular member in October 1920, and began his own analysis with Isidor Sadger. He lived and worked out of an apartment on Berggasse 7, the street on which Freud lived at no. 19, in the Alsergrund area of Vienna.|$|E

The first comic book release for the franchise was the 1993 Topps Comics adaptation of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film with a few added scenes. Topps Comics published another series in 1995, with Nancy A. Collins writing a three-issue, non‑canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train and eventually meeting Leatherface. The two initially become friends, with Leatherface adopting Jason into the former's family.
