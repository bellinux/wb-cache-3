5|$|Two {{recently}} designed national flags {{resemble the}} Japanese flag. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it adopted a national flag {{that had a}} green background, charged with an <b>off-centered</b> red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh. The current flag, adopted in 1972, dropped the golden map and kept everything else. The Government of Bangladesh officially calls the red disc a circle; the red color symbolizes the blood that was shed to create their country. The island nation of Palau uses a flag of similar design, but the color scheme is completely different. While the Government of Palau does not cite the Japanese flag as an influence on their national flag, Japan did administer Palau from 1914 until 1944. The flag of Palau is an <b>off-centered</b> golden-yellow full moon on a sky blue background. The moon stands for peace and a young nation while the blue background represents Palau's transition to self-government from 1981 to 1994, when it achieved full independence.|$|E
25|$|A {{somewhat}} rare congenital {{disorder of}} the sternum {{sometimes referred to}} as an anatomical variation is a sternal foramen, a single round hole in the sternum that is present from birth and usually is <b>off-centered</b> to the right or left, commonly forming in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th segments of the breastbone body. Congenital sternal foramens can often be mistaken for bullet holes. They are usually without symptoms but can be problematic if acupuncture in the area is intended.|$|E
25|$|Because the départements {{are small}} and numerous, the French {{government}} tried to create wider regions during the 20th century. For the Breton nationalists, it was an occasion to recreate Brittany as a political and administrative entity, but the new region had to be economically efficient. Nantes and its département, Loire-Atlantique, raised concerns because they were <b>off-centered,</b> more integrated with the Loire Valley than with the Breton peninsula. The French government and local politicians also feared that Nantes, because of its population and its former Breton capital status, would have maintained a harmful competition with Rennes to get the regional institutions and investments.|$|E

30|$|For a far <b>off-center</b> dopant, we again find a {{maximization}} (at about η≈ 0. 51) in the excitation rate {{just like}} the near <b>off-center</b> location. However, the extent of excitation is much less than before. At a far <b>off-center</b> dopant location, the dot-impurity overlap gets highly quenched so that the γ oscillation has little impact {{in comparison to the}} near <b>off-center</b> location. Even in the low η regime, where one usually expects the γ oscillation to be significant, we confront a nominal influence of the same, owing to such a depleted dot-impurity overlap. Thus, although we envisage the maximization because of the same reason as given earlier, its intensity is significantly reduced.|$|R
25|$|On September 11, 2001, Islamist terrorists hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 {{and crashed}} {{it into the}} {{northern}} façade of the North Tower at 8:46:40a.m., the aircraft striking between the 93rd and 99th floors. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03:11a.m., a second group crashed the similarly hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower, striking it between the 77th and 85th floors. The damage caused to the North Tower by Flight 11 destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. Flight 175 had a much more <b>off-centered</b> impact compared to Flight 11, and a single stairwell was left intact; however, {{only a few people}} managed to pass through it successfully before the tower collapsed. Although the South Tower was struck lower than the North Tower, thus affecting more floors, a smaller number, fewer than 700, were killed instantly or trapped.|$|E
25|$|The early 20th century saw the {{emergence}} of modern dance in New York, a new, distinctively American art form. Perhaps the best known figure in modern dance, Martha Graham, was a pupil of pioneer Ruth St. Denis. Many of Graham's most popular works were produced in collaboration with New York's leading composers – Appalachian Spring with Aaron Copland, for example. Merce Cunningham, a former ballet student and performer with Martha Graham, presented his first New York solo concert with John Cage in 1944. Influenced by Cage and embracing modernist ideology using postmodern processes, Cunningham introduced chance procedures and pure movement to choreography and Cunningham technique to the cannon of 20th century dance techniques. Cunningham set the seeds for postmodern dance with his non-linear, non-climactic, non-psychological abstract work. In these works each element is {{in and of itself}} expressive, and the observer determines what it communicates. George Balanchine, one of the 20th century's foremost choreographers and the first pioneer of contemporary ballet, formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Balanchine used flexed hands (and occasionally feet), turned-in legs, <b>off-centered</b> positions and non-classical costumes to distance himself from the classical and romantic ballet traditions. Balanchine also brought modern dancers in to dance with his company, the New York City Ballet; one such dancer was Paul Taylor, who in 1959 performed in Balanchine's piece Episodes. Another significant modern choreographer, Twyla Tharp, choreographed Push Comes To Shove for the American Ballet Theatre under Mikhail Baryshnikov's artistic directorship in 1976; in 1986 she created In The Upper Room for her own company. Both these pieces were considered innovative for their use of distinctly modern movements melded with the characteristics of contemporary ballet {{such as the use of}} pointe shoes and classically trained dancers.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} whether coupling between neighboring �-type ganglion cells (�-GCs) in {{the rabbit}} retina underlies their synchronous spike activity. Simultaneous recordings {{were made from}} arrays of �-GCs to determine the synchrony of both spontaneous and light-evoked spike activity. One cell within each array was then injected with the biotinylated tracer Neurobiotin to determine which of the cells were coupled via gap junctions. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that neighboring <b>off-center</b> �-GCs maintain short-latency (� 2. 5 msec) synchronous spiking, whereas the spontaneous spike activities of on-center �-GC neighbors are not correlated. Without exception, those <b>off-center</b> �-GCs showing synchronous spiking {{were found to be}} tracer coupled to both amacrine cells and neighboring <b>off-center</b> �-GCs. In contrast, on-center �-GCs were never tracer coupled. Furthermore, whereas spikes initiated in an <b>off-center</b> �-GC with extrinsic current injection resulted in short-latency synchronized spiking in neighboring <b>off-center</b> �-GCs, this was never seen between on-center �-GCs. These results indicate that electrical coupling via gap junctions underlies the short-latency concerted spike activity of neighboring �-GCs.

The project's developers, Extell and Carlyle, were planning to sell the remaining three building lots to a Boston-based company, General Investment and Development Companies.

The design of the white and red sets are nearly identical, with the team name featured on the front over the number, and the player's last name over {{the number on the}} back and under the Bulls' logo. The shorts have the Bulls logo in a diamond shaped design {{on the sides of the}} legs. The red and white uniforms have remained mostly unchanged since 1966, with minor modifications from <b>off-centered</b> numbers, drop shadows and side stripes to white lettering and [...] "Chicago" [...] wordmark on the road uniforms. The present red/white uniform design was unveiled in the 1985–86 season, first using screen printing (with the player names in block lettering without the additional trim), before returning to the traditional sewing methods (player names are in serifed block lettering and with added trim). The Bulls logo was added atop the player's name in 2004. In the 2014–15 season, a gold tab representing the Bulls' six championships was added on the back hemline, while the NBA logo replaced the Bulls logo atop the player's name.|$|E
