5|$|In general, 20th-century historians from Palestine and the Arab world, and Palestinian and Arab nationalists, communists and leftists <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>stripes,</b> held a {{negative}} {{view of the}} Ottoman era, which they associated with backwardness, corruption and tyranny. According to historian Adel Manna, this uniformly negative perception of the Ottomans and the high regard for Muhammad Ali as a modernizer and a liberator of Arab lands from the Ottomans, which he sought to unite under his rule, influenced the later historiography of the 1834 revolt. Another factor that influenced the historians of the 20th century was the limited availability of primary sources from Palestine {{at the time of}} the revolt. Most primary Arabic accounts of the events were kept by Egypt's bureaucracy at the time. Other accounts were from European travelers or consuls in the area, while there were no known written 19th-century accounts by people living in Palestine's towns and villages.|$|E

25|$|Britain {{entered the}} war to protect Belgium from German aggression, and quickly {{assumed the role of}} {{fighting}} the Germans on the Western Front, and dismantling the overseas German Empire. The romantic notions of warfare that everyone had expected faded as the fighting in France bogged down into trench warfare. Along the Western Front the British and French launched repeated assaults on the German trench lines in 1915–16, which killed and wounded hundreds of thousands, but failed to make gains of even a mile. By 1916, with volunteers falling off, the government imposed conscription in Britain (but was not able to do so in Ireland where nationalists <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>stripes</b> militantly opposed it) in order to keep up the strength of the army. Industry turned out munitions in large quantities, with many women taking factory jobs.

25|$|As in {{many major}} cities, {{immigrants}} to New York often congregate in ethnic enclaves {{where they can}} talk and shop and work with people from their country of origin. Throughout the five boroughs the city is home to many distinct communities of Indians, Irish, Italians, Chinese, Koreans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Caribbeans, Hasidic Jews, Latin Americas, Russians and many others. Many of the largest citywide annual events are parades celebrating the heritage of New York’s ethnic communities. Attendance at the biggest ones by city and state politicians is politically obligatory. These include the St Patrick's Day Parade, probably the top Irish heritage parade in the Americas; the Puerto Rican Day Parade, which often draws up to 3 million spectators; the West Indian Labor Day Parade, among the largest parades in North America and the largest event in New York City; and the Chinese New Year Parade. New Yorkers <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>stripes</b> gather together for these spectacles.

500|$|Unorthodox Jukebox was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 16 reviews. Melissa Maerz from Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A– and stated that [...] " [...] talent for crafting little pop perfections <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>stripes</b> is undeniable", describing the record as a fusion of pop and R Rolling Stone magazine's Jody Rosen awarded Unorthodox Jukebox {{four out of five}} stars, writing that, [...] "The result is a record that makes the competition sound sad and idea-starved by comparison". Dan Hyman from Spin granted the record an 8/10 rating, pointing out that [...] "the bulk of Unorthodox Jukebox benefits from presenting [...] as he truly imagines himself: a big belter with an ear for pop hooks, sure, but one unafraid to dive into murkier waters." [...] Hyman went on feeling that Mars' lyrics [...] "get a desperately needed kick in the pants". Matt Cibula of PopMatters complimented the songs' hooks and found the album [...] "sung and arranged just as perfectly as his earlier work [...] a truly accomplished and slick pop album". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times labelled the songwriting exceptional, while praising Mars for being [...] "a model of concision who always knows where the trigger is, and always, always pulls it".

500|$|This already {{applied at}} the top: the {{constitution}} contained an age-requirement {{for the members}} of the Uitvoerend Bewind, which favored the election of staid Patriot regents, and discriminated against the more talented [...] "young Turks" [...] that were appointed Agents, like Jacobus Spoors, Gerrit Jan Pijman and Isaac Jan Alexander Gogel. The tenor of the Bewind became more conservative in the ensuing years. The agents went to work energetically, however, and started with an onslaught on the old administrative organization of the country, in a deliberate attempt to liquidate the very identity of the old federal structure. The once mighty province of Holland was carved into three pieces: Amstel (Amsterdam and immediate vicinity), Texel (the northern peninsula) and Delf (the southern part); and the other provinces were often merged in larger entities, like Overijssel and Drente into Ouden Yssel, and Frisia and Groningen into the Eems department. The aim was to organize the country into units with equal numbers of primary assemblies (hence the small Amstel department with its large population). The first elections for the administrative organs of these new entities were held in March 1799. But, of course, such a reorganization did not suddenly change the old allegiances of the people living in these areas. In any case, the new local and departmental administrations, though elected, were supposed to execute the policies as centrally laid down by the national government. As the elections often put people in power who represented the old order (like Joan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk in Ouden Yssel) this was exceedingly unlikely. To put it differently, the political effort to attain [...] "national unity" [...] through reconciliation of the diverse Patriot factions <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>stripes,</b> {{got in the way of}} the effort to create an efficient national unitary state, as envisioned by Gogel.|$|E

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the album a [...] "stellar collection", concluding that it is [...] "the kind of compilation that satisfies fans <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>stripes</b> and converts skeptics. It's the greatest-hits package that [...] deserve." [...] Anthony Thornton of NME stated, [...] "Despite being an album packed with as much drama as the band themselves have suffered, it'll be the pop anthems you come back for and fortunately there's enough here to keep even the soap addicts happy." [...] Sara McDonnell of musicOMH wrote that the album's music had [...] "sheer diversity" [...] due to the band's [...] "pick 'n mix approach to musical styles". The high points were [...] "Gwen Stefani's lyrics, which deal principally with {{coming to terms with}} her own femininity" [...] and [...] "the band's collaborations with various hip producers", such as The Neptunes, Nellee Hooper and Sly and Robbie; and the low points were the album's [...] "hotch-potch feel", [...] "random tracklisting" [...] and the [...] "forays into reggae". Ruth Mitchell of the BBC Music viewed the album as a typical Christmas album that was [...] "unlikely to stand out from the crowd" [...] and [...] "too long, [...] tiresome about half way through", although complimenting [...] "Just a Girl", [...] "Hey Baby" [...] and [...] "Underneath It All". However, she also expressed disappointment at the placement of [...] "Don't Speak", [...] "the foursome's most glorious pop moment", {{at the end of the}} album.

[...] "Chavez {{has served as a}} role model for like-minded leaders intent on cementing their power. These presidents are barely in office when they typically convene a constitutional convention to guarantee their reelection," [...] said a 2009 Spiegel International analysis, which noted that one reason to join ALBA was discounted Venezuelan oil. In addition to Chavez and Morales, Carlos Menem of Argentina, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Columbian President Álvaro Uribe had all taken this step, and Washington and the EU were both accusing the Sandanista government in Nicaragua of tampering with election results. Politicians <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>stripes</b> expressed opposition to Zelaya's referendum proposal, and the Attorney-General accused him of violating the constitution. The Honduran Supreme Court agreed, saying that the constitution had put the Supreme Electoral Tribunal in charge of elections and referenda, not the National Statistics Institute, which Zelaya had proposed to have run the count. Whether or not Zelaya's removal from power had constitutional elements, the Honduran constitution explicitly protects all Hondurans from forced expulsion for Honduras.|$|E
