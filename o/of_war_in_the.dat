5|$|The naval {{threat to}} Australia {{increased}} dramatically following the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific.

In response to these attacks the Allies increased the resources allocated to protecting shipping in Australian waters.|$|E
5|$|During 1783, Curtis {{was sent}} to Morocco to renew {{treaties}} with the country and then remained in Gibraltar, accepting the Spanish peace treaty delegates at the war's end. Brilliant was paid off in 1784, although Curtis remained in employment during the peace, commanding HMS Ganges as guardship at Portsmouth. In 1787 he was placed on half-pay, {{although it has been}} speculated that during this period he conducted a secret mission to Scandinavia to ensure British supplies on naval materials from the region in the event <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Spanish armament of 1790, Curtis was briefly made flag captain of HMS Queen Charlotte under Howe, but soon transferred to HMS Brunswick. As captain of Brunswick, Curtis had to deal with an outbreak of a deadly and infectious fever. He was successful in controlling the disease and later published and advisory pamphlet on techniques for other officers to follow when faced with contagion aboard their ships.|$|E

5|$|During the Crimean campaign, Manstein was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} atrocities against the Soviet population, especially those committed by Einsatzgruppe D, {{one of several}} Schutzstaffel (SS) groups that had been tasked with {{the elimination of the}} Jews of Europe. Einsatzgruppe D travelled in the wake of Manstein's 11th Army, and were provided by Manstein's command with vehicles, fuel, and drivers. Military police cordoned off areas where the Einsatzgruppe planned to shoot Jews to prevent anyone from escaping. Captain Ulrich Gunzert, shocked to have witnessed Einsatzgruppe D massacre a group of Jewish women and children, went to Manstein to ask him to do something to stop the killings. Gunzert states that Manstein told him to forget what he had seen and to concentrate on fighting the Red Army. Eleven of the seventeen charges against Manstein at his later war crimes trial were related to Nazi maltreatment and killing of Jews and prisoners <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Crimea.|$|E

Owing to urgent requirements to house other RAAF units and elements of the United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA), No.2 EFTS was disbanded on 31March 1942, and its operations transferred to No.5 Elementary Flying School at Narromine, New South Wales, and No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla, Victoria. By the time it closed, No.2 EFTS had trained 806 EATS students, 610 of whom {{had gone on to}} SFTSs.|$|E
5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

5|$|In late 1941, amidst {{concerns}} <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, {{the unit}} was deployed north to Darwin in the Northern Territory, where they undertook garrison duties {{in the weeks}} following Japan's entry into the war. Following Japanese landings in Malaya, the 2/4th embarked from Darwin and were transferred to Malaya, arriving in Singapore {{in the final days}} of the fighting on the peninsula. In the wake of the withdrawal of British and Commonwealth forces to the island, the battalion was hastily deployed in support of the two Australian brigades—the 22nd and 27th Brigades—in the north-western sector of the island. During the initial Japanese landing, elements of the battalion were heavily engaged around the landing beaches but they were outnumbered and over the course of the week the defenders were pushed back towards the centre of the island, towards the city of Singapore. They suffered heavy casualties during this time, before subsequently becoming prisoners of war after the fall of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In the Ohio River valley, the American Revolutionary War {{was fought}} {{primarily}} between American colonists {{south and west}} of the Ohio River (in present-day Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Kentucky) and American Indians with their British allies north of the river (now the Midwestern United States). From Detroit, the British recruited and supplied Indian war parties to attack American forts and settlements, hoping to divert American military resources from the primary theater <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East as well as keeping the Indians—and the lucrative fur trade—firmly attached to the British Empire. Indians of the Ohio Country, primarily the Shawnee, Mingo, Delaware, and Wyandot, hoped to drive American settlers out of Kentucky and reclaim their hunting grounds, which they had lost in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768) and Lord Dunmore's War (1774).|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1941 the Australian ICorps was {{concentrated}} in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East. Following the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific most elements of the corps, including the 6thand 7thDivisions, returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia. The Australian Government agreed to requests from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9thDivision in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73squadrons. The Government did not intend that the 9thDivision would {{play a major role in}} active fighting, and it was not sent any further reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued {{that they were in}} a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E

5|$|Sun Tzu's historicity is uncertain. Sima Qian {{and other}} {{traditional}} historians placed {{him as a}} minister to King Helü of Wu and dated his lifetime to 544–496 BC. Modern scholars accepting his historicity nonetheless place the existing text of The Art <b>of</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later Warring States period based upon its style of composition and its descriptions of warfare. Traditional accounts state that the general's descendant Sun Bin also wrote a treatise on military tactics, also titled The Art of War. Since both Sun Wu and Sun Bin were referred to as Sun Tzu in classical Chinese texts, some historians believed them identical prior to the rediscovery of Sun Bin's treatise in 1972.|$|E

5|$|When Árbenz {{was sworn}} in as defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo, he became the first to hold the portfolio since it had previously been known as the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>War.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fall of 1947, Árbenz, as defense minister, objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist José Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found Árbenz to be different from the stereotypical Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until Árbenz invited Fortuny to his house for discussions that usually extended for hours. Like Árbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like Árbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence Árbenz in the future.|$|E
