Base on the running status of new energy vehicles during the early stage, this article provides some opinions on problems of using electrically driven compressor, which is mainly stated <b>oil</b> <b>carryover</b> and vibration noise of several kinds of electrically driven compressor and enumerated the partial performance of the compressors. After all, the behavior of compressor will not only directly affect the braking safety performance, but also had a greater influence on the Sequential maintenance costs...|$|E
40|$|Air {{system is}} a system of {{mechanical}} refrigeration in which cold air is compressed, cooled, and permitted to expand and thus acts as the refrigerating agent. International Standards bring technological, economic and social benefits. This article provides {{an introduction to the}} ISO 8573 and ISO 12500 series of International Standardswhich cover compressed air purity and test methods, as well as the purificationequipmentessential to achievethe standards. The amount of water present in a compressed air system is staggering. Combination of a small 2. 8 m 3 /min (100 scfm) compressor and refrigeration dryer, operating for 4000 hours in typical Northern European climatic conditions can produce approximately 10, 000 litres or 2, 200 gallons of liquid condensate per year. If the compressor is oil lubricated with a typical 2 mg/m 3 (2 ppm) <b>oil</b> <b>carryover,</b> then though the resulting condensate would visually resembleoil, oil would in factaccount for less than 0. 1 % of the overall volume and it is this resemblance to oil to which a false association is made. Testing standards are being revised to give the users anunblemished picture of how components will perform. These standards are being written to help users manage their total energy consumption. In order to help users evaluate their compressed air systems, additional standards are about to releaseand these newer standards can have significant impact on plant energy consumption if properly applied...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 223 - 242 The {{hydrodynamic}} {{thrust bearing}} load capacity-speed envelope {{is divided into}} three major regions by speed. Each region has its own set of limiting physical phenomenon that must be included in the analysis and presents a design challenge. For instance, the high speed region has high lubricant shear rates possibly including turbulence that change pad thermal crowning and local babbitt temperature and pressure, thus limiting the bearing performance in terms of load and speed. Various design tools are used to set the bearing geometry such that the phenomenon limits are not exceeded, and an appropriate design safety factor is present. Several applications are presented that illustrate how the various design modifications such as pivot type, pivot radial and circumferential offset, pad spacing, and pad thickness may be varied to design a thrust bearing for a specific region. Three dimensional finite element models for the fluid film generate film thickness, pressure and temperature distributions, which when coupled with a pad finite element model for thermal conduction, convection, thermal deflection, and elastic deflection show thrust bearing pad performance. Turbulence is included along with hot <b>oil</b> <b>carryover</b> from the previous pad. Methods are shown that reduce vibratory motion by using the squeeze film damping attributes of double thrust bearings. The benefits of offset pivot, chrome copper pads, and controlled lubrication in a load-speed region are reviewed so that the user has an appreciation of how each feature is affecting his thrust bearing's performance. Of primary interest {{is an example of a}} high speed application where controlled lubrication increased machine efficiency by minimizing parasitic losses. Three dimensional maps of velocity, fluid mixing, temperature, and viscous heating in the pocket result in two dimensional temperature fields at the pad entrance. Accurate determination of the pad entrance temperature distribution allows for calculation of the pad maximum temperatures or bearing capacity. The examples and results presented will be of use to rotating equipment manufacturers and machinery users in applying thrust bearings to their machines...|$|E
40|$|The liquid {{carried by}} the {{combined}} drain system mainly contains water, heavy liquid hydrocarbons and mixed light end hydrocarbon gas (VOC) /Acid Gas (e. g. H 2 S mixture). The liquid was routed to a small horizontal pressure vessel to flash-off trapped gas and <b>carryover</b> <b>oil</b> is skimmed in an open sump downstream of the vessel. Increased flow rate to the close drain flash system has decreased the retention time and thus results in adequate flashing of lighter hydrocarbons and acid gas from the closed drain influent coming into the old vessel. This has created a potential environment and safety hazard for the people working around that vessel when the flashing of residual hydrocarbon and acid gas occurs in the sump, which is open to atmosphere. The mitigation of the problem involved designing a large horizontal tank with a heating coil and oil separation chamber, which can provide adequate retention time for the VOC/acid gas to flash off from the influent liquid. The oil chamber will collect hydrocarbon-oil after the de-emulsification process. Mechanical agitation, by using the desanding nozzle, prevents accumulation of sand {{at the bottom of}} the vessel. The project aims at the prevention of the <b>carryover</b> <b>oil</b> with outlet water into the biological process reactor downstream of the new tank. The accumulated oil is analyzed. The oil sample contains species similar to light crude oil. Economic analysis is performed to estimate the revenue obtained from the disposal of spent oil to a third party carrier...|$|R
