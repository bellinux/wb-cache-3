60|$|Now {{these things}} are repeating {{themselves}} with an enormous reality in the Irish Revolution. You {{will not be able}} to make a Party System out of the matter. Everybody is in revolt; therefore everybody is telling the truth. The Nationalists will go <b>on</b> caring <b>most</b> for the nation, as Danton and the defenders of the frontier went <b>on</b> caring <b>most</b> for the nation. The priests will go <b>on</b> caring <b>most</b> for religion, as Robespierre went <b>on</b> caring <b>most</b> for religion. The Socialists will go <b>on</b> caring <b>most</b> for the cure of physical suffering, as Marat went <b>on</b> caring <b>most</b> for it. It is out of these real differences that real things can be made, such as the modern French democracy. For by such tenacity everyone sees at last that there is something in the other person's position. And those drilled in party discipline see nothing either past or present. And where there is nothing there is Satan.|$|R
