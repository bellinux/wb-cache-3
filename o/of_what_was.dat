2500|$|Socrates', Plato's and Aristotle's {{ideas about}} truth are {{seen by some}} as {{consistent}} with correspondence theory. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle stated: [...] "To say <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> that it <b>is</b> not, or <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> not that it is, is false, while to say <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> that it <b>is,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> not that it is not, is true".

5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another.

5000|$|Regarding {{the law of}} {{excluded}} middle, Aristotle wrote: But on {{the other}} hand there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate. This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true and the false <b>are.</b> To say <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> that it <b>is</b> not, or <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> not that it is, is false, while to say <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> that it <b>is,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> not that it is not, is true; so that he who says of anything that it is, or that it is not, will say either <b>what</b> <b>is</b> true or <b>what</b> <b>is</b> false Aristotle ...|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in interpretation <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> classed as one.

Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of his illness and quickly seized power, re-establishing themselves as regents and dissolving the Marmouset council.|$|E

40|$|It {{seems to}} be a common and {{intuitively}} plausible assumption that conversational implicatures arise only when one of the so-called conversational maxims is violated at the level <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said. The basic idea behind this thesis is that, unless a maxim is violated at the level <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said, nothing can trigger the search for an implicature. Thus, non-violating implicatures wouldn’t be calculable. This paper defends the view that some conversational implicatures arise even though no conversational maxim is violated at the level <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said...|$|R
