In tropical West Africa, the ant Tetraponera aethiops obligately inhabits the domatia of Barteria fistulosa trees, aggressively {{defending the}} trees from herbivory and pruning off lianas. 2. We compared {{the occurrence of}} ants and lianas on B. fistulosa trees in areas of Gabon, where the invasive little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, was absent (uninfested area) and present (infested area). 3. We found that T. aethiops <b>occurred</b> <b>significantly</b> more often in larger B. fistulosa trees, and that occurrence rates were much higher in the uninfested area versus the infested area: on 5 m trees: 90 % vs. 10 %). 4. In contrast, lianas <b>occurred</b> <b>significantly</b> less often in the uninfested area versus the infested area: on 5 m trees: 10 % vs. 63 %). 5. In the infested area, W. auropunctata <b>occurred</b> <b>significantly</b> less often in larger B. fistulosa trees (on 5 m trees: 90 %). Here T. aethiops and W. auropunctata coexisted on few trees (on 5 m trees: 4 %). 6.

50|$|Configural {{frequency}} analysis (CFA) {{is a method}} of exploratory data analysis, introduced by Gustav A. Lienert in 1969. The goal of a configural {{frequency analysis}} is to detect patterns in the data that <b>occur</b> <b>significantly</b> more (such patterns are called Types) or significantly less often (such patterns are called Antitypes) than expected by chance. Thus, {{the idea of a}} CFA is to provide by the identified types and antitypes some insight into the structure of the data. Types are interpreted as concepts which are constituted by a pattern of variable values. Antitypes are interpreted as patterns of variable values that do in general not occur together.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the factors}} that {{influences}} the latency of N1 is processing effort: N1 increases as effort at processing is also increased. Specifically, latency seems to increase during tasks that are significantly complex or difficult and, thus, require greater active attention or effort. For example, the onset, peak, and offset latencies of the N1 <b>occur</b> <b>significantly</b> earlier in response to moving stimuli in a simple detection task vs. an identification task. N1 is also sensitive to the manipulation of a visual stimulus' intensity. N1's peak latency is shortened as the brightness of stimulus flashes is increased. Therefore, it appears that N1 latency is affected by perceptual factors, such as flash intensity, as well as the level of attentional demand or processing effort.|$|E

5000|$|The vowels of Tampuan show {{a two-way}} {{register}} contrast between lax and modal voicings {{as well as}} length (duration) contrast. As with other Bahnaric languages, tense vowels <b>occur</b> <b>significantly</b> more often than lax vowels. Seventy-five percent of dictionary words use tense vowels. [...] As {{can be seen in}} the chart below, the vowels are unevenly distributed. For example, the short lax close vowels have no tense equivalents. Also, there are more close lax vowels than open. Crowley notes that the tense vowels show a trend toward diphthongization in the close range while in the open vowels, it is the lax sounds that are diphthongs, a pattern well documented in historical stages of Khmer and Brao that indicates the language is possibly in an evolutionary stage of restructuring away from a register language.|$|E
50|$|A TVS diode {{is a type}} of Zener diode, {{also called}} an {{avalanche}} diode or silicon avalanche diode (SAD), which can limit voltage spikes. These components provide the fastest limiting action of protective components (theoretically in picoseconds), but have a relatively low energy absorbing capability. Voltages can be clamped to less than twice the normal operation voltage. If current impulses remain within the device ratings, life expectancy is exceptionally long. If component ratings are exceeded, the diode may fail as a permanent short circuit; in such cases, protection may remain but normal circuit operation is terminated in the case of low-power signal lines. Due to their relatively limited current capacity, TVS diodes are often restricted to circuits with smaller current spikes. TVS diodes are also used where spikes <b>occur</b> <b>significantly</b> more often than once a year, since this component will not degrade when used within its ratings. A unique type of TVS diode (trade names Transzorb or Transil) contains reversed paired series avalanche diodes for bi-polar operation.|$|E
5000|$|Luhn {{proposed}} to assign more weight to sentences {{at the beginning}} of the document or a paragraph.Edmundson stressed the importance of title-words for summarization and was the first to employ stop-lists in order to filter uninformative words of low semantic content (e.g. most grammatical words such as [...] "of", [...] "the", [...] "a"). He also distinguished between bonus words and stigma words, i.e. words that probably occur together with important (e.g. the word form [...] "significant") or unimportant information.His idea of using key-words, i.e. words which <b>occur</b> <b>significantly</b> frequently in the document, is still one of the core heuristics of today's summarizers. With large linguistic corpora available today, the tf-idf value which originated in information retrieval, can be successfully applied to identify the key words of a text: If for example the word [...] "cat" [...] occurs significantly more often in the text to be summarized (TF = [...] "term frequency") than in the corpus (IDF means [...] "inverse document frequency"; here the corpus is meant by [...] "document"), then [...] "cat" [...] is likely to be an important word of the text; the text may in fact be a text about cats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Metastatic {{melanoma}} is {{an aggressive}} form {{of skin cancer}} with a high mortality rate and the fastest growing global incidence rate of all malignancies. The introduction of BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations has yielded significant increases in PFS and OS for melanoma. However, at present, no direct comparisons between different BRAF/MEK combinations have been conducted. In light of this, an indirect treatment comparison was performed between two BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapies for metastatic melanoma, dabrafenib plus trametinib and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, {{in order to understand}} the relative efficacy and toxicity profiles of these therapies. Methods A systematic literature search identified two randomized trials as suitable for indirect comparison: the coBRIM trial of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib versus vemurafenib and the COMBI-v trial of dabrafenib plus trametinib versus vemurafenib. The comparison followed the method of Bucher et al. and analyzed both efficacy (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall response rate [ORR]) and safety outcomes (adverse events [AEs]). Results The indirect comparison revealed similar efficacy outcomes between both therapies, with no statistically significant difference between therapies for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 94, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 68 [*]−[*] 1. 30), PFS (HR 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 79 [*]−[*] 1. 40), or ORR (risk ratio [RR] 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 74 [*]−[*] 1. 10). Dabrafenib plus trametinib differed significantly from vemurafenib plus cobimetinib with regard to the incidence of treatment-related AE (RR 0. 92, 95 % CI 0. 87 [*]−[*] 0. 97), any AE grade ≥ 3 (RR 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 60 [*]−[*] 0. 85) or dose interruption/modification (RR 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 60 [*]−[*] 0. 99). Several categories of AEs <b>occurred</b> <b>significantly</b> more frequently with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, while some <b>occurred</b> <b>significantly</b> more frequently with dabrafenib plus trametinib. For severe AEs (grade 3 or above), four <b>occurred</b> <b>significantly</b> more frequently with vemurafenib plus cobimetinib and no severe AE <b>occurred</b> <b>significantly</b> more frequently with dabrafenib plus trametinib. Conclusions This indirect treatment comparison suggested that dabrafenib plus trametinib had comparable efficacy to vemurafenib plus cobimetinib but was associated with reduced adverse events...|$|R
