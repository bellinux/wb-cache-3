5|$|The United Kingdom's largest <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm (539MW) is at Whitelee in East Renfrewshire. The Clyde Wind Farm is a 548MW {{wind farm}} under {{construction}} near Abington, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, {{which will be}} Europe's largest <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm when completed. Two very large offshore wind turbines (5 MW each) {{are located in the}} Moray Firth. There are many other large <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms including some, both planned and operating, which are in community ownership.|$|E
5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. <b>Onshore</b> <b>wind</b> is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants. Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|An 2012 EU {{study shows}} base cost of <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> power similar to coal, when {{subsidies}} and externalities are disregarded. Wind power {{has some of}} the lowest external costs.|$|E

5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Although the UK Government has set {{a target}} of 10% for the {{proportion}} of the UK's electricity produced by renewable energy by 2010, wind power in the UK {{has a long history of}} controversy, with an average approval rate for planning permission of only 28% for <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. Scout Moor was first identified as an excellent site for a wind farm in 2001. Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002, soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury, Rossendale and Rochdale about wind farms in general and Scout Moor in particular. The results showed that 88% of respondents thought wind farms were a very or fairly good idea, 72% thought the Scout Moor project was a very or fairly good idea, and 63% stated wind power as the preferred energy source.|$|E
5|$|A British Wind Energy Association report {{gives an}} average {{generation}} cost of <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> power of around 3.2 pence (between US 5 and 6 cents) per kW·h (2005). Cost {{per unit of}} energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas: wind cost was estimated at $55.80 per MW·h, coal at $53.10/MW·h and natural gas at $52.50. Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011. In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants; {{it is also expected}} that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future. The presence of wind energy, even when subsidised, can reduce costs for consumers (€5 billion/yr in Germany) by reducing the marginal price, by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants.|$|E
50|$|Increasing maximum air temperature, south-easterly (<b>onshore)</b> <b>winds,</b> wind speeds {{in excess}} of 6 m/s, and rainfall, all result in warmer sea surface temperatures.|$|R

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 11.5 GW of <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> potential exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential {{is estimated}} at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner Moray Firth and Firth of Forth were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate {{as part of a}} UK-wide initiative. Also in 2010, discussions were held between the Scottish Government and Statoil of Norway with a view to developing a 5-turbine floating windfarm, possibly to be located off Fraserburgh. In July 2016, RSPB challenged development in the Firth of Forth and Firth of Tay.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} other large <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms in Scotland, at various stages of development, {{including}} some that are in community ownership.|$|E
25|$|Wind {{power is}} Scotland's fastest growing {{renewable}} energy technology, with 5328 MW of installed capacity as of March 2015. This includes 5131 MW of <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> and 197 MW of offshore wind.|$|E

40|$|Wind/wave {{interactions}} {{in the surf}} zone are studied using a wave tank and environmental wind tunnel. The wind simulation is achieved over a relatively short fetch using accelerated growth techniques at a scale of roughly 1 : 100. Waves are scaled at approximately 1 : 50, and consequently there is some scaling mis-match between the wind and wave simulations. Results show that wind has {{a significant effect on}} the breaking of the waves. Both breaker location and breaker type are shown to be affected by the wind. Results are in agreement with those of Douglass (1989 & 1990), who used a wind/wave flume to simulate the prototype conditions, but made no attempt to correctly simulate the turbulence in the air flow. The main findings, are that <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> promote spilling waves and increase the surf zone width, whereas offshore winds promote plunging waves, decreasing surf zone width. Hot-film measurements of the air flow over the waves show that there exists significant differences between the air flow structure of offshore and <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> over the surf zone. Under offshore winds, the surf zone exerts a large drag on the air flow, dramatically increasing turbulence intensities aerodynamic roughness z 0, and friction velocity, u*, near the point of wave breaking. Under <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> the air flow is less affected and at the point of wave breaking, z 0 for <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> is an order of magnitude lower than the value under offshore winds. Phase-averaging techniques indicate large wave-induced perturbations to the mean velocity over the waves, and these are present to heights of up to 5 or 6 times the breaker height over the point of wave breaking. Spectra indicate that for <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> large wave-frequency fluctuations are present at the shore. Additionally, studies of particle motion offshore of the surf zone indicate wind effects on the drift velocities of suspended particles, although the precise nature of the wind effect was not clear...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the large <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> resources, the U.S. has large offshore wind power potential, with another NREL report released in September 2010 showing that the U.S. has 4,150GW of potential offshore wind power nameplate capacity, an amount 4times that of the country's 2008 installed capacity from all sources, of 1,010GW.|$|E
25|$|Hampton Brook, now Westbrook, {{reached the}} sea through a stone culvert but seaweed often blocked it, making it {{overflow}} and become stagnant. The land between {{the houses and}} the often-foetid Hampton Brook was low-lying enough {{to be subject to}} flood during a combination of spring tide, prolonged rainfall and <b>onshore</b> <b>wind.</b> Either the digging or the filling-in of the oyster company's fishpools created soft, unstable land.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the largest}} {{operational}} <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the largest wind farm in the world, Gansu Wind Farm in China has a capacity of over 6,000MW as of 2012, with a goal of 20,000MW by 2020. As of April 2013, the 630MW London Array in the UK is the largest offshore wind farm in the world.|$|E

50|$|The {{coast is}} {{approximately}} half of that of the large bay. The gulf has several alternative names dating to antiquity and to an etymological association with <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> and sandbanks making navigation difficult, including Lesser Syrtis (see Gulf of Sidra which takes in also the mainly Libyan portion of the continental gulf).|$|R
25|$|Wind power {{harnesses}} {{the power}} of the wind to propel the blades of wind turbines. These turbines cause the rotation of magnets, which creates electricity. Wind towers are usually built together on wind farms. There are offshore and <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. Global wind power capacity has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014, and wind energy production was around 4% of total worldwide electricity usage, and growing rapidly.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 {{study by}} the University of Delaware for a 72 GW system {{considered}} 28 billion combinations of renewable energy and storage and found the most cost-effective, for the PJM Interconnection, would use 17 GW of solar, 68 GW of offshore wind, and 115 GW of <b>onshore</b> <b>wind,</b> although at {{times as much as}} three times the demand would be provided. 0.1% of the time would require generation from other sources.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Government set {{a target}} of 40% of Scotland's {{electricity}} generation be derived from renewable sources by 2020. Currently renewable energy sources provide Scotland with 35% of its electricity production, with <b>onshore</b> <b>wind</b> generation making the largest contribution, and supporting several thousand jobs. There are many windfarms along the coast and hills, with plans to create one of the world's largest onshore windfarms at Barvas Moor on the Hebridean island of Lewis.|$|E
5000|$|A Catalina eddy {{is rarely}} prolonged: as the heat over the deserts causes air to rise, the {{resulting}} pressure gradient and {{increase in the}} normal <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> causes the vortex to dissipate.

50|$|Wrecking {{was well}} known in Devon and Cornwall where the rocky coastline, and strong {{prevailing}} <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> helped wreck many merchant ships and warships. It is rumoured that ships were sometimes deliberately attracted: false lights on the shore {{were said to be}} used sometimes to lead ships into disaster. However, {{there is no evidence to}} support these ideas.|$|R
5000|$|Seawatching is {{commonly}} performed during bird migration seasons, and particularly when weather conditions are suitable. Successful seawatching is very {{dependent on the}} weather. [...] When the weather is fine, birds often stay out to sea, and pelagic trips are then a more effective way to observe them; if <b>onshore</b> <b>winds</b> combine with rain, birds can be forced to migrate close to shore.|$|R
