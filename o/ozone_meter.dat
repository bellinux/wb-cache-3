40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} surface ozone measurement at Syowa Station from February 1982 to January 1983 with a Dasibi <b>ozone</b> <b>meter.</b> In order to improve the reliability, the instrument was calibrated in Japan {{before and after the}} observation. The surface ozone mixing ratio at Syowa Station shows the annual change with a winter maximum and a summer minimum, being quite similar to that at Amundsen-Scott (South Pole) Station...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} on application of Dielectric Barrier Discharge Plasma with spiral-cylindrical configuration to produce ozone has been done. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the effect of ozone on the physical characteristics of rice which include discoloration, hardness, and the value of amilograph. Ozone reactor that used in this research have a spiral electrode made of wire, and dielectric material was pyrex tube. Plasma discharge was generated by AC high voltage up to 9 kV. Air flow rate used as a determinant of ozone concentration characteristic was 6 liters/min, while for treatment the air flow rate that used was 4 liters/min in order to obtain the ozone concentration of 10 ppm. Ozone is produced by inserting the free air into the reactor. Ozone concentration is determined by varying the voltage, while ozone generated is detected by <b>ozone</b> <b>meter.</b> The results showed that that the effect of ozonation to physical character of rice was not give significant changes and has a tendency to increase the quality of rice. It can be concluded that ozonation is safe for use in rice storage system...|$|E
40|$|Printers {{contribute}} to various emissions consist with chemical contaminants. High {{concentration of the}} particulate matter can cause serious health problems. This study focuses on the indoor air quality in printing premise unit in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn, Malaysia. Field testing involving air sampling methods were taken from 900 hours to 1600 hours, for every 30 minutes using physical measurement which is Multi-Channel Air Quality Monitor (YESAIR), E-Sampler and <b>Ozone</b> <b>Meter.</b> Air sampling was recorded based on one sampling point and most suitable point for production. A comparison based on different ventilation using fan and air-conditioning were also taken and results is being compared based on OSHA and NIOSH standards. Besides that, the statistical analysis is being conducted in order to predict the effect on number of printers. From the result, the O 3 concentrations show, 10 % reduced for printing premise using fan ventilation compared to air-conditioning but remain the same value for PM 2. 5. The concentration of O 3 increased {{when the number of}} printers decreased, while the concentration of PM 2. 5 increased the increase of printers number. Overall, the use of fan in printing premise is more suggested since the level is slightly lower than the printing premise using air-conditioning...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSUMO is an {{innovative}} proof-of-concept nanosatellite aiming to measure {{on the same}} platform the different components of the Earth radiation budget (ERB), the solar energy input and the energy reemitted {{at the top of}} the Earth atmosphere, with a particular focus on the far UV (FUV) part of the spectrum and on the ozone layer. The FUV is the only wavelength band with energy absorbed in the high atmosphere (stratosphere), in the ozone (Herzberg continuum, 200 – 220 nm) and oxygen bands, and its high variability is most probably at the origin of a climate influence (UV affects stratospheric dynamics and temperatures, altering interplanetary waves and weather patterns both poleward and downward to the lower stratosphere and tropopause). A simultaneous observation of incoming FUV and ozone production would bring an invaluable information on this process of solar-climate forcing. Space instruments have already measured the different components of the ERB but this is the first time that all instruments will operate on the same platform. This characteristic by itself guarantees original scientific results. SUMO is a 3. 6 kg, 3 W, 10 x 10 x 30 cm 3 nanosatellite (" 3 U"), with a " 1 U" payload of < 1 kg and 1 W. 5 instruments: an <b>ozone</b> <b>meter,</b> a FUV measure at 215 nm, 2 radiometers (0. 2 – 3 & 0. 2 – 40 µm) and a bolometer. Orbit is polar, Sun-synchronous, ~ 600 km, since a further challenge are relations between solar UV variability and stratospheric ozone on Arctic and Antarctic regions. Mission is expected to last 1 to 2 years. SUMO definition has been completed (platform and payload AIT are possible in 24 months). SUMO is proposed for the nanosatellite program of Polytechnic School and CNES (following QB 50) for a flight in 2018. Follow-up is 2 fold: on one part more complete measurements using SUMO miniaturized instruments on a larger satellite; on the other part, increase of the coverage in local time and latitude using a constellation of SUMO nanosatellites around the Earth to further geolocalize the Sun influence on our planet. Nanosatellites, with cost and risk limited, are also excellent platforms to evaluate technologies for future missions, e. g. nanotechnology ZnO protection barriers to limit contamination from solar panels in the UV and reduce reflection losses in the visible, or MgZnO solar blind detectors (R&D initiatives proposed to CNES) ...|$|E
