50|$|An {{indexing}} head, {{also known}} as a <b>dividing</b> <b>head</b> or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions. Indexing heads are usually used on the tables of milling machines, but may be used on many other machine tools including drill presses, grinders, and boring machines. Common jobs for a <b>dividing</b> <b>head</b> include machining the flutes of a milling cutter, cutting the teeth of a gear, milling curved slots, or drilling a bolt hole circle around the circumference of a part.|$|R

50|$|Much of the {{perimeter}} of the county is the Continental Divide, including all of its border with the state of Idaho. The <b>divide</b> <b>heads</b> east into Montana at the county border with Ravalli County, between Lost Trail Pass and Chief Joseph Pass.|$|R
5000|$|Direct {{indexing}} plate: Most <b>dividing</b> <b>heads</b> have an {{indexing plate}} permanently {{attached to the}} spindle. This plate {{is located at the}} end of the spindle, very close to where the work would be mounted. It is fixed to the spindle and rotates with it. This plate is usually equipped with a series of holes that enables rapid indexing to common angles, such as 30, 45, or 90 degrees. A pin in the base of the <b>dividing</b> <b>head</b> can be extended into the direct indexing plate to lock the head quickly into one of these angles. [...] The advantage of the direct indexing plate is that it is fast and simple and no calculations are required to use it. The disadvantage is that it can only be used for a limited number of angles.|$|R
50|$|A {{centre lathe}} has {{applications}} anywhere that a centered workpiece may be used; {{this is not}} limited to lathe usage but may include setups in <b>dividing</b> <b>heads,</b> cylindrical grinders, tool and cutter grinders or other related equipment. The term between centres refers to any machining operation where the job needs to be performed using centers.|$|R
25|$|Beginning by {{examining}} patients in whom nerves had been <b>divided,</b> <b>Head</b> and his co-worker J. Sherren soon realised the folly in using patient subjects. Being unacquainted with medicine, {{the patients were}} unable to provide accurate accounts of their sensations and thus they were inappropriate subjects for psycho-physical testing. With this in mind, Head offered himself up as the test subject.|$|R
50|$|CNC {{indexing}} heads may {{be controlled}} {{in two different}} modes. The most basic method of operation uses simple control functions built into the <b>dividing</b> <b>head.</b> It {{does not require a}} CNC machine. The operator enters the desired angle into a control box attached to the indexing head and it automatically rotates to the desired position and locks into place for machining. Changing angles is as simple as typing a new angle value onto the control pad. This is simpler than setting up a manual indexing head because {{there is no need to}} interchange indexing plates or to calculate which hole positions to use. It is also faster for repetitive operations because the work can be indexed by simply pressing a button, eliminating the need to count rotations of the hand crank or specific hole positions on the indexing plate. A CNC <b>dividing</b> <b>head</b> may be used in this manner on either manual or CNC machinery.|$|R
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} many {{manufacturers}} of the era, some Van Norman machines use a proprietary spindle taper. The No. 6, No. 12, {{and some of}} the No. 16 ram type mills use what Van Norman referred to as their [...] "C" [...] taper (Hardinge refers to this taper as 5V today). This taper was also used in some of Van Norman's smaller <b>dividing</b> <b>heads</b> and auxiliary milling subheads. Some of the larger machines use Van Norman's [...] "No. 2" [...] taper (Hardinge 50V), {{and some of the}} larger <b>dividing</b> <b>heads</b> and milling subheads use this taper as well.Larger machines used an assortment of tapers—earlier mills will most likely have either some size of Brown & Sharpe taper or Van Norman's [...] "No. 2" [...] taper. Later mills usually have NMTB milling machine tapers (30, 40, or 50, depending on machine size). It is probable that any machine could be ordered new with any taper the buyer desired.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>dividing</b> <b>heads</b> {{operate at}} a 40:1 ratio; that is 40 turns {{of the hand}} crank generates 1 {{revolution}} of the spindle or workpiece. In other words, 1 turn of the hand crank rotates the spindle by 9 degrees. Because the operator of the machine may want to rotate the part to an arbitrary angle indexing plates are used to ensure the part is accurately positioned.|$|R

50|$|A {{rotary table}} is a {{precision}} work positioning device used in metalworking. It enables the operator to drill or cut work at exact intervals around a fixed (usually horizontal or vertical) axis. Some rotary tables allow the use of index plates for indexing operations, and some can also be fitted with dividing plates that enable regular work positioning at divisions for which indexing plates are not available. A rotary fixture used in this fashion is more appropriately called a <b>dividing</b> <b>head</b> (indexing head).|$|R
50|$|A carrier is {{most often}} used when turning between centers on a lathe, {{but it may be}} used on <b>dividing</b> <b>heads</b> or any similar situation. It is used in {{conjunction}} with a drive plate and drive pins: the plate is mounted directly on the machine spindle (as with a chuck) and the drive pin is attached to the plate. In use the carrier and workpiece are inserted between centers and the leg of the carrier rests against the drive pin.|$|R
50|$|Most CNC <b>dividing</b> <b>heads</b> {{are also}} able to {{function}} as a full CNC axis and may be wired into the control of a CNC machine. This enables the machine's main CNC controller to control the indexing head just like it would control the other axes of the machine. This can be used to machine complex 3D shapes, helices with a non-constant pitch, and similar exotic parts. This mode of operation cannot be used on a manual machine tool because it requires a full CNC controller to operate.|$|R

East of Chief Joseph Pass, Highway 43 descends to Wisdom 26 mi away passing the historic Big Hole National Battlefield of 1877. In early September 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition either crossed this pass or the nearby Lost Trail Pass as they traveled westward into the Bitterroot Valley of present-day Ravalli County.|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} an attachment for a sine bar {{which can be}} used to perform measurements during lathe operations or other types of machining operations. The attachment can be used for setting precision angles on vises, <b>dividing</b> <b>heads,</b> rotary tables and angle plates. It can also be used in the inspection of machined parts, when close tolerances are required, and in the layout of precision hardware. The novelty of the invention is believed to reside in a specific versatile sine bar attachment for measuring a variety of angles on a number of different types of equipment...|$|R
5000|$|Universal Dividing heads: some manual {{indexing}} {{heads are}} equipped with a power drive provision. This allows {{the rotation of the}} <b>dividing</b> <b>head</b> to be connected to the table feed of the milling machine instead of using a hand crank. A set of change gears is provided to select the ratio between the table feed and rotation. This setup allows the machining of spiral or helical features such as spiral gears, worms, or screw type parts because the part is simultaneously rotated {{at the same time it}} is moved in the horizontal direction. This setup is called a [...] "PTO dividing head".|$|R

50|$|A {{measure of}} mass volume <b>divided</b> by <b>head</b> circumference, termed cystic adenomatoid {{malformation}} volume ratio (CVR) {{has been developed}} to predict the risk of hydrops. The lung mass volume is determined using the formula (length × width × anteroposterior diameter ÷ 2), <b>divided</b> by <b>head</b> circumference. With a CVR greater than 1.6 being considered high risk. Fetuses with a CVR less than 1.6 and without a dominant cyst have less than a 3% risk of hydrops. After delivery, if the patient is symptomatic, resection is mandated. If the infant is asymptomatic, the need for resection is a subject of debate, though it is usually recommended. Development of recurrent infections, rhabdomyosarcoma, adenocarcinomas in situ within the lung malformation have been reported.|$|R
