500|$|The Allied nations invaded Italy in September 1943 and by mid-1944 {{had pushed}} the Germans {{back to the}} Gothic Line in the North of the country. Ferdinand was {{intended}} [...] to develop a threat against Genoa, {{as part of an}} expected Allied assault on the Gothic Line in August/September 1944. German forces in the French Riviera (originally threatened by Vendetta) were to be put at relative ease, but not left feeling too secure lest they be moved to re-inforce Normandy. Planning for the operation was handled by 'A' Force; the department in charge of deception in the Middle East. A large part of the <b>operation</b> <b>planning</b> was handed to Major Eugene J Sweeney, an Irish-American career officer who had joined the department in late 1943 with the express task of learning the arts of deception before the war ended. Working out of Algiers, at Advanced HQ (West), Sweeney helped implement several deceptions. The most notable of these was Operation Oakfield, the cover plan for Operation Shingle and the Battle of Anzio.|$|E

Common, unique and best practice elements are identified and should be contained in a continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>plan.</b> An identified compilation of continuity of operation elements is presented. Planning templates are good for COOP document structure and should contain the compilation of COOP elements, a recommended template is offered. Local government continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>plan</b> developers must independently develop and "own" their continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>plan</b> based on the compilation COOP elements. An after action-report is a necessary component for continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>plan</b> maintenance and can be used for continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>plan</b> research. Academia must pursue continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>plan</b> research to qualitatively and quantitatively identify effective continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>plans</b> and their respective elements. With the advent of homeland security as an academic pursuit, research opportunity exists and should be supported by the federal government because of the critical nature of an effective COOP for local government in ensuring the continuity of essential functions during and after an event.

40|$|Continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) is {{critical}} for institution sustainability. The absence of such planning can result in an HBCU closing {{for an extended period}} of time after a disaster resulting in loss of revenue, research projects, students, faculty, and staff. There is a void of information on the extent of continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> at HBCUs and how these institutions would continue functioning after a disaster. Using resilience theory as the foundation, the purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore the extent of continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> at HBCUs in Alabama in the event of a disaster and explore opportunities to strengthen continuity planning for the future. Four HBCUs were chosen in the State of Alabama for this research. Data were collected through interviews with 5 individuals with information on continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> at the universities selected. These data were inductively coded and subjected to thematic analysis. The results of this study indicate comprehensive continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> is not taking place, and planners at these institutions perceive they do not have the guidance needed for effective planning and the time to conduct planning activities. It is recommended the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) develop a guideline for continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> applicable to higher education. It is further recommended that HBCU leadership insure planners have adequate time and resources to devote to continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning.</b> This study fosters positive social change by bringing an awareness to FEMA and HBCU leadership of the need and importance of continuity of <b>operations</b> <b>planning</b> for institutional sustainability...|$|R
