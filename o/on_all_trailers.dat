40|$|In December 1992, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 108, was {{amended to}} require {{conspicuity}} treatments <b>on</b> <b>all</b> heavy <b>trailers</b> manufactured after December 1, 1993. The standard was later modified and extended to tractors and older trailers such that by June 1, 2009 the entire fleet of tractors and semitrailers on United States roadways would reach full {{compliance with the}} regulation. To investigate {{the effect of the}} regulation, an analysis was conducted of the change in the odds that a fatal crash occurred in darkness, comparing scenarios in which the conspicuity treatment was likely to be influential to those in which the conspicuity treatment was likely to be irrelevant. From 1987 to 2009, the odds that a fatal collision involving a heavy truck occurred in darkness declined by 58 % among the relevant crash scenarios, while little evidence of decline was found among the irrelevant scenarios. Disaggregations of crash scenario types suggest that the largest declines occurred in fatal rear end and angle collisions. A comparative analysis of light vehicles also found declines, although they were smaller and less sensitive to crash type. Similar but weaker trends were observed for nonfatal rear end collisions. The results are consistent with causal mechanisms that suggest that detection failure may be a significant contributor to the risk of striking a tractor-semitrailer in darkness, and that conspicuity treatments have significantly reduced this risk...|$|R

40|$|Obtaining a {{representative}} loading spectrum that corresponds {{well to the}} reality {{is still one of}} the greatest challenges for fatigue life calculations and optimal design of the trailer body. A good qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the spectrum leads to more efficient usage of material, a better design of connection points and an overall decrease of the weight of the trailer, which finally results in a significant decrease in the price of a ton of cargo per km. Despite that, the approach is nowadays mostly based on the experience and rules of thumb. It typically results in over-dimensioning of some parts while other parts remain vulnerable to failure due to unknown loading patterns. This paper describes a generic approach to solve the problems mentioned above applied in a research project named FORWARD (Fuel Optimized trailer Referring to Well Assessed Realistic Design loads). The project lasted two years and was carried out in cooperation with several different trailer manufacturers and 1 st tier suppliers. The loading history of more than 1000 hours for five trailer types were captured in the shape of strains, accelerations and velocities of various elements of the trailers, enabling reconstruction of the loading in terms of forces and moments acting on the wheels and kingpin. Parallel to this extensive test-campaign, a novel generic physics-based computational approach was developed to predict selected loads encountered during common manoeuvres to <b>all</b> <b>trailer</b> types. The computational approach was validated against test-data and resulted in creating a generic multi-body library applicable for <b>all</b> <b>trailer</b> types, and an automated post-processing routine for the large amount of test-data...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and test a rapid (< 2 h) sanitation protocol designed for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) positive commercial transport vehicles involving cold water washing and disinfection via fumigation using scale models of weaned pig trailers. The study consisted of 2 phases. Following experimental contamination of model trailers with PRRSV MN 30 â€“ 100 (5 Ã— 105 TCID 50), phase 1 evaluated the presence or absence of PRRSV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on swabs collected from the trailer interiors 0, 60, and 90 min after treatment. Phase 2 consisted of evaluating the infectivity of trailers 90 min posttreatment by monitoring changes in the PRRSV-status of naÃ¯ve sentinel pigs housed for 2 h. Treatments included washing only (treatment 1), washing plus formaldehyde fumigation (treatment 2), washing plus fumigation with glutaraldehyde-quaternary ammonium chloride (treatment 3), and washing plus overnight drying (treatment 4). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus RNA was detected in <b>all</b> <b>trailers</b> (20 out of 20 replicates) at 60 and 90 min following the application of treatments 1 and 2. These trailers also contained infectious PRRSV, as determined by the infection of naÃ¯ve pigs housed in treated trailers and the testing of organic debris collected from the interior of trailers by swine bioassay. At 90 min posttreatment, <b>all</b> <b>trailers</b> treated with glutaraldehyde-quaternary ammonium chloride were PCRnegative, non-infectious to sentinel pigs, and swine bioassay negative. Similar results were observed in trailers allowed to dry for 8 h. Under the conditions of this study, it appears certain disinfectants may possess different levels of efficacy against PRRSV and PRRSV-positive models may be effectively sanitized in the absence of overnight drying...|$|R

5000|$|The {{weight of}} a vehicle is {{influenced}} by passengers, cargo, even fuel level, so a number of terms are used to express the {{weight of a}} vehicle in a designated state. Gross combined weight rating (GCWR) refers to the total mass of a vehicle, including <b>all</b> <b>trailers.</b> GVWR and GCWR both describe a vehicle that is in operation and are used to specify weight limitations and restrictions. Curb weight describes a vehicle which is [...] "parked at the curb" [...] and excludes {{the weight of a}}ny occupants or cargo. Dry weight further excludes the weight of all consumables, such as fuel and oils. Gross trailer weight rating specifies the maximum weight of a trailer and the gross axle weight rating specifies the maximum weight on any particular axle.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the concentration of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in a scale-model trailer that was required to infect susceptible pigs, evaluate the potential of PRRSV-contaminated transport vehicles to infect naÃ¯ve pigs and assess 4 sanitation programs for the prevention of virus spread. To maximize study power, scale models (1 : 150) of weaned-pig trailers were constructed that provided an animal density equal to that of an actual weaned-pig trailer capable of transporting 300 pigs. The 1 st aim involved contaminating the interior of the model trailers with various concentrations (101 to 104 TCID 50 /mL) of PRRSV MN 30 â€“ 100, then housing sentinel pigs in the trailers for 2 h. Pigs exposed to trailers contaminated with â‰¥ 103 TCID 50 /mL became infected. The 2 nd aim involved housing experimentally infected seeder pigs in trailers for 2 h, then directly introducing sentinel pigs for 2 h. Infection of sentinels was demonstrated in 3 of 4 replicates. The 3 rd aim involved applying 1 of 4 sanitation procedures (treatments) to contaminated trailers. Treatment 1 consisted of manual scraping of the interior to remove soiled bedding (wood chips). Treatment 2 consisted of bedding removal, washing (80 Â°C, 20 500 kPa), and disinfecting (with 1 : 256 phenol; 10 -min contact time). Treatment 3 consisted of treatment 2, followed by freezing and thawing. Treatment 4 consisted of bedding removal, washing, disinfecting, and drying. Ten replicates were conducted per treatment. Pretreatment swabs from <b>all</b> <b>trailers</b> tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Post-treatment swabs were PCR-positive for <b>all</b> <b>trailers</b> except those that were washed, disinfected, and dried. Infection of sentinel pigs by PRRSV was also detected by PCR after all treatments except washing, disinfecting, and drying. Under the conditions of this study, drying appeared to be an important component of a sanitation program for ensuring PRRSV biosecurity of transport vehicles...|$|R

50|$|In 1929, Government aid enabled {{plans for}} {{extensions}} to the Piccadilly line northwards to Cockfosters and westwards from Hammersmith to Acton Town, on tracks which were {{parallel to the}} District line but not shared with it, to come to fruition. The length of the line increased from 8.5 mi to 40 mi, and so more trains were needed. The improvements made for the 1930 build were incorporated into the design, {{as well as some}} new features. 145 motor cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, and 130 trailer cars were shared between two builders. <b>All</b> <b>trailer</b> cars had 12 doors, with two sets of double doors and a single-leaf door at both ends on each side. Electro-pneumatic brakes were fitted, as was a weak-field control, which enabled higher speed running and had been tested on the 1930 build. Its use on the Northern line had demonstrated that the same service intervals could be maintained with four fewer trains.|$|R
50|$|The trams had two parallel-connected {{pantograph}}s, {{which were}} both used simultaneously. The back pantograph could be lowered by air pressure by the driver when the pantographs {{were used to}} control switches. During the 1950s, Oslo Sporveier started rebuilding the switches {{so that it was}} controlled by the tram, based on {{whether or not it was}} using power at a point. A-switches were made so the tram was to pass with power being drawn if the switch was to stay in the same place or go to the left, while B-switches would change if there was no power being drawn. Ekebergbanen's trailers were also equipped with pantographs, although these were only used to supply heating and lighting. However, both the double motor car pantographs and the trailer pantographs caused problems with the electrical switches, and were eventually discontinued in the city streets. <b>All</b> <b>trailers</b> from no. 1048 were delivered with a power cord to connect to the motor car, and some of the older trams were also rebuilt.|$|R
