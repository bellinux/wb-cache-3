25|$|The {{requirements}} for heat removal can significantly change {{the appearance of}} high-power vacuum tubes. High power audio amplifiers and rectifiers required larger envelopes to dissipate heat. <b>Transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> could be much larger still.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, BEL {{set up a}} radar {{manufacturing}} facility for the army and in-house R&D. In 1967, BEL began manufacturing <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes,</b> silicon devices and integrated circuits. The PCB {{manufacturing facility}} was established in 1968.|$|R
25|$|When {{a vacuum}} tube is {{overloaded}} or operated past its design dissipation, its anode (plate) may glow red. In consumer equipment, a glowing plate is universally {{a sign of}} an overloaded tube. However, some large <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> are designed to operate with their anodes at red, orange, or in rare cases, white heat.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} 1942-1944, the Radio Manufacturers Association used a {{descriptive}} nomenclature system for industrial, transmitting, and special-purpose vacuum tubes. The numbering scheme was distinct {{from both the}} numbering schemes used for standard receiving tubes, and the existing <b>transmitting</b> <b>tube</b> numbering systems used previously, such as the [...] "800 series" [...] numbers originated by RCA and adopted by many others.|$|R

50|$|Boris Pavlovich Grabovsky (Бори́с Па́влович Грабо́вский 26 May 1901 - 13 January 1966) was a Soviet {{engineer}} who invented a first fully electronic TV set (video <b>transmitting</b> <b>tube</b> and video receiver) that was demonstrated in 1928. In 1925, {{one of the}} pioneers of television Boris Rosing advised and helped him apply for a patent (issued under No 5592) of a fully electronic TV set called Telefot.|$|R
25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum tubes for {{high-power}} applications often required custom socket designs. A jumbo four-prong socket {{was used}} for various industrial tubes. A specialized 7-pin socket (Septar or B7A), with all pins in a circle with one pin wider than the others, {{was used for}} <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes.</b> Subminiature tubes with long wire leads, introduced in the 1950s, were often soldered directly to printed circuit boards. Sockets were made for early transistors, but quickly fell out of favor as transistor reliability became established. This also happened with early integrated circuits; IC sockets later became used only for devices that {{may need to be}} upgraded.|$|R

5|$|A new factory was {{constructed}} at 230 Duffy Avenue, Hicksville, New York, to manufacture electron tubes and semiconductors. Miniature receiving tubes, magnetrons, X-ray tubes, Geiger-Muller <b>tubes,</b> and large <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory {{was completed in}} 1953 and closed in 1989. All assets were then sold to Richardson Electronics of rural Lafox, near Batavia, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|Boris Grabovsky {{started his}} {{education}} in Tashkent special school. Then he entered preparational faculty of Central Asian University in Tashkent {{where he worked}} with Prof. G. Popov. In the university he read articles by Boris Rosing {{in the field of}} electronic telescopy. Being excited by the idea of the transmission of images over a distance, he invented the cathode commutator, which was the first prototype of his <b>transmitting</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tuska {{remained}} {{active in}} the radio field. In March 1922, he participated {{in the establishment of}} a new broadcasting station, WDAK, operated by the Hartford Courant, even loaning the newspaper the <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> formerly used at WQB, in order to help the station get on the air. By 1926, Tuska had arranged for the sale of his company to the A. Atwater Kent company, with Tuska becoming a patent attorney for the firm.|$|R
5000|$|Many power valves {{have good}} {{linearity}} but modest gain or transconductance. Signal amplifiers using tubes {{are capable of}} very high frequency response ranges - up to radio frequency. Indeed, many of the directly heated single-ended triode (DH-SET) audio amplifiers are in fact radio <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> designed {{to operate in the}} megahertz range. In practice, however, tube amplifier designs typically [...] "couple" [...] stages either capacitively, limiting bandwidth at the low end, or inductively with transformers, limiting the bandwidth at both ends.|$|R
50|$|Early {{variations}} included <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> {{such as the}} 807 (1937) with 6.3V heater, plate (anode) {{connected to}} a top cap, and equivalent 12.6V 1625, the smaller 6V6 (1936), the many KT versions marketed in Europe, and a subsequent vast array of audio and RF power tubes. One of the largest-volume post-WWII applications was in the basic design of television sweep power tubes, starting with the 6BG6G (1946), a modified 807. TV designs rarely used transistors in place of sweep tubes—a challenging high-power and high-speed application—until the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|DURAN is a {{brand name}} for a {{borosilicate}} glass from the German company DURAN Group GmbH and represents the internationally defined type of borosilicate glass 3.3 (DIN ISO 3585). Because of its very high resistance to heat and temperature changes, as well as high mechanical strength and the low coefficient of expansion, DURAN, {{which is similar to}} Pyrex from Corning, is not only used for laboratory devices (e.g. components of chemical devices, beakers, Erlenmeyer flask, etc.) but also in cathode ray <b>tubes</b> , <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> or speculums.|$|R
5000|$|Key to the -270's {{operation}} {{was the primary}} water-cooled 8 kW continuous/100 kW pulsed <b>transmitting</b> <b>tube.</b> Early examples were hand-built, but a contract was let to Westinghouse in October 1938 to provide production versions under the Westinghouse designation [...] "WL-530" [...] and the Signal Corps type number [...] "VT-122". A pair of these arrived in January 1939, and were incorporated into the first SCR-270 in time {{to be used in}} the Army's maneuvers that summer. Several improved components followed as the Army offered additional contracts for eventual production.|$|R
5000|$|Vacuum-tube {{output stages}} in early {{wideband}} oscilloscopes used radio <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes,</b> but they consumed {{a lot of}} power. Picofarads of capacitance to ground limited bandwidth. A better design, called a distributed amplifier, used multiple tubes, but their inputs (control grids) were connected along a tapped L-C delay line, so the tubes' input capacitances {{became part of the}} delay line. As well, their outputs (plates/anodes) were likewise connected to another tapped delay line, its output feeding the deflection plates. (This amplifier was push-pull, so there were four delay lines, two for input, and two for output.) ...|$|R
25|$|High-power <b>tubes</b> such as <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> have {{packages}} designed more {{to enhance}} heat transfer. In some tubes, the metal envelope {{is also the}} anode. The 4CX1000A is an external anode tube of this sort. Air is blown through an array of fins attached to the anode, thus cooling it. Power tubes using this cooling scheme are available up to 150kW dissipation. Above that level, water or water-vapor cooling are used. The highest-power tube currently available is the Eimac , a forced water-cooled power tetrode capable of dissipating 2.5 megawatts. By comparison, the largest power transistor can only dissipate about 1 kilowatt.|$|R
40|$|An RF <b>transmitting</b> <b>tube</b> for the 20 GHz to 500 GHz range {{comprises}} a gyrotron and a multistage depressed collector. A winding {{provides a}} magnetic field which acts on spent, spinning or orbiting electrons changing their motion to substantially forward linear motion in a downstream direction. The spent electrons then pass through a focusser into the collector. Nearly all of the electrons injected into the collector will remain within an imaginary envelope as they travel forward toward the end collector plate. The apertures in the collector plates {{are at least as}} large in diameter as the envelope at any particular axial position...|$|R
5000|$|While {{employed}} by the small San Francisco, California manufacturing firm of Heintz & Kaufman which manufactured custom radio equipment Bill Eitel (amateur radio call sign W6UF) and Jack McCullough (W6CHE) convinced company president Ralph Heintz (W6XBB) {{to allow them to}} develop a <b>transmitting</b> <b>tube</b> that could operate at lower voltages than those then available to the amateur radio market, such as the RCA 204A or the 852. Their effort was a success and resulted in production of the HK-354. Shortly after in 1934, Eitel and McCullough left H&K to form Eitel McCullough Corp. in San Bruno California.|$|R

50|$|Directly heated cathode: In this type, the {{filament}} {{itself is}} the cathode and emits the electrons directly. Directly heated cathodes {{were used in the}} first vacuum tubes. Today they are used in fluorescent tubes and most high power <b>transmitting</b> vacuum <b>tubes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Designed as a {{prototype}} system to continuously monitor the atmosphere up to approximately 100 km, the Poker Flat MST radar began operating in 1979 {{at a relatively}} low sensitivity. In almost continuous operation since then, the system is steadily increasing in sensitivity to its ultimate design characteristics. Current and final parameters are listed. The advantages of its modular design, which uses 64 transmitting modules distributed through the 200 mx 200 m antenna array include: easy maintenance, beam switching using very low power switching, air cooled <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes,</b> lower feedline costs, and no moving parts. Continuous, uninterrupted operation (4 years) and less man-made interference because of the remote location) are other assets. Most disadvantages are related to its not-yet-finished status, climate, moose excursions, and operating expenses...|$|R
50|$|The Bay {{area was}} an early center of ham radio with about 10% of the {{operators}} in the US. William Eitel, Jack McCullough, and Litton, who together pioneered vacuum tube manufacturing in the Bay area, were hobbyists with training in technology who participated in development of shortwave radio by the ham radio hobby. High frequency, and especially, Very high frequency, VHF, transmission in the 10 meter band, required higher quality power tubes than were manufactured by the consortium of RCA, Western Electric, General Electric, Westinghouse, which controlled vacuum tube manufacturing. Litton pioneered manufacturing techniques which resulted in award of wartime contracts to manufacture <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> for Radar to Eitel-McCullough, a San Bruno firm, which manufactured power-grid tubes for radio amateurs and aircraft radio equipment.|$|R
2500|$|Large <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> have {{carbonized}} tungsten filaments {{containing a}} small trace (1% to 2%) [...] of thorium. An extremely thin (molecular) layer of thorium atoms forms {{on the outside}} of the wire's carbonized layer and, when heated, serve as an efficient source of electrons. The thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface, while new thorium atoms diffuse to the surface to replace them. Such thoriated tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours. The end-of-life scenario for a thoriated-tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of tungsten carbide and emission begins to drop off rapidly; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end-of-life in a tube with this type of emitter.|$|R
50|$|The Bay Area was {{an early}} center of ham radio with about 10% of the {{operators}} in the United States.

50|$|The 845 power triode is a radio <b>transmitting</b> vacuum <b>tube</b> {{which can}} also be used as an audio {{amplifier}} and modulation tube. Typically, the plate is machined from solid graphite in order to accommodate high current dissipation (up to 100 watts) and voltage. Some current production 845 tubes have metal plates.|$|R
500|$|Originally {{located at}} 79 Washington Street in Brooklyn, New York, Amperex was a {{long-established}} manufacturer of <b>transmitting</b> <b>tubes</b> {{when they were}} acquired by the Dutch firm, Philips, (known more widely as Norelco in the US), around 1955. Philips continued to improve and enlarge the [...] tube plant in New York, but also used the Amperex name to distribute their new line of Dutch-made miniature tubes, (12AX7, 12AU7, 12AT7) to feed the booming U.S. hi-fi market. Classic hi-fi brands such as Marantz, Fisher, and H. H. Scott, Inc., used these tubes. Amperex also produced the 6DJ8, 6922 and 7308 frame grid tubes. Developed by Amperex in 1958 when transistors were beginning to supplant tubes and originally developed for video and radar use, the 6DJ8 also excelled in audio amplifiers needing its high transconductance, and it still has a niche market among audiophiles.|$|R
