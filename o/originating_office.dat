2500|$|Revertive pulsing is {{a method}} of {{signaling}} in which the terminating equipment sends pulses backwards to the originating equipment as it hunts for the appropriate terminal. This {{is in contrast to}} more modern forms of forward pulsing where the originating equipment will directly outpulse to the terminating side the information it needs to connect the call. In Panel offices, as the selectors were driven upwards by the motors, brushes attached to the vertical selector rods [...] wiped over commutators {{at the top of the}} frame. These commutators contained alternating segments which serve either as insulators or conductors. When the brush passed over a conductive segment, it was grounded, thereby generating a pulse which was sent back to the sender in the <b>originating</b> <b>office</b> for counting. When the sender counted the appropriate number of pulses, it cut the power to the solenoid in the terminating office, and caused the brush to stop at its current position.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a spill-forward {{feature is}} a service feature, in the {{operation}} of an intermediate office, that, acting on incoming trunk service treatment indications, assumes routing control of the call from the <b>originating</b> <b>office.</b> This increases the chances of completion by offering the call to more trunk groups than are available in the <b>originating</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

50|$|Using MF signaling, the {{originating}} {{telephone switching}} office sends a starting signal {{such as a}} seizure (off-hook) by toggling the AB bits. After the initial seizure, the terminating office acknowledges a ready state by responding with a wink (short duration seizure) and then goes back on-hook (wink start). The <b>originating</b> <b>office</b> sends the destination digits to the terminating switch.|$|E
5000|$|Larger {{post offices}} also {{impressed}} a date-stamp on covers {{with the name}} of the <b>originating</b> <b>office.</b> This means that covers or stamps torn from covers or pairs of stamps can be used to tie numbers to mailing offices where official records are missing. Even so, as many as 300 New South Wales numbers are still untied.|$|E

5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{new system}} was {{two-stage}} multi-frequency pulsing. The outgoing sender sent its Class 4 toll center an off-hook signal as usual, received a wink as usual as a [...] "proceed to send" [...] signal, and outpulsed only a special 3-digit (later 6-digit) access code. The toll center picked a trunk through the long distance network to the gateway office, which sent a second wink to the <b>originating</b> <b>office,</b> which then sent the whole dialed number. Thus the toll switching system needed no modification except at the gateway. The international trunks used Signaling System No. 5, a [...] "North Atlantic" [...] version of the North American multi-frequency signaling system, with minor modifications including slightly higher digit rate. European MF systems of the time used compelled signalling, which would slow down too much on a long transoceanic connection.|$|E

50|$|Cheney {{is home to}} the Eastern Regional Branch of the Washington State Archives, which {{provides}} archival and records management services to local government agencies throughout Adams, Asotin, Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Lincoln, Pend Oreille, Spokane, Stevens, Walla Walla and Whitman counties in the state of Washington. Eastern Region's collections include: Local government records include those from county offices such as the Auditor, the Clerk, the Treasurer, the Board of Commissioners, and from municipalities, school districts, and other service districts. Only {{a small percentage of the}} records created by these offices are transferred to the State Archives as archival records. They are selected as archival for their value as legal and historical evidence of policy development, implementation, and effect. The transfer of records to the State Archives is an ongoing process. Some historical records remain with their <b>originating</b> <b>office</b> pending future transfer to the archives. Collections span the years from the territorial period to the present and include school census records, tax assessment rolls, court dockets and case files, photographs, maps, plats, and engineering drawings. The Archives building is located on the campus of Eastern Washington University.|$|E

The TSPS system did not perform switching between the <b>originating</b> end <b>office</b> switch and the toll switch for the subscriber voice path.|$|R
50|$|The {{city and}} state {{information}} provided by the City ID service is based on the area code and exchange in which the phone is registered. For land-line phones, this information is a reliable method for determining the phone's <b>originating</b> calling <b>office</b> or switch (the exchange). For mobile phones, this information is potentially less useful because mobile phones often operate outside of their originally registered area code and exchange area.|$|R

50|$|The praefectus urbanus, {{also called}} praefectus urbi or urban prefect in English, was prefect {{of the city}} of Rome, and later also of Constantinople. The <b>office</b> <b>originated</b> under the Roman kings, {{continued}} during the Republic and Empire, and held high importance in late Antiquity. The office survived the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, and the last urban prefect of Rome, named Iohannes, is attested in 599.

50|$|In general, CID as {{transmitted}} from {{the origin of}} the call is only the calling party's full phone number (including area code, and including international access code and country code if it's an international call). The calling party name is added by the consumer's terminating central office if the consumer has subscribed to that service. Calling name delivery is not automatic. A SS7 (or Signalling System 7) TCAP query may be launched by the called party's central office, in order to retrieve the information for Calling Name delivery to the caller ID equipment at the consumer's location, if the caller's name has not already been associated with the calling party's line at the <b>originating</b> central <b>office.</b> Canadian systems using CCS7 automatically (but not in all cases) send the calling name with the call set-up and routing information {{at the time of the}} call.|$|R
50|$|The Principal Solicitor for Ireland {{was one of}} the Irish Law Officers in {{the sixteenth}} century. The <b>office</b> <b>originated</b> in a rather unusual way, from a {{personal}} contest between two rivals for the Office of Solicitor General for Ireland, Patrick Barnewall and Walter Cowley, but it survived for some decades, as it took some of the burden of work from the senior Law Officers. Since both the Solicitor General and the Principal Solicitor were colloquially referred to as the Solicitor, there is some confusion as to who held which office at which time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} a myth.

This group hired Edward L. Bernays, [...] "The father of Public Relation and Spin" [...] as a consultant. Whether Bernays was the inventor of the story about the King and the yellow star, is not known.|$|R
50|$|The <b>office</b> <b>originated</b> {{in early}} times as the clerk of the Lord High Treasurer at the Receipt of the Exchequer. He was {{responsible}} for filing and entering the Teller's Bills from the Tellers of the Exchequer, certifying monies received to the Lord Treasurer, and auditing the books of the Tellers. The title of Auditor was officially attached to the post, combined with that of Tally Writer, {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I. In 1826, the duties of the Chamberlains of the Exchequer devolved upon the Auditor. The office was abolished, with several other offices of the ancient Exchequer, on 10 October 1834.|$|R
