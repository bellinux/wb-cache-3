40|$|Many {{types of}} indoor {{pollution}} problems {{are found in}} homes. The most effective approach to solving these problems is usually to remove or reduce the sources of indoor pollution. Ventilation also helps remove indoor air pollutants, but not as effectively as source reduction. Air cleaning devices (air filters and air cleaners) can also be helpful when used along with source reduction and ventilation. The best solution to the air pollution within your home will depend, of course, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> particular problem, the effect it is having <b>on</b> <b>your</b> family's <b>health,</b> and <b>your</b> family’s budget. The information below will help you decide if an air cleaning device would be useful {{as a part of}} your solution to indoor pollution, and if so, what type might best meet your needs. Many of the principles discussed here also apply to offices, schools, and vehicles. How Effective Are Air Cleaning Devices? Air cleaning devices alone cannot adequately remove all indoor pollutants from homes. This is especially true when the sources emit a large amount of pollution, or when the pollutants settle rapidly on surfaces. Most air cleaning devices will remove some of the particles from the indoor air, but will not effectively remove certain types of pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, radon, odors...|$|R
