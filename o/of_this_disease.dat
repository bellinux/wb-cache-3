5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>disease)</b> the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>disease.</b> Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E

DiscussionPossible mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>disease’s</b> symptomatology are compression of the RCA between the aorta and the pulmonary artery in its anomalous inter-arterial course, and squeezing of the RCA in the proximal intramural part. ConclusionIn this report, we present some unique images of the RCAs course, which contribute to the understanding <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>disease’s</b> symptomatology.
