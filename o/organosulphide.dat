40|$|Blanched and unblanched garlic were {{fermented}} using L. plantarum {{for investigation}} of <b>organosulphide</b> profiles, hydrogen sulphide-releasing activity, pH, titratable activity and microbial growth. Both raw and blanched garlic preparations allowed growth of L. plantarum with corresponding lowering of pH below 4. 0 {{and an increase}} in titratable acidity from an initial value of less 0. 05 % to 0. 3 and 0. 5 %, respectively. Fermentation, alone, decreased allicin and vinyl dithiins, but increased the concentration of DATS. The H 2 S-releasing activity, expressed as DATS-E (mmol DATS/g oil), of raw-fermented (2. 91) garlic was not significantly different to that of raw (4. 74) garlic, but values in blanched (0. 41) and blanched-fermented (0. 71) samples significantly decreased. Reductions in DATS-E values in blanched and blanched-fermented garlic corresponded well with the negative effect of blanching on the <b>organosulphide</b> concentrations of the products. Fermentation with L. plantarum retains H 2 S-releasing activity by increasing DATS, despite notable losses in allicin and allicin transformation products...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{results of}} a survey {{estimating}} volatilisation rates (as gas exchange constants and flux rates) {{of a range of}} hazardous alkane, aromatic, organohalogen, <b>organosulphide,</b> ketone and alcohol volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a water bay are presented. More than 73 experimental test runs were earned out over a year under varying seasonal conditions to measure the simultaneous concentrations of VOCs in air and water phases. The data were processed employing new advances in 'surface renewal ' volatilisation models. Based on the experimental data, estimates of theoretical equilibrium constants, gas exchange constants and flux rates for each VOC were made. Within the ranges of concentration which may reasonably be encountered by process workers, the fluxes for a broad range of VOCs ranged from approximately 0. 04 x 10 ~ 8 to 9. 0 x 10 " ' g cm " 2 h ~ '. The results were used to make predictions about the relationship between volatilisation processes and their implications for occupational hygiene nsk assessment. © 1997 British Occupational Hygiene Society.

40|$|The {{utilization}} of roadside-green-cuttings (grass) for anaerobic digestion increases provides an additional possible source of organic waste {{for use as}} a renewable energy source. Grass {{can be used as a}} substrate to increase biogas yield. Nevertheless, the anaerobic digestion of this kind of waste can be limited due to the fact that it could be contaminated with heavy metals, in particular from traffic emissions and industrial activity. For this reason the biogas production of grass from a busy road was assessed. Samples of roadside-grass were washed with an <b>organosulphide,</b> which is used for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater. A comparison of the anaerobic digestion of washed and unwashed roadside grass was performed. Results showed that the anaerobic digestion of the unwashed grass was much more effective than the washed grass. A second experiment was carried out and co-fermentation of manure and farm-grass was prepared for anaerobic digestion. Lead was added in the concentrations 500, 1000 and 2000 mg Pb 2 +/kg. The results showed that the higher the lead concentration, the lower the inhibition of the biogas yield. The grass could be acting as phytoremediator for high lead concentrations. The grass could contain organic compounds, which can as-similate heavy metals...|$|E

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis is concerned principally with the preparation, photochemistry, and structural chemistry of some platinum metal complexes. The work is in two parts. The first part is {{a study of the}} photochemistry of complexes of the stoichiometric type M(NO) XnL₂ n = 2 or 3 for M = Ru, Rh, Os, Ir; X = Cl, Br, I; and L = R₂s, R₂se, Ph₃P, Ph₃As, and Ph₃ Sb, and the second part is on the preparative and structural chemistries of halogeno- complexes of iridium, ruthenium and rhodium. The main photochemical reaction observed was oxidation of the ligand (R₂S and R₂Se to R₂SO and R₂Seo, and R₃E to R₃E to R₃EO for E = P, As, Sb), and in many instances the oxidised ligand subsequently coordinated to the complex. The oxidation is achieved with nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂) for the <b>organosulphides,</b> organoselenides, triphenylphosphine and triphenylarsine, whereas for the triphenylstibine, O₂ appears to be the oxidisng agent. The photochemical reactions of the nitrosyl complexes were investigated using ¹H n. m. r., infrared, UV-visible and mass spectrometric methods. The X-ray single crystal structures were determined on some starting materials and on some crystalline materials isolated during preparations of the complexes investigated in this work. The structures determined were; RhCl₃(Et₂s) ₂(Et₂SO), space group P 1, a = 9372 (4) Å, b = 9. 608 (5) Å, c = 12. 449 (6) Å, α = 79. 52 (4) °, β = 86. 88 (3), Υ = 70. 66 (3) °; Os(NO) Br₃(Et₂S) (Et₂SO) space group P 2 ₁/c, a = 13. 398 (3) Å, b= 8. 501 (2) Å, c = 16. 199 (3) Å, β = 105. 69 (1) °; Ru(NO) Br₃(Et₂PPh) ₂ space group P 2 ₁/c, a = 13. 505 (2) Å, b = 7. 389 (0) Å, c = 24. 492 (3) Å, β = 91. 22 (1), and Os(NO) Cl₂(Et₂PPh) ₂(CH₃OCH₂CH₂O) space group P 2 ₁/c; a= 10. 869 (1) Å, b = 11. 381 (1) Å, c= 22. 673 (2) Å β = 102. 17 (1) °.

40|$|La désodorisation physico-chimique en {{stations}} d'épuration s'effectue généralement par lavage basique oxydant pour piéger les espèces soufrées réduites telles que H 2 S ou CH 3 SH. L'utilisation du peroxyde d'hydrogène n'est pas encore répandue en comparaison de celle du chlore. Cette étude a été menée afin de déterminer le comportement de H 2 O 2 {{en fonction}} de la composition de l'eau de lavage. L'influence des paramètres : concentration en métaux (fer, manganèse, cuivre et zinc), pH, [H 2 O 2], [CO 32 -], [HS-] a été étudiée en utilisant un plan d'expériences. La décomposition de H 2 O 2 et la concentration de radicaux libres ont été mesurées pour chaque expérience. En présence de métaux, un pH élevé et une forte concentration en peroxyde sont les deux paramètres principalement responsables d'une forte décomposition. Cette décomposition serait accompagnée d'une production de radicaux avec [HO°]max = 10 - 13 M. Cette valeur mesurée de radicaux dans le milieu n'explique qu'une petite part de la décomposition de peroxyde observée. Par conséquent, la majorité de la décomposition est due à des réactions soit à la surface des oxydes, soit en solution avec les cations dissous. Le mélange de métaux et de carbonates à pH 10, 5 présente un effet de synergie sur la décomposition de H 2 O 2. Ces résultats démontrent que malgré le pouvoir oxydant des radicaux HO° formés, l'utilisation de H 2 O 2 en désodorisation ne sera possible qu'avec l'ajout de stabilisant. Deodorization of {{wastewater treatment plants}} involves the elimination of molecules such as NH 3, amines and sulphur compounds like H 2 S and mercaptans. In classical physico-chemical processes, NH 3 and amines are trapped in acid solution by washing air in a scrubbing tower, while sulphides are eliminated in basic oxidising solutions. The oxidant usually used is sodium hypochlorite. Elimination of sulphides and <b>organosulphides</b> generally demands two scrubbers: one at pH 9 and the other at pH 11. Because chlorine in deodorization generates the formation of organochlorinated species, it should soon become necessary to replace this oxidant {{in order to avoid}} the formation of such compounds. The present study follows the behaviour in wash conditions not of chlorine, but hydrogen peroxide, in order to discover the deodorization capacity of this molecule. The kinetics of H 2 S oxidation by H 2 O 2 are well known; the constant is given by log k = 12. 04 - (2641 /T) - 0. 186 x pH (Millero et al., 1989). Unfortunately H 2 O 2 shows strong decomposition in alkaline medium, due to the presence of metals and carbonates in the solution. Initiating a homolytic reaction results in the decomposition of peroxide. However, increasing the concentration of free radicals may improve H 2 S oxidation and consequently, the efficiency of the process. To better understand the behaviour of H 2 O 2 in wash conditions, various parameters were studied, namely pH (9 and 10. 5), [H 2 O 2] (1 and 5 g L- 1), metal concentrations (iron, manganese, copper and zinc) (20 and 200 µg L- 1), [CO 32 -] (0 and 100 mg L- 1) and [HS-] (0 and 2 mg L- 1). Four experimental designs, one for each metal, were employed to reduce the number of experiments and benefit from statistical laws. H 2 O 2 decomposition and HO° concentration were measured and empirical equations established. All experiments were performed in closed-batch reactors with ultra-pure reactants and water. Measurements of HO° concentrations necessitated the addition of atrazine to the solution. The oxidation of this pesticide by HO° is well known. Using atrazine concentrations measured through time, the HO° concentrations were calculated according to the equationln ([Atz] 0 /[Atz]) = k[HO∘]twith k= 2. 1 × 109 M- 1 s- 1 (De Laat et al., 1997). Oxidation of atrazine was halted by extraction onto a Ct 18 Sep-Pack resin and samples were analysed by liquid chromatography. The results showed that in the presence of metals H 2 O 2 decomposition was maximal at high pH and with high peroxide concentrations. The decomposition was accompanied by HO° production. However, the presence of metals generated the decomposition of H 2 O 2 with a reduced production of free radicals compared with ultra-pure water, which indicates that metal oxides were not only decomposition catalysts, but also radical inhibitors. Comparison of simplified radical decomposition, calculated according to the equation([H 2 O 2]/[H 2 O 2] 0) =e-k[HO∘]t,and observed decomposition showed that under these conditions H 2 O 2 consumption was mainly due to metal reactivity. Nonetheless, increasing iron and copper concentrations from 20 to 200 µg L- 1 did not modify the decomposition rate of H 2 O 2. For this reason we postulate a Fenton-like reaction between H 2 O 2 and dissolved metals in which concentrations are determined by solubility products. It follows that the kinetics of H 2 O 2 decomposition can be summarised by r=-k 1 [oxide][H 2 O 2] - k 2 [Mn+][H 2 O 2] - k 3 [HO°][H 2 O 2], with [metal]Tot =[Mn+] + [oxide] and, in the case of Cu and Fe, k 1 [oxide][H 2 O 2] << k 2 [Mn+][H 2 O 2]. To conclude, the addition of four metals with [CO 32 -]= 1 g L- 1 at pH 10. 5 produces a synergetic effect, resulting in a much faster decomposition. These conditions, unfortunately, resemble deodorization conditions. The use of a stabiliser that inhibits not only free radicals but also decomposition catalysts is therefore necessary for deodorization...|$|R
