5|$|American {{businessman}} and philanthropist Armand Hammer, {{well known to}} the Soviet Union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties, left Los Angeles for Armenia on board a Boeing 727 loaded with 2,300 pounds of medical supplies that were provided by the American Red Cross. Hammer, known for his decades <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had spoken with Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, {{and the other half}} were his own personal donation. The flight also carried Robert Seiple (president of World Vision) and a UCLA doctor who had worked {{in the aftermath of the}} 1985 Mexico City earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, while America {{geared up}} for front line {{involvement}} in World War II, Pflueger received fewer assignments {{than he had}} been seeing previously. Grover Magnin kept a flow <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> I. Magnin designs, and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden, Utah. He began to draw up plans for a 12-story cross-shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California, San Francisco (eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger). His firm accepted a commission to excavate below the Mark Hopkins Hotel {{in order to create a}} bomb-resistant radio transmission center for AM station KSFO and shortwave programs of the Voice of America. This space became the hotel's underground parking garage after the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{bacterium}} can {{be grown}} and cultured easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. E. coli is a chemoheterotroph whose chemically defined medium must include a source of carbon and energy. E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species {{in the fields of}} biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> recombinant DNA.

5|$|The {{original}} {{request for}} proposals for a heavy escort fighter (Tyazholyy Istrebitel' Soprovozhdeniya) was received at the Polikarpov OKB in November 1938, but the press <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the I-180 and SPB prototypes prevented any significant design work until {{the third quarter of}} 1940. Mikhail Yangel was appointed head designer, but his job was complicated by multiple changes {{in the role of the}} aircraft from escort fighter to interceptor, dive bomber, and eventually reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and widescreen movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E

He spent 1959 through 1961 as editor of Criticism, a journal of literary criticism, and finished his Continuation cycle in 1962. While he did not publish any more major works until 1971's Ta piimata 1941-1971, (The Poems 1941-1971), he continued to contribute to newspapers and magazines.|$|E
25|$|The {{first few}} decades <b>of</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> APT focused on metals. However, more recent {{work has been}} done on semiconductors, ceramic and {{geologic}} materials, with some work on biomaterials. The most advanced study of biological material to date using APT involved analyzing the chemical structure of teeth of the radula of chiton Chaetopleura apiculata. In this study, the use of APT showed chemical maps of organic fibers in the surrounding nano-crystalline magnetite in the chiton teeth, fibers which were often co-located with sodium or magnesium. This has been furthered to study elephant tusks, dentin and potentially human enamel.|$|E
