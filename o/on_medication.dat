5|$|After {{the initial}} reports, Donaghy stayed at his home, {{before moving to}} a secure {{location}} to avoid the media scrutiny. He surrendered on August 15, 2007, and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy. He told judges that he had used coded language to tip others about players' physical condition and player/referee relations, and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006–07 season. In total, he received $30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies. Donaghy also {{admitted that he had}} a severe gambling addiction, and was <b>on</b> <b>medication</b> to address it. He was released on a $250,000 bond.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary was {{involved}} in a second altercation at around 3am on 13 July 2008, again in Central. Short of cash with which to pay the HK$17.80 taxi fare, she proffered her credit card. When the taxi driver refused, Bokhary angrily flung her credit card in the driver's face; she kicked him when he prevented her from leaving the scene. The police were called. As she was being questioned by the two officers, Bokhary struck one of them. She {{was arrested and charged with}} common assault and assaulting a police officer. She was <b>on</b> <b>medication</b> and had taken wine prior to the incident. Pleading guilty to both charges in November 2008, she was sentenced to 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay the driver HK$1,000 in compensation.|$|E

The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, {{three months after the}} disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was <b>on</b> <b>medication.</b> No trace of drugs was found.|$|E

5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of a person {{suffering}} from depression, and the story centers on their daily life, including encounters at work and their relationship with their girlfriend. The story also features various treatments for depression. Players are periodically faced with choices that alter the course of the story. To make a choice, the player must click on the corresponding hyperlink. However, choices are often crossed out and cannot be clicked on, a mechanism that Depression Quest uses to portray the character's mental state and the fact that logical decisions may not be available to them. Beneath the choices presented to the player are a set of statements about the character, indicating their level of depression, {{whether or not they are}} in therapy, and whether or not they are currently <b>on</b> <b>medication.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Expenditure <b>on</b> <b>medications</b> {{for highly}} {{prevalent}} chronic {{conditions such as}} diabetes mellitus (DM) can result in financial impoverishment. People in developing countries and in low socioeconomic status groups are particularly vulnerable. China and India currently hold the world’s two largest DM populations. Both countries are ageing and undergoing rapid economic development, urbanisation and social change. This paper assesses the determinants of DM medication use and catastrophic expenditure <b>on</b> <b>medications</b> in older adults with DM in China and India. Methods: Using national standardised data collected from adults aged 50 years and above with DM (self-reported) in China (N[*]=[*] 773) and India (N[*]=[*] 463), multivariable logistic regression describes: 1) association between respondents’ socio-demographic and health behavioural characteristics and the dependent variable, DM medication use, and 2) association between DM medication use (independent variable) and household catastrophic expenditure <b>on</b> <b>medications</b> (dependent variable) (China: N[*]=[*] 630; India: N[*]=[*] 439). The data source is the World Health Organization (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Wave 1 (2007 – 2010). Results: Prevalence of DM medication use was 87 % in China and 71 % in India. Multivariable analysis indicates that people reporting lifestyle modification {{were more likely to}} use DM medications in China (OR[*]=[*] 6. 22) and India (OR[*]=[*] 8. 45). Women were more likely to use DM medications in China (OR[*]=[*] 1. 56). Respondents in poorer wealth quintiles in China were more likely to use DM medications whereas the reverse was true in India. Almost 17 % of people with DM in China experienced catastrophic healthcare expenditure <b>on</b> <b>medications</b> compared with 7 % in India. Diabetes medication use was not a statistically significant predictor of catastrophic healthcare expenditure <b>on</b> <b>medications</b> in either country, although the odds were 33 % higher among DM medications users in China (OR[*]=[*] 1. 33). Conclusions: The country comparison reflects major public policy differences underpinned by divergent political and ideological frameworks. The DM epidemic poses huge public health challenges for China and India. Ensuring equitable and affordable access to medications for DM is fundamental for healthy ageing cohorts, and is consistent with the global agenda for universal healthcare coverage...|$|R

25|$|Following his {{election}} in April 2005 {{there were several}} rumors about the Pope's health, {{but none of them}} were confirmed. Early in his pontificate Benedict XVI predicted a short reign, which led to concerns about his health. In May 2005 the Vatican announced that he had suffered another mild stroke. French Cardinal Philippe Barbarin said that since the first stroke Ratzinger had been suffering from an age-related heart condition, for which he was <b>on</b> <b>medication.</b> In late November 2006 Vatican insiders told the international press that the Pope had had a routine examination of the heart. A few days later an unconfirmed rumor emerged that Pope Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation, but this rumor was only published by a small left-wing Italian newspaper and was never confirmed by any Vatican insider.|$|E

25|$|The {{court can}} impose a {{condition}} that a defendant not consume alcohol. Courts can prohibit use of other legally-obtained intoxicants as well.

The court can order outpatient drug abuse treatment and alcohol testing even if the defendant has no history of drug or alcohol abuse, if the defendant has attempted suicide by overdosing <b>on</b> <b>medication</b> and {{has a history of}} unstable behavior. The court may waive the statutory drug testing requirement if the presentence report or other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future substance abuse, but in some circuits is not required to do so although at least one defendant was not required to under mandatory drug testing as part of his probation where the offense was not drug-related and the defendant did not have a history of drug abuse.

He had waking graphic flashbacks that caused him to freeze, reliving a life-threatening moment on the battlefield. His first wife Wanda Hendrix stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being moved to tears by newsreel footage of German war orphans, guilt-ridden that his war actions might have been the cause of their having no parents. As others had noticed since his return from Europe, Hendrix said his dreams were punctuated with the battles he had fought. She tried to coax him into seeking psychiatric help. During a publicity tour in 1952, his dreams caused him to beat the wall of his motel room until his fists bled.|$|E
