5|$|Despite the {{fluctuating}} critical {{assessment of}} the various works over the years, Elgar's major works {{taken as a whole}} have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. The Record Guide in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the Enigma Variations, one of Falstaff, and none <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> of Gerontius. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, {{and more than a dozen}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> of Gerontius. Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed. The Elgar Society's website, in its diary of forthcoming performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{suggested}} the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> split to Nye, {{who was also}} influenced by his own dreams and sometimes wondering if they were real. Nye believed that the dream world was consistent with other alternate universes within Doctor Who. Moffat also instructed Nye {{to come up with}} a monster, and Nye chose the elderly people possessed by the Eknodine, reflecting his own fear of old people as a child, but he made clear that he did not intend to make children scared of their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of Dream Drop Distance is the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> Eaters. Whilst they generally serve as the main enemies of the game, up to three good Dream Eaters, known as Spirits, can be recruited per character {{to assist them in}} battle. Spirits can be created by combining Dream Fragments together with an item or spell, either via experimenting with combinations or using recipes found throughout the game. Characters can also link with Spirits to perform unique attacks. Along the way, the player can care for these Spirits by petting them, feeding them items, or playing mini-games with them, which can unlock new abilities for the Spirits.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before Christmas 1095, one of St-Calais' knights, Boso, {{fell ill}} and dreamed he was {{transported to the}} afterlife, where he found a large house with gates made of iron. Suddenly, St-Calais emerged from the gates, asking the knight the {{whereabouts}} {{of one of his}} servants. Boso's guide in the dream then informed Boso that this was a warning that St-Calais would soon die. Boso recovered and warned St-Calais <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream.</b>|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, announced the death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist economics and argued that Keynesian economics were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|Attica is a war-torn city {{under assault}} by the Persian Empire and their pet basilisk, {{and is the}} site of Eurybiades' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> God, Morpheus. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, which sits atop the Sun Chariot, which has {{plummeted}} to Earth in Helios' absence. Boreas, Zephyros, Euros, and Notos, gods of the north, west, east, and south winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is an underground cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess Eos, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of Triton. The Underworld is the underground realm of the dead and is host to the River Styx and ferryman of the dead, Charon. Tartarus is the prison of the dead and the Titans where the massive Titan Hyperion is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis and {{medication}} {{can only be}} given to patients that report the recurring nightmares to a psychiatrist or other physician. Medications like prazosin are sometimes used to treat nightmares in people with PTSD. Therapy usually helps to deal with <b>the</b> frightening themes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nightmares and alleviate <b>the</b> recurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dreams.</b> <b>The</b> persistent nightmares will usually improve as the patient gets older. Treatments are generally very successful.|$|R
5|$|Following {{service in}} the First World War, Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar, and was {{particularly}} admired both as the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion and {{in the title role}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> of Gerontius. He was a champion of music by English composers of his generation, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton. He also appeared {{from time to time in}} operatic tenor roles, including Satyavan in the first professional performance of Holst's Savitri. The quality of his voice and even his technique, though, was not universally admired. In a high-profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter, and the BBC for publishing it: he won £2,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} arc, Air, Yukito's final wish to save Misuzu's life is heard. The {{timeline}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dream</b> arc has been reset, {{although it is}} now seen through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.|$|E
5|$|They {{eventually}} meet up {{with the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), {{who is trying to}} outrun giant monsters made up of morphed-together penguins. Finn and Jake then see their father, Joshua, knitting a scarf. The scarf turns into the King Worm, and the duo give chase. On the top of a mountain, they find the worm frozen, and Finn manages to shatter it, seemingly waking the two from their dream state. However, Finn soon discovers that he is still dreaming and that Jake was not actually with him, but rather another figment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream.</b> The King Worm actually presents himself and taunts Finn. Finn, however, unleashes his subconscious fears, and the emotional trauma begins to destroy the dreamscape, weakening King Worm's hold. Eventually, the fears become so powerful that the King Worm is defeated, and Finn wakes up in the real world. He and Jake promptly evicted the King Worm from their house.|$|E

5|$|The scene {{changes to}} the court of Giuki, the Niblung king. Giuki's {{daughter}} Gudrun has a dream in which she encounters a beautiful but ominous falcon and takes it to her breast. Anxious to learn the meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> she rides to visit Brynhild, who tells her that she will marry a king, but that her life will be darkened by war and death. Gudrun returns home. Sigurd revisits Brynhild and they again declare their love for each other. He then rides to the Niblung court, where he joins them in making war on the Southland, winning great glory for himself. The witch Grimhild, Gudrun's mother, gives Sigurd a potion that makes him fall in love with Gudrun. Completely under her spell, he marries her and sets out to win Brynhild for Gudrun's brother Gunnar. Visiting Brynhild again, this time magically disguised as Gunnar, and again penetrating the fire that surrounds her, he reminds her that she is promised to whoever can overcome the supernatural fire, and so deceives her into reluctantly vowing to marry Gunnar. Brynhild goes to the Niblung land and carries out her promise. She is distraught at this tragic outcome, and doubly so when Gudrun spitefully tells her of the trick by which Sigurd deceived her into an unwanted wedding. Brynhild now urges Gunnar and his brothers Hogni and Guttorm to kill Sigurd. Guttorm murders Sigurd as he lies in bed, but the dying Sigurd throws his sword and kills Guttorm as he leaves. Brynhild, filled with remorse, commits suicide so that she and Sigurd can be burned on a single funeral pyre.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>Dream's</b> concept in <b>the</b> two essential pieces of American literature: Francis Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby and Norman Mailer's An American <b>Dream.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text focuses on <b>the</b> general definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>Dream</b> and its development throughout <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. It aims at exposing <b>the</b> close relationship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>Dream</b> and <b>the</b> American national consciousness {{in terms of}} self-reliance, individualism and freedom. The analytical part concentrates on isolating the individual literary motifs of each novel that {{can be regarded as}} related to <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>Dream.</b> It discusses <b>the</b> central characters as well as dramatic aspects <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Great Gatsby and An American Dream in order to prove <b>the</b> American <b>Dream</b> to represent an essential theme in their literary frameworks. As a conclusion the thesis presents the opinion that each author elaborates this theme differently. Both novels, however, expose <b>the</b> individual version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>Dream</b> as being defeated in a struggle against <b>the</b> collective nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century American society restricting <b>the</b> efforts <b>of</b> an individual for his or her self-realization.

50|$|Freud's {{process of}} {{psychoanalysis}} is often quite lengthy and complex, {{as was the}} case with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dreams</b> in his book <b>The</b> Interpretation <b>of</b> <b>Dreams</b> (1899). An obstacle that faces the non-German-speaking reader is such that in original German, <b>The</b> Interpretation <b>of</b> <b>Dreams,</b> Freud's emphasis on 'slips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tongue' leads to <b>the</b> inclusion <b>of</b> a great deal of coloquial and informal material that are extremely resilient to translations.|$|R
