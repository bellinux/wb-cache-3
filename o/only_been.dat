Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have <b>only</b> <b>been</b> detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E

5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has <b>only</b> <b>been</b> researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder.
