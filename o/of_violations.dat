5|$|After seeing Ned Flanders reject {{an offer}} from a crooked cable man to get an illegal cable hook-up for $50, Homer chases after the cable man and takes the offer. Homer likes the new {{channels}} and {{spends a lot of}} time watching the television along with his family. Lisa, however, feels suspicious about the cable hook-up. Following a Sunday school lesson regarding the existence and nature of Hell, Lisa becomes terrified <b>of</b> <b>violations</b> of the Ten Commandments, the adherence to which she is assured will keep one's soul safe from Hell. She fears that because Homer violated the Eighth Commandment, he will go to Hell when he dies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sampled convex {{programs}} are studied {{to deal with}} convex optimization problems including uncertainty. A deterministic approach called robust optimization is commonly applied to solve these problems. On the other hand, sampled convex {{programs are}} randomized approach based on constraint sampling. Calafiore and Campi have proposed sufficient number of samples such that only small portion of original constraints are violated at randomized solution. Our main concern {{is not only the}} probability <b>of</b> <b>violation,</b> but also the degree <b>of</b> <b>violation,</b> that is, the worst-case violation. We derive an upper bound <b>of</b> the worst-case <b>violation</b> for sampled convex programs under general uncertainty set, and provide the relation between the probability <b>of</b> <b>violation</b> and the worst-case violation. As well as the probability <b>of</b> <b>violation,</b> the degree <b>of</b> <b>violation</b> is also assured to be depressed to small value with sufficiently large number of random samples.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1938 Adolf Hitler {{personally}} stated that gaining Klaipėda {{was one of his}} highest priorities, second only to gaining the Sudetenland. When Poland presented its ultimatum to Lithuania in March 1938, Germany openly declared that {{in the event of a}} military clash between Poland and Lithuania, its army would invade Lithuania to capture Klaipėda and a large portion of western Lithuania. A week after Lithuania accepted the Polish ultimatum, Germany presented an eleven-point memorandum that demanded freedom of action for pro-German activists in the region and a lessening of Lithuanian influence there. Its points were worded in a deliberately vague manner, which would enable Germany to accuse Lithuania <b>of</b> <b>violations.</b> Lithuania chose to postpone dealing with the problem, hoping that the international situation would improve. In the meantime it hoped to give the German population no reasons for complaint.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Greeks of Thessalonica sent an embassy to the Great Council to {{complain}} <b>of</b> <b>violations</b> {{of their rights}} by the duke and captain. Among other things, they insisted that the Venetians fortify Kassandreia on the western Chalcidice, to protect the Kassandra Peninsula from Ottoman raids. In response, Michiel occupied the fort of Kassandreia, which he refortified and strengthened by the construction of two smaller forts in the area. He also captured the Platamon Castle, {{on the opposite side}} of the Thermaic Gulf, by storm, after setting fire to its main bailey as the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. Platamon was repaired but probably abandoned soon after, for it is not mentioned again. Following Michiel's request, the Great Council sent 200 men from Padua to man Thessalonica and the forts of Kassandreia, and authorised the captain-general to maintain four galleys in the area. From his letters to the Great Council, Michiel was also engaged in negotiations with the Ottomans, as part of which he offered 20,000 aspers a year to the Ottoman governor of Thessaly, Turahan Bey, and to the Grand Vizier. At the same time, according to the Codex Morosini, a pretender claiming to be Mustafa Çelebi arrived in Thessalonica, and gathered a growing following of Turks who considered him to be the true son of Sultan Bayezid. Pseudo-Mustafa launched raids against Murad's forces from the city, but after both Mustafa and the Venetian captain were almost captured during one of these raids, on 3 September the Great Council issued instructions to stop such raids, and keep the gates of the city shut.|$|E
