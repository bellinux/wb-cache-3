5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal opportunity costs <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms <b>of</b> <b>guns.</b> If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> in terms of butter is 4.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} city levels <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> availability and individual assault and robbery victimization. Existing theoretical approaches to guns and crime are integrated with opportunity theory to provide a richer understanding of the dynamic between guns and crime. Data for this analysis are drawn from a sample of 45, 913 individuals nested in 39 cities in developing nations. Results of a multi-level, cross-national examination using hierarchical linear modeling indicate that city levels <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> availability influence individual odds <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> crime victimization, but not individual odds of overall crime victimization. This suggests that individuals who live in cities with high levels <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> availability have higher odds of being the victim <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> assault or gun robbery than individuals who live in cities with low levels <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> availability. The results, however, find little support for the proposition that city-level gun availability interacts with individual behavior to influence individual odds of assault or robbery victimization...|$|R

50|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that higher rates <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> {{ownership}} are associated with higher homicide rates, although Gary Kleck argues that the highest-quality studies show that gun ownership does not increase homicide rates. Higher rates <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> ownership are also associated with higher suicide rates and higher accidental gun death rates. The availability <b>of</b> illegal <b>guns,</b> but not that <b>of</b> legal <b>guns,</b> is associated with higher rates of violent crime.|$|R

5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> and ammunition for the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number <b>of</b> <b>guns</b> that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E

40|$|Gun {{violence}} in the United States of America is a large public health problem that disproportionately affects urban areas. The epidemiology <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> violence reflects various aspects of an infectious disease including spatial and temporal clustering. We examined the spatial and temporal trends <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> {{violence in}} Syracuse, New York, a city of 145, 000. We used a spatial scan statistic to reveal spatio-temporal clusters of gunshots investigated and corroborated by Syracuse City Police Department for the years 2009 - 2015. We also examined predictors of areas with increased gun violence using a multi-level zero-inflated Poisson regression with data from the 2010 census. Two space-time clusters <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> violence were revealed in the city. Higher rates of segregation, poverty and the summer months were all associated with increased risk <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> violence. Previous gunshots in the area were associated with a 26. 8 % increase in the risk <b>of</b> <b>gun</b> violence. Gun violence in Syracuse, NY is both spatially and temporally stable, with some neighborhoods of the city greatly afflicted...|$|R
