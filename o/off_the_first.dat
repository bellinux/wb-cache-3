The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|He then top-scored with 190 in the Third Test in Sydney {{to set up}} a large first innings lead of 270 and an innings victory. Harvey alone {{made more}} than his opponents in the first innings and the innings saw him {{complete}} 1000 Test runs against the South Africans in only eight Tests. Harvey made it consecutive centuries in as many matches, with 84 and 116 in Adelaide. Starting with an on-driven boundary <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> ball of the last day's play, Harvey's century took 106 minutes and was the fastest record in the Australia since World War II and the sixth fastest of all time in Australia. With leading pacemen Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller breaking down in the match, Harvey bowled for only the third time in his Test career. He took his first of three wickets at Test level, that of Russell Endean as a depleted Australian attack could not defeat the visitors who finished seven wickets down.|$|E

5|$|In June 2001, Ripken {{announced}} he would retire {{at the end of}} the season. He was voted the starting third baseman in the All-Star Game at Seattle's Safeco Field on July 10, 2001. In a tribute to Ripken's achievements and stature in the game, shortstop Alex Rodriguez (unknowingly foreshadowing his own future) insisted on exchanging positions with third baseman Ripken for the first inning, so that Ripken could play shortstop as he had for most of his career. That move allowed Ripken to claim the record of most MLB All-Star Game appearances at shortstop. In the third inning, Ripken made his first plate appearance and was greeted with a standing ovation. Ripken then homered <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pitch from Chan Ho Park. Ripken ended up with All-Star MVP honors, becoming one of four players in MLB history with multiple All Star Game MVP Awards (1991 and 2001) and the only player to be named All-Star Game MVP in two different decades.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half {{of extra}} time. Pirlo {{had a chance}} in the early stages, but he put his shot over the crossbar. Tomasson came close in the later stages of the first period of extra time, {{but he could not}} make contact with the ball. Vladimír Šmicer {{required}} treatment for cramp {{towards the end of the}} first period, as a number of Liverpool players felt fatigued. Liverpool had the most of the early exchanges after winning two corners, but could not score. Shortly afterwards, Milan make their final substitution replacing Gennaro Gattuso with Rui Costa. The best chance of the second half came near the end when Shevchenko shot at goal. Dudek saved only for it to rebound back out to Shevchenko, who again shot from under , which Dudek again saved by pushing the shot over the bar. Liverpool had one last chance at the end of extra time, but John Arne Riise's free kick shot was blocked and following this the referee signalled the end of extra time, which meant a penalty shoot-out would decide the championship.|$|E
5|$|Some {{years after}} the events in Tarifa, a quarrel erupted between the Marinids and the Nasrids, in 1306. The Nasrids {{promptly}} sponsored the rebellion of Uthman ibn Idris, a pretender to the Marinid throne in Morocco. Uthman was landed by a Nasrid force in Ceuta, and quickly carved out an enclave. The rebels continued to receive support across the strait from the Nasrid garrisons. It is believed that the Marinid sultan Abu al-Rabi Sulayman, unable to dislodge the rebel from Ceuta, intrigued with the Castilians, whose truce with Granada was about to expire, encouraging them to take Algeciras and Gibraltar and cut the rebel <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> siege of Gibraltar was a side-operation of the main Castilian siege of Algeciras in 1309–10.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{eventually}} captured Hill 311 {{just before}} nightfall, driving <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> battalion of the 23rd Colonial Infantry Regiment with losses. During {{the afternoon of}} the 17th, the Villy artillery casemates were evacuated, while German bombardment continued amid French fire from Chesnois. At about this time, General Huntziger ordered that Villy and La Ferté be relieved to prevent their encirclement, emphasizing the importance of French possession of Hill 311, and directing that the town of Inor to the southwest be held at all costs. General Brochard, responsible for the area, decided to counterattack from the south through Hill 311 to La Ferté using the 3rd North African Infantry Division and the newly arrived 6th Infantry Division. Through the ensuing night La Ferté requested and received supporting fire from Chesnois to suppress German movements on top of the ouvrage.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden goal}} was used during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win.

Ivan Alonso had put {{the ball in the}} Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for fouling Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. Magno was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute {{of the first half of}} extra-time remaining, Fowler thought he had scored the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E
5|$|Granderson led <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> inning with a {{home run}} for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E

5|$|Once {{south of}} the river, Asad, believing himself to be safe from pursuit, ordered his men to set up camp and sent orders to Ibrahim to halt the baggage train and {{likewise}} set up camp. The Turgesh khaghan, after consulting the local rulers, followed {{the advice of the}} ruler of al-Ishtikhan and led his army to cross the river en masse. Faced with a full-scale charge of the Turgesh and their allies' cavalry, the Arabs withdrew to their camp. The Turgesh attacked the camp but were turned back after a fight in which, according to al-Tabari, the Arabs' servants put on pack-saddle cloths as armour and used the tent-poles to strike at the riders' faces.During the night the Turgesh departed, and rode south to overtake the Arab baggage train. Ibrahim ibn Asim had dug a trench around his encampment and his troops managed to beat <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> attacks by the khaghans Sogdian allies. Then the khagan, after climbing a hill and scouting out the dispositions of the baggage escort, dispatched a portion of his men to attack the camp from behind, focusing on the allied Iranian troops from Saghaniyan, {{while the rest of the}} army attacked the Muslims from the front. The Turgesh attack almost annihilated the defenders: the greater part of the troops of Saghaniyan, along with their king, the Saghan Khudah, fell, and the Turgesh seized most of the baggage train. Only the timely arrival of Asad with the main Arab army saved the remnant of the baggage train escort from destruction. According to the account of al-Tabari, the Turgesh launched another unsuccessful attack on Asad's camp the following day, 1 October 737, and then departed.|$|E
