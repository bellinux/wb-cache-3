5|$|Banded sugar ants {{will often}} attack the nests of other ant species at random, while {{ignoring}} other ants nearby. They use their mandibles to hold opponents, and use formic acid to kill them. Foraging workers use visual cues {{to help them}} find their way around, or to let them determine that they are lost; workers will identify landmarks they are familiar with to orientate themselves. When provoked, an individual banded sugar ant will lift up its abdomen and use its large mandibles to fend <b>off</b> <b>an</b> attacker. If further provoked, it can defend itself by spraying formic acid from its abdomen to deter predators.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is to identify characteristics of landscape of steams coming <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hot water in Obama hot spring area, Nagasaki Prefecture, one of the seaside hot spring areas, Japan. The main findings are as follows. (1) The total number of spots where steams come <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hot water is 71. These spots are classified into 7 types based on characteristics of vent fields from which steams come <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hot water. (2) The number of accommodation facilities {{in and around the}} area where steams coming <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hot water occur at a high level is more than in and around the area where steams coming <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hot water occur at a low level. (3) The compositions of vent fields from which steams come <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hot water among areas are different according to the number of accommodation facilities in and around areas and the distance from major roads to areas. Based on these findings, we propose a list of considerations for reviewing the management to develop landscape of steams coming <b>off</b> <b>a</b> hot water with which visitors to the area are easy to being in visual contact. 地域活動に関する実践報告・論文・シンポジウム記...|$|R

5|$|Quite common {{within its}} small range, the {{sluggish}} and reclusive puffadder shyshark {{is often seen}} lying still on the sea floor. It is gregarious and several individuals may rest together. A generalist predator with grasping dentition, the puffadder shyshark is known to take a variety of small benthic prey: crustaceans (including crabs, shrimp, crayfish, mantis shrimp, and hermit crabs), annelid worms (including polychaetes), bony fishes (including anchovies, jack macherels, and gobies), cephalopods (including squid), and fish offal. Overall, the most important component of this shark's diet is crustaceans, followed by polychaetes and then fishes. Males seem to prefer polychaetes, while females prefer crustaceans. It has been observed attacking a common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) by tearing <b>off</b> <b>an</b> arm with a twisting motion.|$|E
