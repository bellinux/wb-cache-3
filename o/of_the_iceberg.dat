This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{modelling}} {{studies have}} indicated that icebergs play {{an active role in the}} climate system as they interact with the ocean and the atmosphere. The icebergs' impact is due to their slowly released meltwater, which freshens and cools the ocean and consequently alters the ocean stratification and the sea-ice conditions. <b>The</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> and their meltwater depends on the atmospheric and oceanic forces acting on them as well as on the initial icebergs' size. The studies conducted so far have in common that <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> were moved by reconstructed or modelled forcing fields and that the initial size distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> was prescribed according to present-day observations. To study <b>the</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modelled <b>iceberg</b> distribution to initial and boundary conditions, we performed 15 sensitivity experiments using the i LOVECLIM climate model that includes actively coupled ice sheet and iceberg modules, to analyse (1) <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmospheric and oceanic forces on <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> transport, mass and melt flux distribution, and (2) <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial <b>iceberg</b> size on <b>the</b> resulting Northern Hemisphere climate including the Greenland ice sheet, due to feedback mechanisms such as altered atmospheric temperatures, under different climate conditions (pre-industrial, high/low radiative forcing). Our results show that, under equilibrated pre-industrial conditions, the oceanic currents cause <b>the</b> <b>icebergs</b> to stay close to the Greenland and North American coast, whereas the atmospheric forcing quickly distributes them further away from their calving site. Icebergs remaining close to Greenland last up to 2 years longer as they reside in generally cooler waters. Moreover, we find that local variations in the spatial distribution due to different iceberg sizes do not result in different climate states and Greenland ice sheet volume, independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevailing climate conditions (pre-industrial, warming or cooling climate). Therefore, we conclude that local differences in <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> their melt flux do not alter the prevailing Northern Hemisphere climate and ice sheet under equilibrated conditions and continuous supply of icebergs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the applied radiative forcing scenarios have a stronger impact on climate than the initial size distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>icebergs...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the past, the Arctic {{underwent}} numerous {{phases of}} glaciation and deglaciation. Compared to modern times where only <b>the</b> mainland <b>of</b> Greenland {{is covered by}} an ice sheet, several kilometers thick ice sheets existed all around the Arctic Ocean during glacial periods. Large ice streams drained these ice sheets across the present-day continental shelves to the oceans. In some locations, the ice sheet still had an ice thickness of more than 1 km at <b>the</b> termination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice streams. From here, huge <b>icebergs</b> calved into <b>the</b> surrounding waters. In phases <b>of</b> rapid deglaciation, <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> calving rate was increased with <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> building <b>iceberg</b> armadas after occasional ice sheet breakup events. Afterwards, <b>the</b> released <b>icebergs</b> drifted with <b>the</b> currents and occasionally grounded at the seafloor where it was shallower than <b>the</b> <b>iceberg</b> draft.
