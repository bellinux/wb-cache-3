40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{influence}} of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> {{on the field}} spread of the aphid-borne bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) in bean was studied in 1972 and 1973. <b>Oil</b> <b>sprays</b> failed to significantly reduce virus spread in the 1972 BYMV experiment. However, the data did suggest that {{the efficiency of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> could be greatly improved by timing the applications to periods of peak aphid activity. Several factors were identified which could have contributed to the failure of <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> to reduce the incidence of BYMV in 1972. An excessive time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application resulted in a considerable amount of virus spread within all of the plots before any <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were applied. In addition, some of the treatments were subject to a disproportionate number of the dispersing aphid population which resulted in non-uniform virus spread throughout the study area. And all treatments were exposed for an excessive length of time to the gladioli or primary virus reservoir. As a result, the <b>oil</b> <b>sprayed</b> areas were subject to extreme pressure from the secondary and primary virus reservoirs. Results of the 1973 BYMV field experiment clearly indicate that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> can protect bean plants against spread of BYMV under field conditions. A number of changes in the experimental design were responsible for the overall success of the 1973 experiment. The time lag between bean emergence and the first oil application was eliminated. This change prevented an excessive amount of virus spread early in the season, thus eliminating the high, non-differential virus spread that results when {{there is a lack of}} virus protection early in the season. And the exposure period of beans to the gladioli, primary virus source, was substantially reduced so that <b>oil</b> <b>sprays</b> were directed against the secondary virus source and not both primary and secondary virus sources. Harvest data collected during 1973 indicated that an increase in plant weight may not occur as a result of virus reduction by <b>oil</b> <b>sprays.</b> The data suggest that repeated applications of oil may bring about a physiological response resulting in an increase in plant weight unrelated to virus reduction...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> system is established. Design/methodology/approach: Spraying lubrication is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the roller cage is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of roller cage {{may be related to}} the <b>spraying</b> mode of <b>oil.</b> For high-speed rolling bearing,the roller cage shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating <b>oil</b> not <b>sprayed</b> into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the <b>spraying</b> mode of <b>oil</b> supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, <b>spraying</b> angle, <b>oil</b> pressure, oil viscosity, structure of roller cage shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of <b>oil</b> <b>spraying</b> was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system. Originality/value: The computer simulation allows to better understand the interdependence betweenparameters of process and choosing optimal solution...|$|R

Prior to the second growth cycle, the spraying system was optimized to improve the distribution of oil and reduce the generation of small oil particles. We measured ventilation rate and concentrations of PM 10, PM 2. 5, ammonia, and odor. Furthermore, we recorded bird performance and birds' exterior quality. PM 10 emission was significantly reduced by 59 % at 8 mL m- 2 d- 1 and by 64 % at 16 mL m- 2 d- 1. For PM 2. 5, these values were 81 % and 74 %, respectively.

5000|$|Tajikistan Orchard Management: Akmal Dekhan Farm sits on 21 {{hectares}} in Sughd province, producing sweet apricot {{varieties that}} are in high demand in local markets. It is located in Tajikistan’s portion of the Fergana Valley, a large triangular and very fertile valley in what is an often dry part of Central Asia. Sughd province is the country’s breadbasket, with the most productive farmland {{in a country with}} only six percent arable land. However, agricultural practices remain antiquated, leaving productivity well below its full potential. F2F staff analyzed Akmal Dekhan Farm and determined that its major challenge was low productivity as a result of outdated orchard management techniques, which kept sales and income for the farm low. F2F volunteer Brian Flanagan, an international agriculture and rural development specialist from New York, visited Sughd province for two weeks to train a group of orchard farmers on proper pruning and grafting techniques. Mr. Flanagan also trained owners on the importance of soil testing and collected a number of soil samples from Akmal Farm, sharing the results and recommendations on proper fertilization once tests results returned. Finally, the volunteer demonstrated an inexpensive, non-toxic dormant <b>oil</b> <b>spray</b> that can be easily mixed using readily available ingredients and is highly effective at controlling many diseases and pests that afflict fruit trees. Mr. Flanagan’s time with Akmal was well spent. Over the course of one growing season, gross sales increased 32 percent, while productivity jumped nearly 30 percent to 66,800 kilos. F2F assistance in orchard management and improved production practices has helped farmers satisfy local demand while increasing incomes and sustainability for their businesses.|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of liquid smoke to food {{has grown to}} encompass {{a wide variety of}} methods employing thousands of commercial formulations worldwide. By far the widest use of liquid smoke is for the purpose of replacing direct smoking of food with onsite-generated smoke from wood. To impart the desired functional effects of smoke, liquid smoke preparations must be applied topically. In addition to flavor, reaction color, anti-microbial, and texture effects are the functionalities that can only be obtained by topical addition followed by thermal processing. Dipping products in diluted solutions or soaking them in brines containing liquid smoke followed by heating was done long before the modern industrial era using Wright’s liquid smoke and pyroligneous acid precursors. Allen patented a method of regenerating smoke using air atomization. It remains the leading technology for using condensed smoke products to treat processed meat, cheese, fish, and other foods in batch smokehouses. As the meat-processing industry has consolidated, continuous processes have evolved and direct applications of solutions of liquid smoke via showering or drenching systems installed on continuous lines have grown to be the largest type of application method. In North America there are more than thirty-five processed-meat plants utilizing bulk tanks to receive tankers of liquid smoke for topical application as an alternative to direct wood smoking. Also noteworthy is the method of topical application by impregnation of fibrous, laminated, and plastic casings. Meat products are subsequently stuffed into these casings and thermally processed. The use of natural condensed smoke preparations internally in food is another important means of imparting smoke flavor. It is used when other technical functions of smoke are not imperative to be expressed in a finished food. This can be done directly by adding into blenders with meat or other foods or injecting whole muscle meat. Incorporation into sauces such as barbeque or dry seasonings and compounding with other flavors are other important ways in which the flavors are used. Further utility of aqueous smoke solutions is gained by the use of more complex food-grade processing such as extraction into <b>oil,</b> <b>spray</b> drying using maltodextrin carriers, or plating onto foods and food ingredients such as malt flour, yeast, or salt.|$|E
