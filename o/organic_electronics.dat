2500|$|Several {{physical}} properties of CMPs {{can be attributed}} to their extended conjugation or microporosity. Much like conductive metals, conjugated polymers exhibit electronic bands. [...] The electrons of the conjugated system occupy the valence band and removal of electrons from this band or addition of electrons to the higher energy conductive band can lead to conductivity. [...] Conjugated materials can in many cases [...] absorb visible light because of their delocalized π-system. [...] These properties have led to applications in <b>organic</b> <b>electronics</b> and organic photonics. [...] CMPs exhibit a high level of tunability with respect to surface area and pore size. [...] Monomers can be designed with longer rigid moieties to increase surface area. [...] The series of CMP-1,4 to CMP-5 shows a dramatic increase in surface area from 500 m2/g to 1000 m2/g. [...] The increase in surface area can drastically improve their ability to be filled with various organic and inorganic compounds for different applications. [...] The increased surface area can also improve gas sorption capabilities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A shoe insole pedometer, which {{consists}} of a piezo-electric energy harvester and a 2 V organic pedometer circuit, has been developed {{as a first step}} toward the application of flexible large-area energy harvesting. A pseudo-CMOS 14 bit step counter records the number of steps up to 16383 steps using the harvested power. To increase the noise margin of the pseudo-CMOS logic cir-cuits, a negative voltage is generated by an organic charge pump circuit and is applied to the pseudo-CMOS inverters and trans-mission gates in the flip-flops in the step counter. A pseudo-CMOS Schmitt trigger inverter used to feed clean square pulses to the step counter is presented.

40|$|To fully {{realize the}} {{advantages}} of <b>organic</b> flexible <b>electronics,</b> patterning is very important. In this paper we show that a purely additive patterning technique, termed polymer inking and stamping, {{can be used to}} pattern conductive polymer PEDOT and fabricate sub-micron channel length organic thin film transistors. In addition, we applied the technique to transfer a stack of metal/conjugated polymer in one step and fabricated working polymer light-emitting devices. Based on the polymer inking and stamping technique, a roll-to-roll printing for high throughput fabrication has been demonstrated. We investigated and explained the mechanism of this process based on the interfacial energy consideration and by using the finite element analysis. This technique can be further extended to transfer more complex stacked layer structures, which may benefit the research on patterning on flexible substrates. ...|$|R
