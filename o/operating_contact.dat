40|$|Abstract—The contact {{resistances}} of 2300 elastomer button contacts {{used for}} LGA (land grid array) package interconnections were measured over {{a range of}} contact loads. The experimental data, fitted using three probability distribution functions, show that an inverse Gaussian distribution best describes elastomer button contact resistance behavior. Using this probability function, the minimum <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> load necessary for a desired socket operating reliability can be determined.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} ohmic {{switches}} allowing sequential switching of multiple contacts {{to improve the}} device reliability are proposed. The switches {{are based on a}} novel design concept featuring bidirectional operation using both piezoelectric and electrostatic actuation. To enhance the hot switching capabilities two sequentially <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> groups are introduced, enabling the protection of the low resistive contact by a more reliable contact. Measurement results of fabricated MEMS switches have proven that reliable sequential switching is achieved independently from the contact gap and actuation mode. Furthermore, the switches feature very low contact resistances of less than 0. 3 Ω and are able to overcome contact sticking under hot switching by applying bidirectional actuation...|$|E

50|$|The {{other common}} {{overload}} protection system uses an electromagnet coil in series with the motor circuit that directly <b>operates</b> <b>contacts.</b> This {{is similar to a}} control relay but requires a rather high fault current to <b>operate</b> the <b>contacts.</b> To prevent short over current spikes from causing nuisance triggering the armature movement is damped with a dashpot.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effects of speed and load on the operation of 120 -mm bore angular-contact ball bearings at speeds to 25, 000 rpm and thrust loads to 22, 240 newtons (5000 lb). Bearing temperature and power consumption increased with increases in load and/or speed. The effect of load on temperature and power consumption was small relative to the speed effect. Actual measurements of bearing <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> angle were in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Skidding occurred in the bearing in various amounts, generally increasing with speed at given load. The highest amount of skidding, 6 percent, occurred at the highest speed, 25, 000 rpm. No visible damage to the bearing surfaces occurred due to the skidding...|$|E
40|$|Previous work on {{load sharing}} in {{non-metallic}} gears {{indicated that the}} change in <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> ratio {{is large enough to}} cause concern. Tests also show that premature contact between the gear teeth can lead to severejank wear. This paper shows that predeter-mined amounts of tip relief are needed to minimize this form of wear from occurring. The tip relief suggested in this paper is compared to recommendations given in the British Standard. Finally, for non-metallic gears, allowances for backlash due to elastic deformation of the teeth are suggested.

40|$|Material in railway rails {{is loaded}} {{repeatedly}} by {{the passage of}} the wheel. The maximum contact pressure which the material can carry elastically in the steady state is known as the 'shakedown limit'. With an <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> pressure below the shakedown limit the rail would be expected to remain elastic with a very long life. However, examination of rail cross-sections shows severe plastic deformation in a sub-surface layer of a few tens of microns thickness; the contact patch size is in tens of millimetres. This raises two questions: firstly, why should plastic flow occur if the shakedown limit is not exceeded; and secondly, why should plastic flow be confined to a thin sub-surface layer? It is hypothesized that asperity contacts are responsible for the observed plastic flow. This hypothesis was investigated in experiments on a twin-disc machine and was found to be correct. Numerical analysis showed that roughness causes the contact pressure to deviate from the assumed Hertzian (smooth) to one which is spiky...|$|E

40|$|Market-based {{resource}} management systems typically retain some residual regulation to manage externalities left unresolved. This residual regulation {{could be improved}} through renewable “evergreen ” operating contracts {{between the government and}} the entitlement holder(s). Renewal well before contract expiration would avoid the end-point problems of a fixed length contract. An evergreen operating contract improves the economic incentives of entitlement holders in two ways. First, the contract creates a specified period of certainty. Second, the renewal process for an evergreen <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> creates two-sided contracting, whereas traditional regulation is a one-sided contract dictated by government. Evergreen contracts allow the specification of entitlements to evolve, but within boundaries, as more is learned about the resource and its interactions with the rest of the ecosystem. Examples of regulatory contracting, both fixed term and evergreen, already exist in forestry and grazing leases and in fisheries in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Evergreen contracts might be applied widely, as in ITQ fisheries, water entitlement trading systems, aquaculture leases, and pollution trading systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{values of}} {{inner and outer}} race temperature, cage speed, and heat {{transferred}} to the lubricant or bearing power loss, calculated using the computer programs Shaberth and Cybean, with the corresponding experimental data for the large bore ball and roller bearings were compared. After the development of computer program, {{it is important that}} values calculated using such program are compared with actual bearing performance data to assess the programs predictive capability. Several comprehensive computer programs currently in use are capable of predicting rolling bearing operating and performance characteristics. These programs accept input data of bearing internal geometry, bearing material and lubricant properties, and bearing operating conditions. The programs solve several sets of equations that characterize rolling element bearings. The output produced typically consists of rolling element loads and Hertz stresses, <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> angles, component speed, heat generation, local temperatures, bearing fatigue life, and power loss.

40|$|The {{computer}} program SHABERTH {{was used to}} analyze 35 -mm-bore, angular-contact ball bearings designed and manufactured for high-speed turbomachinery applications. Parametric tests of the bearings were conducted on a high-speed, high-temperature bearing tester and were compared with the computer predictions. Four bearing and cage designs were studied. The bearings were lubricated either by jet lubrication or through the split inner ring with and without outer-ring cooling. The predicted bearing life decreased with increasing speed because of increased <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> stresses caused by changes in contact angle and centrifugal load. For thrust loads only, the difference in calculated life for the 24 deg. and 30 deg. contact-angle bearings was insignificant. However, for combined loading, the 24 deg. contact-angle bearing gave longer life. For split-inner-ring bearings, optimal operating conditions were obtained with a 24 deg. contact angle and an inner-ring, land-guided cage, using outer-ring cooling in conjunction with low lubricant flow rates. Lower temperature and power losses were obtained with a single-outer-ring, land-guided cage for the 24 deg. contact-angle bearing having a relieved inner ring and partially relieved outer ring. Inner-ring temperatures were independent of lubrication mode and cage design. In comparison with measured values, reasonably good engineering correlation was obtained using the {{computer program}} SHABERTH for predicted bearing power loss and for inner- and outer-ring temperatures. The Parker formula for XCAV (used in SHABERTH, a measure of oil volume in the bearing cavity) {{may need to be}} refined to reflect bearing lubrication mode, cage design, and location of cage-controlling land...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of engineering components for harsh operating conditions, such as increasingly high velocity and <b>operating</b> <b>contact</b> loads, requires continuous {{improvement in the}} reliability and service life of mating surfaces, thus justifying the massive interest put in the optimization of protective coatings in the last decades. Wear resistant coatings, in particular, are used to reduce {{the damage caused by}} abrasion, erosion, cavitation and fretting, also potentially associated with corrosion, and in some cases to reduce friction. Oxide ceramics, such as alumina, titania, zirconia, chromia, yttria and mixtures therein, have been widely used in force of their wear resistance (1 - 3) as well as for their protective role in the presence of thermal loads, and the fabrication processes for this kind of coatings are today technologically consolidated, being APS the most efficient and economical deposition technique. Particular attention has been devoted in the very recent past to the possibility of depositing nanostructured oxide ceramic coatings (1), anticipating potential exceptional improvements of tribological properties associated with the extremely high density of grain boundaries of these materials, provided that the nanocrystalline structure of the starting materials can be preserved during the deposition and reproduced within the coating. While presenting evident shortcomings correlated to the risk of grain coarsening, thermal spray of nanostructured powders appears however as a very attractive route to nanostructured coatings, due to the very short time of residence of starting materials at high temperature. Very limited literature is available as of today on the particular subject (4 - 9). In the present communication, preliminary results of the fabrication and characterization of coatings produced by air plasma spray deposition of commercially available nanostructured alumina-titania powders are presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{electromechanical}} characteristics, electrostatic characteristics and coil eddy current losses of a reed relay was developed. These characteristics were returned from reed and coil dimensions. The model was intended {{as an aid to}} the design of reed relays for Radio Frequency (RF) and high voltage applications. An electromechanical model of a reed switch and coil was developed using a combination of an axisymmetric finite element model and analytical methods. The characteristics returned from this model were operate, release and differential amp turns, contact gap and contact force. Inclusion of results for contact resistance against contact force yielded the contact resistance characteristics. Electrostatic force between reed contacts was calculated and a criteria for contact arcing in a vacuum applied to allow prediction of breakdown voltage in an evacuated reed switch. The above elements were incorporated in a "Reed Switch Design Program" in which <b>operating,</b> <b>contact</b> resistance and breakdown voltage characteristics were calculated from reed and coil dimensions. Results were found to be in agreement with measured values for three reed switch types. Eddy current losses in relay coils were investigated through experimental measurement of losses occurring in coils mounted around a copper conductor carrying a high frequency current. The losses occurring in the coil were found to present an effective resistance to the current in the conductor. The influence of coil dimensions and the magnetic properties of the conductor on losses were observed. An analytical model of eddy current losses was derived from first principals results and were found concordant with those measured. An "RF Reed Relay Design Program" embodying the eddy current loss model and preceding work was created to demonstrate how relay performance (and efficiency) can be enhanced by tuning reed and coil dimensions. An example of its successful application to product development at Crydom Magnetics Ltd is presented. Proposals for future work are included. Crydom Magnetics Limite...|$|E
