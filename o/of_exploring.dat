5|$|Similar to its {{predecessor}} Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie features three-dimensional worlds containing items to be collected. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, {{that are used}} to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead <b>of</b> <b>exploring</b> the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in Banjo-Kazooie, a singular board is used within a temple where Master Jiggywiggy resides. Whenever the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies than the last.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} Santo Domingo early in 1524, with the {{intention}} <b>of</b> <b>exploring</b> the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course {{took him to the}} north coast of Honduras, where he was beset by a storm. In order to lighten the load of his ships, he ordered that a number of horses be thrown overboard. This event resulted in the place being named Puerto de Caballos ("Port of Horses"). González Dávila landed on the north coast, with authorisation to conquer Honduras from the king, after having sent the royal fifth of his proceeds from campaigns in Panama and Nicaragua, a sum totalling 112,524 gold castellanos. Puerto de Caballos later developed into an important staging point for the colonisation of the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{main flow}} {{of the game is}} {{different}} from the other Dragon Quest games; instead <b>of</b> <b>exploring</b> one large world, the party goes to separate continents by placing stone shards into their appropriate pedestals in Estard Fane. Once all of the missing shards are located and placed for a particular pedestal, the party is transported to the trapped location in the past. After solving whatever problems plague the location, the party then travels back to Estard, the beginning island. From there, they can travel via boat, carpet, or skystone to the modern version of the location they just saved. These saved lands appear on the main map, although the originals (from the past) can be revisited through the ruins.|$|E
5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} <b>of</b> <b>exploring</b> the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course {{took him to the}} north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby <b>of</b> <b>exploring</b> {{the steam}} tunnels and {{buildings}} of the campus, broke into a building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 time-sharing computer system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E

5|$|On {{the desert}} planet, the search begins for a {{suitable}} source of lime to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits of lime. The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea <b>of</b> <b>exploring</b> the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out for a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E

Although individualism is the topic, which accompany sociology {{since the}} beginning, until {{now there is}} not approved sociological theory of individualism. Even the voices of those, who question the existence of individualism, become stronger. As the main weaknesses <b>of</b> sociological <b>exploring</b> <b>of</b> individualism there are recorded normativeness (moral and religious, ideological and political, theoretical) and attempts to build kind of “grand” theory. As the key failing <b>of</b> sociological <b>exploring</b> <b>of</b> individualism is considered there the scientific approach of methodological individualism, which makes individualism as social phenomenon sociologically invisible, confusing individualism with egoism. The aim of author is to suggest and give reasons for exploring individualism {{as a kind of}} social organization, using an approach of sociological realism...|$|R
