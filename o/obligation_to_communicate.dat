5000|$|Global {{warming is}} real and is a {{phenomenon}} that humans have created. Climate scientists worldwide have understood its essence since the so-called [...] "Charney Report" [...] of the National Research Council 25 years ago. Our {{burning of fossil fuels}} (coal, oil, and natural gas) is the indisputably direct cause of the ever-increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This added carbon dioxide acts directly to warm the planet. There is no scientific controversy about these facts. The eventual warming amounts for Earth are expected to be substantial, but with some remaining uncertainty concerning how much warming we will receive for given scenarios of future amounts of carbon dioxide, and other [...] "greenhouse" [...] gases... A doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide amounts is expected to occur within this century... Another 3-6 degrees Fahrenheit global warming is expected to occur this century, with continued warming thereafter... Tropical storms are expected on average to have stronger winds, and much more rain... I do, however, believe that it is scientists' <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> the science of global warming, including its remaining uncertainties, to leaders and stakeholders, worldwide. I would also argue that it is our responsibility to offer our science-based perspectives on the available policy options, as well as their strengths and weaknesses.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND:Research ethicists have {{recently}} declared a new ethical imperative: that researchers should communicate {{the results of}} research to participants. For some analysts, the obligation is restricted to the communication of the general findings or conclusions of the study. However, other analysts extend the obligation to the disclosure of individual research results, especially where these results are perceived to have clinical relevance. Several scholars have advanced cogent critiques of the putative obligation to disclose individual research results. They question whether ethical goals are served by disclosure or violated by non-disclosure, and whether the communication of research results respects ethically salient differences between research practices and clinical care. Empirical data on these questions are limited. Available evidence suggests, on the one hand, growing support for disclosure, and on the other, the potential for significant harm. METHODS:This paper explores {{the implications of the}} disclosure of individual research results for the relationship between research and clinical care through analysis of research-based cancer genetic testing in Ontario, Canada in the late 1990 s. We analyze a set of 30 interviews with key informants involved with research-based cancer genetic testing before the publicly funded clinical service became available in 2000. RESULTS:We advance three insights: First, the communication of individual research results makes research practices seem like clinical services for our respondents. Second, while valuing the way in which research enables a form of clinical access, our respondents experience these quasi-clinical services as inadequate. Finally, our respondents recognize the ways in which their experience with these quasi-clinical services is influenced by research imperatives, but understand and interpret the significance and appropriateness of these influences in different ways.

Their financial support comes in part from public money [...] tax dollars and gate receipts-they have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> something and offer services worthy of that support. Because a popular vehicle of communication {{is the use of}} temporary and permanent exhibitions and displays are affected more by exhibits and displays than anything else that the garden does. Their use and quality should be given serious consideration to ensure that the garden's messages are being transmitted effectively. Visitors of an educational exhibit tells a story through interpretation of ideas and presentation of objects is different from a display, which is simply an arrangement of objects with no intended educational message and displays each have their merits in a botanic garden or arboretum. The aesthetic quality of some areas, as a landscape vista, might be destroyed by on-site information and ideas are more appropriate than arrangements of plants. This thesis is written with a conviction that temporary educational exhibits are a tremendously valuable tool for botanical gardens and arboreta to interpret their plant collections and garden functions, and to transmit a love of plants. The development of an exhibit falls logically into two phases, planning and production. Planning consists of a series of distinct but related steps (developing a theme, writing objectives and a storyline, drawing up a production schedule, doing research, choosing plants and other objects, and carrying out related planning activities) which, when finished, will outline the procedure for the mechanical stages of production, installation, and removal. An exhibit does not exist in isolation but should be integrated into other programs at the garden is needed to inform people that the exhibit is there for their viewing theme. The life of a temporary exhibit can be extended with the use of supplementary printed materials. The Publicity Special events will reinforce the exhibit can be further extended by showing it at other I gardens and museums. Exhibit evaluation is the means of determining how well the messages have been conveyed, and where {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} an exhibit lie.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of the Internet expeditioners {{travelling}} alone or in small groups to remote locations have been using email and websites to communicate with sponsors, supporters, friends and family. This brings new communication opportunities to expeditioners {{and at the same time}} may be changing the expedition experience. The author used the experience of participating in an 11 -month sailing voyage around the world as a platform for this research by project. The purpose of the voyage was to raise awareness of the plight of the albatross. The author examined how the Internet shaped this expedition, the purpose of expedition communication and how meaning was constructed for a remote audience. Using a constructionist epistemology, a phenomenological approach is used in the development and analysis of a narrative account of the voyage, its preparation and aftermath. The Exegesis contains a detailed account of one Leg of the Voyage, from Cape Town to Melbourne, with a particular focus on the online communications. A full account of the voyage, again with a particular emphasis on communications, is contained in the Durable Record. The potential availability of Internet communication was found to have been intrinsic to the design of the expedition and enabled the Voyage to forgo traditional media sponsorship and yet still attract and engage a worldwide audience through an institutional community website. The lack of use of the Internet’s capability to support online discussion and build communities on this Voyage and other expedition websites sampled, is explored and it is proposed to be an expression of these expeditioners possible disinterest in feedback. The building of online communities around an expedition website is suggested to be an area of opportunity with the potential to engage site visitors, to enable new insights to be gained into the life of expeditioners, and to provide greater exposure for sponsors. A simple classification of expeditions by their leadership, organisation, purpose and membership is proposed and the differing purposes of communication in each considered. The use of email on the voyage was found to facilitate and improve contact with supporters, family and friends. Whilst adding a sense of security it was also found to be time consuming, stressful, power hungry and to build a sense of <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>communicate.</b> Its general reliability led to exchanges on non-critical matters and to a reduction in the feeling of remoteness that some expeditioners may be seeking. Whilst on this voyage technical and budgetary constraints limited the full use of the Internet’s capability to utilise text, images and sound to construct meaning, the effective and timely use of a short daily narrative, aimed at a known audience is demonstrated. The author justifies drawing learning from his participation in the Voyage through the use of experiential learning and reflective learning theory arguing that the preparation for expeditions, participation in them and mediated reflection following them, are rich learning environments provided that good records are kept, particularly a frequently written personal journal...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes {{an explanation}} of why {{the state has a}} special moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect individuals in its legal territory against violence committed by private actors. Having {{an explanation of}} this obligation will allow us to better determine a number of its major characteristics, including to whom the state owes this obligation [...] the scope of the obligation [...] apart from those persons actually located in the state's legal territory. It argues that the state has a special moral <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect because the state is the fiduciary of those individuals in its legal territory and has a fiduciary <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> advance their purposes reasonably. Since obtaining security from violence is a normal and fundamental purpose of individuals, the state has a fiduciary <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect them from private violence. To support this conclusion, the dissertation evaluates whether the most plausible explanations of the special <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect can account for our moral intuitions. Apart from the fiduciary explanation, it considers and rejects four alternatives. First, the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect might arise as an application of an inherent duty to promote justice, including by protecting against acts of violence. Second, it might arise because the state normally contributes causally to the harm from most or all acts of violence that occur in its territory, so it has an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect against that harm. Third, it might arise because the state implicitly promises <b>to</b> protect by <b>communicating</b> a claim that it has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Fourth, it might arise because the exercise of coercive political control is legitimate only if the state simultaneously protects against violence. After rejecting these alternatives, the dissertation explains, defends, and applies the fiduciary account {{to the question of the}} scope of the special <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> protect...|$|R
