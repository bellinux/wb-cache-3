5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay fiber <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> paid {{the town to}} pass through the former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E

On 4 March 2008, contracts for {{the supply of}} 80,000tonnes of steel were awarded to Corus Group, with an estimated value of £65million. Other contracts included £3million for fibre <b>optic</b> <b>cable,</b> over £1million for reverse osmosis equipment to provide over 500tonnes of fresh water daily, and £4million for aviation fuel systems.

The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester. Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995, and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea Cable System opened, providing fiber <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> connection to the mainland. The European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association (EISCAT) opened a radar in 1996, followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008.|$|E

50|$|For telecommunications, cables can be {{installed}} in water, in air or underground. In the latter case, the cables might be direct buried or installed in ducts. The first is more common for copper balanced cables; the latter for fibre <b>optic</b> <b>cables.</b> The ducts in which the fibre <b>optic</b> <b>cables</b> are installed are usually made of polyethylene. They have a size ranging from typically 25 mm to 100 mm. Sometimes they are installed as subducts in larger ducts. These larger ducts can also consist of other materials, like concrete.

25|$|Internet The fibre <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> {{that runs}} from a bay on the {{southern}} {{side of the island}} connects it to the internet. Internet services were provided using VDSL and ADSL until central government introduced a national fibre optic rollout that included urban parts of Waiheke. Central government also forced the separation of the cable infrastructure from the ISPs, with the fibre backbone being mained by Chorus who has contracts with numerous ISPs. The locally owned WISP continues to provided wireless internet and some islanders use both services to ensure systems redundancy.|$|E
