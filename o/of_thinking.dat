5|$|Business design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / Anthropology (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> compared to practices associated with the more traditional Mathematics / Economics / Psychology (M/E/P) management paradigm. Since 2006, the term Business Design is trademarked by the Rotman School of Management; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> that {{is characterized by a}} deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business {{design management}} activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the Aalto University in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{development}} <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking.</b> The main objectives of the work are to identify, define and justify the psychological factors, stages and qualitative characteristics <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking.</b> Show through practical experiments that specially organized cognitive activity leads to the development <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> through the development of its qualitative properties. In my work I analyze in detail the concept <b>of</b> creativity, creative <b>thinking,</b> and cognitive activity in terms of different scientific approaches. One important aspect is the detailed functional analysis of the process <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> and cognitive activity. Cognitive activity in the context of my work is discussed as a functional space for the development <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking.</b> During the practical part by experimental work we confirm the hypothesis that the development of individual qualitative characteristics <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> during a specially organized cognitive activity leads to the overall development <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking.</b> Practical work includes preparation and adaptation of Torrance figural test <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> to identify creative potential, preparation of exercises and tasks for the development of each property <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking,</b> preparing a presentation to familiarize students with concepts: creativity, creative thinking, cognitive activity and the capacity to distinguish psychical phenomena influencing the creative thinking. Creating an appropriate atmosphere for the development of emotionally-positive attitude of students to the process <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking.</b> Ensuring an impact of detected psychological factors through the implementation of certain conditions. Carrying out classes targeted to the development of individual qualitative characteristics <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> in the 5 th, 6 th and 7 th classes of elementary school Janského. By creating a control and experimental groups we provide the ability to track changes in the practical section. After comparing and analyzing the results we can make the conclusion that the specially organized cognitive activity leads to the development <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking.</b> Own contribution <b>of</b> the work {{lies in the fact that}} the effect of each identified, evidence-based psychological factor in the development <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> individual is guaranteed due to creation of certain conditions to initiate and activate this process, while developing each of the four qualitative characteristics <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> takes place gradually. The research results can be used in the practice of educational institutions to create a comprehensive program targeted to develop creative thinking and the implementation of this framework program in the school education process. During writing this thesis we used the following methods: a theoretical analysis of philosophical, psychological and pedagogical literature, examined the practical experience on the subject. Developing creative <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> individual during cognitive activity was studied using experimental tests of J. Guilford, E. P. Torrance and others. The work consists of two parts. First, more theoretically oriented part, is divided into two chapters. The first chapter deals with definitions of basic terms, describes the process <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> and its stages. The second chapter deals with the revelation of psychological factors and phenomena influencing the process <b>of</b> creative <b>thinking</b> and functional analysis.

5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E
