50|$|As digital {{technology}} progressed since <b>the</b> CD releases <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Beatles' studio albums in 1987, audiophiles became increasingly disappointed with <b>the</b> sound quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official CDs. Many fans also clamored for release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Beatles</b> Capitol albums on CD. Several bootleggers undertook their own remasterings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>Beatles</b> catalogue, <b>of</b> both mono and stereo original releases, typically using premium vinyl pressings played and digitised with high-end audio equipment. While these unauthorised copies are not bootlegs as commonly defined, their creation and distribution channels overlap with bootleg products.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Beatles</b> wrote many songs {{during their}} visit to Rishikesh: 30 by one count, and [...] "48 songs in seven weeks" [...] by others.

Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> songs became part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album <b>The</b> <b>Beatles</b> (aka [...] "the White Album"), while others {{appeared}} on Abbey Road, and solo records.

5|$|MercyMe {{wanted to}} get out of their comfort zone with the overall sound of the album, and brought in {{producer}} Dan Muckala. Millard has said that he initially wrote the songs on the album as poems and then the band worked on the music, meaning the band didn't think much about the overall length of the songs. MercyMe further developed the sound of the album by looking to the work <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Beatles</b> for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1966, The First Lady also invited The Beatles {{to perform}} for a private affair in the Palace but the {{invitation}} was rejected.

5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living in the Material World.

This was the first US tour by a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beatles</b> since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E
