5|$|In 1954, an {{amusement}} arcade {{was added to}} the pier; this now occupies three quarters of the length of the structure. Alterations later that decade included the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>restaurant</b> and replacement of the decking. By the 1970s the pier's amusements included crazy golf, a miniature zoo and live theatre performances.|$|E
40|$|Revenue {{management}} {{has been applied}} to the restaurant industry, but restaurant operators have been disinclined to apply various types of RM approaches, due to apprehension for customer’s possible expressions of dissatisfaction. To relieve this reluctance, restaurant operators may need to understand how their customers perceive capacity limitations. While customers are more familiar with RM practices in traditional RM industries (e. g., airlines or hotels) with fixed capacities, perceptions of capacity limitations in restaurants (relatively flexible capacity) may influence customers’ perceptions of RM practices. In addition, the price difference between high-demand periods and low-demand periods may have differential impacts on customers’ perceptions of value of the restaurant’s expected offering and the fairness of RM practice. Based on commodity theory and equity theory, this study hypothesizes that two main effects, perceived scarcity <b>of</b> space in <b>a</b> <b>restaurant</b> and price differences, influence perceived value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>restaurant’s</b> offering and fairness perceptions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>restaurant’s</b> RM practice. <b>As</b> hypothesized, the negative effects of price difference on fairness perceptions are supported by the results. Unexpectedly, the main effect of perceived scarcity of space does not influence either perceived value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>restaurant’s</b> expected offering or fairness perceptions for <b>a</b> <b>restaurant’s</b> RM practice. Interesting results suggest future research directions...|$|R

5|$|The main {{attraction}} of Waterfall Gully is the waterfall, First Falls. It {{is at the}} south-eastern end of the road, in land owned by Cleland Conservation Park.

5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>restaurant</b> and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before a}} TNA show on February 25, 2004, Punk had a {{physical}} scuffle with Teddy Hart outside <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>restaurant</b> that was broken up by Sabu. The scuffle reportedly stemmed from an ROH {{show in which}} Hart performed three unplanned spots putting several other wrestlers in danger of injury. Around {{the time of the}} scuffle, Punk and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA shows, leading to speculation he was fired for the incident. Punk, however, said the scuffle had no bearing on his TNA career. He said the reason he and Dinero stopped appearing on TNA pay-per-views was that TNA officials believed that he and Dinero had not connected with the fans as villains, having turned against the popular Raven and instead formed a villainous tag team managed by James Mitchell. The officials decided that since the team was not working as villains, the storyline would be put on hold indefinitely, and thus had no work for Punk or Dinero. Punk officially quit TNA in March 2004 during the Rob Feinstein controversy, after having a dispute with the TNA offices over his ability to compete in ROH following a TNA order that their contracted wrestlers were to no longer wrestle in ROH.|$|E
