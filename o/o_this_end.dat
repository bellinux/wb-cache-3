40|$|A massive {{long-lived}} ø neutrino in the MeV regime modifies {{the primordial}} light-element abundances predicted by big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This effect {{has been used}} to derive limits on m ø. Because recently the observational situation has become somewhat confusing and, in part, intrinsically inconsistent, we reconsider the BBN limits on m <b>ø.</b> To <b>this</b> <b>end</b> we use our newly developed BBN code to calculate the primordial abundances as a function of m ø and of the cosmic baryon density j. We derive concordance regions in the j-m ø -plane for several sets of alleged primordial abundances. In some cases a concordance region exists only for a nonvanishing m ø. At the present time BBN does not provide clear evidence for or against a ø neutrino mass.

40|$|The {{relation}} between intrarectal volume and pressure during increasing rectal distension by a latex balloon were studied on repeated occasions in 10 healthy adult volunteers to define variations {{within and between}} individuals. A wide intersubject variation in the maximum tolerable volume (58 - 908 ml) and pressure (12. 2 - 108. 8 cm H 2 <b>O)</b> at <b>this</b> <b>end</b> point was seen, and these two values were correlated (r = 0. 78). Intrasubject variation in maximum tolerable volume also occurred which was related to study order and progressively reduced with repeated study. In 26 unselected patients with pain predominant irritable bowel syndrome similar intersubject variation was noted and virtually all patients data fell within the calculated 95 % confidence limits of the normal individuals. Differentiation between patients and normal subjects was not possible from knowledge of rectal responses. These noticeable inter- and intrasubject variations in rectal responses to distension {{need to be considered}} whenever similar techniques are proposed for use in the study of rectal disease or of rectal response to treatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the (110) surface of NiAl, an ordered alloy of B 2 structure, using a plane-wave pseudopotential method. The clean surface and several {{oxidized}} surfaces were investigated, with oxygen coverages up to 1. 5 ML (1 ML = 1 O-atomper surface metal atom). In order to compare the energies of the oxidized structures, which comprise different numbers of metal and oxygen atoms, one has {{to take account of}} the chemical potentials of the Ni, Al and <b>O.</b> To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> for each system, we have applied simple analytic models to study their surface energy as a function of temperature, alloy stoichiometry (assumed to be near 50 [...] 50) and oxygen partial pressure. The calculations predict how, at oxygen pressures just above the threshold for decomposing NiAl, the clean surface should be coated by an alumina layer, with the consequent depletion of Ni near the surface. Varying stoichiometry has the relatively minor effect of shifting the crossovers in oxygen pressure at which different oxidized surfaces become stable. 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The thermotropic sphere-to-rod {{transition}} of nonionic surfactants was characterized {{in terms of}} a large set of parameters: the transition temp. and width, the partial vol., coeff. of thermal vol. expansion, enthalpy, isobaric heat capacity, and structural parameters, such as radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius. Data were recorded as a function of concn. of surfactants in H 2 O and in D 2 <b>O.</b> To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> pressure perturbation calorimetry (PPC), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and isothermal titrn. calorimetry (ITC) were applied in a study of aq. solns. contg. myristyl, tridecyl, and lauryl maltoside and heptaethyleneglycoltetradecyl ether (C 14 EO 7). Small changes in the thermodn. and volumetric parameters (e. g., the partial vol. change is. apprx. + 2. permill.) are discussed in detail as the result of three effects governing the transition. (i) Redn. of the water accessible hydrophobic surface area (ASAap) drives the transition. (ii) Shrinking in headgroup size by thermal dehydration triggers the transition. (iii) Hypothesized gradual ordering of the chains may control the effect of chain length on the transition. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} of giant Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide (Cu_ 2 O) up to a {{principal quantum number}} of n= 25 by T. Kazimierczuk et al. [Nature 514, 343, (2014) ] inevitably raises the question whether these quasi-particles must be described within a multi-polariton framework since excitons and photons are always coupled in the solid. In this paper we present the theory of exciton-polaritons in Cu_ 2 <b>O.</b> To <b>this</b> <b>end</b> we extend the Hamiltonian which includes the complete valence band structure, the exchange interaction, and the central-cell corrections effects, and which has been recently deduced by F. Schweiner et al. [Phys. Rev. B 95, 195201, (2017) ], for finite values of the exciton momentum ħ K. We derive formulas to calculate not only dipole but also quadrupole oscillator strengths when using the complete basis of F. Schweiner et al [...] Very complex polariton spectra for the three orientations of K along the axes [001], [110], and [111] of high symmetry are obtained and a strong mixing of exciton states is reported. The main {{focus is on the}} 1 S ortho exciton-polariton, for which pronounced polariton effects have been measured in experiments. We set up a 5 × 5 matrix model, which accounts for both the polariton effect and the K-dependent splitting, and which allows treating the anisotropic polariton dispersion for any direction of K. We especially discuss the dispersions for K being oriented in the planes perpendicular to [11 ̅ 0] and [111], for which experimental transmission spectra have been measured. Furthermore, we compare our results with experimental values of the K-dependent splitting, the group velocity, and the oscillator strengths of this exciton-polariton.

40|$|The Phox 2 b gene is {{necessary}} {{for the development of the}} autonomic nervous system, and especially, of respiratory neuronal circuits. In the present study, we examined the role of Phox 2 b in ventilatory and thermoregulatory responses to hypoxic stress, which are closely related in the postnatal period. Hypoxic stress was generated by strong thermal stimulus, combined or not with reduced inspired <b>O</b> 2. To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> we exposed 6 -day-old Phox 2 b+/- pups and their wild-type littermates (Phox 2 b+/+) to hypoxia (10 % O 2) or hypercapnia (8 % CO 2) under thermoneutral (33 &# 176;C) or cold (26 &# 176;C) conditions. We found that Phox 2 b+/- pups showed less normoxic ventilation (VE) in the cold than Phox 2 b+/+ pups. Phox 2 b+/- pups also showed lower oxygen consumption (VO 2) in the cold, reflecting reduced thermogenesis and a lower body temperature. Furthermore, while the cold depressed ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia in both genotype groups, this effect was less pronounced in Phox 2 b+/- pups. Finally, because serotonin (5 -HT) neurons are pivotal to respiratory and thermoregulatory circuits and depend on Phox 2 b for their differentiation, we studied 5 -HT metabolism using high-pressure liquid chromatography, and found that it was altered in Phox 2 b+/- pups. We conclude that Phox 2 b haploinsufficiency alters the ability of newborns to cope with metabolic challenges, possibly due to 5 -HT signaling impairments...|$|R

40|$|The {{movement}} of the bacterial insertion sequence IS 50 and of composite elements containing direct terminal repeats of IS 50 involves the two ends of IS 50, designated O (outside) and I (inside), which are weakly matched in DNA sequence, and an IS 50 encoded protein, transposase, which recognizes the O and I ends and acts preferentially in cis. Previous data had suggested that, initially, transposase interacts preferentially with the O end sequence and then, in a second step, with either an O or an I end. To better understand the cis action of transposase and how IS 50 ends are selected, we generated a series of composite transposons which contain direct repeats of IS 50 elements. In each transposon, one IS 50 element encoded transposase (tnp +), and the other contained a null (tnp-) allele. In {{each of the five}} sets of composite transposons studied, the transposon for which the tnp+ IS 50 element contained its O end was more active than a complementary transposon for which the tnp - IS 50 element contained its <b>O</b> <b>end.</b> <b>This</b> pattern of <b>O</b> <b>end</b> use suggests models in which the cis action of transposase and its choice of ends is determined by protein tracking along DNA molecules...|$|R

40|$|Replacement of the axial Met 80 heme ligand in electrode-immobilized {{cytochrome}} c with a noncoordinatingAla residue and {{alteration of}} the hydrogen bonding network in the region nearby following substitution ofTyr 67 were investigated as effectors of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the protein-electrode electrontransfer (ET) and the heme-mediated electrocatalytic reduction of H 2 <b>O</b> 2. To <b>this</b> <b>end,</b> the voltammetry of theMet 80 Ala, Met 80 Ala/Tyr 67 His, and Met 80 Ala/Tyr 67 Ala variants of yeast iso- 1 -cytochrome c chemisorbedon carboxyalkanethiol self-assembled monolayers was measured at varying temperature and hydrogen peroxideconcentration. The thermodynamic study shows that insertion of His and Ala residues in place of Tyr 67 results mainly in differences in protein-solvent interactions at the heme crevice with no relevant effects onthe Eo′ values at pH 7, which for single and double variants range from approximately - 0. 200 to - 0. 220 V(vs SHE). On the contrary, both double variants show much lower ET rates compared to Met 80 Ala, mostlikely {{as a consequence of}} a change in the ET pathways. In the present nondenaturing immobilizing conditions,and with hydrogen peroxide concentrations in the micromolar range, the variants catalyze H 2 O 2 reduction atthe electrode, whereas wild-type cytochrome c does not. H 2 O 2 electrocatalysis occurs with an efficientmechanism likely involving a fast catalase-like process followed by electrocatalytic reduction of the resultingdioxygen at the electrode. Comparison of Met 80 Ala/Tyr 67 His with Met 80 Ala/Tyr 67 Ala shows that the presenceof a general acid-base residue for H 2 O 2 recognition and binding through H-bonding in the distal heme siteis a key requisite for the reductive turnover of this substrate...|$|R
