5|$|In 1996, Lexus debuted {{its first}} sport utility vehicle, the LX 450, {{followed}} by the third generation ES 300 sedan. The marque's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995. Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans in 1998. The RX crossover targeted suburban buyers who desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX's <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> It was particularly successful, eventually becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES sedan. The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous country when it launched sales in Brazil. In 1999, Lexus recorded its 1 millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market and was ranked the top-selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a {{producer}} of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government {{and a number of}} major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces. World War II was over before the company could start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many major components, including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the full load lifting tandem axle mechanism, which improved <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Sport utility {{vehicles}} are off-road vehicles with four-wheel drive and true <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> They most often feature high ground clearance and an upright, boxy body design. Sport Utilities are typically {{defined by a}} body on frame construction which offers more <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> but reduced on-road ride comfort and handling compared to a cross-over or car based utility vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Unmatched <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> (for {{a vehicle}} with 4 regular-sized wheels).|$|R
50|$|The Alvis Salamander is a 6X6 Airport Crash Tender with <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities,</b> {{developed}} in 1956.|$|R
25|$|The {{same year}} Alfa Romeo {{introduced}} the Crosswagon Q4, a Sportwagon Q4 with a crossover look and enhanced <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities.</b>|$|R
25|$|The design still {{emphasizes}} {{power and}} luxury, with significant work done on improving noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). However, {{for the first}} time, Jeep also emphasized on-road performance to a similar extent as the cornerstone of its brand, <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Adventure {{motorcycles}} are motorcycles with touring capability on paved and unpaved roads. As a dual-sport {{they have}} a significant on-pavement bias and perform well on pavement at higher speeds unlike most dual-sports. Their size, weight and sometimes their tires, however, limits their <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> Most adventure motorcycles function well on graded dirt and gravel roads but are less than ideal on more difficult off-pavement terrain.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover Experience was {{established}} in 1990, and consists {{of a network of}} centres throughout the world, set up to help customers {{get the most out of}} their vehicles' on and <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> The flagship centres are Land Rover's bases at Solihull, Eastnor, Gaydon and Halewood. Courses offered include off-road driving, winching and trailer handling, along with a variety of corporate and individual 'Adventure Days'. The factory centres at Solihull and Halewood have manufacturing tours, while Gaydon has an engineering tour.|$|E
50|$|As many SUV owners {{never used}} the <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> of their vehicle, newer SUVs (including crossovers) now have lower ground {{clearance}} and suspension designed primarily for paved roads.|$|R
50|$|Their {{main focus}} is {{performance}} Supercars with distinct <b>Off-Road</b> <b>capabilities</b> (as the car architecture {{is similar to}} a rally raid racing car, {{despite the fact that it}} is road legal).|$|R
50|$|While {{production}} {{vehicles with}} <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> can travel on unsurfaced roads, modifications {{are needed to}} travel on terrains exceeding capabilities of original configuration. The following {{are some of the}} modifications made to off-road vehicles.|$|R
25|$|The {{fourth-generation}} Grand Cherokee {{retains its}} classic Jeep styling {{combined with a}} modern and sleek body style. The interior features leather trim and real wood accents, plus Bluetooth and uConnect electronics options. With the additional awards for the 2011 Grand Cherokee, the Jeep Grand Cherokee has won 30 awards for <b>off-road</b> <b>capability,</b> luxury, value, best-in-class, and safety, making it the most awarded SUV ever. Among the awards are: Top Safety Pick for 2011 from the IIHS, listed as a Consumers Digest Best Buy for 2011, Safest SUV in America by MSN Autos, and Truck of the Year for 2011 by The Detroit News.|$|E
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck sat in the front doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample <b>off-road</b> <b>capability,</b> but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|E
2500|$|Crossover SUVs {{are derived}} from an {{automobile}} platform using a monocoque construction with light <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> and lower ground clearance than SUVs. They may be styled similar to conventional [...] "off-roaders", or may be look similar to an estate car or station wagon.|$|E
50|$|The RAV4 Adventure is {{a concept}} vehicle that accentuated the car's look to {{reinforce}} its <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities.</b> It included dark red body colour, extended wheel arches, 20-inch alloy wheels and matte painted front and rear bumpers.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles {{developed}} {{include a}} 1000cc motorcycle (1989), {{a series of}} cars (P1 to P4, since 2002) featuring Korres's patented suspension system, combining high performance with extreme <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities,</b> and D3, a city car design for disabled drivers, proposed in 2012.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the FAVs were {{replaced}} by Humvees in general military use, which did not provide nearly the speed nor extreme <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the FAVs. FAVs were transferred to special forces use {{where it has been}} largely replaced by the Light Strike Vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|Early in 1941, Willys-Overland {{demonstrated}} the vehicle's <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> by having it {{drive up the}} steps of the United States Capitol, driven by Willys test driver Irving [...] "Red" [...] Haussman, who had recently heard soldiers at Fort Holabird calling it a [...] "jeep." [...] When asked by syndicated columnist Katharine Hillyer for the Washington Daily News (or by a bystander, according to another account) what it was called, Irving answered, [...] "It's a jeep." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rover {{continued}} {{to develop its}} '100-inch Station Wagon', which became the ground-breaking Range Rover, launched in 1970. This also used the ex-Buick V8 engine {{as well as the}} P6's innovative safety-frame body structure design and features such as permanent four-wheel drive and all-round disc brakes. [...] The Range Rover was initially designed as a utility vehicle which could offer the <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> of the Land Rover, but in a more refined and car-like package.|$|E
2500|$|This newfound {{emphasis}} on on-road refinement led Jeep {{to replace the}} XJ-era live-axle with leading-arms front suspension (found in the ZJ and WJ) with a new design: an independent double-wishbone setup like that which debuted in the 2002 Liberty. [...] The new Jeep changed its philosophy due to what it perceived as increasing demand in the SUV marketplace for on-road performance and decreasing demand for <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> Although classed as a truck-based SUV, the WH/WK Grand Cherokee has more luxuries than a [...] "crossover" [...] especially refinement, capability and NVH.|$|E
50|$|Theth remains remote. It is {{most easily}} {{accessible}} by a 25 km unmade {{road from the}} village of Boga which is impassable during the winter months and is not generally suitable at any time of the year for motor vehicles without <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Range Rover models, the X5 {{was designed as a}} sporting road car: its <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> are significantly less than those of Land Rover. BMW reportedly worked hard to ensure it was referred to as an SAV (Sports Activity Vehicle) instead of an SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle).|$|R
50|$|It {{can travel}} at speeds {{of up to}} 55 mph {{on the road and}} it also has <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The vehicle also has a trailer mounted plow which can be used to dig the {{launcher}} into the earth in order to help protect it were it within the vicinity of a nuclear detonation.|$|R
2500|$|Conceived by Citroën Vice-President Pierre Boulanger to help motorise {{the large}} number of farmers still using horses and carts in 1930s France, the 2CV has a {{combination}} of innovative engineering and utilitarian, straightforward metal bodywork— initially corrugated for added strength without added weight. The 2CV featured low cost; simplicity of overall maintenance; an easily serviced air-cooled engine (originally offering 9hp); low fuel consumption; and an extremely long-travel suspension offering a soft ride and light <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> Often called [...] "an umbrella on wheels", the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads and until 1955 reached almost to the car's rear bumper. Notably, Michelin introduced and first commercialized the radial tyre with the introduction of the 2CV.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, the Enhanced Patrol Vehicle Project was {{unveiled}} at the SPF's annual work-plan seminar {{to highlight the}} need for <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> The Volvo V70 AWD XC, Mitsubishi Space Wagon and Mitsubishi Chariot underwent evaluation in various NPCs. Eventually, all NPCs were {{to have at least}} three of such vehicles, but the project was met with skepticism by some of the public, stating that the police need not use such [...] "luxurious vehicles" [...] for police patrols. In 2004, the new Fast Response Vehicle (FRV) was introduced, consisting of cheaper modified Toyota Hi-Lux sport utility vehicles. These vehicles utilise diesel-power which provide greater ability to endure high usage on the roads over extensive periods of time. Their bigger storage space also allows for easier storage and retrieval of equipment.|$|E
5000|$|Particular {{features}} that {{add to the}} <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> include: ...|$|E
50|$|German forces used half-tracks as {{artillery}} tractors, {{such as the}} Sd.Kfz. 7. Half-tracked tractors {{were not}} commonly used in this role in other nations. Compared to wheeled vehicles they had better <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities,</b> but were slower on roads and were more prone to breakdowns. However, for Germany horses remained the most common way of towing artillery throughout the war.|$|R
50|$|The Chevrolet Tracker, {{formerly}} the Geo Tracker, is a mini SUV produced for Chevrolet and Geo by CAMI Automotive in Ingersoll, Ontario. Although appearing as a compact SUV, the Tracker was actually certified as a Light truck {{due to its}} <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The Tracker was produced under many brands in several different editions and in many countries.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the war, the American M8 Greyhound and the British Daimler Armoured Cars {{featured}} turrets mounting light guns (40 mm or less). As with other wartime armored cars, their reconnaissance roles emphasized greater speed and stealth than a tracked vehicle could provide, so their limited armor, armament and <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> were seen as acceptable compromises.|$|R
50|$|Sport utility {{vehicles}} are off-road vehicles with four-wheel drive and true <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b> They most often feature high ground clearance and an upright, boxy body design. Sport Utilities are typically {{defined by a}} body on frame construction which offers more <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> but reduced on-road ride comfort and handling compared to a cross-over or car based utility vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Trekka superficially {{resembled a}} Land Rover but {{with far more}} limited <b>off-road</b> <b>capability</b> and was {{produced}} in both van and ute formats.|$|E
50|$|An eight-cylinder engine {{producing}} 260 kW/355 hp powered the roadworthy prototype, while a {{four-wheel drive}} designed with technical complexity provided the necessary <b>off-road</b> <b>capability.</b>|$|E
50|$|UAZ Patriot (UAZ-3163) is a {{mid-size}} SUV {{produced by}} the UAZ division of SeverstalAvto in Ulyanovsk, Russia. It was introduced in 2005 and replaced the older UAZ Simbir (UAZ-3162). Extensive use of newer parts, large carrying capacity, good <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> and an affordable price (<15,000 USD) predicted good sales in Russia. 12,011 units were sold in the year 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} Land Rovers, {{this car}} is {{manufactured in the}} Halewood Body & Assembly facility, near Liverpool, and was until 2009 manufactured alongside the Jaguar X-Type as Jaguar X-Type and Landrover Freelander both used modified version of Ford's front wheel drive platform. The new Freelander features higher ground clearance and <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities</b> that are closer to other Land Rover models.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} <b>off-road</b> <b>capabilities,</b> Unimogs {{can be found}} in jungles, {{mountains}} and deserts as military vehicles, fire fighters, expedition campers, and even in competitions like truck trials and Dakar Rally rally raids. In Western Europe, they are commonly used as snowploughs, municipal equipment carriers, agricultural implements, forest ranger vehicles, construction equipment or road-rail vehicles and as army personnel or equipment carriers (in its armoured military version).|$|R
