5|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia {{claims that}} 214 civilians were killed156 in 24 {{instances}} {{of war crimes}} and another 47 as victims of murderduring the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian Helsinki Committee disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period. When submitted as evidence, their report {{was rejected by the}} ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number of civilian deaths at 324. Croatian government officials estimate that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{had mixed}} results. While {{significant}} damage was inflicted on Singapore's important naval base and commercial port, some raids on these targets were not successful and other attacks on oil storage facilities on islands near Singapore were ineffective. The minelaying campaign disrupted Japanese shipping in the Singapore area {{and resulted in}} the loss of three vessels and damage to a further ten, but was not decisive. The Allied air attacks were successful in raising the morale of Singapore's civilian population, who believed that the raids marked the impending liberation of the city. The overall number <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> from the bombings was low, though civilian workers were killed during attacks on military facilities; one attack rendered hundreds of people homeless.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, {{but it is no}} less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the heat or the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E

5|$|With the {{increased}} number <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> {{compared with the}} World War I, Winston Churchill agreed to Ware's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths. A supplemental chapter {{was added to the}} Imperial War Graves Commission's charter on 7 February 1941, empowering the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War, which resulted {{in the creation of the}} Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour. The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67,000civilians. The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended. The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956; it added the final volume to the showcase in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The War of the Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} war for both Frederick and Maria Theresa, whose reigns began and ended with wars against one another. Although they {{deployed}} armies {{three to four times}} the size of the armies of the Seven Years' War, neither monarch used the entirety of the military force each had at his or her disposal, making this war-without-battles remarkable. Despite the restraint of the monarchs, some early nineteenth-century casualty estimates suggest that tens of thousands died of starvation and hunger-related disease. Carlyle's more moderate estimate lies at about ten thousand Prussian and probably another ten thousand Austrian dead. Michael Hochedlinger assesses combined casualties at approximately thirty thousand; Robert Kann gives no estimate of casualties but suggests the primary causes of death were cholera and dysentery. Gaston Bodart, whose 1915 work is still considered the authority on Austrian military losses, is specific: five Austrian generals (he does not name them), over twelve thousand soldiers, and 74officers died of disease. In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265men were killed and four officers and 123men were wounded, but not fatally. Sixty-two officers and 2,802men were taken prisoner, and 137men were missing. Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted. Finally, twenty-six officers and 372men were discharged with disabilities. Bodart also gives Prussian losses: one general killed (he does not say which), 87officers and 3,364 men killed, wounded or captured. Overall, he assumes losses of ten percent of the fighting force. Little has been discovered <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties,</b> although certainly the civilians also suffered from starvation and disease. There were other damages: for example, Habelschwerdt and one of its hamlets were destroyed by fire.|$|E

25|$|Mark Solonin {{claimed that}} the figures <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> were {{deliberately}} inflated in order to hide the number of Stalin's own victims. Solonin's estimates <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> are 5–6 million killed by Germans (including Holocaust victims) and over a million who died during the sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad. The attitude of the Germans toward the non-Jewish Soviet population, as he states, while cruel, was pragmatical and thus not genocidal (exceptions happened, but not as a general policy). Also, he claims that the Soviet documents for civilian casualties per republic are inconsistent with the populations of said republics, unless one assumes the soldiers who died while held in camps upon that territory are included.|$|E

40|$|This {{practice}} note details {{an emerging}} best practice <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> harm mitigation in armed conflict: namely, the creation <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> tracking, analysis and response processes by a warring party or peace operation force. It asserts that in Iraq, Afghanistan and soon Somalia, these processes {{to better understand}} civilian harm and address consequences have positively shaped mission tactics, training, and overall operations. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, tracking and analysis has lead to a marked decrease in <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> and facilitated the making of amends for any civilian losses. The paper argues that for warring parties to achieve their mission—particularly one with a protection <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> mandate as with the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) —they must fully understand {{the impact of their}} actions on the civilian population, positive or negative. For this reason, a <b>Civilian</b> <b>Casualty</b> Tracking, Analysis, and Response Cell should be created for MINUSMA to improve its ability mitigate risk to civilians as required by its Security Council mandate...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the expansive literature on military casualties and support for war, we {{know very little about}} public reactions to foreign <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties.</b> This article, based on representative sample surveys in the US and Britain, reports four survey experiments weaving information about <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> into vignettes about Western military action. These produce consistent evidence <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>casualty</b> aversion: where death tolls were higher, support for force was invariably and significantly lower. Casualty effects were moderate in size but robust across our two cases and across different scenarios. They were also strikingly resistant to moderation by other factors manipulated in the experiments, such as the framing of casualties or their religious affiliation. The importance of numbers over even strongly humanizing frames points towards a utilitarian rather than a social-psychological model of casualty aversion. Either way, <b>civilian</b> <b>casualties</b> deserve a more prominent place in the literature on public support for war...|$|R

The civilian casualties of Greater Syria, including Akkar, were covered in a detailed article by Linda Schatkowski Schilcher.
