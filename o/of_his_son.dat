5|$|The loss <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> {{was a major}} blow to Tiberius, {{personally}} and politically. Over the years he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the position of princeps and by sharing the tribunician powers with Drusus in AD 22 had prepared to relent some of his responsibilities in favour <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>son.</b> With these hopes now dashed, Tiberius left his administration more than ever {{in the care of}} Sejanus and looked toward the sons of Germanicus (Nero Caesar, Drusus Caesar and Caligula) as possible heirs.|$|E

5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they were inside the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Halcyoneus.|$|E

5|$|Offa's {{domination}} {{of the kingdom of}} Essex was continued by Coenwulf.
