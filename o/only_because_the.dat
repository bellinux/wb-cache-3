5|$|Once {{the film}} went into production, the {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, rather than in Portland, came after debate on how to match the locations that were introduced in the first film. One member involved in the decision process pointed out that Vancouver had been scouted as a potential setting for Twilight, and it was <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> U.S. dollar had, at that time, dropped below the Canadian dollar that Oregon drew Twilight principal photography to Portland and its surrounding areas. Vancouver was chosen because it allowed a higher production value, while the surrounding areas contained beautiful forests and gray weather. With this decision, however, came the issue of reconstructing key sets {{that were used in}} the first film. For the exterior of Forks High School, crew members were able to find a parking lot, but the school's steps needed to be filmed with a greenscreen backing to match those that were originally presented in Twilight. David Thompson Secondary School would then be able to serve as the interior for the high school scenes.|$|E
5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the {{transcript}} of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Lancaster {{was denied}} as a {{large-scale}} or long-term replacement. The Chief of the Air Staff, Portal, argued {{it was the}} only aircraft capable of carrying an 8,000lb bomb to Berlin and could not be spared. As a result, the RAF official history does not include the Lancaster as a Coastal Command aircraft. With a range of 2,350 miles it could have been invaluable. The Boeing Fortress was given to the service <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Air Ministry considered it unfit as a heavy bomber. It issued a directive on 27 January 1942 stating all Fortresses were to given over to Coastal Command for A/S operations. No. 59 Squadron RAF, No. 206 Squadron RAF and No. 220 Squadron RAF all used the Fortress as successful reconnaissance aircraft. However, the bulk of the force by early 1942 was still medium-range aircraft, which could now reach only 600 miles into the Atlantic. U-boats were now operating at 700 miles plus.|$|E

25|$|Noahide law differs radically from Roman law for gentiles (Jus Gentium), if <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{latter was}} {{enforceable}} judicial policy.

This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use as a commodity.|$|E

25|$|Huygens {{developed}} a balance spring {{watch in the}} same period as, though independently of, Robert Hooke. Controversy over the priority persisted for centuries. A Huygens watch employed a spiral balance spring; but he used this form of spring initially <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> balance in his first watch rotated more than one and a half turns. He later used spiral springs in more conventional watches, made for him by Thuret in Paris from around 1675.|$|E
25|$|After Germany {{had lost}} World War I (1914–1918), the German Revolution of 1918–1919 ended the monarchy and the German Empire was {{abolished}} {{and a democratic}} system, the Weimar Republic, was established in 1919 by the Weimar National Assembly. Right-wing nationalist and militarist circles opposed the new republic and promoted the stab-in-the-back myth, claiming that the war had been lost <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> brave efforts of the undefeated German military had been undermined by civilians at home.|$|E
25|$|It {{is because}} this process takes this dialectical form, {{in which each}} new stage is created through the further differentiation, integration, and {{synthesis}} of new structures out of the old, that the sequence of cognitive stages are logically necessary rather than simply empirically correct. Each new stage emerges <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> child can take for granted the achievements of its predecessors, and yet there are still more sophisticated forms of knowledge and action {{that are capable of}} being developed.|$|E

25|$|When {{the team}} visited {{the school in}} April they found it empty, to their delight. However, this was <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{students}} were on Easter holidays and soon returned. H. Gaunt, the headmaster, {{was concerned about the}} mysterious arrival of numerous government inspectors on 25 April, who left without telling them anything. When he contacted the Ministry of Works and Planning he was informed that a government department would be moving into the school, forcing him to move the students {{for the second time in}} two years.|$|E
25|$|After Birly died in 1854, Semmelweis {{applied for}} the position. So did Carl Braun— Semmelweis's nemesis and {{successor}} as Johann Klein's assistant in Vienna— and Braun received more votes from his Hungarian colleagues than Semmelweis did. Semmelweis was eventually appointed in 1855, but <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Viennese authorities overruled {{the wishes of the}} Hungarians, as Braun did not speak Hungarian. As professor of obstetrics, Semmelweis instituted chlorine washings at the University of Pest maternity clinic. Once again, the results were impressive.|$|E
25|$|The use of German paratroopers in Rotterdam, where Fallschirmjäger {{landed in}} a {{football}} stadium and then hijacked private transport {{to make their way}} to the city centre, demonstrated that nowhere was safe. Worse still, the airborne abduction attempt on the Dutch royal family had failed <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Dutch had possessed detailed plans of the operation well in advance. To counter the threat of an airborne assault, the Home Guard manned observation posts where soldiers spent every night until almost the end of the war continuously watching the skies, and initially armed with shotguns.|$|E

25|$|These {{changes were}} unusual not <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> extent {{and timing of}} the changes meant that {{construction}} {{took place during the}} school year, but also because Drillbit Taylor production did not pay for the re-tiling. The district had provided money to re-tile floors throughout the LAUSD, so the re-tiling of the floors itself was not unusual or controversial. However, as the film's production needs guided the color choices for the re-tiling and the schedule for construction, many students were upset by the behavior of the movie company and the school.|$|E
25|$|He {{had a pair}} of engines on hand of {{the exact}} size. He took them to pieces and he {{distributed}} the parts among the best machine shops in the country, telling each to make ninety sets exactly in all respects to the sample. The orders were executed with unfailing regularity, and he actually completed ninety sets of engines of 60 horsepower in ninety days – a feat which made the great Continental Powers stare with wonder, and which was possible <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Whitworth standards of measurement and of accuracy and finish were by that time thoroughly recognised and established throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{military}} command in Constantinople made poor assumptions of Russian intentions. They decided that Russians {{would be too}} lazy to march along the Danube and cross {{it away from the}} delta, and would prefer the short way along the Black Sea coast. This would be ignoring the fact that the coast had the strongest, best supplied and garrisoned Turkish fortresses. There was only one well manned fortress along the inner part of the river Danube, Vidin. It was garrisoned <b>only</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> troops, led by Osman Pasha, had just taken part in defeating the Serbs in their recent war against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
