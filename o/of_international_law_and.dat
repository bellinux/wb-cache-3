25|$|In the Austro–Prussian War of 1866, Prussia took Holstein from Austria {{and the two}} duchies {{subsequently}} {{merged into}} the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. From this point on, the Schleswig-Holstein Question was subsumed by the larger issue of Austro–Prussian relations, which the 1866 war deeply influenced. It survived, however, as between Danes and Germans, though narrowed {{to the question of}} the fate of the Danish population of Schleswig. This question is of great interest to students <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> as illustrating the practical problems involved in asserting the modern principle of nationality.|$|E

This was a breach <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> might have escalated into a serious incident, but Tryon handled the matter with tact. He suggested to the senior French officer, Captain Rieunnier, that perhaps a mistake had been made. The French apologised and explained that the commander of Leopold had misunderstood his instructions.|$|E
25|$|Some 200 German {{war crimes}} {{defendants}} were tried at Nuremberg, and 1,600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice.

Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which, having sovereign power over Germany, could choose to punish violations <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.|$|E
