5000|$|NSW Rural Fire Service on {{the other}} hand, do *not* specify this ADR <b>optional</b> <b>lamp</b> system, noting Australian Road Rule 221(e), allows drivers to use their {{flashing}} hazard-warning lights under [...] "hazardous weather conditions causing reduced visibility" [...] instead. (A rule that runs contrary to Article 32 of the 1968 [...] "UN Convention on Road Traffic" [...] and one that therefore that will be rescinded). The rear fog lamp is seen at twice the distance of regular tail-lamps.|$|E
50|$|NSW Fire Brigade fire {{fighting}} vehicles have mandated a rear fog <b>lamp,</b> <b>optional</b> in Australia, {{on the basis}} of OH&S to help combat such outcome.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The [...] "California 3-way" [...] or [...] "Coast 3-way" [...] {{connection}} never {{connects the}} lamp socket shell {{to the line}} (hot) terminal. An <b>optional</b> additional <b>lamp</b> can be connected at Terminal A as a pilot lamp, or to illuminate a long corridor. An optional receptacle can be connected at Terminal B, since that terminal is always live.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2003, Toyota {{added an}} {{optional}} Appearance Package for the SR5 model that included color-keyed cladding, bumpers, and liftgate trim. In April 2003, Toyota made the Appearance Package, {{along with the}} previously <b>optional</b> fog <b>lamps,</b> running boards, and 16-inch aluminum wheels, standard on the SR5. The Sport Edition also added black running boards and color-keyed trim, replacing the grey cladding and silver-painted grille, door handles and liftgate trim.|$|R
50|$|The {{economies of}} the new 240 and 340 models came at a cost - the leather {{upholstery}} was replaced by Ambla leather-like material and tufted carpet was used on the floor—though both had been introduced on the Mark 2 a year earlier. Other changes included {{the replacement of the}} front fog lamps with circular vents and <b>optional</b> fog <b>lamps</b> for the UK market. The sales price was reduced to compete with the Rover 2000 TC.|$|R
50|$|Standard trim meant black {{front window}} frame, black wire wheels (color optional), black horn (chrome-plated optional), single tail light (2nd optional), painted dash, {{position}} lights integrated {{in the head}} lamps (Deluxe cowl <b>lamps</b> <b>optional),</b> and less expensive interiors.|$|R
5000|$|RunX S & Allex (mid range) models {{featured}} 15" [...] steel wheels with optional 16" [...] alloys, optional side, front & rear skirting, automatic or {{manual gearbox}} options, <b>optional</b> front fog <b>lamps,</b> manual or automatic climate controlled A/C.|$|R
2500|$|Fender and hood {{stampings}} {{were similar}} to the 1960-'61 items, but neither identical nor interchangeable. At the rear, the cat's-eye tail lamps were deleted. A wraparound stainless trim {{was applied to the}} tailfins, below which were placed round tail lamps set into stamped aluminum bezels. These occupied the space formerly available for <b>optional</b> backup <b>lamps,</b> which for 1962 flanked the license plate below the rear bumper. The spare-tire stamping was eliminated from the deck lid, which was now a smooth stamping with a small central ridge at its trailing edge. On V200 deck lids, a large round emblem surrounded an oblong block-letter [...] "VALIANT" [...] callout on a black field. Similar block-letter/black-field callouts were placed on each front fender. On the Signet, the deck lid was adorned with a smaller round emblem surrounding the red-and-blue stylized-V Valiant logo.|$|R
40|$|Most driver {{information}} systems offered in automobiles today display vehicle speed, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, and some basic diagnostic information (warnings, panel <b>lamps).</b> <b>Optional</b> driver {{information systems}} add to this list by offering fuel economy information, compass heading, outside temperature and other comfort and convenience related items. Very few provide information {{in regards to the}} real performance of the vehicle, its motion in 3 -dimensional space, or the driver's skill and performance. Making this information available to the driver can enhance the "fun-to-drive" aspects of driving...|$|R
50|$|Another {{significant}} change was {{the switch to}} Ford's new 6F 6-speed automatic, which became standard on all V6 equipped models and optional on the I4. As well, new front and 18.5 mm rear stabilizer bars were added for 2009 to improve ride handling after complaints about diminished performance following the 2008 changes. Others changes included redesigned seats, daytime running <b>lamps,</b> <b>optional</b> steering mounted audio controls, and other additional features. The Tribute was discontinued in November 2011 {{at the end of}} the 2011 model year, replaced by the Mazda CX-5 for 2012.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the facelift, North America received three additional models to the Lancer line in 2004—Lancer Ralliart, LS Sportback and Ralliart Sportback. Ralliart slots in between the base models and high-performance Evolution. These cars came equipped with Mitsubishi's 2.4-liter 4G69 engine (rated at / 162 lbft Nm for the Sportback, and / 162 lbft Nm for the Ralliart). The power gain was due to a tuned muffler for the Ralliart, and also included a new, stiffer suspension package that improved handling and lowered for Ralliart and lifted the LS Sportback by 2.9 inches. The LS Sportback had 15-inch steel or optional 15-inch alloy wheels. The Ralliart came with 16-inch alloy wheels, front bucket seats borrowed from Japan's Mitsubishi Evolution GT-A, <b>optional</b> fog <b>lamps,</b> and a new aerodynamic ground package for Ralliart. The LS Sportback and Ralliart Sportback were equipped with a four-speed INVECS-II automatic transmission, while the Ralliart came with a five-speed manual transmission with an option for the four-speed automatic.|$|R
2500|$|... "Driving lamp" [...] {{is a term}} {{deriving}} {{from the early days}} of nighttime driving, when it was relatively rare to encounter an opposing vehicle. Only on those occasions when opposing drivers passed each other would the low (dipped or [...] "passing") beam be used. The high beam was therefore known as the [...] "driving beam", and this terminology is still found in international UN Regulations, which do not distinguish between a vehicle's primary (mandatory) and auxiliary (<b>optional)</b> upper/driving beam <b>lamps.</b> The [...] "driving lamp" [...] term has been supplanted in US regulations by the functionally descriptive term [...] "auxiliary high-beam lamp".|$|R
5000|$|For the Canadian market, the {{optional}} Discovery Pro 8" [...] infotainment system is available {{as part of}} the single option [...] "Technology Package", while only the 6.5" [...] Discover is available to US consumers. The Golf R comes (either standard or <b>optional)</b> LED tail <b>lamps</b> and front turn signals, 3-door version, electrically folding mirrors, spare tire and sunroof. All these features are not available to the North American version. The Golf R and e-Golf are the only Golf models available in North America still produced in Germany. Other Golf models for the North American market are now produced by Volkswagen de México in Puebla, Mexico.|$|R
50|$|LEDs {{were first}} applied to {{automotive}} lighting in centre high mount stop lamps (CHMSL), {{beginning in the}} late 1980s. Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running <b>lamps.</b> <b>Optional</b> on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal are all realised with LEDs. The Lexus LS 600h features LED low beam, position and side marker lamps in North America, and the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum uses LEDs for the low and high beams, {{as well as for the}} position and side marker lamps. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has no non-LED lamps at all, not even in the most basic trim level.|$|R
2500|$|Introduced for the 2005 {{model year}} was the {{optional}} Competition Package. [...] Included in the Competition Package were 17" [...] Gunmetal Painted Alloy Rims, Ladder Tachometer w/ shift lights, a Limited Slip Differential, and <b>Optional</b> Projector-beam Fog <b>Lamps.</b> [...] In mid-2006, GM released two Engine Kit upgrades for both the Ion Red Line [...] and the Cobalt SS. [...] The Stage 1 Kit retailed for around $500 USD, and included higher-flow fuel injectors and a recalibration to the ECU to increase the Horsepower by 31hp to 236hp and 205lb·ft. of torque, up from the stock 205hp and 200lb·ft. [...] The Stage 2 Kit retailed for around $750 and opens up {{the middle of the}} power curve to more power than the Stage 1 Kit alone. [...] In addition to everything that the Stage 1 Kit comes with, the Stage 2 Kit includes a smaller drive belt and pulley for the supercharger, bringing the engine up to 241hp and 218lb·ft. of torque. [...] GM did release a Stage 1 to Stage 2 Upgrade kit that retailed for $400. [...] This Upgrade Kit is for a Red Line [...] with the Stage 1 kit already installed. [...] This Upgrade Kit adds the Stage 2 elements and increases the horsepower from 236hp to 241hp.|$|R
5000|$|Following the [...] "merger" [...] with Leyland, the new company's board bore {{an uncanny}} {{resemblance}} to the senior management team that had hitherto headed up the Leyland half of the partnership, so comments of the management team on the profitability of the former BMC elements need to be viewed with caution. However, following a review of company records undertaken {{with the support of}} the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just £16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group £9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost £17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified ("modernised") front panels. Even the UK's best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about £10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of lead sealing from body joints (£2.40 per car), removing provision for <b>optional</b> reversing <b>lamps</b> (£0.10) and [...] "changes in body finish" [...] (£0.75). Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include [...] "new automated body building facilities" [...] saved £2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation's Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge. Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of investment appraisal criteria that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management's diagnosis that BMC's profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model investment to cover its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute.|$|R
