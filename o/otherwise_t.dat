30|$|Body weights of mice in treated groups {{decreased}} {{from the control}} or the dexamethasone groups indicating that the consumption of T. clypeatus has changed body weight of animals {{during the period of}} the study. Mushrooms and mushroom-derived polysaccharides, have been shown to have therapeutic properties against metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, hyperglycemia associated with diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension [24 – 26]. This was attributed to their anti-hypercholesteremic effects which result in body weight. Hence the decreased in body weight by the result may be a result of the effect of T. clypeatus on lipid mass. As low lipid mass could not be affect significantly the production of antibodies or cell proliferation, this could be justify the improvement of immune response by the extract while it lowers the body weight. T. clypeatus is an edible mushroom, largely consume without adverse effects. Hence, the decreased in the body weight observed could not be compromised its use for its immunomodulatory. <b>Otherwise,</b> <b>T.</b> clypeatus was administered through oral route in two form as additive aliment (powder) and dissolved in water (extract). As the powder was used in crude form this could be lowered the animal’s appetite which can also result in loss of body weight.|$|E

If, for all prime factors p of b, p ≡ 1 mod 4 and t is a quadratic non-residue mod p, the situation is more complicated. We define d(p) to be the highest power of 2 dividing (p - 1) and postulate that d(p) takes the same value for all prime factors p of b. Then t is basic mod b.

40|$|Leishmaniasis affects 12 {{million people}} {{but there are}} no {{vaccines}} in routine use. Recently, we used DNA vaccination in a susceptible BALB/c high-dose model of infection to screen 100 novel Leishmania major genes as vaccine candidates. In addition to finding novel protective antigens, we identified several antigens that reproducibly exacerbated disease. Here we examined the immune response to two of these antigens, lmd 29 and 584 C, that were originally identified in an expressed sequence tag cDNA sequencing project. We show that, in addition to exacerbating disease in susceptible BALB/c mice, these antigens retain a propensity to exacerbate disease in resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mice. This ability to exacerbate disease was lost when susceptible BALB/c mice were rendered resistant by disruption of the genes encoding interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) alone, IL- 4 /IL- 13, or IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 9, and IL- 13. Failure to exacerbate disease was associated with reduced IL- 5 and IL- 10 production in IL- 4 knockout mice. Treatment of lmd 29 -vaccinated mice with anti-IL- 10 receptor antibody prior to challenge infection converted exacerbation in wild-type BALB/c mice into highly significant antigen-specific protection.

Such an extension is said to be closed if R is integrally closed in T; <b>otherwise,</b> <b>T</b> is integral over R and the extension is a minimal integral extension. An extension R (T is a closed minimal extension if and only if there is a maximal ideal M of R such that (R,M) is a rank 1 valuation pair of T (equivalently, for each t ∈ T, M is the radical of (R:R t) and there is an element m ∈ M such that mt ∈ R). Also, for a pair of rings R (T and element u ∈ T, the pair R (R[u] is a closed minimal extension if and only if for each t ∈ R[u], there are elements c, d ∈√(R:R u) such that ct+ d = 1. For a minimal integral extension R (T, the conductor M = (R: T) is a maximal ideal of R.

With new pos- sible applications and often non-normative standard proposals emerging rapidly it is hard to nd one universal formalization of ontology engineering rules. This causes many authors to fall into a trap of focusing on the application of an ontology and not giving enough attention to the ontology itself. Such approach results in ontologies that are hardly reusable, overcomplicated and di cult to understand which is the exact opposite of what a good ontology should be. While many problems are very speci c we attempt to bring the attention to a set of common ones with the intention of instructing how to x or avoid them. Here, we explain how we improved an existing ontology, Core Grid Ontology (CGO), that we use as an example.
