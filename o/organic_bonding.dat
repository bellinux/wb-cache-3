5000|$|Vinylogy is the {{transmission}} of electronic effects through a conjugated <b>organic</b> <b>bonding</b> system. The concept was introduced in 1926 by Ludwig Claisen to explain the acidic properties of formylacetone and related ketoaldehydes. Its adjectival form, vinylogous, is used to describe functional groups in which the standard moieties of the group are separated only by a conjugated bonded system. For example, a carbon-carbon double bond (>C=C<, a [...] "vinyl" [...] moiety) between a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group {{is referred to as}} a vinylogous carboxylic acid, analogous electronically to a carboxylic acid, RCOOH.|$|E

In total, 20 HA-coated implants were placed in rabbit femurs and evaluated after 6  months. The data were analyzed by laser scanning microscopy (LSM). In all specimens, there was intimate contact between the bone and HA; in some portions, mineralized bone was in tight, direct contact with the HA, while in others, a basophilic and apparently unmineralized material was present between the bone and HA. LSM showed fluorescence at many areas of the interface, in osteocyte lacunae, and inside the coating. <b>Organic</b> <b>bonding</b> between the bone and HA was hypothesized.

40|$|This {{study was}} part of the Megacities Initiative: Local and Global Research Observations (MILAGRO) field {{campaign}} conducted in Mexico City metropolitan area during spring 2006. The physical and chemical transformations of particles aged in the outflow from Mexico City were investigated for the transport event of 22 March 2006. A detailed chemical analysis of individual particles was performed using a combination of complementary microscopy and micro-spectroscopy techniques. The applied techniques included scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) and computer controlled scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (CCSEM/EDX). As the aerosol plume evolves from the city center, the organic mass per particle increases and the fraction of carbon-carbon double bonds (associated with elemental carbon) decreases. Organic functional groups enhanced with particle age include: carboxylic acids, alkyl groups, and oxygen bonded alkyl groups. At the city center (T 0) the most prevalent aerosol type contained inorganic species (composed of sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen, and potassium) coated with organic material. At the T 1 and T 2 sites, located northeast of T 0 (~ 29 km and ~ 65 km, respectively), the fraction of homogenously mixed organic particles increased in both size and number. These observations illustrate the evolution of the physical mixing state and <b>organic</b> <b>bonding</b> in individual particles in a photochemically active environment...|$|E
30|$|Burn piles {{consisting}} of large wood generally burn longer and produce more heat than piles generated from smaller diameter thinning slash (Shea 1993, Busse et al. 2013). Busse et al. (2013) reported temperatures {{as high as}} 600 °C at the soil surface below large-wood piles in the LTB, with soil temperatures remaining above 400 °C for > 12 h at the surface and 5 cm depths. Massman and Frank (2004) also found temperatures > 400 °C at the soil surface beneath a large slash pile. The potential for considerable changes in soil properties at this temperature range is well established in literature. Soil water loss occurs from 60 °C to 100 °C and nitrifying bacteria are destroyed between 75 °C to 140 °C, limiting the early post-burn release of available NO 3 (DeBano et al. 1977, Esquilin et al. 2007). Destructive distillation of soil organic matter occurs at 200 °C to 315 °C (Esquilin et al. 2007) while nitrogen (N) is volatilized at temperatures ranging from 300 °C to 500 °C (Hungerford et al. 1991). Volatilization of sulfur (S) occurs at temperatures of 350 °C to 800 °C (Tiedemann 1987, Neary et al. 1999), whereas Raison et al. (1985) noted that phosphorous (P) is volatilized at temperatures approaching 775 °C. After severe fire, the consumption of <b>organic</b> <b>bonding</b> agents decreases soil aggregation, resulting {{in an increase in}} soil bulk density and reduction in infiltration rates (Giovannini et al. 1988, Fernandez et al. 1997).|$|E

40|$|Most food {{industry}} activities result in {{large amounts of}} by-product that are often treated as waste and sent to landfill. In Australia, the macadamia nut industries generate as much as 28, 000 tonnes of empty shells on an annual basis. These by products are under-utilized, often used for garden mulching or ground and used for animal filler, or else incinerated, as their disposal in landfill is cost-prohibitive, through sheer volume. However, these by-products are perfectly suited to the manufacture of panels, as they come clean and dry after processing, and present excellent physical properties when exposed to high humidity environments, particularly when compared to softwood. This makes them suited to applications such as panel furniture in high moisture environments, including kitchen and bathroom sink countertops or drawers where dimensional, swelling and adhesive problems are often an issue. This paper presents results of research into panels made from macadamia industry by-products in Australia, identified as being particularly abundant and underused. The matrices of these composite materials have been chosen from non-toxic and <b>organic</b> <b>bonding</b> agents, such as castor oil based adhesives. The present study considers and explores the suitability of these materials for high-moisture environment panel applications. Results are presented for the main physical properties and are compared with mixes already available in the market.

40|$|In {{order to}} design {{electronic}} devices utilising quartz, a material {{of paramount importance}} in the electronic industry, a reliable set of the material constants and their temperature coefficients is required. The previously available data sets suffer from inconsistencies and inaccuracies in experimental and/or theoretical approach. The objective and result {{of this research was}} to provide a universally consistent and accurate data set of the elastic and dielectric moduli of quartz. An automated pulse-echo phase detection system for the measurement of acoustic delay time in highly parallel, orientated, single-crystal specimens was designed and built. Data for ten propagation modes in standard grade synthetic quartz were used to determine the six independent elastic moduli and their temperature coefficients to an accuracy better than 0. 02 % over the temperature range - 60 °C to 120 °C using a frequency range of 10 MHz to 220 MHz. Computer control allowed the accumulation of several orders of magnitude more data than was acquired in previous experiments. This large data base enabled reliable calculations to be made of the parameters of the indium cold-weld bond used to attach the transducers. Use of this bonding technique allowed delay line measurements to be made to above 120 °C, whereas the use of <b>organic</b> <b>bonding</b> agents had limited previous measurements to ~ 30 °C. Comprehensive diffraction and transducer/bond reflection delay models were used to correct the experimental delay time data. An interferometric length measuring system was designed and used to measure specimen length. Capacitance measurements were performed to allow calculation of the dielectric moduli of quartz to an accuracy of 0. 2 %. The first fully documented and error-corrected measurements of the temperature coefficients of the dielectric moduli over the range - 60 °C to 120 °C were also performed. An accurate hydrostatic and volumetric determination was made of the density of quartz. A full data set of the fundamental constants of standard grade synthetic quartz was thus compiled. Finally, the experimentally derived values of effective elastic moduli were varied within the experimental error to fit to the extremely sensitive curves of frequency versus temperature for singly and doubly rotated quartz resonators. Results show that the data set produced by this research is more reliable than other previously available data sets. Measurements on five propagation modes in very high purity synthetic quartz indicate {{that there may be a}} significant difference between this and standard grade synthetic quartz. <p...|$|E
