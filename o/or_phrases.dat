5|$|It {{is claimed}} that the word orange has no true rhyme. There are, however, several half rhymes or near-rhymes, {{as well as some}} proper nouns and {{compound}} words <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> that rhyme with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.|$|E
5|$|The {{output of}} a SGD may be {{digitized}} and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded words <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits {{the user to}} speak novel messages by typing new words. Today, individuals {{use a combination of}} recorded messages and text-to-speech techniques on their SGDs. However, some devices are limited to only one type of output.|$|E
5|$|Coprolalia (the {{spontaneous}} utterance {{of socially}} objectionable or taboo words <b>or</b> <b>phrases)</b> {{is the most}} publicized symptom of Tourette's, {{but it is not}} required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. Echolalia (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.|$|E
5000|$|... "Connotation" [...] {{branches}} into {{a mixture}} of different meanings. These could include the contrast of a word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> with its primary, literal meaning (known as a denotation), with what that word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> specifically denotes. The connotation essentially relates to how anything {{may be associated with}} a word <b>or</b> <b>phrase,</b> for example, an implied value judgement or feelings.|$|R

5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words <b>or</b> <b>phrases,</b> and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{cinematic}} techniques by which von Stroheim portrayed naturalism was animal symbolism. In Greed McTeague {{is associated with}} a canary, only briefly mentioned in the novel. Von Stroheim altered Norris's original ending and has McTeague release the canary in Death Valley. McTeague buys Trina a female canary as a wedding gift and early in their marriage von Stroheim cuts from a shot of them kissing to birds fluttering wildly in their cage. Another scene with animal imagery includes cross-cutting between a cat attempting to pounce on the canaries in the scene where Schouler bids goodbye to McTeague and Trina without telling them that he has informed on McTeague. Dogs, cats and monkeys are associated with various supporting characters. Von Stroheim also used the naturalist technique of giving characters specific objects, gestures <b>or</b> <b>phrases</b> that repeat throughout the film as a visual leitmotif. For example, Trina tugs on her lips and McTeague fiddles with his birdcage.|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test their {{knowledge}} of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words <b>or</b> <b>phrases.</b> In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E

The game's goal is to fill the white squares with letters, forming words <b>or</b> <b>phrases,</b> by solving clues which lead to the answers. In languages that are written left-to-right, the answer words and phrases are placed in the grid from left to right and from top to bottom. The shaded squares are used to separate the words <b>or</b> <b>phrases.</b>|$|E

50|$|Dittography is the accidental, {{erroneous}} act {{of repeating}} a letter, word, <b>phrase</b> <b>or</b> combination of letters by a scribe or copyist. The term {{is used in}} the field of textual criticism. The opposite phenomenon, in which a copyist omits text by skipping from a word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> to a similar word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> further on, is known as haplography.|$|R

5000|$|Regular {{polyalphabetic}} substitution ciphers often rely on code words to determine alphabet changes. Each {{letters of the}} code work references a different alphabet. With the ten charts of Hyakutake's system, a code number {{would be easy to}} use for pseudo-random changes --- [...] "301934859762" [...] means encode the first word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> with the third table, the second word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> with the tenth (zeroth) table, etc. The thirteenth word <b>or</b> <b>phrase</b> would be encoded with the third table again. Of course to give maximum security this code number needs to be changed frequently.|$|R
