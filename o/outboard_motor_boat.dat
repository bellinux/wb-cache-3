In November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence, Mukos was part of the [...] "Kaštela" [...] {{tactical}} group that was tasked with enforcing a naval blockade of the port of Split and the surrounding islands. On 14 November, at around 17:30, while on patrol in the Split strait between the islands of Brač and Šolta, Mukos was hit with an improvised torpedo launched by special forces of the Croatian Navy (HRM), effectively starting the Battle of the Dalmatian Channels. The HRM command constructed the torpedo from a small <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> loaded with explosives. A former missile technician from the Yugoslavian navy had, while receiving training on Saab missiles in Sweden, picked up some remote control plane parts in a hobby store. Handed over to HRM, the gear yielded the ability to remotely control the unmanned vessel. The explosion ripped a hole in the forward section of the hull, causing the bow to flood and killing three crew members. The remaining crew was rescued by a Shershen-class torpedo boat Pionir II (TČ-224) while Mukos itself was left adrift.|$|E
5000|$|Kirakira is [...] "Off {{the beaten}} track" [...] and {{receives}} very few visitors. [...] There {{is a strong}} desire to develop tourism as a much need source of sustainable revenue for the Kirakira community. [...] There are unique surfing breaks on Makira Island with its black beaches and wonderful snorkelling particularly in the Islands of just off Kirakira. [...] There are sandy beaches surrounded by opalescent waters at the [...] "Three Sisters" [...] Island group and Ugi Island. [...] These waters are dotted with coral reefs where one can spend hours exploring and finding an exhilarating variety and species of tropical fish. The Islands can be accessed by an <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> <b>boat</b> that takes about 45-60 minutes to reach from Kirakira harbour. It makes a perfect day trip for a group of 3-6 people. The cost of Boat Hire, A couple of Guides and Petrol for a Day Trip is around $1500-1800 SBD. If you have a group of 4-6 people and take along some fresh fruit and coconuts for lunch, this can make for an amazing daytrip for about US$50 per person. If you are interested in flora and fauna then there are many exciting bird-watching trails that you can find. [...] There are also some very interesting villages to visit. Perhaps most interesting of all is {{the fact that in the}} 21st century people are still living a traditional village based life.

40|$|The {{fisheries}} {{sector is}} one {{sector of the}} economy that became the foundation of life of many residents, especially fishermen. One strategy that is done for the development of this sector is the minapolitan concept, where fisheries and marine sector became the driving force of the economy in the Minapolitan. This study intends to examine whether the fisheries sector is a sector - basis which can be developed without constrained by the capacity of the local economy - in areas designated as Minapolitan. Furthermore, this study also intends to find out whether the factors that drives the development of the fisheries sector, so expect the resulting findings can serve as a reference for decision makers in the field of fisheries. Results of research by using location quotient (LQ), found that almost all regencies Minapolitan really have the advantage in the fisheries sector. However there are some areas that do not excel in this sector when viewed from the LQ coefficient. The area in question is Malang, Tulungagung, Pasuruan and Tuban Region.

50|$|In {{an audio}} amplifier, {{all forms of}} {{oscillation}} are generally unwanted. Poor design and layout can sometimes lead to squegging in such an amplifier. As always, this arises {{from a combination of}} high and low frequency oscillations. Poor layout or poor shielding leads to high-frequency oscillations where the output has been coupled back to the input, especially if the input and output cables are run together for a distance. The high-frequency oscillations cause heavy currents in the output stages and, with poor power supply decoupling, these upset the input stage biasing and disrupt the high frequency oscillations. Squegging then arises. Squegging in audio amplifiers is commonly called motorboating because it sounds in the loudspeaker like an <b>outboard</b> <b>boat</b> <b>motor</b> at low speed.|$|R

40|$|Poor {{people will}} not buy the concept of {{management}} unless it improves their livelihood. To encourage a community based approach to fisheries management practices the socioeconomic conditions of the fisher communities should therefore be improved. This paper aims to describe and summarize the socioeconomic conditions, fishing practices and income of two fishing communities in the Batticaloa district. Data were collected in the year 2006 through a semi-structured, predominantly qualitative but also quantitative, questionnaire at an interview. Forty eight, mainly, lagoon fishermen from the Koddaimunai Fishermen's Cooperative Society (FCS) and 51 mostly sea fishers from the tsunami housing scheme Swiss village (Palameenmadu FCS) were questioned. Ethnicity, religion, occupation, gender, age, ownership of boat/gear and family size were addressed as they are related to willingness to participate in fisheries management. Regularity, frequency and duration of fishing, the distance travelled into sea or lagoon, the types of gears and boats used, experience in fishing, the needs and problems of the fishing communities and their marketing strategies were surveyed as they influence the average income of the fishermen. Results were summarized as bar charts, box-plots, histograms and bivariate scattergrams. Statistical Analysis was carried out using MINITAB (Version 14), EXCEL (2. l) and modified Nomographs (to test percentages). The two communities differed (P< 0. 05) in their average age and experience in terms of {{number of years of}} fishing. The Koddaimunai FCS fishermen used more thornies, castnets, traps while the Swiss village fishermen used more <b>outboard</b> <b>motor</b> <b>boats</b> with line and drift nets (P<O. 10). In communities housing, loan facility, FCS help, pension, safety at work, training received are unsatisfactory. The daily average percapita income was significantly different (P<O. 10) from Rs. 75. 00 (Koddaimunai FCS) to 100 (Palameenmadu FCS) which was above the national poverty line (Rs 46. 00 day-I personl) for the year 2006 / 2007. For both communities the income was unstable and insufficient and extra income from fishery non related activity or the ability to save money was not possible. In both communities, capital and labour expenditure were high followed by expenditure for fuel, repair and license. Auctioning heaped fish was the preferred style of marketing. Scatterplots of daily per-capita income against fishing experience, duration of fishing, ownership of boats/gears and types of boats/gears did not show much difference, with the income always centering around Rupees 0. 00 to 100. 00. Non availability of credit facility, technical training and fishing rights and high fuel prices, poor marketing strategies and greedy middlemen are a threat to good management practices. Strengthening of the FCS ought to be the first step towards developing a community based fisheries management in these communities...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} boat noise on the {{behaviour}} of bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus {{was investigated in}} the Egadi Islands, Sicily, during spring 2005 using a fixed tuna trap set near shipping routes. Tuna behaviour was observed when exposed to both natural ambient sound and sound generated by hydrofoil passenger ferries, small boats and large car ferries. Acoustical and behavioural analyses were conducted with and without extraneous sound to define a list of behavioural categories. Each vessel produced different engine sounds {{with regard to their}} composition and bandwidth, and all were distinctly different from ambient sound levels. In the absence of boat noise, tuna assumed a concentrated coordinated school structure with unidirectional swimming and without a precise shape. When a car ferry approached, tuna changed swimming direction and increased their vertical movement toward surface or bottom; the school exhibited an unconcentrated structure and uncoordinated swimming behaviour. Hydrofoils appeared to elicit a similar response, but for shorter periods. Agonistic behaviour was more evident when exposed to sounds from <b>outboard</b> <b>motors</b> of small <b>boats.</b> This study showed that local noise pollution generated by boats produced behavioural deviations in tuna schools. Schooling enhances tuna homing accuracy during their spawning migration, and an alteration in schooling behaviour can affect the accuracy of their migration to spawning and feeding grounds...|$|R
