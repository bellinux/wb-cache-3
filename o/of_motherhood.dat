40|$|Background: The {{cultural}} {{phenomenon of}} "teenage pregnancy and motherhood" has been socially constructed and (mis) represented {{in social and}} health care discourses for several decades. Despite {{a growing body of}} qualitative research that presents an alternative and positive view <b>of</b> young <b>motherhood,</b> there remains a significant gap between pregnant and young women's experience <b>of</b> young <b>motherhood</b> and current global health and social policy that directs service delivery and practice. Aim: This paper aims to heighten awareness of how a negative social construction <b>of</b> young <b>motherhood</b> influences global health and social policy that directs current community health models of practice and care for young mothers in the community. Discussion: There is clear evidence on the vital role social support plays in young women's experience <b>of</b> pregnancy and <b>motherhood,</b> particularly in forming a positive motherhood identity. This discussion paper calls us to start open and honest dialogue on how we may begin to re-vision the 'deficit view' <b>of</b> young <b>motherhood</b> in order to address this contradiction between research evidence, policy discourse and current practice and service provision. Qualitative research that privileges young women's voices by considering the multidimensional experiences <b>of</b> young <b>motherhood</b> is an important step towards moving away from universally prescribed interventions to a non-standard approach that fosters relational and responsive relationships with young mothers that includes addressing the immediate needs of young mothers at the particular time...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions <b>of</b> <b>motherhood</b> widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of teenage childbearing on the adult {{outcomes}} of a sample of women who gave birth, miscarried or had an abortion as teenagers. If miscarriages are (conditionally) random, then if all miscarriages occur before teenagers can obtain abortions, using the absence of a miscarriage as an instrument for a live birth provides a consistent estimate of the effect <b>of</b> teenage <b>motherhood</b> on women who give birth. If all abortions occur before any miscarriage can occur, OLS on the sample of women who either have a live birth or miscarry provides an unbiased estimate of this effect. Under reasonable assumptions, IV underestimates and OLS overestimates the effect <b>of</b> teenage <b>motherhood</b> on adult outcomes. For a variety of outcomes, the two estimates provide a narrow bound on the effect <b>of</b> teenage <b>motherhood</b> on adult outcomes and which is relatively modest. The bounds can also be combined to provide consistent estimates of the effects <b>of</b> teen <b>motherhood.</b> These effects are generally adverse but modest. ...|$|R

25|$|Motherhood- Three generations <b>of</b> <b>motherhood</b> {{are present}} in the novel. The {{relationship}} most thoroughly explored is the one between Anna and her daughter Alyona. This relationship as depicted by Anna seems tumultuous and fraught with drama. However, as the novel progresses, the reader sees that Anna’s portrayal of her relationship with her daughter is accurate only in so far as it is a reflection of her relationship with her own mother. The novel ends on a redemptive note in which Anna shows that she is willing to forfeit everything- perhaps even her sanity- for her aging mother, and Alyona finds the strength to break away from the domineering Anna in order to be a better mother to her own children.|$|E

Cersei is defined by her pride, and this punishment was directed at women to break their pride, but was never inflicted on men.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, the Galerie Hans Goltz, Munich, mounted Schiele's {{first solo}} show. A solo {{exhibition}} {{of his work}} took place in Paris in 1914. During the war Schiele's paintings became larger and more detailed, {{when he had the}} time to produce them. His military service however gave him limited time, and much of his output consisted of linear drawings of scenery and military officers. Around this time Schiele also began experimenting with the theme <b>of</b> <b>motherhood</b> and family. His wife Edith was the model for most of his female figures, but during the war due to circumstance, many of his sitters were male. Since 1915, Schiele's female nudes had become fuller in figure, but many were deliberately illustrated with a lifeless doll-like appearance. Towards the end of his life, Schiele drew many natural and architectural subjects. His last few drawings consisted of female nudes, some in masturbatory poses.|$|E

40|$|Despite a voluminous {{literature}} on the determinants of adolescent parenthood, little research exists on school-level influences on nonmarital, school-age motherhood.

25|$|Women's lack {{of access}} to higher {{education}} had effectively excluded them from the practice of well-paid and high status occupations. Entry of women into the higher professions like law and medicine was delayed in most countries due to women being denied entry to universities and qualification for degrees; for example, Cambridge University only fully validated degrees for women late in 1947, and even then only after much opposition and acrimonious debate. Women were largely limited to low-paid and poor status occupations for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, or earned less pay than men for doing the same work. However, through the 20th century, public perceptions of paid work shifted as the workforce increasingly moved to office jobs that do not require heavy labor, and women increasingly acquired the higher education that led to better-compensated, longer-term careers rather than lower-skilled, shorter-term jobs. Despite this, women are still at a disadvantage compared to men because <b>of</b> <b>motherhood.</b> Women are viewed as the primary caregiver to children still to this day, so their pay is lowered when they have children because businesses do not expect them to stay long after the birth.|$|E

Stacey reveals to Alfie that their rent is increasing and Kat is struggling with money. Alfie then invites Kat to his flat for lunch and they reminisce about their relationship. The next day, Kat lashes out at Alfie for leaving leftovers for the children, but {{at the urging of}} Stacey, she agrees to be his date to Ian and Jane's wedding if he makes more effort for making up for the fire. On the wedding day, she gets heavily drunk, and during the reception, shoves Sonia Fowler's (Natalie Cassidy) head into the wedding cake. When the nursery raise their rates, Kat is forced to leave the children in Mo's care to work her shift at the market, but ends up having drinks with Kim Fox-Hubbard (Tameka Empson). When Mo brings the children over to the pub, they misbehave and Kat is thrown out of the pub. Undeterred, Kat and Kim continue drinking and sneak into the pub to steal another bottle of wine. Linda Carter (Kellie Bright), catches them, and while Kim leaves to find the cash to pay for it, Linda prepares to call social services to tell them of Kat's irresponsibility as a mother, but Kat snatches Linda's phone and throws it across the ground. When Kim returns with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), she confesses her fears about being a bad mother, resulting in the other three women sharing their experiences <b>of</b> <b>motherhood</b> and reassuring her. Kat also tells Linda to speak to Mick about her fears that the baby may not be his. Linda then realises that the phone call was still connected, and promises to fix things to make sure social services do not know about what happened, however Kat receives a call from a social worker requesting to visit her. Kat is surprised when a lawyer visits her about Harry telling her about a compensation case with four other women also raped by Harry.|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} in Traveling Shoes, one that many critics overlook, is Angelou's {{love for her}} son. [...] The theme <b>of</b> <b>motherhood</b> is one of Angelou's most {{consistent}} themes throughout her series of autobiographies, although it does not overwhelm this book {{as it does in}} Gather Together in My Name and Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. [...] Motherhood is present in many of the book's subthemes—her relationship with her houseboy Kojo, her delight in being called [...] "Auntie" [...] by many African children, and her feelings toward [...] "Mother Africa". [...] Traveling Shoes begins with Guy's accident, his long recovery, and his mother's reaction to it, thus universalizing the fear of every parent—the death of a child. [...] The main character is a mother of a grown son, so liberation from the daily responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>motherhood</b> is emphasized, but it is complicated by the recognition that part <b>of</b> <b>motherhood</b> is letting go, something Angelou struggles with. [...] Confrontations between Angelou and Guy are minimal, consisting of their conflict over his choice of dating a much-older woman and of his demands for autonomy after she returns from the Genet tour. [...] Angelou seems to vacillate between wanting to supervise him and wanting to let go throughout this book. [...] In this way, as Lupton says, the motherhood theme, like the identity theme, is [...] "dual in nature".|$|E
