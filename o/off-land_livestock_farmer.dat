40|$|AbstractObjective/backgroundTo {{determine}} {{the occurrence of}} active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to Mycobacterium bovis in abattoir workers, butchers, <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers,</b> and veterinarians and to document their knowledge and practices regarding bovine TB (bTB). MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted among abattoir workers, butchers, <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers,</b> veterinary doctors, and veterinary assistants. Sputum samples were collected from the respondents with a chronic cough and data on sociodemographic conditions, knowledge, and practices regarding TB were obtained. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. ResultsA total of 141 abattoir workers, 317 butchers, 50 <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers,</b> five veterinary doctors, and three veterinary assistants took part. Four of 16 coughing abattoir workers and one of 50 coughing <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> were positive for M. bovis by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Duration of work as an abattoir worker was significantly associated (p< 0. 05) with prevalence of zoonotic TB. Age, education, and type of work carried out by workers were not significantly associated with zoonotic TB. None of the abattoir workers, butchers, and <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> had undergone any sort of formal training related to their work.

The {{study was to determine}} the effectiveness level of beef cattle business partnerships; the influence of the characteristics of <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers,</b> the mentoring from YMTM and the seven techniques of beef cattle business on the effectiveness of the partnership; and the influence of the effectiveness of the partnerships on the livestock farmers income. Population of the study were farmers who received cattle from YMTM. Sampling was conducted through proportional stratified, covering 156 <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers.</b> The data were analyzed by method quantitative descriptive and relationship analysis with SmartPLS. The beef cattle business partnership between YMTM and the <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> in TTU can be classified into the sufficient category of effective. All the exogenous factors, namely the characteristics of <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers,</b> mentoring YMTM and the seven techniques of beef cattle business have a significant effect on the effectiveness of the partnership. The average of the weight gain of cattle is 262 gram/catlle/day, which is tended in 2. 1 years period.

40|$|The {{practical}} use of forage paddy rice and rice is encouraged because {{it contributes to}} the effective utilization of paddy fields and production {{as well as the}} use of domestic feed. Research on forage paddy rice and rice has typically focused on the perspective of paddy or <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers.</b> However, {{to address the issue of}} the {{practical use}} of forage paddy rice and rice, the maintenance of users is necessary, and this demands the existence and cooperation of both paddy and <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers.</b> In this study, an interview survey was conducted to clarify the logic of paddy and <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> who introduce forage paddy rice and rice as well as determine the importance of intermediation companies for paddy rice farmers. We find that paddy farmers plant forage paddy rice and rice to keep paddy fields because they have to deal with adjustments to long-term production and the expansion of areas dedicated to changing crop. Meanwhile, <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> use forage paddy rice to produce coarse feed. Hence, the management strategy of individual farmers is related to the logic of introducing forage paddy rice. Further, we show that intermediation companies aim to keep the high quality of forage paddy rice and rice by monitoring paddy farmers and managing supply and demand. This is important to decrease the gap between paddy and <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> based on both logics. In particular, the monitoring and adjustment of supply and demand play a major role, and thus it is necessary for intermediation companies to improve these functions in the future...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Tax)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The current South African {{tax system}} offers <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> {{a variety of}} forms of relief. There are also certain aspects that do not make it so {{advantageous}} to be regarded as a farmer by the tax collector. A large number of farmers emigrate to other countries without knowing how the tax systems of those countries function or how much tax they will have to pay. With these factors in mind the question arises concerning how other countries tax their <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> and what relief is provided to them. The objective of this research is to examine and compare the theoretical tax legislation of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, where after it will be applied in a case study.

It was found that, although the relief provided to South African <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> regarding some aspects exceeds the relief provided in Australia and New Zealand, there are certain aspects that could be adjusted in order to make it more advantageous for <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> to stay in South Africa.

Consequences of climate hazards, such as drought, flood, and temperature variability, have been experienced in The Gambia.

40|$|Food {{safety is}} an {{important}} issue facing consumers, the food industry and the government. Since consumers cannot themselves easily assess food safety risks, their perception of food safety is in part a matter of trust in the food chain. This study focuses on <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> and investigates the causal relationship between the factors which determine consumer trust regarding food safety and in turn their purchase likelihood. The main research questions are: 1) What are the key factors which build consumer trust in this context? 2) What are the contributions of these factors to building consumer trust? 3) Is there any relationship between consumer trust and purchase likelihood? By integrating theories developed in several disciplines, six factors, namely: providing information, competence, integrity, benevolence, credibility and reliability were identified to have a strong influence on consumer trust in <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers.</b> An exploratory study in the form of face-to-face interviews was carried out to clarify the main concerns of livestock husbandry practices, and to identify the items to measure the causal factors of consumer trust in <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> regarding food safety. Because the objectives set out in this study could not be achieved by using multiple regression, which could not handle latent variables, the conceptual model was tested with a quota sample of 194 individuals {{in the form of a}} Structural Equation Model using LISREL 8. 30. It was proved successful in identifying the effects of the causal factors of trust to build consumer trust and in turn to affect purchase likelihood. The factor ‘providing information’ was identified to be a key factor by which trust is built and the features that lead to trust, namely: ‘competence’, ‘integrity’, ‘credibility’, ‘reliability’, and ‘benevolence’ were identified to be factors to build trust in <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers.</b> Representatives of the livestock industry were approached to confirm the relevance of the study and facilitate the interpretation of the findings. Though there is a limitation of its generalisation due to the sampling method, there is evidence that these factors are important to building consumer trust in <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> regarding food safety. The evidence also suggests that there is a strong relationship between trust and consumer purchase likelihood. The research confirms that <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> could draw benefit from strategies to increase their trustworthiness and in turn positively influence consumers’ purchasing decision. This study recommends further research to apply this model in other industries where the suppliers have little contact with consumers. The differences in trust building between cultures and the communication channels that <b>livestock</b> <b>farmers</b> representatives should used are also suggested for further study. Future research on how the food industry should respond to the change in consumer trust during periods of concern about food safety is also recommended. These are valid topics for future research and will provide potential benefits for consumers and food industry as a whole...|$|R
