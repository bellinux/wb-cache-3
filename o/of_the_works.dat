40|$|Purpose – Based on Job Characteristics Theory (JCT), {{the study}} {{examined}} {{direct and indirect}} precursors of task significance and psychological experiences to explain teacher work motivation. Methodology – This study employed a survey design. A sample of 497 teachers out of a 12005 - strong population was selected from National Secondary Schools in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Kedah. Cluster random sampling was used to select the samples. Data were obtained through a survey questionnaire that comprised 22 items and these were analysed using structural equation modelling and regression analysis with PROCESS MACRO. Findings – Results indicated that task significance and psychological experiences (experienced meaningfulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> experienced responsibility for outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and knowledge <b>of</b> actual results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work)</b> significantly influenced teacher work motivation. Based on the model evaluation, the overall measurement model and the structural model {{were found to be}} adequately fit. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> regression analysis with PROCESS MACRO indicated that psychological experiences (experienced meaningfulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> experienced responsibility for outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and knowledge <b>of</b> actual results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work)</b> partially mediated <b>the</b> relationship <b>of</b> task significance and teacher work motivation. Compared to experienced meaningfulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and experienced responsibility for outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> task significance seemed to exhibit a stronger impact on teacher work motivation through knowledge of actual results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Significance – <b>The</b> study proposed a model which highlighted <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> task significance and psychological experiences (experienced meaningfulness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> experienced responsibility for outcomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and knowledge <b>of</b> actual results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work)</b> as significant contributors to teacher work motivation...|$|R

This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
