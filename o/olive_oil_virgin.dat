40|$|An {{association}} between the intake of heterocyclic amines (HAs) {{and the development of}} cancer has been observed in some epidemiological studies, while in other studies no such correlation has been found. HAs are mutagenic/carcinogenic compounds formed at low levels via the Maillard reaction and a free radical mechanism during cooking of animal tissue. The addition of pure antioxidants or foods containing antioxidants has previously been shown to decrease the amount of HAs formed during cooking. In this study, beefburgers were fried in six different oils: refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil depleted of phenols, rapeseed oil, virgin olive oil with rosemary extract and refined olive oil with rosemary extract. The content of antioxidative compounds in the virgin olive oil and the rosemary extract was determined. The beefburgers were analysed with regards to 12 different HAs by solid phase extraction and HPLC analysis. MeIQx, 4, 8 -DiMeIQx, PhIP, Harman and Norharman were detected in all beefburgers fried in the different oils, but the relative amounts varied. Frying in virgin olive oil reduced the formation of HAs compared with refined olive oil. This effect is probably due to the content of phenols in the virgin olive oil. The HA-reducing effect of virgin olive oil decreased during storage, but the addition of rosemary extract may prevent this decrease...|$|E

When the oils were heated at high temperatures (frying), oxidation products were formed which were harmful to human health and antioxidants present were degraded. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate tocopherol (an antioxidant present in oils) and the behaviour of oxidation products in different olive oil classes. MCR-ALS results showed that degradation started at 70 ºC for extra virgin olive oil, while tocopherol concentration decreased and oxidation products increased starting at 40 ºC in virgin olive oil. In mixed oil, commercialized as a mixture of 85 % soybean oil and 15 % olive oil, tocopherol concentration started to decrease and oxidation products increase at 30 ºC.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the cytogenetic effects of multiple doses of four vegetable oils in rat bone marrow cells and to examine the possible antimutagenic effects of these oils in chromosomal damage induced by the antitumor drug cisplatin. These oils are consumed by humans and commonly used as drug vehicles. The rats received treatment with multiple doses of canola oil, <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil, and corn oil (5 mL kg- 1) alone or combined with the antitumor drug cisplatin (5 mg kg- 1).

Olive, virgin olive and canola oils showed protective effects against cisplatin-induced chromosomal damage (p < 0. 05). A rational mechanism for the protective effects of vegetable oils is that their phenolic compounds have antioxidant and antimutagenic properties in vivo...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{approach}} {{is presented to}} determine hydrophilic phenols in olive oil samples, employing vortex-assisted reversed-phase dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (RP-DLLME) for sample preparation and screen-printed carbon electrodes for voltammetric analysis. The oxidation of oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, caffeic acid, ferulic acid and tyrosol was investigated, being caffeic acid and tyrosol selected for quantification. A matrix-matching calibration using sunflower oil as analyte-free sample diluted with hexane was employed to compensate matrix effects. Samples were analyzed under optimized RP-DLLME conditions, i. e., extractant phase, 1 M HCl; extractant volume, 100 µL; extraction time, 2 min; centrifugation time, 10 min; centrifugation speed, 4000 rpm. The working range showed a good linearity between 0. 075 and 2. 5 mg L− 1 (r = 0. 998, N = 7) for caffeic acid, and between 0. 075 and 3 mg L− 1 (r = 0. 999, N = 8) for tyrosol. The methodological limit of detection was empirically established at 0. 022 mg L− 1 for both analytes, which is significantly lower than average contents found in olive oil samples. The repeatability was evaluated at two different spiking levels (i. e., 0. 5 mg L− 1 and 2 mg L− 1) and coefficients of variation ranged from 8 % to 11 % (n = 5). The applicability of the proposed method was tested in olive oil samples of different quality (i. e., refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>virgin</b> olive oil and extra virgin olive oil). Relative recoveries varied between 83 % and 108 % showing negligible matrix effects. Finally, fifteen samples were analyzed by the proposed method and a high correlation with the traditional Folin-Ciocalteu spectrophotometric method was obtained. Thereafter, the concentrations of the fifteen oil samples were employed as input variables in linear discriminant analysis in order to distinguish between olive oils of different quality.

40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Química. Codi: QU 0943. Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 Determining {{the quality}} of olive oil {{has always been a}} conflict, as to date, the only way that was {{available}} for classification was through tasting by a panel of experts. This differentiation, performed by a quite subjective method, could be complex, and sometimes leads to large discrepancies in the organoleptic qualities of the same oil depending on the taster to try it. Such discrepancies may result in misclassification of the oil, resulting in economic harm to producers, to determine a quality below the real to a particular product. The progress each day over chromatographic techniques coupled to mass spectrometry allows to reach detect differences in concentrations of trace compounds even in the range of parts per trillion. Through these techniques it can be quantified with high accuracy at these levels, something impossible for a tasting panel or other physicochemical techniques. In the same way, in highlighting differences between large groups of samples, technical progress with high resolving power, and the development of new information technologies has facilitated the emergence of complex statistical analyzes that allow, based a previous model, a sample assignment within a given group with a minimum data treatment. In this field, metabolomics is the most efficient methodology, as it allows, through statistical analysis of individual samples, create patterns of behavior of different groups and thus classify blind samples in each group with minimal error.
