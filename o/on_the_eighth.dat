5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a {{phenomenon known as}} gonochorism), although a few species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> segment or its appendages, or in {{a small number of}} species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage.|$|E
5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} {{is incompatible with}} {{the first and second}} boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during the war and both are incompatible with living to see the full duration of the war. The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> day of the war. The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation of the war. On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation of the war, holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> day, observing the remainder of the war through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E

5|$|Though secular {{scholars}} {{consider the}} story to be literary and not historical, circumcision features prominently in the Hebrew Bible.

5|$|Acting on MacArthur's instructions, General Walton Walker of the Eighth Army {{started the}} Home-by-Christmas Offensive at 10 a.m. on November 24, 1950. With a reconstituted ROK II Corps placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighth</b> Army's right flank, the advance {{was led by}} the US I Corps to the west, US IX Corps in the center, and the ROK II Corps to the east. The three UN Corps {{advanced}} cautiously in a continuous front line {{in order to prevent}} more ambushes similar to the Chinese First Phase Campaign, but the lack of manpower stretched the UN forces to the limit. Except for the strong Chinese resistances against the ROK II Corps, the Eighth Army met little opposition, and the line between Chongju to Yongwon was occupied {{on the night of the}} November 25.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chinese {{were unable}} to exploit the {{breakthrough}} in the UN lines, {{the weakness of the}} ROK II Corps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighth</b> Army's right flank was exposed to the Chinese commanders. During the planning of the Chinese Second Phase Campaign, Peng would again focus his attention towards the ROK II Corps at the Eighth Army's right flank, resulting in a disastrous defeat for the UN forces at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, October 25 is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.|$|E
5|$|Burton and Roosevelt had a {{complicated}} history. Burton, {{as a leader}} at the 1900 Republican National Convention, was perhaps instrumental in Roosevelt's securing his party's nomination. Roosevelt's last appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (whose jurisdiction, at the time, included appeals from Kansas) had been William Cather Hook, a choice favored by Burton's political opponents: Senator Chester I. Long (R-KS) and Governor Willis J. Bailey (R-KS). When the next vacancy opened <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighth</b> Circuit, Burton and his allies favored the appointment of Charles Blood Smith. D.W. Mulvane was unsuccessful in pressing Smith's candidacy in a June 1903 meeting with Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> abdominal segment.|$|E
5|$|Following Stanford's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{took the}} field at its 25-yard line and {{embarked}} upon one of its longest drives {{of the game in}} terms of the number of plays.

He threw six passes, completing 3 for 39yards, and ran once, for no gain. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> play of the drive, running back Ryan Williams gained one yard, then committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty. Tech's drive faltered after the penalty: Taylor threw an incomplete pass, then was sacked for a 16-yard loss, and the Hokies punted to the Stanford 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Robert Burnell (sometimes spelled Robert Burnel; c. 1239– 25 October 1292) was an English bishop {{who served}} as Lord Chancellor of England from 1274 to 1292. A native of Shropshire, {{he served as a}} minor royal {{official}} before entering into the service of Prince Edward, the future King Edward I of England. When Edward went <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighth</b> Crusade in 1270, Burnell stayed in England to secure the prince's interests. He served as regent after the death of King Henry III of England while Edward was still on crusade. He was twice elected Archbishop of Canterbury, but his personal life—which included a long-term mistress who was rumoured to have borne him four sons—prevented his confirmation by the papacy. In 1275 Burnell was elected Bishop of Bath and Wells, after Edward had appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1274.|$|E

5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old. The eyes open <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>eighth</b> day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E
5|$|Amphibious {{landings}} at Inchon by X Corps hit North Korean {{forces from}} behind, allowing I Corps and IX Corps {{to break out}} of Pusan. Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighth</b> Army front were taken by I Corps troops. By the end of October the city of Chongju, forty miles from the Yalu River border of North Korea, had been captured.|$|E
5|$|Following Walker's orders, {{most of the}} Eighth Army's major units {{promptly}} broke {{contact with}} the Chinese and withdrew, but the US 2nd Infantry Division was forced to stay at Kunu-ri in order to hold off the Chinese forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eighth</b> Army's right flank. By the time the 2nd Infantry Division tried to withdraw {{on the night of}} November 29, the two Chinese divisions attacked the US 38th Infantry Regiment. The PVA 112th Division first struck the 38th Infantry Regiment on the left flank, but the American defenses held firm, forcing the Chinese to go on the defensive. Meanwhile, the PVA 114th Division attacked the Turkish Brigade and the right flank of the 38th Infantry Regiment. The Chinese outflanked the Turks by attacking along the southern bank of the Kaechon River, then crossed the river in the UN rear areas. Upon noticing this development, Brigadier General Tahsin Yazıcı of the Turkish Brigade ordered a withdrawal, leaving the right flank of the 38th Infantry Regiment completely uncovered. By the dusk of November 29, Chinese had cut the road between the 38th Infantry Regiment and Kunu-ri, and the Americans had to retreat by infiltrating the Chinese lines. At 4 a.m. on November 30, the 38th Infantry Regiment crossed the Kaechon River under the cover of the 23rd Infantry Regiment and Kunu-ri was under Chinese control.|$|E
