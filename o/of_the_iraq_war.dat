5|$|During the Labour {{leadership}} campaign, {{he described}} himself as a socialist, and spoke out against some of the actions of the Blair ministry, including criticising its record on civil liberties and foreign policy. Though he was not yet an MP {{at the time of the}} 2003 vote, Miliband was a strong critic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> He backed UK military action and intervention in Afghanistan and Libya respectively.|$|E

50|$|His {{relations}} with the United States became strained following <b>the</b> withdrawal <b>of</b> Spanish forces from <b>Iraq,</b> and <b>the</b> new relationship Zapatero built with two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War's</b> most vocal critics, France and Germany, until those countries elected new leaders. As Zapatero had vocally supported the incumbents, he strained relationships with the new leaders.|$|R

5|$|Outside {{the museum}} building, an ex-Iraqi Army T-55 tank {{was put on}} display at the main {{entrance}} in August 2008. This vehicle was captured by the Royal Engineers during the opening stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War</b> in 2003. The spot had previously been occupied by an Iraqi ZSU-23-4 Shilka anti-aircraft gun.

5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to his handling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War,</b> specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E
5|$|The United States sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China. A total of 213 U.S. competitors took part in 18 sports; the only 2 sports Americans did not compete in were soccer 5-a-side and 7-a-side. The American delegation included 16 {{former members of the}} U.S. military, including 3 veterans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> Among them were shot putter Scott Winkler, who was paralyzed in an accident in Iraq, and swimmer Melissa Stockwell, a former United States Army officer who lost her left leg to a roadside bomb in the war.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War</b> and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Brown {{became the}} deputy {{commander}} of U.S. Special Operations Command and, holding the post until 2003 {{when he was}} selected to replace Air Force General Charles R. Holland as Commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. Shortly after becoming the head of USSOCOM, in 2004, {{he was involved in}} the aftermath of the Pat Tillman friendly fire incident which culminated when he testified before the congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in 2007. Also during his tenure in command of USSOCOM he announced the creation of Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command in 2006. Brown retired in 2007 after leading USSOCOM through four years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War</b> and War in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|M Squadron {{also had}} a 3-month tour in early 2003. Corporal Ian Plank, an SBS member {{attached}} to the SAS was killed by Iraqi insurgents during a house-to-house search for a wanted high-ranking Islamist terrorist in an insurgent compound in Ramadi on 31 October 2003, {{he was the first}} UKSF combat casualty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> The SBS was also very active as part of Task Force Black, C squadron deployed to Baghdad as part of the task force in 2004, in its four-month deployment it mounted 22 raids. On 23 July 2005, M squadron, supported by troops from the SAS and US forces carried out Operation Marlborough, killing 3 members of AQI.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War</b> dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq {{to hunt for}} Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry}} from the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E

25|$|The Multi-National Force – Iraq (MNF–I), often {{referred}} to as the coalition forces, was a military command during <b>the</b> 2003 invasion <b>of</b> <b>Iraq</b> and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ensuing <b>Iraq</b> <b>War,</b> led by <b>the</b> United States <b>of</b> America (Operation Iraqi Freedom), United Kingdom (Operation TELIC), Australia, Spain and Poland, responsible for conducting and handling military operations.|$|R
5|$|The brigade had {{a tour of}} duty in Iraq {{in early}} 2003, at the very {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> Dutton led 3 Commando, as well as supporting units from the Royal Engineers, 7 Armoured Division, 16 Air Assault Brigade along with troops from multiple other nations, including US Marines, the first time American troops had been under the operational command of a British officer since the Second World War. Royal Marines from 40 Commando under Dutton's overall command, along with United States Navy SEALs, secured oil fields on the Al-Faw Peninsula to prevent them from being burned in the first days of the ground operation, after which 40 Commando and others from 3 Commando Brigade moved up the peninsula and took the port city of Umm Qasr, where they encountered resistance into the fifth day of the ground campaign.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{itself has}} not seen a deployment, even though all subordinate units have been deployed for several support missions. The 96th CA Battalion deployed units in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War</b> in mid-2007. The brigade also had troops deployed in support of special operations units in Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan. The brigade suffered several casualties in Iraq, including two soldiers killed by improvised explosive devices. One of these soldiers, a Major, prompted the State of California to fly its flags at half staff. It also suffered several casualties which were rehabilitated through the new Wounded Warrior Project. The 98th Civil Affairs Battalion also had soldiers deployed to Iraq before its activation in 2008. Soldiers of this battalion also saw deployments to Africa {{as well as other}} areas in support of the Global War on Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial Dennis Hastert and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the Republicans had to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the game, First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden escorted former Yankees catcher and World War II veteran Yogi Berra to the mound, {{where the}} {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown by a veteran <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>War.</b> The Phillies' Ryan Howard {{got the first}} hit of the 2009 World Series by doubling in the first inning. Howard was stranded {{in the first and}} the game was scoreless after two innings. The Phillies scored first with a two-out solo home run by Chase Utley {{in the top of the}} third inning. Through the first five innings, Philadelphia starting pitcher Cliff Lee allowed no runs and three hits, striking out seven Yankees batters. In the top of the sixth, Utley hit another solo home run to give the Phillies a 2–0 lead. The starting pitchers Lee and CC Sabathia continued to pitch until the top of the eighth when Sabathia was replaced by Phil Hughes. Hughes walked the first two batters and was replaced by Dámaso Marte. Marte got two quick outs and was relieved by David Robertson, who walked Jayson Werth and gave up a two-run single to Raúl Ibañez. The Phillies added two more runs in the ninth with an RBI single by Shane Victorino and an RBI double by Howard. Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and striking out ten batters, not walking any of the hitters he faced.|$|E
