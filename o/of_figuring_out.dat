500|$|In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, {{published}} The Hidden Curriculum, {{arguing that}} education at MIT was often slighted {{in favor of}} following a set of unwritten expectations, and that graduating with good grades was more often the product <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, {{was the one who}} was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled [...] "course bibles"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the Virginia Tech Massacre in 2007, Moran told a local radio station that the Federal Assault Weapons Ban should be {{reinstated}} {{despite the fact that}} the shooting had been carried out by a pistol legal under the assault weapons ban, thus would have had no effect upon the shooting, and blamed the National Rifle Association, which he accused of getting a [...] "free ride", and President George W. Bush for blocking gun control legislation. He further warned that if gun control legislation was not passed, then shootings such as the one at Virginia Tech will happen [...] "time and time again." [...] He later dismissed charges that he was politicizing the shooting, telling Politico that [...] "as a legislator, your immediate reaction is to think something could be done to avoid this. I don't know why the idea <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> how to avoid it is a political partisan issue." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferris Jabr of New Scientist {{approved}} of Contagion for accurately portraying the [...] "successes and frustrations" [...] of science. Jabr cites story {{elements such as}} [...] "the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they {{need to figure out}} how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells" [...] as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, [...] "It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, and how many of them die." [...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk." [...] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that [...] "typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here." [...] Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus.|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea was}} that that city only has one tiny {{splinter}} of Terrigen Crystal, which meant it couldn't do the Terrigenesis ritual that Inhumans go through at maturity to sort <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what their powers are going to be.

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles {{considered}} the album [...] "an unexpected magnum opus", and while Pareles felt that [...] "the rock CD overpowers the acoustic one", he considered that [...] "among the quieter songs, {{there are enough}} supple melodies and hypnotic guitar patterns to suggest fine prospects for a follow-through album". Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly described the discs of In Your Honor as [...] "the outdoors and indoors sides", with the rockers [...] "pack an intoxicating wallop: 90-proof rock for 90-degree weather, they'll sound terrific blasting from convertibles, open windows, boom boxes, and at barbecues and beach parties" [...] and the acoustic songs [...] "all very pretty — sometimes scarily so", ultimately concluding that [...] "you'll probably revisit the rockin' half more often". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered that the record [...] "showcases a reinvigorated band that is eager to stretch out and experiment", with the rock record having a [...] "fluid musicality and a [...] sense of drama that gives it a nearly cinematic sense of scope", and the acoustic album being [...] "quieter, {{but it also has}} a similar flow and easy grace that makes it a fitting complement to the harder first record." [...] Reviewer Joe Gross of Spin described the hard rock disc as [...] "the most consistent rockers of Grohl's career" [...] and considered that the album as a whole [...] "chronicle the physical and mental graffiti <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> how to emerge from some very large shadows, including his own, with nerve and power" [...] While Mike Schiller of PopMatters considered that [...] "In Your Honor has some great tunes, but {{it is by no means}} perfect", he praised the rock songs for [...] "indications of just how loud this band can get", and regarding the acoustic tracks, wrote that [...] "despite the down-tempo feel, the songs are infectious".|$|E

2500|$|In his {{ironically}} entitled essay My Life as an [...] "Anti-Semite", from The Politics of Anti-Semitism (2007), Cockburn wrote, [...] "Over {{the past}} 20 years I've learned there's {{a quick way}} <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> just how badly Israel is behaving. You see a brisk uptick {{in the number of}} articles here accusing the left of anti-Semitism." [...] He went on to add: [...] "Back in the 1970s when muteness on the topic of how Israel was treating Palestinians was near-total in the United States, I'd get the anti-Semite slur hurled at me once in a while for writing about such no-no stuff as Begin's fascist roots in Betar, or the torture of Palestinians by Israel's security forces.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned {{rave reviews}} {{for his role}} as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a {{considerable}} [...] "good-guy air"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, [...] "This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [...]" [...] Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would [...] "force" [...] something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said [...] "Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One {{way to get out of}} the mess <b>of</b> <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer’s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person’s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin’s assumptions we can reformulate the person’s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead of worrying about the investor’s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E
