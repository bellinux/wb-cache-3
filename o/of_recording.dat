We establish some bounds for the Sharma-Mittal entropy <b>of</b> <b>record</b> values. We generate a characterization result based on the properties of Sharma-Mittal entropy <b>of</b> <b>record</b> values for exponential distribution. We further establish some distribution free properties of Sharma-Mittal divergence information between distribution <b>of</b> a <b>record</b> value and the parent distribution. We extend the concept of Sharma-Mittal entropy to the concomitants <b>of</b> <b>record</b> values arising from a Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM)  bivariate distribution.
