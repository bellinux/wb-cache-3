Raja Ighbaria explained the reasoning behind the group's opposition as follows:"Going back in history, Jewish immigration to Palestine has always been {{at the expense of}} the Palestinian people. It resulted in the expulsion of Palestinians from their homeland. Adding one million Jews to Israel [...] forms an actual danger to the very fact <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>existence.</b> Transfer of the remaining Palestinians comes closer to realization than it had been before." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Orthodox Christians {{refer to}} Fallen Nature {{they are not}} saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed {{in the image of}} God; we are still God's creation, and God has never created {{anything}} evil. But our fallen nature remains open to evil intents and actions. It is sometimes said that we are [...] "inclined to sin"; that is, we find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors. But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the beginning <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> we lie open to sinning by our own choice.|$|E
2500|$|Within the church, {{there have}} also been a number of {{unofficial}} statements regarding gender. For example, [...] "Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family" [...] (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, [...] "Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to understand and appreciate the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children." [...] The book also states: God created us male and female. This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. What we call gender is an essential characteristic <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>existence</b> prior to our birth. Gender is part of our eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. Although we may not know all the reasons why this is so, we do know some of the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. To achieve our exaltation, an eternal marriage {{between a man and a}} woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 October 1932, Papen {{delivered}} {{a speech on}} German radio outlining what his government was attempting to achieve. Papen stated the [...] "enemy of the people" [...] was [...] "cultural bolshevism" [...] which was working to [...] "subvert the spiritual foundation <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>existence,</b> loyalty to our people, as well as faith in the eternal truths of Christianity". Papen called for a [...] "conservative policy of renewal" [...] of raising the [...] "supremacy of state power" [...] as the [...] "fundamental error of the enyclopaedists and the liberal era was the proclamation of unlimited freedom of thought, that freedom which destroys before it has constructed anything, that freedom which in molding public opinion reproduces itself daily by the thousands, yet conveys to the people nothing, but the corrosive poison of negative criticism and spiritual abnegation". To which end, Papen called {{for the creation of}} the volksgemeinschaft (the [...] "people's community" [...] or [...] "national community") that would unite the German people as one. Papen ended his speech with the call for Christian renewal, saying [...] "The doctrines of Christianity, which have already trained and watched over the European peoples for over a thousand years, and to which the spiritual life [...] of the German people in particular is inextricably bound, are more vital to us today than ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|He noted {{further that}} Hamas had removed {{significant}} sections of their constitution {{which called for}} Israel's destruction, though the basic idea remains the same: Israel cannot be allowed to remain as a Jewish state in the Middle East. [...] "In the past," [...] he said, [...] "it was said that we don't understand politics, only force, but we are a broad, well-grounded movement that is active {{in all areas of}} life. Now we are proving that we also understand politics better than the others." [...] Abu Tir's final thought on Israeli negotiation was to leave it to the new parliament [...] "as with every matter, to be discussed and decided upon in a rational manner". After Hamas's landslide victory in January 2006 many countries decided to back Israel's decision to cut foreign aid to The Palestinian Authority. After being asked what Hamas planned to do in light of this Abu Tir stated that Hamas [...] "would not go to foreign donors on [...] bended knee". In a 6 February 2006 open letter to Newsweek International Tir stated that [...] "The European Union and America should cooperate with us. We have ways of creating understanding among our people. We are facilitators, helpers, aides. The presence of Hamas is a guarantee of safety and stability in the region. Any money that is given to us will be channelled to the correct path." [...] As he tried to address Western fears that donations would go to buy arms Tir told the West to [...] "... be afraid...we can always find arms on the black market. It is obvious that we have built our military infrastructure in that way. Our weapons are the only guarantee <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>existence.</b> If a proper Palestinian state were established, then all the militias would melt inside the Palestinian Army." [...] Summing up his letter Tir attempted to ease western anxiety about Hamas by stating that [...] "The West has nothing to fear from Hamas. We're not going to force people to do anything. We will not impose Sharia. Hamas is contained. Hamas deals only with the Israeli occupation. We are not Al Qaeda." ...|$|E
