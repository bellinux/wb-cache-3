Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E

A test of this hypothesis is that the negative latitudinal <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> gradient in the central equatorial Pacific should lead to an associated negative gradient in species richness. Here, we show that species richness in the central equatorial Pacific is positively associated with the <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> predicted from the pattern reported for the North Atlantic.

40|$|Detailed {{knowledge}} of environmental conditions {{is required to}} understand faunal production in coastal seas with topographic and hydrographic complexity. We test the hypothesis that organic biomass and production of subtidal sediment invertebrates throughout the Strait of Georgia, west coast of Canada, can be predicted by depth, substrate type and <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> modified to reflect lability and age of material. A basin-wide database of biological, geochemical and flux data was analysed using an empirical production/biomass (P/B) model to test this hypothesis. This analysis is unique in the spatial extent and detail of P/B and concurrent environmental measurements over a temperate coastal region. Modified <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> {{was the most important}} predictor of organic biomass and production. Depth and substrate type were secondary modifiers. Between 69 - 74 % of variability in biomass and production could be explained by the combined environmental factors. Organisms < 1 mm were important contributors to biomass and production primarily in shallow, sandy sediments, where high P/B values were found despite low <b>organic</b> <b>flux.</b> Low biomass, production, and P/B values were found in the deep, northern basin and mainland fjords, which had silty sediments, low <b>organic</b> <b>flux,</b> low biomass of organisms < 1 mm, and dominance by large, slow-growing macrofauna. In the highest <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> and biomass areas near the Fraser River discharge, production did not increase beyond moderate flux levels. Although highly productive, this area had low P/B. Clearly, food input is insufficient to explain the complex patterns in faunal production revealed here. Additional environmental factors (depth, substrate type and unmeasured factors) are important modifiers of these patterns. Potential reasons for the above patterns are explored, along with a discussion of unmeasured factors possibly responsible for unexplained (30 %) variance in biomass and production.

Station B is well-oxygenated throughout the year and material {{for this study was}} collected just after the spring bloom in May 2000. The aim of the experiment was to assess the separate effect of the principal environmental parameters, oxygen concentration and <b>organic</b> <b>flux,</b> on the benthic foraminiferal assemblage. Oxygen appears to induce the strongest changes, especially on the vertical distribution of the foraminifera. When subjected to anoxic conditions most species, except some intermediate to deep infaunal taxa (Melonis barleeanus, Globobulimina spp.), migrate towards the sediment water interface, apparently trying to escape the hostile conditions. Adding organic matter affected only some shallow living, opportunistic taxa (Epistominella exigua, Adercotryma glomerata). All other species display no significant response to enhanced food conditions, under either oxic or anoxic conditions. The outcome of our experiment suggests that the assemblages of this mesotrophic environment are influenced more strongly by variation in oxygen levels than by changes in <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> on a short time scale (days to weeks). On a longer time scale <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> is important in regulating abundances...|$|E
40|$|For the {{investigation}} of <b>organic</b> carbon <b>fluxes</b> reaching the seafloor, oxygen microprofiles were measured at 145 sites in different sub-regions of the Southern Ocean.

Based on this data set {{as well as on}} previous published data, a relationship was established for the estimation of fluxes derived by ex situ measured O 2 profiles. The <b>fluxes</b> of labile <b>organic</b> matter range from 0. 5 to 37. 1 mg C m&# 8722; 2 d&# 8722; 1.

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} model of organic substrate biodegradation in membrane-attached biofilms growing in extractive membrane bioreactors is presented and analysed {{to establish the}} rate-limiting steps. The model accounts for counterdiffusion and reaction of oxygen and organic substrate within the biofilm, and predicts detailed substrate concentration profiles and the evolution over time of biofilm thickness. Good agreement was found between model predictions and <b>organic</b> substrate <b>flux</b> and biofilm thickness measured experimentally in a lab-scale single-tube extractive membrane bioreactor. Analysis using this model showed that, due to oxygen diffusion limitations, the reaction zone within the biofilm {{is located at the}} biofilm/biomedium boundary and constitutes {{a small fraction of the}} entire biofilm volume. This allows a considerable simplification of biofilm modelling. A simple diffusion model was formulated as an alternative to the more complex full diffusion-reaction model for the calculation of <b>organic</b> substrate <b>flux.</b> This simple model is based on the insight that the <b>organic</b> compound <b>flux</b> is limited primarily by the biofilm diffusion resistance. The diffusion model was combined to a yield-based expression for biofilm accumulation to give the evolution over time of biofilm thickness.

The benthic foraminiferal faunas indicate that during LGM times, bottom waters were well ventilated, while <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> to the sea floor {{was significantly higher than}} today. From 30 to 10. 2  ka BP, faunal density and composition suggest a gradual decrease in <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> to the sea floor. This trend is interrupted by a short return to higher <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> levels during the Younger Dryas (12. 8 – 11. 5  ka BP). The faunas immediately preceding the early to middle Holocene organic-rich layer (sapropel) S 1 are very similar to Late Holocene faunas, indicating oligotrophic conditions. The transition from well ventilated bottom waters to anoxic (Levantine Basin) or strongly dysoxic (Aegean Sea) bottom waters appears to take place within a time-span of only 600  years, from ∼ 10. 8 to 10. 2  ka BP. Sapropel S 1 (10. 2 – 6. 4  ka BP) is characterized by extended periods of bottom-water anoxia in the Levantine Basin, and by strongly dysoxic conditions punctuated by episodic re-ventilation events in the Aegean Sea. Re-establishment of fully oxygenated bottom-water conditions after sapropel S 1 was extremely rapid. The ensuing Late Holocene faunas are very similar to recent faunas found in the Aegean Sea, suggesting much lower fluxes of organic matter to the sea floor than during glacial times...|$|E

40|$|Size {{distributions}} of biotic assemblages are important modifiers of productivity and function in marine sediments. We investigated {{the distribution of}} proportional organic biomass among logarithmic size classes (2 (- 6) J to 2 (16) J) in the soft-bottom macrofaunal communities of the Strait of Georgia, Salish Sea {{on the west coast}} of Canada. The study examines how size structure is influenced by 3 fundamental habitat descriptors: depth, sediment percent fines, and <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> (modified by quality). These habitat variables are uncorrelated in this hydrographically diverse area, thus we examine their effects in combination and separately. Cluster analyses and cumulative biomass size spectra reveal clear and significant responses to each separate habitat variable. When combined, habitat factors result in three distinct assemblages: (1) communities with a high proportion of biomass in small organisms, typical of shallow areas (3 g C/m(2) /yr/δ(15) N) from the Fraser River; and (3) communities with biomass dominated by moderately large organisms, but lacking the smallest and largest size classes, typical of deep, fine sediments experiencing low modified <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> (< 3. 0 gC/m(2) /yr/δ(15) N). The remaining assemblages had intermediate habitat types and size structures.

40|$|The {{study of}} extant organisms is {{the base of}} the {{environmental}} micropaleontology, since the knowledge of natural mechanisms, which regulate their distribution in present environments, is the necessary base for the reconstruction of fossil environments. Since most shallow-water taxa well tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, the <b>organic</b> <b>flux,</b> which determines trophic levels, appears the most important factor that regulates the distribution of benthic foraminifera. On the contrary, other variables like substrate, temperature and salinity are less important for their occurrence. Since the end of the 90 s, many studies have been performed on recent benthic foraminifera from a small marine basin located along the southern Tuscan shelf, characterized by the sedimentary contribution of the Ombrone River. The geographical features of this basin, named Ombrone River Basin (ORB), are unfavourable to the organic matter dispersion, determining a particularly suitable environment for the study of eutrophicated sea-bottoms. Researches evidenced the correlation between a typical assemblage, dominated by the opportunistic Valvulineria bradyana and the <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> of fluvial origin. Particularly, the statistical multivariate analysis performed on 127 samples from the ORB helped to determine the distribution of such assemblage. In this work, the quantitative parameters describing the structure of the V. bradyana assemblage (species richness, heterogeneity, dominance) are evidenced and discussed, defining an actualistic model for assemblages {{that could be used to}} evidence the organic paleo-flux in coastal marine areas influenced by river contributions. During the Early Pleistocene, the coast of Latium was located in eastern position with respect to the present one. In front to the coast, some structural highs emerged, forming an island lineage parallel to the coast and delimiting a narrow inner basin. In this basin, the Tiber River and other minor rivers built their delta systems. This paleogegraphic setting has been evaluated as favourable to the development of eutrophicated environments, and consequently many tens of available samples from the clayey terms of the Chiani-Tevere Formation have been considered for a comparison with the actualistic model. The foraminiferal assemblages from three sites, Civita di Bagnoregio, Orte, and Nazzano, are dominated by V. bradyana and show quantitative parameters coinciding with the recent model utilized as marker of the <b>organic</b> <b>flux.</b> These episodes of eutrophication in the inner Tyrrhenian basin may be considered coeval, because all the three successions are ascribed to the Santernian (Globigerina cariacoensis Zone). Considering the paleogeography of the region, it may be supposed that the Civita di Bagnoregio site was probably influenced by the contribution of a small river which flowed into the Tyrrhenian Sea near this locality. In addition, the Orte and the Nazzano sites corresponded to the Nera and Farfa delta systems, respectively. These preliminary results are encouraging for the development of the research aimed to the reconstruction of the organic paleo-flux along the coast of Latium, with useful implications for a detailed paleogeographic reconstruction of the Santernian middle Tiber Valley. In addition, the good accordance between a paleogeographic reconstruction based on geological evidences and the preliminary results obtained by paleoecological proxies, validate the utility of the actualistic model considered as typical marker of the river <b>organic</b> <b>flux...</b>|$|E

We find that most of the major taxa show a clear W to E shallowing of their upper or lower depth limit, coinciding with a W to E decrease in the surface water primary production, and in the estimated flux of the labile organic matter to the sea floor. This observation implies that the bathymetrical succession of these taxa is indeed determined by the <b>organic</b> <b>flux.</b> In the western Mediterranean, we find successions from more oligotrophic taxa at greater water depths to more eutrophic taxa in more shallow water. Towards the eastern Mediterranean, most eutrophic taxa tend to become increasingly rare, or even to disappear, whereas the more oligotrophic taxa show a clear shoaling of their depth range. Deep infaunal taxa are mainly limited to {{the western part of the}} Mediterranean. This is explained by their dependency on a relatively elevated <b>organic</b> <b>flux,</b> and by the fact that the bacterial stocks on which they feed may become unattainable when the redox front is positioned too deep in the sediment. The close similarity between the flux level controlling our main faunal boundary, and the flux levels coinciding with important faunal changes in other parts of the world ocean, suggests that a flux level of about 2 – 3 g labile C m? 2 y? 1 level corresponds to a benthic ecosystem threshold value of global importance...|$|E

In addition, the model includes a description of surface sediments and organic carbon early diagenesis. The integrated representation of material fluxes from the productive surface ocean down to the sediment-water interface allows taking advantage of surface ocean observations, sediment trap data and exchange fluxes at the sediment-water interface.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study that}} aims to overcome oxygen limitations in membrane-attached biofilms in the Extractive Membrane Bioreactor (EMB), by using nitrate instead of oxygen as an electron acceptor. In the EMB target organic compounds are extracted through a dense membrane into a bioreactor, where they are biodegraded. However, due to bacterial attachment, a membrane-attached biofilm forms on the biomedium side of the membrane. This is problematic as an inverse relationship between the <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> and biofilm growth is commonly observed. In the aerobic EMB, this {{is thought to be}} a consequence of the low solubility of oxygen in water - oxygen can therefore only penetrate thin biofilms. Thus this problem might be overcome by using nitrate, which is very soluble in water. It is hypothesized in this anoxic EMB that nitrate can fully penetrate the biofilm and therefore overcome the inactive zones of bacteria. To test this hypothesis, four experiments have been performed in an EMB with toluene as a model pollutant. The effect of excess and low nitrate concentrations on biofilm formation and toluene flux has been investigated. At low nitrate concentrations, a decrease in pollutant flux concomitant with biofilm growth was observed. Conversely, no biofilm was formed and the flux remained high using excess nitrate. Therefore, to investigate the effect of excess nitrate with biofilm formation, a ferric nitrate flocculent was used to force the formation of a biofilm. However, when the biofilm was formed, the toluene flux across the membrane decreased, similar to the experiment with low nitrate concentrations. This indicates that the solubility of the electron acceptor is not the sole factor controlling the decrease in <b>organic</b> <b>flux</b> with biofilm growth, as previously thought in the aerobic EMB...|$|E

Main Pond also accounted for 21 – 35 % of the total and dissolved <b>organic</b> carbon <b>flux</b> of the wetland. Similar to the inorganic materials, the flux of total and dissolved organic carbon, volatile suspended solids and dissolved organic nitrogen was northward into the wetland from the Sacramento River. In contrast, the small and positive chlorophyll a flux of Main Pond accounted for only 4 % of the chlorophyll flux (0.4  kg day− 1) in the wetland. Greater and more positive chlorophyll a flux for Lower Beaver Pond than Main Pond indicated Main Pond received its chlorophyll a from Lower Beaver Pond. The greater negative phaeophytin flux than chlorophyll a flux for Main Pond and the reverse for Lower Beaver Pond also supported the contribution of live chlorophyll a from Lower Beaver Pond to Main Pond. Over all, Lower Beaver Pond accounted for 87 % (9.1  kg day− 1) of the chlorophyll a flux among the wetland ponds. Lower Beaver Pond also produced the majority of total organic carbon (72 %) in the wetland, which again was exported southward into Main Pond. By contrast, Upper Beaver Pond accounted for only 2 – 11 % of the <b>organic</b> material <b>flux,</b> with the largest flux associated with volatile suspended solids (− 6, 949  kg day− 1). Like Lower Beaver Pond, the <b>organic</b> material <b>flux</b> in Upper Beaver Pond was characterized by negative values and indicated Lower Beaver Pond {{was a source of}} organic material to the river.|$|R
40|$|Benthic foraminifera in {{gravity and}} piston cores from two {{sites of the}} {{northern}} and southern slopes of the South China Sea (SCS) were analyzed to evaluate changes in surface productivity and deep-water mass characteristics over the last 40, 000 years. Our observations suggest that changes in <b>organic</b> carbon <b>flux,</b> that is food supply, and chemical and/or physical properties of the ambient water mass may be the two primary and intercorrelated factors controlling the distribution patterns of benthic foraminifera. When <b>organic</b> carbon <b>flux</b> increased above 3. 5 g C m**- 2 yr**- 1 in the southern SCS during the last glacial maximum and in the northern SCS during {{the first part of the}} Holocene around 10 ka B. P., a group of detritus feeders including Bulimina aculeata and Uvigerina peregrina dominated the benthic foraminiferal assemblage as shown by relative abundance (%) and accumulation rates. This may reflect episodes of increased surface productivity, possibly induced by increased input of nutrients from nearby river runoff. Suspension feeders such as Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and a group of 'opportunistic' species including Oridorsalis umbonatus, Melonis barleeanum and Chilostomella ovoidea gradually became more abundant than detritus feeders as soon as the <b>organic</b> carbon <b>flux</b> decreased to 2. 5 - 3. 5 g C m**- 2 yr**- 1. Similar glacial to interglacial changes in relative abundance and accumulation rates were observed in both cores for a number of species, including Eggerella bradyi, Globocassidulina subglobosa, Astrononion novozealandicum, Sphaeroidina bulloides and Cibicidoides robertsonianus. These changes were not correlated to the distribution patterns of organic carbon in both cores and may have been related to yet unspecified changes in chemical and/or physical properties of the ambient water mass, independent of changes in <b>organic</b> carbon <b>flux...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Lüderitz {{upwelling}} cell {{is presently}} {{the most productive}} area of the Benguela current system and abundant organic matter (OM) accumulates on the adjacent slope sediments even at great water depth. OM from two cores taken on the slope and covering the last 280 kyear was analysed in terms of "petroleum quality" (Rock-Eval), chemical features (FTIR, EDS) and petrographic composition (light microscopy and TEM). These data indicate that the OM is more oxidized at 3606 m water depth than on the upper slope sediments (1029 m) although the petroleum quality of the OM throughout the deep-water core remains surprisingly high for hemipelagic deep-sea sediments (HI= 200 – 400 mg/g). The petroleum quality of OM accumulated on the upper slope is consistently high: HI averages 450 mg/g. Two petrographic types of OM are distinguishable from microscopic observation, each ascribed to distinctive preservation mechanisms: (1) ‘Granular' amorphous OM, which dominates in the deep-water core, is formed by organo-mineral aggregates. Aggregation {{appears to be the}} primary preservation mode at this depth although is quantitatively limited (maximum TOC value of 4 wt. % of bulk sediment obtained through this process). The ultrastructure of the aggregates highlights an intimate association pattern between sedimentary OM and clays. (2) ‘Gel-like' nannoscopically amorphous OM (NAOM) largely dominates at 1000 m water depth and contains sulfur. Thus, early diagenetic sulfurization was probably involved in the preservation of this OM, but a contribution from the classical degradation–recondensation pathway cannot be ruled out. Moreover, selective preservation occurred at both sites but represents an insignificant part of the OM. <b>Organic</b> <b>fluxes</b> mainly control the occurrence and extent of sulfurisation at both water depths by determining the redox conditions at the sea floor. Aggregate formation is limited by both <b>organic</b> and mineral <b>fluxes</b> at the lower slope whereas OM supply is never limiting on the upper slope. Although consistently operating through time at both depths, preservation by organo-mineral association is limited by mineral availability and thus accounts for a relatively minor portion of the OM accumulated on this organic-rich slope. In the case of large <b>organic</b> <b>fluxes,</b> sulfurisation and/or degradation–recondensation is required to obtain TOC contents above 4 wt. % of bulk sediment in the area...|$|R
