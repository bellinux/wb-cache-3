40|$|Context The {{development}} of agents targeting androgen signalling holds promise for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Objective The emerging role of abiraterone acetate (AA), a novel, orally administered androgen synthesis inhibitor, is critically analysed. Evidence acquisition Data were acquired from critically important <b>original</b> <b>research</b> <b>published</b> in <b>peer-reviewed</b> literature or presented at conferences {{conducted by the}} American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology. Evidence synthesis The major findings are addressed in an evidence-based, objective, and balanced fashion. Conclusions AA specifically inhibits CYP 17 and substantially reduces serum androgen levels without inducing significant adrenal insufficiency. A phase 3 trial reported a significant extension of survival in metastatic CRPC with AA plus prednisone compared to prednisone alone following docetaxel. The primary toxicity of mineralocorticoid excess is manageable. The addition of low-dose corticosteroids to AA may be necessary for controlling symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{monitors}} health-risk {{behaviors of}} adolescents in United States, which include (1) violence; (2) tobacco use; (3) {{alcohol and other}} drug use; (4) sexual behaviors contributing to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases; (5) inadequate physical activity; and (6) unhealthy dietary behaviors. We reviewed <b>original</b> <b>research</b> <b>published</b> in <b>peer-reviewed</b> journals between 1985 and 2010 to synthesize evidence about the association of adolescent health-risk behaviors and academic achievement. MethodsUsing predetermined selection criteria, 122 articles were included that used at least one variable for health-risk behaviors and also for academic achievement. ResultsFor all six health-risk behaviors, 96. 6 % of the studies reported statistically significant inverse relationships between health-risk behaviors and academic achievement. ConclusionsWith this persuasive evidence about the interrelationship of health-risk behaviors and academic achievement, {{it is imperative that}} leaders in education and health act together to make wise investments in our nation's school-age youth that will benefit the entire population. A unified system that addresses both health behavior and academic achievement would have reciprocal and synergistic effects on the health and academic achievement not only of children and adolescents, but also of adults in the United States...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of social}} media (SM) as a {{surveillance}} tool of global {{illicit drug use}} is limited. To address this limitation, a systematic review of literature focused {{on the ability of}} SM to better recognize illicit drug use trends was addressed. A search was conducted in databases: PubMed, CINAHL via Ebsco, PsychINFO via Ebsco, Medline via Ebsco, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, ABI/INFORM Complete and Communication and Mass Media Complete. Included studies were <b>original</b> <b>research</b> <b>published</b> in <b>peer-reviewed</b> journals between January 2005 and June 2015 that primarily focused on collecting data from SM platforms to track trends in illicit drug use. Excluded were studies focused on purchasing prescription drugs from illicit online pharmacies. Selected studies used a range of SM tools/applications, including message boards, Twitter and blog/forums/platform discussions. Limitations included relevance, a lack of standardized surveillance systems and a lack of efficient algorithms to isolate relevant items. Illicit drug use is a worldwide problem, and the rise of global social networking sites has led to the evolution of a readily accessible surveillance tool. Systematic approaches need to be developed to efficiently extract and analyze illicit drug content from social networks to supplement effective prevention programs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (MTBI) is a major public-health concern and represents 70 - 90 % of all treated {{traumatic brain}} injuries. The last best-evidence synthesis, conducted by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Neurotrauma, Prevention, Management and Rehabilitation in 2002, found few quality studies on prognosis. The objective of this review is to update these findings. Specifically, we aim to describe the course, identify modifiable prognostic factors, determine long-term sequelae, and identify effects of interventions for MTBI. Finally, we will identify gaps in the literature, and make recommendations for future research. Methods: The databases MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were systematically searched (2001 to date). The search terms included ‘{{traumatic brain injury}}’, ‘craniocerebral trauma’, ‘prognosis’, and ‘recovery of function’. Reference lists of eligible papers were also searched.

40|$|Background: Outbreaks of {{emerging}} infectious diseases, {{especially those of}} a global nature, require rapid epidemiological analysis and information dissemination. The final products of those activities usually comprise internal memoranda and briefs within public health authorities and <b>original</b> <b>research</b> <b>published</b> in <b>peer-reviewed</b> journals. Using the 2003 {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemic as an example, we conducted a comprehensive time-stratified review of the published literature to describe the different types of epidemiological outputs. Methods and Findings: We identified and analyzed all published articles on the epidemiology of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong or Toronto. The analysis was stratified by study design, research domain, data collection, and analytical technique. We compared the SARS-case and matched-control non-SARS articles published according to the timeline of submission, acceptance, and publication. The impact factors of the publishing journals were examined according to the time of publication of SARS articles, and the numbers of citations received by SARS-case and matched-control articles submitted during and after the epidemic were compared. Descriptive, analytical, theoretical, and experimental epidemiology concerned, respectively, 54 %, 30 %, 11 %, and 6 % of the studies.

Only 22 % of the studies were submitted, 8 % accepted, and 7 % published during the epidemic. The submission-to-acceptance and acceptance-to-publication intervals of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic period were significantly shorter than the corresponding intervals of matched-control non-SARS articles published in the same journal issues (p, 0. 001 and p, 0. 01, respectively). The differences of median submission-to-acceptance intervals and median acceptance-to-publication intervals between SARS articles and their corresponding control articles were 106. 5 d (95 % confidence interval [CI] 55. 0 - 140. 1) and 63. 5 d (95 % CI 18. 0 - 94. 1), respectively. The median numbers of citations of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic and over the 2 y thereafter were 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 8. 0 - 52. 0) and 8 (IQR 3. 2 - 21. 8), respectively, significantly higher than the median numbers of control article citations (15, IQR 8. 5 - 16. 5, p, 0. 05, and 7, IQR 3. 0 - 12. 0, p, 0. 01, respectively). Conclusions: A majority of the epidemiological articles on SARS were submitted after the epidemic had ended, although the corresponding studies had relevance to public health authorities during the epidemic. To minimize the lag between research and the exigency of public health practice in the future, researchers should consider adopting common, predefined protocols and ready-to-use instruments to improve timeliness, and thus, relevance, in addition to standardizing comparability across studies. To facilitate information dissemination, journal managers should reengineer their fast-track channels, which should be adapted to the purpose of an emerging outbreak, taking into account the requirement of high standards of quality for scientific journals and competition with other online resources. © 2010 Xing et al. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
