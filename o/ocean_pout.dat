5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the sea mink was an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} a new semen diluent (diluent C) which prolongs the sustained motility of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> sperm, a distinguishing {{feature of the}} sperm of internally fertilizing teleosts. Sperm motilities were compared in the new diluent (C), based on the ionic composition of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> seminal plasma, vs. four other semen diluents (A, B, D and E) ordinarily used for extending the semen of external fertilizers. While sperm retained motility after extension of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> semen {{in all of these}} diluents, motility was significantly reduced following sperm resuspension in diluents B and D. Since sperm motility remained high in diluent C, formulated to closely mimic the composition of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> seminal plasma, it was selected for additional experimentation. Negative effects were observed on sperm motility after dilution (> 1 : 10) of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> semen with diluent C, but sperm motility could be restored by replacement of the seminal plasma. Of practical importance for storage of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> sperm at 4 degrees C, it was shown that semen dilution 1 : 3 in diluent C preserved sperm motility beyond 5 days. Although <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> sperm tolerate a fairly wide range of K+ levels (0 - 30 mmol/l), the best motility was observed from 10 - 20 mmol/l [K+], similar to the ionic levels found in seminal plasma. Finally, since no change in fertility of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> sperm occurred following 1 : 3 dilution of semen in diluent C, we conclude that diluent C is an effective medium for in vitro artificial egg insemination and prolonged motility of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> sperm.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to utilize <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> (Macrozoarces americanus) for the product ion of surimi, a washed fish mince made stable for frozen storage by incorporation of cryoprotectants. Principal factors affecting gel forming properties, freeze-thaw stability and sensory quality of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> surimi were examined alone, as well as, in combination with either red hake or turkey meat under various conditions. Parameters studied were: i) moisture and salt levels, ii) thermal gelation in a single {{as well as a}} two-stage heating process, iii) optimization of gel formimg properties and freeze-thaw stability of blended surimi, iv) texture-modifying effect of different nonfish proteins in the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> surimi and its applicability as a binder in formed products, and v) use of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> in the turkey as an extender. Compressive force (cohesiveness) and penetration force (rigidity) were measured for the evaluation of gel forming properties of surimi, and expressible moisture for water binding ability as well as freeze-thaw stability of surimi gel. Sensory quality of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> incorporated turkey roll was also evaluated. The 74 % moisture level produced the most cohesive gel while NaCl progressively increased cohesiveness and rigidity, accompanied by a general decrease in expressible moisture. Thermal gelation was best demonstrated on a single-stage heating at 90 C by maintaining the integrity of the gel; regardless of the length of time of heating as compared to a two-stage heating, heat~setting at different temperatures and subsequent cooking at 90 C.

Northern blot analysis of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> demonstrated that AFP mRNA was detected in most tissues with extremely high levels observed in the liver, and high levels in the stomach and gill. Low AFP mRNA levels were observed in skin, mouth skin, intestine, spleen, and kidney, while barely detectable levels were observed in heart, ovary, brain, and blood cells. No AFP mRNA was observed in muscle. For t-OP 5 α transgenic Atlantic salmon, AFP mRNA was detected in most tissues with high levels observed in heart, liver, stomach, and brain, low levels observed in mouth skin, intestine, spleen, gill, and muscle, and barely detectable levels observed in kidney, ovary and skin. No AFP mRNA was observed in blood cells. Northern blot analysis of EO- 1 α transgenic salmon demonstrated that expression was observed only in pituitary and spleen, with moderate expression detected in the pituitary and low expression in the spleen. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated that the OP 5 α gene is expressed in all tissues of the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout,</b> and all tissues except for blood in both transgenic Atlantic salmon lines (t-OP 5 α and EO- 1 α). Blood plasma samples from the three strains of fish were tested for AFP activity by determining the thermal hysteresis (TH) for each. TH measurements from winter acclimated <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> were high (approximately 1. 36 °C) with typical bipyrimidal ice crystal shaping indicative of a high amount of AFP, while t-OP 5 α transgenic fish showed little(< 0. 01 °C) TH activity, but yielded hexagonal shaped ice crystals indicative {{of the presence of}} AFP. On the other hand, EO- 1 α transgenics showed no (0 °C) TH activity and no ice crystal shaping, as expected. The differences observed in the level of expression between <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> and the two transgenic fish lines may be attributed to gene copy number, where it is high in <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> and low in transgenic salmon, and promoter integrity, where the promoter is intact in <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> and truncated in both transgenic lines. In addition, differences in expression levels between the two transgenic lines may be a result of {{the presence or absence of}} intervening sequences (introns) in the DNA where the t-OP 5 α construct contains introns while the EO- 1 α construct does not. Finally, it is apparent by its ubiquitous expression in transgenic Atlantic salmon that, unlike the type I AFP from winter flounder, the introns within the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> OP 5 α AFP gene do not contain tissue specific elements, or salmon lack the factors needed to recognize them...|$|E

The results from both protein chemistry and molecular biology showed that SP- 1 -A, SP- 1 -B and SP- 1 -C have very similar amino acid compositions and sequences with only minor differences. For example, SP- 1 -A contains Ile and Ala at positions 53 and 62, while both SP- 1 -B and SP- 1 -C contain respectively Leu and Val at the same positions.

40|$|A current {{problem for}} {{aquaculture}} of salmonid fish in Atlantic Canada is the susceptibility of these fish to cold water temperatures and ice.

Previous attempts at producing freeze resistant transgenic salmon by introducing the type I antifreeze protein (AFP) gene from winter flounder have yielded much optimism (Fletcher et al., 1988). The AFP activity in the resulting transgenic salmon, however, was too low to confer freeze resistance to the fish (Hew et al., 1992).

When the internal temperature of the straws had dropped to - 95 degrees C, the straws were plunged into liquid nitrogen. The frozen semen was thawed in a water bath at 1 or 30 degrees for 30 and 7 s respectively. The presence of DMSO in semen extender was essential for protecting the spermatozoa and 20 % DMSO (v/v) yielded the highest post-thaw sperm motility (20 - 25 % of the total cells).

Thawing frozen semen in water at 30 or 1 degrees did not cause any difference in terms of sperm motility. It is suggested that the loss of sperm motility during freezing and thawing is due to ultrastructural changes in spermatozoa (severe swelling of the mitochondria or dehydration of cytoplasm at the midpiece) which were detected by scanning electron microscopy.

[...] Synthesis of vitellogenin in the liver of <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> was induced by administration of the ovarian steroid 17 β-estradiol. Vitellogenin was isolated from the plasma by gel filtration and characterized biochemically.

The vitellogenin protein contains high levels of the essential amino acids, including arginine, lysine, isoleucine and leucine, valine, threonine and phenylalanine, and some non-essential amino acids, such as aspartic acid, serine, glutamic acid and alanine. With the isolated vitellogenin, antisera were prepared in rabbits and a vitellogenin radioimmunoassay was developed and used for sex determination and for studies of the seasonal changes in plasma vitellogenin. [...] The seasonal reproductive cycle of female <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> was found to be organized into 4 successive phases of reproduction: 1) a post-spawning quiescent phase (August- September to February), in which the small ovaries (GSI 1. 21 ± 0. 25) are inactive and predominated by small previtellogenic oocytes (ca. 1. 0 mm diameter); a low level of both sex steroids (testosterone and 17 β-estradiol) and vitellogenin occurs in the plasma; 2) the reproductive preparatory phase (March - May), in which the ovaries develop slowly (GSI 4. 61 ± 2. 34) and consist of both previtellogenic and small vitellogenic oocytes (4 - 5 mm diameter); plasma levels of sex steroids and vitellogenin begin rising slowly; 3) the rapid ovarian growth phase (June - August), in which both the diameter of the vitellogenic oocytes (7 - 8 mm); the GSI (16. 76 + 6. 54) and levels of sex steroids in the plasma rapidly increase and 4) the ovulation and spawning phase (August - September), when fish spawn and the plasma sex steroids return to basal levels. The females spawn once per year, producing a single batch of 1200 - 1700 eggs (8 - 9 mm diameter). The seasonal reproductive cycle in males was found to be composed of two phases, (1) a quiescent phase (October - May) and (2) the reproductive phase (June - September). The spawning season of males (occurrence of spermiation) starts with rapid testicular development, following a dramatic increase in both testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone in the plasma. [...] Increasing water temperature in the winter stimulated feeding activity but did not alter the timing of the reproductive cycle of the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout.</b> However, lengthening the photoperiod in the winter stimulated steroidogenesis and vitellogenesis and advanced the spawning season. Administration of gonadotropic hormone releasing hormone analog to mature females advanced and synchronized spawning through accelerating the preovulatory decline of plasma testosterone and 17 β-estradiol. [...] Sperm motility, pH, osmolarity and ionic composition of the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> seminal plasma were studied. Milt collected from the reproductive tract (sperm duct) of mature males contained highly motile spermatozoa (sperm) in a very low concentration. Motility of the sperm was enhanced in ovarian slime collected from the ovaries of prcspawning females but was immobilized instantly upon dilution with seawater, suggesting that the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> is an internal fertilizer. pH and osmolarity of the seminal plasma were in a range of 7. 2 - 7. 5 and 365 - 406 mOsM, respectively. Various ions including Na+, K+, Ca 1 +, Mg++ and Cl- as well as glucose were detected and quantified in the seminal plasma. Fertilized eggs were produced by artificial insemination, both in vivo (injecting sperm directly into the ovary of mature females) and in vitro. The in vitro insemination necessitated a contact period of 5 hours between the eggs and sperm for fertilization of the eggs before the eggs could be transferred into seawater for incubation. Larvae hatched from in vivo artificially inseminated eggs. [...] Studies of copulation and spawning behaviours of the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> showed that males developed a papilla (protrusion of the genital pore) and fish copulated through direct genital contact for internal fertilization of eggs. Females spawned spontaneously in captivity, 6 - 17 hours after copulation. A complete spawning process was determined to consist of 4 successive steps, including (1) oviposition (spawning), (2) wiping the eggs with skin mucus, (3) wrapping herself around the eggs and (4) guarding the egg-mass. Wiping the eggs with skin mucus could be an effective means for preventing leech and fungal infection of the eggs. Parental care and fanning increased water flow to the eggs, which is important for egg survival during a lengthy period (3 months) of incubation...|$|E
40|$|Feeding {{relationships}} of various fish species, {{and their relationship}} to the composition of the surrounding sediments, were observed for one year at two sites in the lower Bay of Fundy region. The fishes were the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> (Macrozoarces americanus), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), cod (Gadus morhua) and witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus). After reducing the size of the data matrix by removing redundant variables (prey items), interspecific diet overlap {{and the degree to which}} stomach contents reflect benthic composition were assessed using discriminant functions analysis. Variables were ranked by their power to discriminate among pairwise comparisons of groups: fish species and benthic samples. Many amphipods were utilized to a greater extent than their abundances in the sediments would suggest. Many annelids were underutilized. Each fish species has developed specialized feeding behaviours, digestion techniques and morphologies to segregate food resources. All species tend to increase prey intake at those places and times when benthic abundance of prey common to their diets increases. Visual predators (flounders) show different functional responses towards increased prey abundances than non-visual predators (<b>ocean</b> <b>pout).</b> In some cases availability is determined by prey size rather than prey abundance.;Only a few prey species show benthic density changes as a result of predation. Benthic populations may be held at an early successionary, highly productive stage by extreme physical conditions. Large fluctuations in temperature, salinity and current could provide a force regulating benthic species abundance that is at least as important as fish predation...|$|E
40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{transgenic}} G 1 and G 2 tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) {{have been produced}} following egg injection with gene constructs carrying growth hormone coding sequences of fish origin. Using a construct in which an <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> antifreeze promoter drives a chinook salmon growth hormone gene, dramatic growth enhancement has been demonstrated, in which the mean weight of the 7 month old G 2 transgenic fish is more than three fold that of their non transgenic siblings. Somewhat surprisingly G 1 fish transgenic for a construct consisting of a sockeye salmon metallothionein promoter spliced to a sockeye salmon growth hormone gene exhibited no growth enhancement, although salmon transgenic for this construct do show greatly enhanced growth. The growth enhanced transgenic lines were also strongly positive in a radio-immuno assay for the specific hormone in their serum, whereas the non growth enhanced lines were negative. Attempts to induce expression from the metallothionein promoter by exposing fish to increased levels of zinc were also unsuccessful. Homozygous transgenic fish have been produced from the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> antifreeze=chinook salmon GH construct and preliminary trials suggest that their growth performance {{is similar to that}} of the hemizygous transgenics. No abnormalities were apparent in the growth enhanced fish, although minor changes to skull shape and reduced fertility were noted in some fish. There is also preliminary evidence for improved food conversion ratios when growth enhanced transgenic tilapia are compared to their non-transgenic siblings. The long term objective of this study is to produce lines of tilapia which are both growth enhanced and sterile, so offering improved strains of this important food fish for aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|Isometric force {{measurements}} {{have had}} a long-standing application {{in the study of}} cardiac contractility and more recent studies of this ilk have been directed at elucidating excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in fish hearts. This paper brings together recent discoveries, emphasizing differences among species and the effects of temperature. The importance of such an overview is tw-fold. Foremost, the isometric studies have resulted in models of E-C coupling that are currently being tested using other techniques, some of which form important contributions to this symposium. Second, emphasis on exceptional species and experimental conditions has increased and this may blur the broader picture. Therefore, we hope to clearly establish what is known, set the stage for some of the other talks, and act as a pointer for future research. Isometric force has been measured a number of species, including: hagfish (Myxine glutinosa), little skate (Raja erinacea), spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), black dogfish (Etmopterus spinax), white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> (Macrozoarce...|$|E
40|$|Three {{lines of}} {{transgenic}} tilapia were produced harbouring a novel piscine growth hormone (GH) gene construct containing a chinook salmon growth hormone gene spliced to <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> antifreeze gene regulatory sequence. One copy to multiple {{copies of the}} transgenes were integrated at a single site in the host genome. The initial transmission rate from G 0 to G 1 generation {{was found to be}} less than 10 % in these 3 lines indicating a mosaic distribution of the transgene in the germ cells. However, transmission rates from G 1 to G 2 were found to follow the expected Mendelian ratio. Expression of chinook salmon GH was demonstrated in G 0, G 1 and G 2 transgenic fish in these lines and resulted in dramatic growth enhancement. The average weight of the G 1 and G 2 transgenic fish was found to be 3 times (P< 0. 001) greater than that of their nontransgenic siblings...|$|E
40|$|Catch-per-tow indices {{obtained}} by research vessels {{for the years}} 1963 – 2009 from NAFO statistical areas 4 W, 4 X, 5 Y, and 5 Z were studied to determine how fish “apparent abundance ” in the decade 2000 – 2009 differed from the long-term time-series. Cluster ana-lysis of normalized catch-per-tow data indicated that the abundance and species composition of stocks in each statistical area changed dramatically over the 50 -year period. There were decreases in thorny skate, <b>ocean</b> <b>pout,</b> cusk, witch flounder, and monkfish and increases in herring, haddock, northern shrimp, and spiny dogfish. Cluster analysis suggested that these decreases and increases were not gradual, but abrupt, and that these abrupt decreases and increases were concentrated in {{the decade of the}} 1980 s. Observations of abrupt change were supported by regression-tree analysis of individual stocks. Examination of the interrelationship among abundance indices from different stocks by Bonferroni-adjusted correlation coefficients showed that the abundance trajector-ies of most stocks were uncorrelated. It appears that the set of population transitions during the decade of the 1980 s was a dominant event in the statistical time-series...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies and the Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms were asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the safety of ‘Ice Structuring Protein (ISP) ’ as food ingredient. Ice structuring proteins (ISPs) are widely distributed in nature, for example in cold water fish, vegetables, grains, lichens and bacteria. ISPs bind to ice and help organisms cope with very cold environments by both lowering the temperature at which ice crystals form and by modifying {{the size and shape}} of the ice crystals so that the ice is less damaging to tissues. The applicant wishes to take advantage of these properties by adding an ISP to edible ice at a level not exceeding 0. 01 % by weight. ISP type III was originally isolated from the <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> (Macrozoarces americanus) a cold-water fish found off the northeast coast of North America. There were 12 isoforms of the protein that could be separated by HPLC and ISP type III HPLC 12, a protein of 66 amino acid...|$|E
40|$|In 1996 at AquaBounty Farms (Prince Edward Island, Canada) {{the rates}} of routine oxygen {{consumption}} of 660 growth-enhanced transgenic Atlantic salmon (carrying a chinook salmon growth hormone gene driven by an <b>ocean</b> <b>pout</b> antifreeze gene promoter) were {{compared with that of}} 660 non-transgenic salmon, over a pre-smolt body interval of 8 - 55 g {{to determine whether or not}} the transgenic salmon had a greater metabolic rate. Routine oxygen consumption rates (mg O 2 /h), inclusive of the heat increment associated with feeding, were 1. 54 - to 1. 70 -fold higher for transgenic fish compared to the controls. Integrated over time from first feeding to smolt size, the transgenic salmon actually consumed 42 % less total oxygen than the non-genetically modified controls to reach smolt size. In a post-absorptive state (24 h starvation), corresponding oxygen consumption rates of transgenic fish were 1. 58 - to 2. 30 -fold greater than that of regular salmon. The added cost to smolt producers for the short-term delivery of more water or oxygen to support the elevated metabolism of such growth-enhanced fish would appear to be justified in light of the benefits in reducing smolt production time. ...|$|E
