40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} an intermediate setting between quantum nonlocality and communication complexity problems. More precisely, we study {{the value of}} XOR games G when Alice and Bob are allowed to use {{a limited amount of}} <b>one-way</b> classical <b>communication</b> ω_o. w. -c(G) (resp. <b>one-way</b> quantum <b>communication</b> ω_o. w. -c^*(G)), where c denotes the number of bits (resp. qubits). The key quantity here is the quotient ω_o. w. -c^*(G) /ω_o. w. -c(G). We provide a universal way to obtain Bell inequality violations of general Bell functionals from XOR games for which the quotient ω_o. w. -c^*(G) /ω_o. w. - 2 c(G) is larger than 1. This allows, in particular, to find (unbounded) Bell inequality violations from communication complexity problems in the same spirit as the recent work by Buhrman et al. (2016). We also provide an example of a XOR game for which the previous quotient is optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) in terms of the amount of information c. Interestingly, this game has only polynomially many inputs per player. For the related problem of separating the classical vs quantum communication complexity of a function, the known examples attaining exponential separation require exponentially many inputs per party...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe prove three {{different}} types of complexity lower bounds for the one-way unbounded-error and bounded-error error probabilistic communication protocols for boolean functions. The lower bounds are proved {{in terms of the}} deterministic communication complexity of functions {{and in terms of the}} notion “probabilistic communication characteristic” that we define. We present boolean functions with the different probabilistic communication characteristics which demonstrates that each of these lower bounds can be more precise than the others depending on the probabilistic communication characteristics of a function. Our lower bounds are good enough for proving that proper hierarchy for <b>one-way</b> probabilistic <b>communication</b> complexity classes depends on a measure of bounded error. As the application of lower bounds for probabilistic communication complexity, we prove two {{different types of}} complexity lower bounds for the one-way bounded-error error probabilistic space complexity. Our lower bounds are good enough for proving proper hierarchies for different <b>one-way</b> probabilistic space <b>communication</b> complexity classes inside SPACE(n) (namely for bounded error probabilistic computation, and for errors of probabilistic computation) ...|$|R

40|$|We show optimal Direct Sum {{result for}} the <b>one-way</b> entanglement-assisted quantum <b>communication</b> {{complexity}} for any relation f subset of X x Y x Z. We show: Q^{ 1,pub}(f^m) = Omega(m Q^{ 1,pub}(f)), where Q^{ 1,pub}(f), represents the <b>one-way</b> entanglement-assisted quantum <b>communication</b> complexity of f with error at most 1 / 3 and f^m represents m-copies of f. Similarly for the <b>one-way</b> public-coin classical <b>communication</b> complexity we show: R^{ 1,pub}(f^m) = Omega(m R^{ 1,pub}(f)), where R^{ 1,pub}(f), represents the <b>one-way</b> public-coin classical <b>communication</b> complexity of f with error at most 1 / 3. We show similar optimal Direct Sum {{results for the}} Simultaneous Message Passing quantum and classical models. For two-way protocols we present optimal Privacy Trade-off results leading to a Weak Direct Sum result for such protocols. We show our Direct Sum and Privacy Trade-off results via message compression arguments which also imply a new round elimination lemma in quantum communication. This allows us to extend classical lower bounds on the cell probe complexity of some data structure problems, e. g. Approximate Nearest Neighbor Searching on the Hamming cube { 0, 1 }^n and Predecessor Search to the quantum setting. In a separate result we show that Newman's technique of {{reducing the number of}} public-coins in a classical protocol cannot be lifted to the quantum setting. We do this by defining a general notion of black-box reduction of prior entanglement that subsumes Newman's technique. We prove that such a black-box reduction is impossible for quantum protocols. In the final result in the theme of message compression, we provide an upper bound on the problem of Exact Remote State Preparation. Comment: Full version (version 1), 31 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
