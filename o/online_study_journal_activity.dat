5000|$|In 2002, Tanya Olson (who teaches Developmental English at Vance-Granville Community College) further {{explored}} the teacher/student relationship {{in an article}} in Bad Subjects, an <b>online</b> cultural <b>studies</b> <b>journal.</b> In this article, entitled [...] "TA/TG: The Pedagogy of the Cross-Dressed", Olson compared the experience of being a butch woman and not knowing which restroom and whether one was male or female to use to the experience of being a Teaching Assistant (TA) and not being fully a student or a teacher, drawing on it for inspiration towards creating a new conception of pedagogy. She concludes, [...] "Maybe re-defining TAs in the academy will help stop the sense of masquerade that currently characterizes their work. No matter how much they challenge accepted cultural standards or straddle societal binary divisions, everyone deserves a bathroom they can call home. From there we can create a pedagogy of the cross-dressed." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{has also}} been an {{emerging}} body of academic studies with a fat activist agenda. Marilyn Wann argues that fat studies moved beyond being an individual endeavour to being a field of study with the 2004 conference Fat Attitudes: An Examination of an American Subculture and the Representation of the Female Body The American Popular Culture Association regularly includes panels on the subject. In a number of colleges, student groups with a fat activist agenda have emerged, including Hampshire, Smith, and Antioch. Fat studies is now available as an interdisciplinary course of study at some colleges, taking a similar approach to other identity studies such as women's studies, queer studies and African American studies. As of 2011, there were 2 Australian courses and 10 American courses that were primarily focussed on fat studies or on health at every size, and numerous other courses that had some fat acceptance content. Taylor & Francis publish an <b>online</b> Fat <b>Studies</b> <b>journal.</b> In the UK, the first national Fat Studies seminar was held at York in May 2008, leading to the 2009 publication Fat Studies in the UK, edited by Corinna Tomrley and Ann Kalosky Naylor.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains two}} papers that investigate {{the use of}} metacognitive learning and thinking strategies with university-aged students learning science. The first paper reviews studies that {{have focused on the}} instructional implications of using metacognitive teaching and learning strategies in the classroom. Metacognition has been researched extensively in specific domains (such as reading) and with predominately young children. Lately, the value of metacognitive strategies has begun to be investigated in other cognitive domains (such as math and science) and with older students. The review paper ends with a suggestion for further research, extending the scope of metacognition to even broader areas.;The second paper reports a case study of eleven students 2 ̆ 7 use of metacognitive processes in a technology-enhanced introductory meteorology course. The study analyzed how novices engaging in metacognitive activities monitored and changed personal conceptions about weather processes and how they used those conceptions to write forecasts. Among the eleven students, several different metacognitive approaches to forecasting were employed. Several students changed their metacognitive approaches during the <b>study.</b> The <b>journaling</b> <b>activities,</b> interviews and other metacognitive thinking prompts probably contributed to improvements of metacognitive processes. Some suggestions for further research and practice in the area of metacognition with college-aged students learning about science are also included...|$|R
