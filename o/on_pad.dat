25|$|The {{brake pads}} must usually be {{replaced}} regularly (depending <b>on</b> <b>pad</b> material, and drivestyle), {{and some are}} equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of soft metal that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to squeal, a soft metal tab embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a warning light when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic sensor.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{one could}} claim {{in support of}} the PAD that really was there was a small 'anti-monarchy' {{movement}} which supported Thaksin. This disturbed many monarchists. Sondhi Limthongkul, forefront leader of PAD, had claimed this since 2005, when he started criticizing Thaksin Shinawatra for his 'inappropriate' act defaming the monarchy when Thaksin held a religious ceremony at the royal temple of Wat Phra Kaeo. From then <b>on,</b> <b>PAD</b> has accused Thaksin's followers as being 'anti-monarchy'. The UDD's and Thaksin's harsh attack on Prem Tinsulanonda, head of royal Privy Council and close advisor of the king, has been seen as a contradiction of Thai tradition and a hidden attempt to make a regime change. Moreover, a leader of UDD, such Jakrapob Penkair has engaged in public criticism {{of the role of the}} monarchy, mostly, seen 'negatively'. Several UDD leaders were also charged and arrested and accused of insulting the monarchy, a crime under Thai criminal law. The PAD, therefore, has always claimed that it was defending the most revered institution according to the Constitutions, blasting UDD and Thaksin Shinawatra as anti-monarchist. The controversial issue of the monarchy has been then one of the fierce causes among these factions' supporters.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{highlighted}} {{assets of}} the menstrual cup is its reusability. According to manufacturers, a cup can last a decade if used properly. Considering that {{a woman in a}} developed country will spend an average of US$60 per year <b>on</b> <b>pads</b> and tampons and that the menstrual cycle repeats itself for 35 to 40 years, this adds up to a net expense of $2,400 <b>on</b> <b>pads</b> and tampons during a lifetime. Considering that the potential life of a menstrual cup is 10 years and that it costs around 30 dollars, this adds up to a gross cost of $120 during a lifetime.|$|R
500|$|The launch {{simulation}} on January 27, 1967, <b>on</b> <b>pad</b> 34, was a [...] "plugs-out" [...] test {{to determine}} whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on (simulated) internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. Passing this test was essential to making the February 21 launch date. The test was considered non-hazardous because neither the launch vehicle nor the spacecraft was loaded with fuel or cryogenics, and all pyrotechnic systems (explosive bolts) were disabled.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the public}} 1969 fire, surveys were {{taken of the}} land outside the {{boundaries}} of Rocky Flats to quantify the amount of plutonium contamination. Researchers noted that plutonium contamination from the plant was present, but did not match the wind conditions of the 1969 fire. The 1957 fire and leaking barrels <b>on</b> <b>Pad</b> 903 have since been confirmed {{to be the main}} sources of plutonium contamination. Authors Krey and Hardy estimated the total quantity of plutonium contamination outside of Rocky Flats's boundaries to be 2.6 Ci (...) , while Poet and Martell estimated the value to be 6.6 Ci (...) [...] The study also noted that plutonium levels just outside the boundaries of the plant were hundreds of times higher than the background level caused by global fallout from nuclear testing, and that contamination {{to the north of the}} plant was probably caused by normal operations rather than accidental releases.|$|E
2500|$|Columbia spent 610 {{days in the}} Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF), another 35 days in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), and 105 days <b>on</b> <b>Pad</b> 39A {{before finally}} lifting off. [...] Columbia was {{successfully}} launched on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight (Vostok 1), and returned on April 14, 1981, after orbiting the Earth 36 times, landing on the dry lakebed runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California. [...] Columbia then undertook three further research missions to test its technical characteristics and performance. Its first operational mission, with a four-man crew, was STS-5, which launched on November 11, 1982. At this point Columbia was joined by Challenger, which flew the next three shuttle missions, while Columbia underwent modifications for the first Spacelab mission.|$|E
