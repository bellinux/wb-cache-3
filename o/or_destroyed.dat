40|$|Abstract — At present, {{intelligent}} {{planning in}} the Graphplan framework is {{a focus of}} artificial intelligence. While the Creating <b>or</b> <b>Destroying</b> Objects Planning (CDOP) is one unsolved problem of this field, one of the difficulties, too. In this paper, we study this planning problem and bring forward the idea of transforming objects to propositions, based on which we offer an algorithm, Creating <b>or</b> <b>Destroying</b> Objects in the Graphplan framework (CDOGP). Compared to Graphplan, the new algorithm can solve not only the entire problems that Graphplan do, but {{also a part of}} CDOP. It is {{for the first time that}} we introduce the idea of object-proposition, and we emphasize the discussion on the representations of creating <b>or</b> <b>destroying</b> objects operator and an algorithm in the Graphplan framework. In addition, we analyze the complexity of this algorithm. Keywords—Graphplan, object_proposition, Creating <b>or</b> <b>destroying</b> objects, CDOGP...|$|R
