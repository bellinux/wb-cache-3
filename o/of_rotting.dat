40|$|Repressor <b>of</b> toxins (<b>Rot)</b> {{is known}} to be a global {{regulator}} of virulence gene expression in Staphylococcus aureus. The function <b>of</b> <b>Rot,</b> but not the transcription <b>of</b> <b>rot,</b> is regulated by the staphylococcal accessory gene regulator (Agr) quorum-sensing system. In addition, the alternative sigma factor (σB) has a repressive effect on rot expression during the postexponential phase of growth. The transcriptional profiles <b>of</b> <b>Rot</b> in σB-positive and σB-negative strains in the postexponential and stationary phases of growth were compared. An upregulation <b>of</b> <b>rot</b> expression was observed during the stationary phase of growth, and this upregulation occurred in a σB-dependent manner. The effects of other staphylococcal transcriptional factors were also investigated. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that proteins present in staphylococcal lysates retarded the mobility <b>of</b> the <b>rot</b> promoter fragment and that the effect was reduced, but not eliminated, with lysates from strains lacking a functional SarS protein. A modest upregulation <b>of</b> <b>rot</b> expression was also observed in sarS-negative strains. Affinity purification of proteins binding to the rot promoter fragment, followed by N-terminal protein sequencing, identified the SarA and SarR proteins. Primer extension analysis <b>of</b> the <b>rot</b> promoter revealed a number of discreet products.

5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} <b>of</b> <b>rotting</b> wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, {{although the majority of}} sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, burning, and sowing two to three years previously.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae.

This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs <b>of</b> <b>rotting</b> hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and quantity of light received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{read-only}} transaction (ROT) {{does not}} modify any data. The main issues regarding processing ROTs are correctness, data currency and perform-ance. Two-phase Locking (2 PL) protocol {{is widely used}} for concurrency con-trol with serializabilty as correctness criteria. Even though 2 PL processes ROTs correctly with no data currency related issues, the performance deteriorates as data contention increases. To improve the performance over 2 PL, snapshot iso-lation (SI) -based protocols have been proposed. SI-based protocols process ROTs by reading from {{a snapshot of the}} committed data and ignoring the modi-fications produced by the concurrent active transactions. Even though SI-based algorithms improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>ROTs,</b> both data currency <b>of</b> <b>ROTs</b> and correctness (serializability) are compromised. In this paper, we propose an ap-proach to improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>ROTs</b> using speculation without compromising data currency of transactions and correctness. The proposed approach improves the performance <b>of</b> <b>ROTs</b> by trading extra computing re-sources without violating serializability as correctness criteria. The simulation results show that with the proposed protocol the throughput performance is im-proved significantly over 2 PL and SI-based approaches with manageable extra resources...|$|R
5|$|There are {{numerous}} different microhabitats in a wood; coniferous forest, broad-leafed forest, open woodland, scattered trees, woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern and moss. The greater the structural {{diversity in the}} wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, {{and a range of}} features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain {{it has been estimated that}} various types <b>of</b> <b>rotting</b> wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.|$|E
5|$|There are {{primarily}} two feeding guilds in Lepidoptera – the nectarivorous who obtain {{the majority of}} their nutritional requirements from floral nectar and those of the frugivorous guild who feed primarily on juices <b>of</b> <b>rotting</b> fruit or fermenting tree sap. There are substantial differences between the morphology of the proboscises of both feeding guilds. Hawkmoths (family Sphingidae) have elongated proboscises which enable them to feed on and pollinate flowers with long tubular corrollas. Besides this, a number of taxa (especially noctuid moths) have evolved different proboscis morphologies. Certain noctuid species have developed piercing mouthparts; the proboscis has sclerotised scales on the tip with which to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices. Proboscises in some Heliconius species have evolved to consume solids such as pollen. Some other moths, mostly noctuids, have modified proboscises to suit their mode of nutrition – lachrymophagy (feeding on tears of sleeping birds). The proboscises often have sharp apices as well as a host of barbs and spurs on the stem.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells <b>of</b> <b>rotting</b> meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
