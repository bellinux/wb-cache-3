5|$|The Court of Appeal {{also held}} that legal {{precedents}} from other Commonwealth jurisdictions supported {{a rejection of}} the subjective test in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> test. The subjective test was applied in Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and subsequently affirmed in Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941). However, these decisions had been departed from in subsequent decisions by the Privy Council and House of Lords. These courts had rejected the subjective test applied by the majority in Liversidge, preferring the objective test applied by Lord Atkin in his dissenting judgment. In the light of these developments, the Malaysian case of Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister for Home Affairs), Malaysia (1969), which had applied the test in Liversidge and which the respondents' counsel had relied on in support of the subjective test, could no longer be considered good law. Additionally, Teh Cheng Poh v. Public Prosecutor (1978) decided by the Privy Council on appeal from Malaysia, was referred to by the Court in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> test. The case concerned the exercise of discretionary power under the Malaysian Internal Security Act, which the ISA of Singapore is derived from.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the logical expression of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the worldâ€“ asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E

5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the subjective test in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> test on the following grounds. Firstly, the Court held that Karam Singh and other cases following it were no longer good law in so far as they applied Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had been wrong, and preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting judgment in Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{events are}} split up into two groups: the seven {{objective}} tests (art, economics, language and literature, math, music, science and social science) the three subjective events (essay, interview and speech). In addition, {{there is a}} SuperQuiz relay event. The former seven are given as half-hour multiple choice tests, whereas the latter three are graded by judges. The multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each, {{with the exception of}} math, which has 35 questions. Beginning in the 2012-2013 season, the SuperQuiz written test was dropped and the oral relay was changed to include questions from six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> subjects: art, economics, language and literature, music, science, and social science.|$|E

5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective.</b> The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{entering}} variable will, in general, increase from 0 {{to a positive}} number, the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function will decrease if the derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function {{with respect to this}} variable is negative. Equivalently, the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function is decreased if the pivot column is selected so that the corresponding entry in the objective row of the tableau is positive.|$|E

25|$|An optimal {{solution}} need not exist, for two reasons. First, if two constraints are inconsistent, then no feasible solution exists: For instance, the constraints xâ‰¥2 and xâ‰¤1 cannot be satisfied jointly; in this case, {{we say that}} the LP is infeasible. Second, when the polytope is unbounded {{in the direction of}} the gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function (where the gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function is the vector of the coefficients <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function), then no optimal value is attained.|$|E
25|$|One of Fermat's theorems {{states that}} optima of {{unconstrained}} problems are found at stationary points, {{where the first}} derivative or the gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function is zero (see first derivative test). More generally, they may be found at critical points, where the first derivative or gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function is zero or is undefined, or on the boundary of the choice set. An equation (or set of equations) stating that the first derivative(s) equal(s) zero at an interior optimum is called a 'first-order condition' or a set of first-order conditions.|$|E

25|$|For {{unconstrained}} {{problems with}} twice-differentiable functions, some critical points {{can be found}} by finding the points where the gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function is zero (that is, the stationary points).

25|$|The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes {{were also}} {{developed}} {{with a single}} objective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens of the telescope was designed with a large focal length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective focuses {{an image of a}} distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece of a much smaller focal length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather collection of light which is determined by the physical size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> lens. Thus, telescopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> divided by the focal length of the eyepiece, smaller focal-length eyepieces cause greater magnification.|$|E
