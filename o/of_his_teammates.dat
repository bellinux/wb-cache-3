The South African authorities requested that an extra Test {{be added to the}} fixture and the Australian Board of Control consented. Incensed that the players were not consulted about the change, Chappell led a group <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> in a demand for more money to play the proposed game. Eventually the match was cancelled after Chappell and his supporters refused to back down.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his {{professional}} career, Rivera learned English, beginning in 1991 with the Greensboro Hornets, when he realized none <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> spoke his native Spanish. He is now a proponent of Latino players learning English and of American press members learning Spanish, in order to bridge the cultural gap. Rivera became a naturalized citizen of the United States in October 2015, and was recognized as an Outstanding American by Choice during the ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{wrote to}} every {{club in the}} top two {{divisions}} to inform them he was available on a free transfer, and privately lamented choosing his past clubs for financial rather than footballing reasons. Over the summer he played 11 games in the North American Soccer League for the Tampa Bay Rowdies, a club that shared facilities with the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Allardyce subsequently applied in his managerial career many modern practices of American football with regards to training, player management and tactics. He found playing difficult however, due to {{the heat and the}} all-out attacking nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates,</b> which led to him being frequently exposed at the back, though he found that the club's masseurs managed to cure a long-standing hamstring scar tissue problem.|$|E
5|$|Despite Brown's intentions, Saban {{was used}} {{occasionally}} on the Browns' offense in 1946. He caught a 44-yard pass from quarterback Otto Graham in a September {{game against the}} Buffalo Bisons. He was mainly used as a linebacker, however, and had four interceptions as the Browns won the first AAFC championship. In the offseason, he worked for Browns owner Mickey McBride's Yellow Cab Company; many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> spent the offseason either at college making up for time lost to the war or taking jobs to supplement their football incomes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness. After proving that he had recovered, Gibbs was offered a short term contract at the club, which was eventually extended. Newly relegated Watford finished 13th of 24 teams in 1996–97. They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted the irony that having been released as an injury concern, he ended up playing more games the following season than any <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates.</b>|$|E

5|$|Greaves was {{struggling}} with his fitness and his motivation. He felt {{he had become a}} journeyman footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to having the most accomplished season of his collegiate career, Chappuis was a leader on campus. He {{was elected president of}} the Michigan Alpha chapter of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity whose membership included a number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> and prominent University of Michigan athletic alumni such as Tom Harmon, Bob Ufer, and Harry Kipke. Chappuis appeared {{on the cover of the}} October 28, 1947 issue of Look magazine which featured pictures of him on the football field and at the fraternity house. In the magazine, Chappuis and his future wife were also featured about the Michigan campus. He expressed an interest in first playing professional football for a few years before going into the porcelain business with his father.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 season, Parker remained—despite {{the signing}} of Miami's Jason Kapono—the {{starting}} shooting guard for the Raptors, with rookie Jamario Moon completing the wing positions. In a season that was fraught with lengthy injuries to a number <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> (such as T.J. Ford and Chris Bosh), he managed to play in all 82 regular season games and ensured that Toronto made the 2008 NBA Playoffs, albeit as the sixth seed. However, the Raptors were eliminated {{in the first round}} by the Orlando Magic in five games. Parker was later named by ESPN {{as one of the best}} Euroleague players to have graced the NBA.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool's decline {{culminated in}} relegation to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season, {{finishing}} last with 28 points to end 50 {{seasons in the}} top division. The club had conceded 97 goals and failed to record an away win in 24 consecutive matches {{over a period of}} 14 months. Liddell, like the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates,</b> struggled for form, scoring just seven goals and missing a penalty in a 1-0 loss to Cardiff that confirmed relegation. Despite the club's descent, Liddell elected to stay rather than accept a transfer elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Test of {{the series}} was a high-scoring draw, Loxton making six in his only innings. His 43 in the final Test {{of the series}} was overshadowed by centuries for three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates,</b> in an innings win that sealed the series 4–0. In the Test series as a whole, the Victorian all-rounder made 255 runs {{at an average of}} 42.50, but bowled only 34 overs in taking two wickets. He made little impact on the tour matches after the start of the Tests, passing fifty twice and taking two wickets from 13 overs in five matches. For the entire tour, Loxton totaled 809 {{first-class}} runs at 40.45 and took 12 wickets.|$|E
5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended from playing by the ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> was banned from playing. He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending {{much of the last}} 20 years of his life institutionalised there.|$|E

Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4x100-meter relay team. In what many expected would be his final race, Bolt collapsed to the track after an apparent hamstring injury. He refused to get in a wheelchair and crossed the finish line with the assistance <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the upturn in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates.</b> Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E
5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>teammates</b> (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E
