5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense.

Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service.

5|$|In {{the space}} of only a generation, public {{education}} had left behind a highly regimented and politicized system dedicated to training children in the basic skills of literacy and the special discipline required of urban citizens, and had {{replaced it with a}} largely apolitical, more highly organized and efficient structure specifically designed to teach students the many specialized skills demanded in a modern, industrial society. In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> and a broader concern for the welfare of urban youth.|$|E
5|$|Saunders {{attended}} the local mission school at Lake Condah, {{where he did}} well in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry about the bush, and encouraged them to read Shakespeare and Australian literature. After completing eight years <b>of</b> <b>schooling,</b> Saunders earned his merit certificate. His formal education thus ended, {{he went to work}} at the age of 14 as a millhand in a sawmill. Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time, but Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented. He worked and furthered his education until 1937, when he went into business with his father and brother, operating a sawmill in Portland, Victoria; the sawmill was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{physical}} isolation, the islanders maintained a lively community. A school {{had been established}} in 1723 by the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SPCK), with sixty children on its initial attendance roll. The demands of island life conflicted to some extent with those <b>of</b> <b>schooling.</b> The SPCK's inspector found only eighteen out of seventy pupils present when he visited in 1824. He found {{that many of the}} children were fully occupied helping their families in summer and only attended school in winter. Two places of worship were built within a couple of years of each other, a Baptist chapel in 1877 and a Church of Scotland church in 1878 (at a cost of £900). Although they soon became focal elements of community life, there seems to have been some bad blood between the two congregations, perhaps due to a clash between the missionary zeal of local Baptists and the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Kirk.|$|E

5|$|Frank Arthur Worsley {{was born}} on 22 February 1872 in Akaroa, New Zealand, one of three {{children}} of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana. His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from Rugby in England aboard the Cornwall to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851. The family lived in Grehan Valley, high up above Akaroa. Worsley's mother died {{while he was a}} toddler. He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at Peraki, he was homeschooled for a time. From age 10, he helped with clearing land for sheep pasture and growing cocksfoot. When Frank was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the New Zealand Shipping Company as an apprentice and at about the same time, his father moved his family, which was now just Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to Christchurch. Frank attended Fendalton School and marked his final year <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> by being made head boy.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins {{was born}} in Finley, New South Wales to Jack and Jenny Hawkins. He {{grew up in the}} New South Wales region of Finley as the middle child among three other siblings. He {{attended}} Finley High School and played for the Finley Football Club before making the move south of the border to begin boarding at Melbourne Grammar School. Hawkins' footballing ability was recognised early on when he was selected to play first XVIII football for the school whilst still in year ten, when many of his teammates were completing their final year <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> at year twelve. Hawkins kicked four goals on debut for the school and his performances up forward soon received attention from AFL recruiting teams. By the time he had reached his final school year he was rewarded with joint captaincy of the football team alongside Hawthorn draftee Xavier Ellis. He was also selected in the Associated Public Schools (APS) team to play the Associated Grammar School (AGS) selected football team in the traditional annual clash of schools, where he won best on ground honours for his performance.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{found it}} {{difficult}} to both study and play hockey, but praised the support of his classmates and the faculty in helping him earn his degree. He had to complete an extra year <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> after failing his second year, but graduated from McGill in 1916. Following an 18-goal season in 1915–16, he left Montreal to take up practice in British Columbia. Roberts continued his hockey career and joined the Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). He led the PCHA in scoring with 43 goals – in 23 games – and was named a league all-star on left wing. His medical career took him to Seattle and as a result, he joined the Seattle Metropolitans for the 1917–18 PCHA season. He retired in 1918 to focus on his medical career in the Howe Sound region of British Columbia, but was lured back to the PCHA by the Millionaires for the 1919–20 season. He scored 16 goals in 22 games for Vancouver before permanently retiring from hockey.|$|E

5|$|Schnaufer, {{at the age}} of six, went to {{the local}} Volksschule (primary school) at Calw. After {{completing}} his fourth grade, he received two years <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> at the Oberschule, also in Calw. At an early age he expressed his wish to join an organisation of military character and joined the Deutsches Jungvolk (German Youth) in 1933. After completing his sixth grade at school he took and passed the entry examination at the Backnang National Political Institutes of Education (Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt—Napola), a secondary boarding school founded under the recently established Nazi state. The goal of the Napola schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military and administrative leadership of the Third Reich. Schnaufer was considered a very good student, finishing top of his class every year. Aged seventeen he graduated with his Abitur (diploma) in November 1939 with distinction. At the Napola school he also received the Reich Youth Sports Badge, the base-certificate of the German Life Saving Association (Deutsche Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft), the bronze Hitler Youth-Performance Badge (HJ-Leistungsabzeichen), and completed his B-license to fly glider aircraft. In 1939 Schnaufer was one of two students posted to the Napola in Potsdam. The Flying Platoon (Fliegerzug) stationed in Potsdam centralised all the destined flyers from all the Napolas. Here he learned to fly glider aircraft, at first short hops on the DFS SG 38 Schulgleiter, and later on the two-seater Göppingen Gö 4 which was towed by a Klemm Kl 25. During his stay at Potsdam, the film producer Karl Ritter was making the Ufa film Cadets in Potsdam. The Napola had detached two companies to work on the film, among them Schnaufer. It remains unclear exactly what role he played in this film.|$|E

25|$|The intricacies <b>of</b> <b>schooling</b> are {{far from}} fully understood, {{especially}} the swimming and feeding energetics.
