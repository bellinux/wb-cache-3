40|$|This study {{examined}} listeners ’ detection and resolution of metrical ambiguity {{in the song}} ‘Murder by Numbers ’ by The Police {{over the course of}} five hearings. In the extended opening of the song, a syncopated pattern in the drums ostensibly projects a triple meter that clashes with a duple meter played by the instruments that en-ter later. A tapping task was used to examine changes in listeners’ perception of the ambiguous segment on multiple rehearings. All participants first heard the whole song (Trial 1). In the remain-ing four trials participants were divided into two experimental groups receiving different instructions. Participants in the natural condition continued to tap the beat they spontaneously perceived in the subsequent presentations of the 80 -second-long target seg-ment. Participants in the coherent condition were asked to find one coherent way of tapping that would fit the whole segment. The majority of listeners processed the musical signal primarily in a bottom-up fashion, interpreting the song as containing a change of meter even during the later trials. Only in a few cases did par-ticipants recognize the garden path nature of the segment and in-hibit their initial hearing, reinterpreting the meter by applying some type of top-down listening strategy. This study provides initial evidence on how interpretation of am-biguous meter changes upon rehearing. Although the findings sug-gest that the coherence (global stability) of metrical structure is not of primary importance for many average listeners, nonetheless there are trends toward greater coherence <b>over</b> <b>repeated</b> <b>listening,</b> particularly for some listeners. 1...|$|E

40|$|Use {{of songs}} {{as the vehicle}} for {{language}} teaching/learning has become common practice (Medina, 1993). Nevertheless, there are no experimental studies examining the potential learning gains from songs. The present study investigates incidental learning of three vocabulary knowledge dimensions (spoken-form recognition, form-meaning connection, and collocation recognition) through listening to two songs. The effects of <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> to a single song (1, 3, or 5 times) {{and the relationship between}} frequency of exposure to the targeted vocabulary items and learning gains were also explored. Two multiple choice tests (one for each song) that each measured the different dimensions of vocabulary knowledge were used to evaluate learning. The results indicated that (a) listening to songs contribute to vocabulary learning (b) <b>repeated</b> <b>listening</b> had a positive effect on vocabulary gains and (c) frequency of exposure positively affected learning gains. The pedagogical implications are discussed in detail...|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in 2008 in Toronto’s Phase 1 and Alex Lifeson's Lerxst Sound studios.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars stating [...] "this music sings. It's true the singing is balladic and dirgelike {{much of the}} time, but it is pastoral, too, and gentle and sweetly elegiac.

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 3½ stars stating [...] "At times, the album resembles a Glass soundtrack, but Galasso {{is not as}} {{predictable}} as Glass, freely roaming around various world cultures for inspiration, varying his bowing techniques to suit the mood... It's hard to predict how these mostly slight compositions will stand up to <b>repeated</b> <b>listening,</b> but they are beautifully recorded in the best ECM fashion".|$|R
5000|$|The series bears <b>repeated</b> <b>listening,</b> {{with many}} subtle lines, {{but at times}} {{can be a little}} {{confusing}} as it goes backwards and forwards in time, segued by records that they play on their show.

One typical line from Bain-Jones is [...] "... and i said no it won't as its water based...", before realising they are on air again.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this, Allmusic {{also made}} Kollected Works an album pick and {{published}} a review declaring {{it to be}} [...] "inventive new wave pop of the highest order" [...] and [...] "a record that combined the musical sensibilities of the Police and the lyrical concerns of Weird Al Yankovic". The reviewer applauded the album's humor and eccentricity, while contending that the tracks also have plenty of musical depth to make them hold up to <b>repeated</b> <b>listens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a {{television}} interview with BBC Breakfast, Love noted that the main themes of [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were fame and notoriety, referring to it as [...] "a really simple, sweary, fast in-your-face song" [...] about her public reputation. She described how she was inspired to write the song after <b>repeated</b> <b>listens</b> to The Rolling Stones 1968 song [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", which left her [...] "feeling quite like a rock villainess".|$|R
5000|$|... ==Reception== The Allmusic review states [...] "Everything on {{the album}} is {{visually}} evocative the way good soundtrack music should be, yet the individual cuts are tight and melodic enough to hold up to <b>repeated</b> <b>listens.</b> The end result is a soundtrack that succeeds both as a film score and a stand-alone album. This unique combination makes Bullitt {{one of the finest}} achievements in the Lalo Schifrin catalog {{and one of the best}} action film scores ever written".|$|R
5000|$|Salaam Remi {{contributes}} to the song's emotional weight with his maudlin, noir-style string samples taken from Bad Man Waltz. Epinions described the song's composition: [...] "The musical layers are deceptively intricate, with a unison string/woodwind line that continually evolves throughout the song and a very simple vocal harmony mix that moves into a call and response against Jazmine's pleas. Neither of the facets scream for attention but <b>repeated</b> <b>listens</b> bear out just how well they framed this song." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nick Kent {{wrote that}} with [...] "We'll Run Away", Wilson and Usher [...] "zeroed in" [...] {{on a certain}} type of teen angst that would culminate more fully in Wilson's [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice".

5000|$|Therefore, {{it comes}} as little {{surprise}} that his latest chart botherer - a rendition of Kish Mauve's 2009 electro-rock hit 'Come On' - {{is far more than}} a note-for-note rehash. [...] "Walk away, that's what you do," [...] he bawls innocently over bobbing synths courtesy of Richard X, before defiantly calling [...] "come on, come on" [...] to his contrary lover. In fact, even after <b>repeated</b> <b>listens,</b> Young's lounge-pop reinvention still sounds like a different number altogether.|$|R

5000|$|One {{reviewer}} stated [...] "There’s {{an overall}} mood of passiveness to Silverwater {{that stands in}} direct contrast to the more aggressive Chemist. This is The Necks at their most reflective, utilising their key tools of minimalism and repetition to create a gently trance-inducing piece of music. Though occasional bursts of intensity serve to stave off monotony, Silverwater remains a largely subdued affair. That it’s so utterly engaging, and so amenable to <b>repeat</b> <b>listens</b> is testament to the undeniable skill of the musicians involved".|$|R

25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse is a feat of {{imagination}} scarcely ever recorded. It's breathtaking. Somehow, a bold assurance of intention {{has met with}} a hunger for experimenting with sound to expand an already formidable group of songs into pure, open-minded ambiguity.

5000|$|Release Magazine {{gave the}} album a mostly {{positive}} review, stating [...] "...slightly more pop tuned, but still holds all the Camouflage trademark elements. Personal vocal performances, gloom and pop all in one. The single [...] "Motif Sky" [...] {{is one of}} the tracks that have blossomed through <b>repeated</b> <b>listening,</b> as have [...] "We Are Lovers" [...] and my current favourite [...] "Dreaming". Except for the exceptionally dreary [...] "How Do You Feel?", [...] "Relocated" [...] is a solid effort, maybe lacking somewhat in raw hit power".|$|R
500|$|Jackson G. Marx was {{similarly}} conflicted in Australian Rolling Stone, writing, [...] "They create painstaking technical 'works' of art. This {{is not necessarily}} a compliment. Sometimes it's a certified jerk-off." [...] Despite describing some songs as, [...] "tragically clever," [...] and, [...] "grooveless monstrosities," [...] he scored the album three stars from five, and wrote of the pleasure of <b>repeated</b> <b>listens.</b> [...] "'Tail', for example, is tangled and inert and teeters precariously on the brink of disappearing up its own arsehole, but a determined listener will find its hooks more infecting with each spin." ...|$|R
