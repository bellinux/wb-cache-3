5|$|Reflecting on Hoffman's work in {{the late}} 2000s, Mosher writes that the actor {{remained}} impressive, but had not delivered a testing performance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of his work in Capote. The film critic David Thomson believed that Hoffman showed indecisiveness at this time, unsure whether to play spectacular supporting roles or become a lead actor who is capable of controlling the emotional dynamic and outcome of a film.|$|E

5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of difficulty selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to triple jump and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E

5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Mexico won its {{independence}} from Spain, and San Diego {{became part of the}} Mexican territory of Alta California. In 1822, Mexico began attempting to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1833, and most of the Mission lands were sold to wealthy Californio settlers. The 432 residents of the town petitioned the governor to form a pueblo, and Juan María Osuna was elected the first alcalde ("municipal magistrate"), defeating Pío Pico in the vote. (See, List of pre-statehood mayors of San Diego.) However, San Diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents. Beyond town Mexican land grants expanded the number of California ranchos that modestly added to the local economy.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised questions about whether other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E

5|$|Plans to link it westwards to the Oakham Canal, northwards to the South Forty-Foot Drain and southwards to the River Nene in 1809 came to nothing, and {{it closed}} in 1863, {{soon after the}} arrival of the Midland Railway in the area. Although Stamford Corporation {{attempted}} to sell it after closure, its ownership was disputed, and they were unable to do so. Its course and some of its structures can still be traced in the landscape. These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford, and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash, which it crossed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Kingswood branch {{was again}} not upgraded, and still {{retained}} its 1871 track. It was abandoned {{at the end}} of 1915, and the track removed in 1920. In 1911 Brill Brick and Tile Works closed, and the siding to the brickworks was removed, {{with the exception of the}} rails <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> crossing which in 1984 were still in place, albeit tarmacked over. On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Brill became a centre for training cadets, who were housed in Wotton House and ferried in trains of five passenger coaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level,</b> the player can control several different air, {{land and water}} vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo N-1 Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air, land or watercraft specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} H. S. Offler in 1951 {{felt that}} the Libellus was not a contemporary account of the trial, and instead dated from {{the second quarter of}} the 12th century and was produced at Durham. More recent scholars, including W. M. Aird, Frank Barlow, and Emma Mason have concluded that the work is indeed a contemporary record of the trial. Barlow bases his belief in the authenticity <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of detail {{and the fact that the}} account lacks all knowledge of events outside the court, and explains that Offler's concerns can be explained by the late date for all the manuscripts, which allowed scribal errors to creep in.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} of discovery depend very much <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of aggressiveness of the civilization interacting with humanity, its ethics, {{and how much}} human and extraterrestrial biologies have in common.

The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern {{the magnitude of the}} long-term {{implications of}} contact. In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer wall}} was 2m thick at its base, and {{featured}} arched chambers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the peribolos, crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching {{a height of}} 8.5–9m. Access {{to the outer wall}} from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner wall's towers. The outer wall likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78m, with an average distance of 50–66m. Only 62 of the outer wall's towers survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14m tall and 4m wide. They featured a room with windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of the peribolos, crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. The outer wall was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the outer wall.|$|E
