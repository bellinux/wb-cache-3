500|$|Lavigne and Sum 41 lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley {{began dating}} when Lavigne was 19 years old, after being friends {{since she was}} 17. In June 2005, Whibley {{proposed}} to her. The couple married on 15 July 2006 in Montecito, California. On 9 October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, [...] "I am grateful for our time together, and I am grateful and blessed for <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> friendship." [...] The divorce was finalized on 16 November 2010.|$|E
2500|$|... "It's a {{temporary}} measure {{to take care}} of the welfare of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> workers," [...] WHO spokesperson Christy Feig announced. He did not specify how long the closure would last, but said they would return after an assessment of the situation by the WHO. The medical worker, one of the first WHO staff infected by the Ebola Virus, was treated at a hospital in Kenema and then evacuated to Germany. By 4 October 2014, it was announced he has recovered and left Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Mao Zedong also once {{mentioned}} Xiang Yu, [...] "We {{should use}} <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> strength {{to defeat the}} enemy, instead of thinking about achieving fame like the Conqueror." [...] In 1964, Mao also pointed out three reasons for Xiang Yu's downfall: not following Fan Zeng's advice to kill Liu Bang at the Feast at Hong Gate and letting Liu leave; adhering firmly {{to the terms of}} the peace treaty (without considering that Liu Bang might betray his trust); building his capital at Pengcheng (彭城; present-day Xuzhou, Jiangsu).|$|E
50|$|The {{place has}} been {{mentioned}} around 450 as an Frankish settlement. Until {{the end of the}} 18th century, the community Eisenbach, consisting of the three districts Untereisenbach, Obereisenbach and Übereisenbach, belonged to Luxembourg. As a result of the Congress of Vienna, Übereisenbach became part of Prussia, where Untereisenbach and Obereisenbach at the opposite shore of the <b>Our</b> <b>remained</b> Luxembourgish.|$|R

60|$|<b>Our</b> party <b>remained</b> {{two days}} more in Glasgow, and visited {{quite a number}} of objects of {{interest}} and curiosity in and around the city.|$|R
60|$|Madame Fontaine {{was looking}} out of the window. It was {{impossible}} for us to discover whether she approved of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> in the room or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "And if {{they come}} to search for us, {{there is no more}} {{assurance}} of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> hidden with this Tory in the loft, than if he remained here in the room." ...|$|E
60|$|After the {{foregoing}} exposition of principles, <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> space may best be {{occupied by a}} few of the chief maxims and rules deducible from them; and with a view to brevity we will put these in a hortatory form.|$|E
50|$|In <b>our</b> {{heart will}} <b>remain</b> forever.|$|R
60|$|For {{two weeks}} <b>our</b> party <b>remained</b> in New York, living {{at one of}} the best hotels, but {{spending}} nearly all their time in shops and streets.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where we are huddled none can trace, [...] And if <b>our</b> names <b>remain,</b> They pave some path or p-ing place [...] Where we {{have never}} lain! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{asked us}} very angrily {{what we wanted}} there, and seemed {{particularly}} annoyed at seeing Jean Marie. However, on my repeated assurances that we only came {{to see what was}} going on, he at last consented to <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> to see the dance; only cautioning us that we must keep perfect silence, and that a word, much more a laugh, would entail most serious consequences.|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{the last}} year's snow," [...] {{answered}} the maiden; [...] "east, north, south, and west--some to France, some to Flanders, some, I fear, {{into the world}} and its pleasures. We have got permission to remain, or rather <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> has been connived at, for my aunt has great relations among the Kerrs, and they have threatened a death-feud if any one touches us; and bow and spear are the best warrant in these times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is all done," [...] {{he said to}} his friends. [...] "Now we {{will get}} rid of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> stores which the men brought up yesterday. I propose that instead of selling them we divide them into three and send them down to the three cavalry messes. I am sorry we have not a few bottles of spirits left, but the tea, and chocolate, and sugar, and so on, will be very welcome to them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go, then, noble Cedric," [...] said Athelstane, [...] "neglect {{not this}} opportunity. Your {{presence}} without may encourage friends to <b>our</b> rescue--your <b>remaining</b> here would ruin us all." ...|$|R
40|$|Webber et al. take a {{critical}} {{view of our}} findings that niche expansions are rare in plant invaders, arguing mainly {{that we did not}} include nonanalog climates in our analyses. Yet, their concerns include misunderstandings and go beyond the scope of our study, which was purposely restricted to analog climates. We further explain why <b>our</b> results <b>remain</b> robust to other factors of niche dynamics in the native range. We conclude that the implications of <b>our</b> findings <b>remain</b> valid for projections of niche models in analog climates and that projections in nonanalog climates should be undertaken with care...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there's a {{funny thing}} about that bill," [...] replied Jenny. [...] "In winter it turns almost black. Most of us wear a {{different}} colored suit in winter, but <b>our</b> bills <b>remain</b> the same." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{brilliant}} suggestion was, {{needless to}} say, received with acclamation; and I instantly {{set to work}} to buy suitable canoes from the surrounding natives. I succeeded after a delay of three days in obtaining two large ones, each hollowed out of a single log of some light wood, and capable of holding six people and baggage. For these two canoes {{we had to pay}} nearly all <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> cloth, and also many other articles.|$|E
60|$|The {{end of it}} {{was that}} for a knife and a few nails Kari {{purchased}} the largest balsa that these people had, provisioning it with as much dried fish, corn and water in earthenware jars as it would carry together with ourselves, and such of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> goods as we wished to take with us. Then we announced that I, the god who had come out of the sea, desired to return into the sea with himself, my servant.|$|E
6000|$|After this {{everything}} went right. I sent {{some of the}} men back in the charge of Stephen for <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> effects, which they brought safely aboard, and in the evening we sailed. Our voyage up to Kilwa was beautiful, a gentle breeze driving us forward over a sea so calm that not even Hans, who I think {{was one of the worst}} sailors in the world, or the Zulu hunters were really sick, though as Sammy put it, they [...] "declined their food." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said: [...] "Our {{position}} is that sanctions will remain unchanged. Irrespective {{of the results of}} elections in any country, including in one as important as the United States of America, <b>our</b> assumptions <b>remain</b> unchanged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is, mamma; else we shouldn't be here now. What I mean is this,--let us take some {{necessary}} first step at once. It {{is clear that}} my uncle thinks that <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> here should give him some right over us. I do not {{say that he is}} wrong to think so. Perhaps it is natural. Perhaps, in accepting his kindness, we ought to submit ourselves to him. If that be so, it is a conclusive reason for our going." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was no blaming. He {{only said}} that it was very sad for him that, in his old age, he should be left alone. This was before there was any talk about <b>our</b> <b>remaining.</b> Indeed he seemed {{determined}} not to ask that again as a favour. I could see that in his eye, and I understood it from his tone. He went on to speak of you and Bell, saying how well he loved you both; but that, unfortunately, his hopes regarding you had not been fulfilled." ...|$|E
60|$|I did get {{a little}} sleep that night, with one eye open, but before dawn I was up again seeing to the feeding of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> horse with some mealies that we carried, and other matters. The oxen we had been obliged to unyoke that they might fill {{themselves}} with grass and water, since otherwise I feared that we should never get them on to their feet again. As it was, the poor brutes were so tired {{that some of them}} could scarcely eat, and all lay down at the first opportunity.|$|E
30|$|Hence, we {{ask that}} <b>our</b> {{contributors}} <b>remain</b> {{committed to the}} TEAM approach: Theory advancement, Empirical advancement, Applied advancement, Methodological advancements.

60|$|I {{would also}} {{recommend}} liberal measures {{for the purpose}} of supporting the American lines of steamers now plying between San Francisco and Japan and China, and the Australian line--almost <b>our</b> only <b>remaining</b> lines of ocean steamers--and of increasing their services.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would say so," [...] rejoined the doctor. [...] "Thank you. Then {{it seems to me}} that the right course will be to write to Mrs. Evelyn, inclosing a note to Dr. Lucas-—who it seems is Mrs. Brownlow's chief reliance—-asking him to find someone to send out. She, can send it on to him if she disapproves of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> {{together}} longer than is absolutely necessary, or if Leukerbad disagrees with you. Meantime, I'll go and see whether Reeves has found any men to carry the poor boys." ...|$|E
6000|$|And there {{indeed it}} was!--a human figure, dimly {{discernible}} in the gloom--a figure that wavered {{from side to}} side as if about to fall, clutching at the wine-casks for support, had stepped unsteadily forward and for one moment stood revealed in the light of <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> candles; then it surged heavily and fell prone upon the earth. In that moment we had all recognized the figure, the face and bearing of our father--dead these ten months and buried by our own hands!--our father indubitably risen and ghastly drunk! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} one thing {{necessary}} before you start. I must see you. There is no reason on earth for <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> here, except that mamma has not made up her mind. If she will consent to go back before you start, it will be best so. Otherwise, you must take the trouble to come here,--where, I am afraid, you will not be received as a welcome guest. I have told mamma that if I cannot see you here {{in a manner that is}} becoming, I shall go out and meet you in the streets, in a manner that is unbecoming.|$|E

60|$|But in {{the midst}} of the {{effective}} though silent transformation the camp of <b>our</b> explorers <b>remained</b> unchanged; and the dying embers of the slowly sinking fire continued to cast their dull red glow on the recumbent forms which were thoroughly protected by the spreading fir-tree.|$|R
30|$|Though our {{everyday}} environment has been dramatically and rapidly changed by industry and technology.
