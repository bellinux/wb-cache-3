[...] Despite an outward appearance of confidence and popularity with his troops, the [...] "genial six-footer with a face some people described as 'coarse'", privately often exhibited a lack <b>of</b> <b>self-confidence,</b> and in later campaigns became somewhat dependent on his older brother Richard (the admiral in the Royal Navy, also on station in the Colonies) for advice and approval.|$|E
500|$|... "Red Carpet" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Japanese singer Namie Amuro. It was released on December 2, 2015 via Avex Trax and her label Dimension Point as the singer's third consecutive non-album single, being supported by B-side track [...] "Black Make-Up". [...] "Red Carpet" [...] was distributed in two physical formats—a standard CD, and a CD and DVD bundle—and was made available for digital consumption. The recording was written and composed by Matthew Tishler, Paula Winger, Stephanie Lewis and Tiger, whilst production was handled by Tishler. Musically, the track is an upbeat neo soul ballad with elements of contemporary R, and features guitars, synthesizers, keyboards and drums as instrumentation. Lyrically, the songwriting focuses on themes <b>of</b> <b>self-confidence,</b> empowerment and narcissism, and uses the title {{as a metaphor for}} life experiences.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Red Carpet" [...] was {{described}} by Japanese journalist Kanako Hayakawa as a neo soul tune with elements of contemporary R. Similarly, CD Journal noted elements of neo soul and described its instrumentation as consisting of guitars, pianos and drums.

An editor of Billboard Japan noted musical similarities to Amuro's previous singles [...] "Baby Don't Cry" [...] (2007) and [...] "Love Story" [...] (2011), and labelled the sound as an [...] "upbeat neo soul tune". [...] "Black Make-Up" [...] was noted by critics as a [...] "danceable" [...] track that incorporates dance-pop and R elements.

500|$|At {{the head}} of a strong cavalry force—the numbers {{reported}} in the sources vary from a 3,000 to as many as 30,000—Sayf al-Dawla invaded Byzantine territory, and advanced unopposed as far as the fortress of Charsianon, capital of the theme of the same name. There he and his army sacked the fortress and massacred the garrison; they pillaged and torched the surrounding region and its settlements and took many prisoners. Towards the end of autumn, Sayf al-Dawla finally began the journey home, taking his booty and prisoners. The contemporary Byzantine historian Leo the Deacon gives a vivid portrait of the Hamdanid prince, who, elated at the success of his raid and full <b>of</b> <b>self-confidence,</b> sped back and forth alongside his troops on his horse, a mare [...] "of extraordinary size and speed", throwing his spear in the air and catching it again with remarkable dexterity.|$|E

The lyrical content present on the song was {{compared}} to her compositions during her previous albums, Like a Prayer (1989) and Ray of Light (1998), especially [...] "Drowned World/Substitute for Love" [...] from the latter. The song received positive reviews from most music critics, who commended her raw vocals, the revelatory lyrics that matched with the album's thematic and noted it for being a highlight on the record. It charted in some European territories, peaking inside the top-twenty in Hungary and the top-forty in Spain and Sweden. Madonna performed the track in an acoustic version on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where the performance received acclaim from critics, who noted an improvement on her vocals.|$|E

Hinata was then disowned by Hiashi and placed in the care of Kurenai Yuhi. Under Kurenai's guidance, Hinata began training to become strong in both skill and will in order to prove her worth to her father. Hinata's growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto, as she is inspired by his enthusiasm and his unyielding determination to never give up. As the series progresses, Hinata's admiration towards Naruto eventually grows into love. During Part II, Hinata confesses her feelings to Naruto while protecting him from Pain and later assists him during the Allied Ninjas' battle with the Ten-Tails. Following the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War, and the events of [...] where she carries out the will of her ancestor Hamura Ōtsutsuki by helping Naruto stop Toneri, Hinata marries Naruto and they have two children by the series epilogue.
