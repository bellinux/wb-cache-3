25|$|Pacheco {{repeatedly}} {{went into}} the lab at night to take photographs and to escort scientists, including veterinarians and a primatologist, through it to secure their testimony. Newkirk lay crouched {{on the back seat}} of a car outside, hidden under a large cardboard box with holes for her eyes, using a walkie-talkie from a toy store to alert Pacheco if anyone else entered the building. The monkeys' living conditions documented by Pacheco were graphically disturbing. Having collected the evidence, Newkirk and Pacheco alerted the police, who raided the lab, removed the monkeys, and charged Taub with 113 counts of cruelty to animals and six counts of failing to provide adequate veterinary care. Taub maintained that he had been set up by Newkirk and Pacheco while he was <b>on</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>and</b> that several of the photographs had been staged. The judge found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care and fined him $3,000. A later jury trial saw five of these counts dismissed, and the sixth was overturned on appeal because of a technicality. The National Institutes of Health, which had funded Taub's research, was among the scientists and other professionals who criticized the conditions in which Taub had kept the monkeys, though the NIH later reversed its decision when the charges against Taub were overturned.|$|E

500|$|Lane {{was born}} near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on July 15, 1864, {{the first of}} four {{children}} of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns. [...] Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown; when his voice began to fail, he became a dentist. The elder Lane, disliking the island colony's cold climate, moved with his family to Napa, California in 1871, and to Oakland in 1876, where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School. [...] Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the Oakland Times, then worked as a reporter, and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party. From 1884 to 1886, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, though he did not graduate. [...] Lane later wrote, [...] "I put myself through college by working <b>on</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>and</b> after hours, and I am very glad I did it."

500|$|Specific action cues {{were scored}} {{on the piano}} down to each second of film. Noting how the film was set in the Caribbean and had a different, slower pace than Speed, Mancina gave the score a [...] "Jamaican/Latin feel" [...] by {{incorporating}} reggae music between action sequences. The reggae music was written to give the feel of being <b>on</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>and</b> serve as a love theme for the characters. Some themes from Speed {{were included in the}} score between sections of the newly written material. He wrote new themes for Annie and Alex because he felt the original themes written for Reeves' character would not work well with Patric. After viewing the scene where Geiger attaches leeches to his body to cleanse his blood, Mancina felt the scene was [...] "so gross" [...] that he wrote a [...] "slimy theme" [...] for the character, which is distinctively {{different from the rest of}} the music. He mixed the score at the same time the film was being edited, which meant the music had to be constantly re-edited into the film. During the scoring of Speed2, Mancina said in an interview that keeping up with the editing of the film was the [...] "hardest thing [...] ever done".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was <b>on</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>and</b> her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club. The TV spec script for The X-Files [...] however, was actually written in 1994.|$|E
500|$|After {{working with}} the cover for the album, {{provisionally}} titled Runaway Train, Levy went <b>on</b> <b>vacation</b> <b>and</b> travelled with Pearl Jam on their 2008 tour. After a concert in Washington D.C., Levy {{came up with the}} idea [...] "to do it all graphic black on black" [...] and sketched what would become the yellow artwork. The record company liked it and requested he do two more in the same style, which became the red and white versions. During the promotional photography sessions, Levy made the deluxe edition art. The tracks on the album did not have much influence on the artwork as Levy had heard [...] "maybe 5 songs at that point", but he found it curious that his artwork fit the title track [...] "Black Ice", which was not among the tracks he had heard. Levy said that since the album had many similarities with Back in Black – [...] "Black" [...] in the title, dark covers, and AC/DC resurfacing with a sound based on the band's early work – the art was [...] "like a time travel, which is why there are so many psychedelic drawings". The artwork's resemblance to a train, echoing lead single [...] "Rock N' Roll Train", was a coincidence, given Levy [...] "never thought of it that way". Atop the image there is a cog with an image of Angus with his fist in the air resembling the statue on Stiff Upper Lip, because Levy [...] "just thought it was great as a continuing icon." [...] The photographs for the booklet and promotional photography were taken by music photographer Guido Karp, in August 2008 in London.|$|E
