In this study, camelina <b>oil-cakes</b> were fed to fattening pigs for 33 days {{and its effect on}} performance, plasma biochemical analytes, pro-/anti-inflammatory mediators and antioxidant detoxifying defence in spleen was investigated in comparison with sunflower meal. 24 crossbred TOPIG pigs were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two experimental dietary treatments containing either 12 % sunflower meal (treatment 1 -T 1), or 12. 0 % camelina <b>oil-cakes,</b> rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids v- 3 (v- 3 PUFA) (treatment 2 -T 2). The results showed no effect of T 2 diet (camelina cakes) on feed intake, average weight gain or feed efficiency. Consumption of camelina diet resulted in a significant decrease in plasma glucose concentration (18. 47 %) with a trend towards also a decrease of plasma cholesterol. In spleen, T 2 diet modulated cellular immune response by decreasing the protein and gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers, interleukin 1 -beta (IL- 1 b), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and interleukin (IL- 8) and cyclooxigenase 2 (COX- 2) in comparison with T 1 diet.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to study the {{input-output}} relationships and economics of pangas monoculture and carp-pangas polyculture in Bangladesh. By analyzing the data collected from 50 pangas farms and 55 carp-pangas farms, the study has investigated the production systems of two technologies and the effects of fingerling stocking and applications of feed and fertilizer on fisheries income. The data were collected from the fishermen of Trishal and Bhaluka of Mymensingh district, and Kahaloo and Adamdighee of Bogra district during 2001 - 02. For pangas monoculture, the stocking density was 31, 561 per ha while it was 55, 017 per ha in carp-pangas polyculture. Most of the farmers used urea, TSP and lime before stocking. Rice and wheat bran happened to be the most common feed ingredients for both types of culture in general. Other important ingredients used were mustard <b>oil-cakes,</b> rice polish, wheat flour, fish meal, bone meal, soybean meal and poultry litter. In terms of quantities, rice bran and wheat bran dominated the farmers list. Rice and wheat bran together constituted about 60 % of all studied feeds. Feed cost constituted 59. 13 % of total costs for pangas monoculture and 67. 44 % for carp-pangas polyculture. Per ha productions of pangas and carp-pangas in a single culture cycle were 15, 508 kg and 19, 745 kg, respectively. Per ha gross profits were estimated to be Tk 310, 311 and Tk 464, 418 for pangas monoculture and carp-pangas polyculture, respectively. Net profit appeared to be Tk 264, 216 per ha for pangas monoculture and Tk 416, 509 per ha for carp-pangas polyculture. The BCRs calculated were 1. 46 and 1. 68 for monoculture and polyculture, respectively. The break-even costs per kg of fish were estimated at Tk 36. 93 for pangas and Tk 30. 93 for mixed species which was much lower than the prices the producers received. Break-even productions were estimated at 10, 702 kg per ha for pangas monoculture and 11, 784 kg per ha for carp-pangas polyculture. Fingerling and feed cost, and pond size significantly explained the variation of income from pangas monoculture. These factors have significantly influenced the income from the crop.

60|$|Suppose that a {{commodity}} {{is capable of}} being made by two different processes—as a manufactured commodity may be produced either by hand or by steam-power—sugar may be made either from the sugar-cane or from beet-root, cattle fattened either on hay and green crops or on <b>oil-cake</b> and the refuse of breweries. It is {{the interest of the}} community that, of the two methods, producers should adopt that which produces the best article at the lowest price. This being also the interest of the producers, unless protected against competition, and shielded from the penalties of indolence, the process most advantageous to the community is that which, if not interfered with by Government, they ultimately find it to their advantage to adopt. Suppose, however, that a tax is laid on one of the processes, and no tax at all, or one of smaller amount, on the other. If the taxed process is the one which the producers would not have adopted, the measure is simply nugatory. But if the tax falls, as it is of course intended to do, upon the one which they would have adopted, it creates an artificial motive for preferring the untaxed process, though the inferior of the two. If, therefore, it has any effect at all, it causes the commodity to be produced of worse quality, or at a greater expense of labor; it causes so much of the labor of the community to be wasted, and the capital employed in supporting and remunerating that labor to be expended as uselessly as if it were spent in hiring men to dig holes and fill them up again. This waste of labor and capital constitutes an addition to the cost of production of the commodity, which raises its value and price in a corresponding ratio, and thus the owners of the capital are indemnified. The loss falls on the consumers; though the capital of the country is also eventually diminished, by the diminution of their means of saving, and, in some degree, of their inducements to save.|$|E

40|$|The date-palm {{fruit is}} also known as heavenly fruit because of its mention in {{religious}} scriptures. It contains rich carbohydrate vitamins Band D potassium, calcium, iron and other tonic ingredients. Its exact native place is unknown but date-palm probably originated somewhere in the north America and perhaps also in south west Asia (Muhammed and Mal 2005). Pakistan is ranked among the 5 th leading producers of dates after Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iran. The date-palm trees are infested by number of pathogens including nematodes which eventually reduce its yield. During the study period from July 2001 to June 2005 a total of six nematode species namely Helicotylenchus indicus Sher, 1963; H. multicinctus (Co bb, 1893), Sher, 1961; Tylenchorhynchus brassicae Siddiqi, 1961; Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White, 1919), Chitwood, 1949; Pratylenchus thomei Sher & Allen, 1953 and P. penetrans (Cobb, 1917), Filipjev & Schuumaus Stekhoven, 1941 were recorded from Lasbela district, Balochistan, Pakistan. The similarity between localities based on the qualitative (presence/absence) nematode data was calculated on the basis of Jaccard's coefficient of similarity and has been studied in detail. Group structure inherent in the data sets relevant to Lasbela district localities were exposed using average linkage clustering strategy. Poultry manure was evaluated for its nematicidal potential in a date-palm field at two dosages (300 and 600 kg/ha), while Carbofuran was used for the purpose of comparison. It was observed that Carbofuran and poultry manure at 600 kg/ha effectively controlled the populations of Meloidogyne incognita, Helicotylenchus indicus and Tylenchorhynchus brassicae over the controls. The practical implications of organic amendments in the management of nematode populations are discussed. When different nematode management materials such as neem <b>oil-cake,</b> castor <b>oil-cake</b> and mustard <b>oil-cake</b> were applied in an experiment at Fatoo farm, Lasbela district, it was found that nematode populations declined significantly as a result of <b>oil-cake,</b> treatments compared to controls. In general, mustard <b>oil-cake</b> was the most effective in controlling nematode populations. In the second experiment conducted at Awaran Chowk region, Lasbela district castor and mustard oil-cakes were used to control nematodes. Carbofuran was used for comparison purpose. Of the two amendments, mustard <b>oil-cake</b> was more effective in the control of Helicotylenchus multicinctus at 3, 6 and 12 months and castor oil at 3 and 12 months and mustard <b>oil-cake</b> at 6 months reduced the Pratylenchus penetrans populations. However, the yield remained uninfluenced by the treatments. The effect of single and repeated applications of organic amendments including castor, mustard and neem-oil-cakes and poultry manure on the stylet bearing nematode populations associated with the rhizosphere of date-palm was examined. Carbofuran was used for the purpose of comparison. Meloidogyne incognita population was more effectively controlled by the multiple dosage of the organic amendments but the populations of Helicotylenchus multicinctus and Pratylenchus thomei did not respond to the mode of application. In general, M. javanica and H. multicinctus populations were best controlled by poultry manure when given as single or repeated dosage. On the other hand, P. thomei population was most effectively managed by neem cake among the organic amendments. Single dosages of organic amendments did not alter the yield of date but repeated dosages of poultry manure gave increased yield over the control. Besides, histological studies were conducted on roots infected with Pratylenchus penetrans. Roots lesions showed puncture of epidermal cells, disarrangement of cortical cells with large empty, abnormal cavities, thin cell walls that were wavy and collapsing as the supporting material was destroyed by nematode infection. Histological changes in the young date-palm roots infected with the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, collected from Balochistan during August 2002, revealed that the nematode larvae penetrated the roots of date-palm by puncturing action of stylet and finally migrated into the cortex and endodermis layers where the cells were damaged. Hypertrophy, resulting in the formation of giant cells in the cortical and stellar regions of the roots, was recorded. Presence of gelatinous egg masses, hyperplasia of cells, with cells having relatively thick walls and shrunken basophilic cytoplasm were found in the infected roots.

Among the tested components, B. thuringiensis applied alone or mixed with oxamyl gave the highest percentage of increase in plant growth parameters i. e., plant fresh weight and shoot dry weight with values of 105. 9 and 85. 8 % and 127. 8 and 107. 5 %, respectively, as well as the lowest percent reduction of nematode developmental criteria. Moreover, in concomitant application of horse manure plus oxamyl appeared to be the best treatment in suppressing nematode development and improving plant growth parameters, followed by sesame <b>oil-cake</b> plus oxamyl, then sesame <b>oil-cake</b> and horse manure alone. Meanwhile, length of shoot and number of leaves were positively affected by the tested materials either when applied singly or integrated with oxamyl as compared to nematode alone.

Introduction: Never {{before in the}} history of our country has either the demand for pork been so great or were there so many hogs raised as at the present time. Corn is and always will be " King of the feed yard: Swine cannot subsist upon dry fodder as do the ruminants, and as corn is the most abundant and convenient grain to feed, it has, in the past, been almost the only grain fed to hogs. With the advance of Agricultural Science, the study of feeds for live stock has radically changed the feeding methods in the great stock producing regions. The necessity of foods richer in protein than corn, to form with corn a balanced ration, has increased the demand for the various mill by-products beyond the supply. Not only is the balanced ration more economical but more healthful. In the past each great corn year has been followed by wide spread ravages of hog cholera. The losses of a single season amounting to millions of dollars and for several seasons paralyzing swine raising in the affected regions. It was a noticable fact that a hog fed on mill-feeds or that had free access to abundant alfalfa or clover pasture, not only fed better but was more resistant to disease than the exclusively corn-fed hog. Though clover and alfalfa is the cheapest of feeds in their season, some other protein feed must be provided for the winter months. Shorts, bran and ground linseed <b>oil-cake</b> have been used with corn extensively and profitably to produce a better balance ration. However, the increasing demand for these feeds has raised their price almost beyond the feeders reach...|$|E
40|$|Development and {{introduction}} of new types of bakery products with increased nutritional value {{is one of the}} basic and urgent problems in the bakery industry. The solution of it is the use of whole grains, as well as secondary products of their processing. The use of by-products of wheat germ (oil, oilcake, oilcake flour), which are rich in proteins and enhances the nutritional value of products {{is considered to be a}} promising area in the bakery industry. At the same time the program objectives products, developed in the framework of the "Strategy of development of the food processing industry of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2020 "products, are expanding the production of cereal-based foods, and involving of secondary resources in the economy. These technologies are re-source efficient. They allow efficient use of by-products raw materials of the milling industry. The process for the preparation of grain bread on the basis of a thick sourdough from bioactivated wheat grain is known. However, despite all the advantages of grain breads with high amounts of dietary fiber, minerals and vitamins, they exhibit low levels of protein and lysine deficiency. At present larger preference is given to the raw materials of natural origin (millet, buckwheat and oatmeal flours, fruit puree, whole grains, oil, flour and wheat germ flakes, and etc.) for foods enrichment in modern food science. Products of processing of wheat germ: oil, flakes, oilcake and <b>oil-cake</b> flour are widely used in bakery technology. To improve the nutritional value flour from wheat germ oilcake was used in the work. In the course of the research its positive effect on the quality of semi-finished and finished products was found. They differed from the control sample in a high content of antioxidants and better digestibility of proteins bread crumb...|$|E

Because as in Chapter II, the factors affecting the development of Mixed Husbandry is examined England as a whole, Chapter III aims to point out its characteristics at the stage of individual farm management. Chapter IV supplements this study, for one of the characteristics of the agriculture under the Period of High Farming is more uses of purchased fertilizer than previous periods, and so in this case, it is very important what more uses of purchased fertilizer effect on the system of English farming. Though author feels sorry not to sum shortly those contents here, he remarks some points to be cleared through this study. Author places Norfolk Husbandry as Early Priod of the Development of Mixed Husbandry for the reason why Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period is one of having certain peculiarity and regional limitation, and then, the factors that it extends to the whole of England and realizes higher productivity under the Period of High Farming is (i) in arable enterprise, the development of drill husbandry, more fertilization (by means of more dung and purchased fertilizer), and the evolution of land improvements (by pipe-draining and the mixing the soil), (ii) in livestock enterprise, the introduction of livestocks of superior breed as Shorthorn and Southdown and so on, and the improvement and development of the feeding methods of livestock (the evolution of stall-feeding, more uses of turnip, grasses and purchased feed such as <b>oil-cake</b> and linseed-cake, the establishment of the machines and implements of cooking those feed, and the erection of liquid manure tank), (iii) the rese of prices of corn and livestock, and the degelopment of means of communication which aspire those technical progress. Accordingly, under the presence of above mentioned economic and technical factors under the Period of High Farming, the extended reproduction function that contains 2 ̆ 2 introduction of turnip and clover→increase of livestock productivity→increase of dung→increase of arable productivity 2 ̆ 2 which is generally pointed as a characteristics attended to Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period, is more completely, more extensively realized. 前稿においてはイギリス農業全体として混合農業の展開条件を考察したのであるが,本章では個別経営の段階における混合農業の経営・技術的特性を検討する. 個別経営事例の検討によって,その特性がより明確に浮きでると考えるからである. このばあい,Caird (1852) の 2 ̆ 2 English Agriculture in 1850 - 512 ̆ 2 を主要資料とする. Cairdの同書は農業革命期の大農業学者Youngと同様な方法(調査旅行) で収集した資料に基づいており, 2 ̆ 2 Youngによる描写に対する,われわれに残されたもっとも興味ある素材を提供する 2 ̆ 2 ものである(Wilson, 1862,p. 75). Caird(1852) は 2 ̆ 2 English Agriculture 2 ̆ 2 のなかで農業者といっしょに歩いたり,地主ないし彼の代理人といっしょに視察したりして数多くの優良農業経営(good farming) を詳細に観察しているので,本章では,これらの事例のうちから, 1895 年の農業統計で採用された地域区分(詳しくは前稿(II) の第 3 表を参照のこと) に基づきながら各地域から 1 事例ずつ,計 4 事例を選び,それらの経営自体を検討する. 第 1 図はCairdが調査旅行を行った州や道順,および本章で検討する農場が位置する場所を示したものである...|$|E
40|$|These {{cereal and}} <b>oil-cake</b> silos {{are made up}} of 10 {{exterior}} cylindrical cells, with an inner diameter of 6 m and a height of 31. 88 m. The cells are joined together by means of walls whereby four additional octagonal cells are created. Out of these, three are subdivided into four cells and the fourth forms the central silo. Below this unit there is a corridor for the emptying of the silos. &# 13; The work has been carried out with a travelling form with the following characteristics: mixed with regard to shape and materials; stiff, since the top platforms are connected; and it has a constant cross-section as the dimensions of the silos remain the same throughout the whole height. The form was lifted by means of elevation devices, controlled by a centralized hydraulic mechanism. &# 13; In view of the characteristics of the travelling form, the concrete used ¡n the work had to fulfill several very special conditions, notably different from these applying to the concrete that is normally used for fixed forms. For this reason, it was submitted to a great number of studies and tests until the requirements had been met. &# 13; The construction was finished in record time: in the first place, because a detailed programme had been worked out in advance, consisting of a diagram of bars and preference network and secondly, because continuous concreting was applied with day and night shifts, whebery the foreseen {{two and a half months}} for finishing the silos were reduced to 12 days. Estos silos, destinados a almacenamiento de cereales y borujo, están formados por 10 celdas exteriores cilíndricas, de 6 m de diámetro interior y 31, 88 m de altura, que se unen entre sí por medio de muros, dando lugar a cuatro celdas adicionales de forma octogonal. De éstas, tres están subdivididas en cuatro interceldas, quedando la cuarta como silo central. Debajo del conjunto se ha dispuesto una galería para el vaciado de los silos. &# 13; La obra se ha realizado con un encofrado deslizante que reúne las siguientes características: es mixto, en cuanto a la forma y materiales; rígido, por el enlace de las plataformas superiores de trabajo; y de sección constante, por mantener los silos las mismas dimensiones en toda su altura. La maniobra de ascenso del encofrado se conseguía mediante dispositivos de elevación accionados por mando hidráulico centralizado. &# 13; Dadas las particularidades del encofrado deslizante, el hormigón utilizado en la obra debía reunir una serie de condiciones especiales, sensiblemente distintas a las del hormigón que normalmente se emplea con encofrados fijos, por lo que fue objeto de numerosos estudios y ensayos hasta conseguir su perfecta adecuación. &# 13; La construcción se llevó a cabo en un tiempo récord: en primer lugar, por la confección previa de un detallado programa que consiste en un gráfico de barras y una red de precedencias; y, en segundo lugar, por la implantación de un hormigonado continuo, con tumos de día y de noche, con lo que se consiguió disminuir en doce días los dos meses y medio previstos para la terminación...|$|E
