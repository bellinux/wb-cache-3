2500|$|A {{country is}} {{regarded}} as polio free or non-endemic if no cases have been detected for a year. However, {{it is still possible}} polio circulates under these circumstances, as was the case for Nigeria, where a particular strain of virus resurfaced after 5 years in 2016. This can be due to limited surveillance and under-vaccinated populations. Moreover, for the currently circulating virus WPV1, only 1 in 200 infection cases exhibit symptoms of polio paralyses in non-vaccinated children, and possibly even fewer in vaccinated children. Therefore, even a single case is considered an epidemic. According to modeling, it can take 4 to 6 months of no reported cases to achieve only a 50% chance of eradication, and 1 to 2 years for e.g. 95% chance. [...] For a polio virus to be certified as eradicated world-wide, at least three years of good surveillance without cases needs to be achieved, though this period may need to be longer for a strain like WPV3, where a lower proportion of those infected demonstrate symptoms. [...] Wild poliovirus type 2 was certified eradicated in 2015, the last case having been detected in 1999. [...] Wild poliovirus type 3 has not been detected since 2012, but its eradication has yet to be certified, and the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication in 2017 recommended not certifying its eradication independent of that of WPV1, and hence of wild poliovirus as a whole. [...] This recommendation would mean that PV3 will not be removed from the bivalent oral vaccine, as was considered necessary with PV2 due to its high risk of giving rise to cVDPV strains, but rather <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> for PV3 will continue until total eradication of polio allows all <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> to cease.|$|E

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of TB is most complicated. The routine diagnosis for TB patient is sputum culture based. But culture need 6-8week with 10-20% false positive results. A rapid serological test for diagnosis, follow-up of disease activity, {{and response to}} therapy {{would be useful to}} clinicians. The purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (Mantoux test) is an important tool for {{diagnosis of}} latent TB infection and disease in the developed world, but it has low predictive value in bacille Calmette-Gue´rin (BCG)-vaccinated individuals, as well as in individuals living in areas where TB is endemic. The low predictive value is a result of cross-reactivity with BCG and atypical mycobacteria, as well as falsenegative reactions in malnourished children. BCG has been used as an antigen in EIAs in in vitro studies to determine disease activity, but its use was suspended because of difficulties in interpretation, problems differentiating between active or past disease, and low sensitivity and specificity.

In vitro assays and other tests were also performed to validate the idea of the occurrence of an actual immune response to support what they observed in the mice. For example, the spleen on the challenged mice were isolated and measured for the presence of any cytokines, and specifically activated immune cell groups that would indicative that a specific immune response did occur upon vaccination. The isolated CTLs specific for the survivin protein after vaccination of the mice were used in cytoxicity assays where mice tumour cells expressing survivin were shown to be killed upon incubation with the specific CTLs.|$|E
5000|$|Raccoons {{can carry}} rabies, a lethal disease {{caused by the}} {{neurotropic}} rabies virus carried in the saliva and transmitted by bites. Its spread began in Florida and Georgia in the 1950s and was facilitated {{by the introduction of}} infected individuals to Virginia and North Dakota in the late 1970s. Of the 6,940 documented rabies cases reported in the United States in 2006, 2,615 (37.7%) were in raccoons. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as local authorities in several U.S. states and Canadian provinces, has developed <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> programs to fight the spread of the disease in endangered populations. Only one human fatality has been reported after transmission of the rabies virus strain commonly known as [...] "raccoon rabies". Among the main symptoms for rabies in raccoons are a generally sickly appearance, impaired mobility, abnormal vocalization, and aggressiveness. There may be no visible signs at all, however, and most individuals do not show the aggressive behavior seen in infected canids; rabid raccoons will often retire to their dens instead. Organizations like the U.S. Forest Service encourage people to stay away from animals with unusual behavior or appearance, and to notify the proper authorities, such as an animal control officer from the local health department. Since healthy animals, especially nursing mothers, will occasionally forage during the day, daylight activity is not a reliable indicator of illness in raccoons.|$|E

The safety of oral rabies vaccines has been assessed in both target (red fox and raccoon dog) and several non-target species. Case presentation Since 2011, the competent authority in Finland has received a few reports of dogs experiencing adverse reactions that have been assumed to be caused by the consumption of baits containing oral rabies vaccine. The dogs usually exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, inappetence, constipation or diarrhoea) or behavioral symptoms (restlessness, listlessness and unwillingness to continue hunting).

Due to <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> some European countries are now rabies-free in terrestrial animals. In Slovenia, after the first experimental <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> and study of vaccination models from 1988 - 1992, the spring-autumn campaigns have been carried out since 1995. The model of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> of wildlife requires 16 - 20 baits per km 2 in the vaccination area. The baits were distributed by plane. They were dispersed from a height of 300 - 500 m. The aeroplanes' paths were 1000 metres apart. In the vaccination campaigns two vaccines were used. Lysvulpen®, produced by the Bioveta company at the Czech Republic, was laid down in the southwestern part of the country, and Fuchsoral®, produced by the German company Impfstoffwerk Dessau-Tornau, was placed {{in the eastern part of}} Slovenia. A rapid decline of rabies was evidenced from 1995 to 1999, when the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> program in the whole territory using the aircraft baits distributing system was practiced. In 1999, only 6 rabies cases were laboratory-confirmed, whereas in 1995, 1089 rabies cases were documented. Of the 14 rabies cases detected in 1998, 12 were found as an island in a circle with a radius of 30 km in the centre of the vaccinated area. In 2000 and 2001, rabies incidence increased again, so it was decided to change the baits distribution system in the year 2001. The vaccination by crossing flights in certain areas was introduced.
