5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which swung it around into an adjacent oil platform, causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to downtime in production was greater than the damage Flossy created to the oil rigs. There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> in the Gulf of Mexico, the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting. Their goal was to use mathematical models and historic data to better predict hurricane formation and path. Studies went on into 1962, but no reliable forecast mechanism was found.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} war, the GR1s {{switched}} to medium level strike missions, typical targets for these strikes included munition depots and <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> facilities. Only the reconnaissance Tornado GR1As continued to operate at the low-altitude high-speed profile throughout the war, the GR1A emerged unscathed despite the inherent danger posed by missions such as conducting pre-attack reconnaissance. In the war's aftermath, Britain maintained a {{military presence in the}} Gulf, around half a dozen GR1s were based at Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait for operations over the southern no fly zone as part of Operation Southern Watch; another half a dozen GR1s participated in missions over Northern Iraq in Operation Provide Comfort.|$|E
5|$|Other key {{sectors of}} the Turkish economy are banking, construction, home appliances, electronics, textiles, <b>oil</b> <b>refining,</b> {{petrochemical}} products, food, mining, iron and steel, and machine industry. In 2010, the agricultural sector accounted for 9 percent of GDP, while the industrial sector accounted for 26 percent and the services sector for 65 percent. However, agriculture still accounted {{for a quarter of}} employment. In 2004, it was estimated that 46 percent of total disposable income was received by the top 20 percent of income earners, while the lowest 20 percent received only 6 percent. The rate of female employment in Turkey was 30 percent in 2012, the lowest among all OECD countries.|$|E

Large pipelines bring Alberta oil to Sarnia, where <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> and petrochemical production have become mainstays of the city's economy. Shell Canada, Imperial Oil, and Suncor Energy (Sunoco) operate refineries in Sarnia. Large salt beds found under the city became a source of chlorine and other significant ingredients which contributed to the success of Chemical Valley. Chemical companies operating in Sarnia include NOVA Chemicals, Bayer (Lanxess and H.C. Starck), Cabot Corporation and Ethyl Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Flossy {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean and moved across Central America into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression on September 21, 1956, which became a tropical storm on September 22 and a hurricane on September 23. The hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h) before it struck the central Gulf coast of the United States as a Category 1 hurricane on September 24, and evolved into an extratropical cyclone on September 25. It was the first hurricane to affect <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> in the Gulf of Mexico. The tropical cyclone led to flooding in New Orleans, and broke a drought across the eastern United States. The death toll was 15, and total damages reached $24.8million (1956USD).|$|E

25|$|Rockefeller saw the SIC as {{the ideal}} {{mechanism}} for achieving another goal: A monopoly on <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> in Cleveland. Once the SIC had severely weakened his competitors, Standard Oil would buy out the city's 26 major <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> companies at fire sale prices. The monopoly would allow Standard Oil to dominate the national refining market, garner significantly higher profits, and drive even more competitors out of business. With higher profits, Standard Oil could then rapidly expand, becoming the nation's dominant <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> company. To make the purchases, Standard Oil needed cash. To secure the cash, Rockefeller allowed Amasa Stone, Stillman Witt, Benjamin Brewster, and Truman P. Handy—all of whom were officers in Cleveland banks—to buy shares in Standard Oil at par in December 1871. Witt and the other bankers used their influence at their own and other banks to give Rockefeller the financial backing he needed. Witt now owned the equivalent of 5 {{percent of the entire}} outstanding stock of Standard Oil.|$|E
