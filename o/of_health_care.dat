40|$|Excerpt] Congress {{has held}} {{hearings}} and introduced legislation addressing the interrelated topics {{of the quality}} <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> access to mental <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> and the cost <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> The mental <b>health</b> workforce is {{a key component of}} each of these topics. The quality <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> depends partially on the skills of the people providing the care. Access to mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> relies on, among other things, the number of appropriately skilled providers available to provide care. The cost <b>of</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> depends in part on the wages of the people providing care.

5|$|Hospice {{care in the}} United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms.

Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part <b>of</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness.
