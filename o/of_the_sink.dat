25|$|Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, {{claimed in}} his memoirs to have {{discovered}} bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly {{running out of the}} basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash his hands in a semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect. There is no mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> in the official police reports.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} to the Chamber is hidden in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom on the second floor. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> taps has a snake scratched into its side; when a command in Parseltongue is spoken, it opens to reveal {{the mouth of a}} dark, slimy chute, wide enough to slide down, that gives onto a stone tunnel. There are many skeletons of small animals littering the floor and even a gigantic skin shed by the Basilisk. The tunnel leads to a solid wall, carved with two entwined serpents with emeralds for eyes. At a command in Parseltongue, the wall opens to expose a long, dim corridor, lined with monumental statues of snakes, including two rows of towering stone pillars with more carved serpents that brace the ceiling. A colossal statue of Salazar Slytherin, looking ancient and monkey-like, is at the centre. The Basilisk rested inside the statue and emerged from its mouth when the Heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, summoned it.|$|E

2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then stood in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> She then looked {{at herself in the mirror}} and cried.|$|E
2500|$|The Cathedral Room {{is one of}} {{the largest}} cave {{entrance}} rooms found in North America. The room measures [...] high, [...] wide, and [...] feet long. Entrance to the cave is made through a sink hole which is 94’ deep. Two large openings are at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> Rocks, trees, dirt and animals falling through the sinkhole and falling boulders from the ceiling throughout the centuries has left a debris pile measuring [...] tall. This pile is sometimes referred to as the Underground Mountain. On July 7, 1963 an underground altitude record was set by Don Piccard by flying a hot air balloon around the massive room. Later, in 1994 five hot air balloons were flown simultaneously in the Cathedral Room in celebration of the 100th year anniversary of giving cave tours.|$|E
50|$|Lillian's death {{left two}} living Titanic survivors, Barbara West and Millvina Dean; however, both {{were less than}} a year old at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> and neither had any {{recollection}} of it. She was the last survivor who remembered <b>the</b> <b>sinking,</b> therefore upon her death first-hand accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Titanic passed into history.|$|R

2500|$|A simple {{circular}} flow of income diagram is replaced in ecological economics {{by a more}} complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of production. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials {{is referred to as}} an [...] "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The [...] "sink function" [...] describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> function, long-term damage occurs. Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing [...] "cumulative pollutants". Pollutants affect human health and the health of the climate.|$|E

The iceberg is evoked by a wall of 400 replica life-jackets, on which an image <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sinking</b> ship is projected.|$|R
6000|$|We camped {{two days}} in the {{neighborhood}} of the [...] "Sink of the Humboldt." [...] We tried to use the strong alkaline water <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sink,</b> but it would not answer. It was like drinking lye, and not weak lye, either. It left a taste in the mouth, bitter and every way execrable, and a burning in the stomach that was very uncomfortable. We put molasses in it, but that helped it very little; we added a pickle, yet the alkali was the prominent taste and so it was unfit for drinking.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{shut the}} door, locked it, {{and went into}} the {{enclosure}} where Moreau lay beside his latest victims,--the staghounds and the llama and some other wretched brutes,--with his massive face calm even after his terrible death, and with the hard eyes open, staring at the dead white moon above. I sat down upon the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink,</b> and with my eyes upon that ghastly pile of silvery light and ominous shadows began to turn over my plans. In the morning I would gather some provisions in the dingey, and after setting fire to the pyre before me, push out into the desolation of the high sea once more. I felt that for Montgomery there was no help; that he was, in truth, half akin to these Beast Folk, unfitted for human kindred.|$|E

50|$|The {{trail to}} Cedar Sink follows the Smith Valley floor for about ¾ mile. The trail is 1.6 miles round trip and circles the {{southern}} edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> and eventually leads to a platform overlooking the sink. The trail is clearly delineated with many stairs leading to the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink</b> {{and there are several}} vista platforms along the ridge. The trail offers many glimpses at the once underground river system. The views from the plateau change depending on the weather; there are many ephemeral springs at the south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sink.</b> The overflow route is dry at times and flowing strongly at other during high precipitation events. The main channel flow is often not at the surface throughout many parts of this region.|$|E
