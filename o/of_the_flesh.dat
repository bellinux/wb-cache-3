5|$|Self-harm is practised in Hinduism by the ascetics {{known as}} sadhus. In Catholicism {{it is known}} as mortification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh.</b> Some {{branches}} of Islam mark the Day of Ashura, the commemoration of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, with a ritual of self-flagellation, using chains and swords.|$|E
5|$|The {{ninth and}} tenth commandments deal with coveting, {{which is an}} {{interior}} disposition not a physical act. The Catechism distinguishes between covetousness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> (improper sexual desire) and covetousness for another's worldly goods. The ninth commandment deals with the former and the tenth the latter.|$|E

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|The broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical spores are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. Their surfaces {{are covered with}} small rounded bumps. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5μm. The hyphae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> are brownish with thin walls, and measure 4–6μm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5μm. The hyphae do not have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The {{organization}} {{has been criticized}} for issues relating to the Catholic Church, especially the practice of mortification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh.</b> Controversies about Opus Dei have centered around criticisms of its behaviours, such as alleged secretiveness, aggressive recruiting methods, and its strict rules governing members. The organization's members have also been categorized by critics as left-leaning elitists, with some individuals supporting fascist governments, such as the Francoist Government of Spain until 1978.|$|E
50|$|Although {{injured in}} the attempt, the Viceroy escaped with flesh wounds, but his Mahout {{was killed in the}} attack. Lady Hardinge was unscathed.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} carotenoid {{deposition in}} rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were investigated in three feeding experiments. <b>The</b> deposition <b>of</b> astaxanthin in <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> increased significantly with increasing levels <b>of</b> astaxanthin in <b>the</b> diet decreased <b>the</b> ratios <b>of</b> astaxanthin in flesh to astaxanthin in diet. Fish size, dietary fat quality and vitamin E supplementation {{seemed to have}} no effect on the astaxanthin deposition.

5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh.</b> In this work the veil has the opposite effect; the woman's face is framed by the headdress to draw attention to her beauty.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in {{the early history of}} the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E

50|$|Endocannibalism is a {{practice}} <b>of</b> eating <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>of</b> {{a human being}} from the same community (tribe, social group or society), usually after they have died. Endocannibalism has also been used to describe <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> relics in a mortuary context.|$|R
50|$|Avocado oil was originally, {{and still}} is, {{extracted}} for cosmetic use {{because of its}} very high skin penetration and rapid absorption. Following drying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> avocado <b>flesh</b> to remove as much water as possible (≈65% water in avocado flesh), avocado oil for cosmetics is traditionally extracted with solvents at elevated temperatures. After extraction, the oil for application in skin care products is usually refined, bleached, and deodorized, resulting in an odorless yellow oil. Like extra virgin olive oil, cold-pressed avocado oil is unrefined and so retains the flavor and color characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruit <b>flesh.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> that it once adorned {{makes it difficult to}} discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the patina of history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> S.pungens. With an application of a drop <b>of</b> KOH, <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> will turn vinaceous (<b>the</b> color <b>of</b> red wine), <b>the</b> tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns <b>the</b> <b>flesh</b> gray, <b>the</b> tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|R

50|$|Alphonso mangoes {{are often}} {{discussed}} {{as a popular}} cultivar. Alphonso mangoes have a rich, creamy, tender texture and are low in fiber content, with a delicate, creamy pulp.

25|$|The {{eggplant}} is a delicate, tropical perennial often cultivated as {{a tender}} or half-hardy annual in temperate climates. The stem is often spiny.
