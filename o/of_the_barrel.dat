5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded from the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> Before it could be loaded the bore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel).</b>|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, James and Scamper {{qualified}} for the NFR and won five go-rounds at the event. James recalled that it was Friday the 13th during the 7th go-round <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> racing competition when Scamper's bridle fell off his head during the run.|$|E
2500|$|The report {{discussed}} testing <b>the</b> interiors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel <b>barrels</b> at <b>the</b> wreck site <b>of</b> four intact barrels {{and five}} 'open' ones, that were probed with a siphon-extraction tube. These nine out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> several hundred <b>barrels</b> were all {{located on a}} remote part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wreckage separated by 787ft from the main wreck site, which contains <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> <b>The</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> was not verified.|$|R
50|$|Exactly what {{triggered}} <b>the</b> conflagration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> {{was never}} determined, although <b>the</b> day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion was noted as unusually dry. Given the circumstances, an accidental ignition in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> was not improbable.|$|R
50|$|For <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> older, side-by-side, Spanish guns, the choke {{is often}} marked on <b>the</b> tang <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> {{becoming}} exposed when the wooden forearm is removed, after <b>the</b> double <b>barrels</b> are pivoted off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> break-action, {{such as when}} performing a field-stripping and cleaning. The manufacturer's mark, along with the proof marks, and <b>the</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> in grams, and the proof test pressures are also stamped alongside the choke marking on <b>the</b> tang <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> near where <b>the</b> shells are inserted into <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Heilongjiang hand cannon is 34 centimeters (13.4 inches) {{long without}} a handle and weighs 3.55kg (7.83 pounds). The {{diameter}} of the interior at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is 2.6cm (1.0 inches). The barrel is the lengthiest part of the hand cannon and is 6.9 inches long. There is no inscription on the hand cannon.|$|E
5|$|The barrel was of {{one-piece}} forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The breech end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> was screwed into a breech ring. The breech mechanism was {{of vertical}} sliding-block type. The barrel was {{fitted with a}} hydrospring recoil system.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed. The differences however could point to the repeated use of differently-sized falsework structures in the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> vaults (see animation below).|$|E
2500|$|The 47/8 model {{supported}} easy change <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> between 7.65 and 9mm Parabellum and a kit {{to convert}} to [...]22 caliber. [...] See Table.|$|R
5|$|Within each turret, a red stripe on the {{interior}} wall, inches from the railing, marked <b>the</b> boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel's</b> recoil, warning <b>the</b> crew to keep back.|$|R
25|$|Each barrel is a {{very simple}} non-automatic design having its own breech and bolt. Like the {{original}} Gatling gun, the entire firing cycle is actuated by cams and powered by <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> <b>The</b> seven-barrel carriage assembly itself {{is driven by the}} aircraft's dual hydraulic system.|$|R
5|$|The {{telescopic}} sight on the M6 and both elevation and traverse controls were {{located on the}} left side, so one gunner was able to aim the gun. The traverse gear had a release mechanism which allowed free movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> in case a quick traverse was needed.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 {{howitzer}} {{was essentially}} a combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> of the 152-mm howitzer model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm howitzer M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter {{than that of the}} M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E
5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is 20,000 rounds.|$|E

40|$|An {{alignment}} network between N parallel {{data input}} ports and N parallel data outputs includes a first {{and a second}} <b>barrel</b> switch. <b>The</b> first <b>barrel</b> switch fed by the N parallel input ports shifts the N outputs thereof and in turn feeds the N- 1 input data paths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>barrel</b> switch according to the relationship X=k. sup. y modulo N wherein x represents the output data path ordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>barrel</b> switch, y represents the input data path ordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>barrel</b> switch, and k equals a primitive root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number N. The zero (0) ordered output data path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>barrel</b> switch is fed directly to the zero ordered output port. The N- 1 output data paths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>barrel</b> switch {{are connected to the}} N output ports in <b>the</b> reverse ordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> connections between the output data paths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>barrel</b> switch and <b>the</b> input data paths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>barrel</b> switch. <b>The</b> second switch is controlled by a value m, which in the preferred embodiment is produced at <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> a ROM addressed by the value d wherein d represents the incremental spacing or distance between data elements to be accessed from the N input ports, and m is generated therefrom according to the relationship d=k. sup. m modulo N...|$|R
5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate the temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> are made of glass-reinforced plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. Originally the gun had an EFC barrel life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average life has increased even further. The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.|$|E
5|$|A {{signature}} {{feature of}} Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side. Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> vault replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, {{it was the}} Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15m (50ft).|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{attempts}} {{to rescue the}} freighter Sanction, which is trapped in a star's magnetic field. An agreement is reached to transport over {{the crew of the}} freighter, but they surprisingly send over a cargo barrel first. The Enterprise crew {{attempts to}} transport the freighter's crew, but is only successful in recovering four of them before their ship is destroyed. Two, T'Jon (Merritt Butrick) and Romas (Richard Lineback), are scruffy and unshaven, while the other two, Sobi (Judson Scott) and Langor (Kimberly Farr), are groomed and well dressed. They all show relief that the barrel made it over, and little remorse for the lost ship and crewmen. Both groups start to fight over the ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel,</b> and are escorted to the observation lounge under guard.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up from the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{examination}} of the bullet can exclude {{a large number of}} weapons by examining the general characteristics of a recovered bullet. By determining general aspects of the fired ammunition, a number of weapons can be immediately excluded as being incapable of firing that type of bullet. The make and model of the weapon can also be inferred from the combination of different class characteristics that are common to specific manufactures. The three main class characteristics of all bullets are the lands and grooves, the caliber of the bullet, and the rifling twist. All three can be tied directly to the type of barrel that was used to fire the bullet. The lands and grooves of barrel are the bumps and valleys created when the rifling is created. The caliber is the diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel.</b> The twist is the direction of the striations left by the barrel's rifling, clockwise (right-handed) or counterclockwise (left-handed). Most barrels will have a right-handed twist with the exception of weapons created by the Colt's Manufacturing Company which uses left-handed twists. Weapon barrels that match the class characteristics of recovered bullets can be examined further for individual characteristics to determine if the bullet came from that particular weapon.|$|E

50|$|During the {{composting}} process, both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> composting <b>barrel</b> {{shows signs of}} corrosion after a certain operating time due to the acids produced during <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> decomposition. Although <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> is painted with anticorrosive paint, it could not withstand <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acids and hence, undergoes corrosive over time.|$|R
2500|$|In Britain in the 1950s {{when the}} baby boom years {{following}} World War II caused an increased requirement for hand-knitting, I.X. Products produced a brightly coloured and marketable plastic row counter with patent number 424432. This was a barrel-shaped counter which sat in stable fashion on the knitting needle by <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> a central metal spring. <b>The</b> assemblage consisted <b>of</b> a double rotating inner barrel and an outer fixed and slotted skin which was pinned to the central spring. [...] The two separately rotating halves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>barrel</b> were printed with numbers, and the outer slotted skin rotated over <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> revealing a single ten and a single unit at one time. Precise engineering ensured that there was just enough ease <b>of</b> movement for <b>the</b> turning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels,</b> but just enough friction to prevent movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> while vigorous knitting continued. However the introduction in <b>the</b> late 1950s <b>of</b> double knitting yarn and the consequent popular use of thicker needles tended to damage the springs which were intended for needles of a maximum thickness of 3.25mm. [...] This design and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrel-shaped on-needle counters which followed it had a white or cream central barrel and a decoratively coloured outer skin.|$|R
5|$|The {{main battery}} was {{supplied}} {{with a total}} of 720 shells or 90 rounds per gun. The guns had a rate of fire of around 2.5 shells per minute. Post-war tests conducted by the British Royal Navy showed that the guns on Baden could be ready to fire again 23 seconds after firing; this was significantly faster than their British contemporaries, the , which took 36 seconds between salvos. The German weapons were, however, less accurate than earlier German weapons, and fired a lighter shell than the equivalent British guns. The German armor-piercing shell weighed 750kg (1,653lb) and was driven by a 277kg (610.7lb) RPC/12 propellant charge in a brass cartridge. The shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of 800mps (2,625fps). Each gun was expected to fire 300 shells before replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrel</b> was required. The guns that had been constructed for the battleships Sachsen and Württemberg were eventually used as long-range, heavy siege guns on the Western Front, as coastal guns in occupied France and Belgium, and a few as railway guns; these guns were referred to as Langer Max.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{variants}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mitrailleuse concept were developed, {{with common}} elements {{to all of}} their designs. They were characterized {{by a number of}} rifled barrels clustered together and mounted on a conventional artillery chassis or (in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> one model) a tripod. The ammunition was secured in a single block and placed into the breech, behind <b>the</b> open ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b> All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> were loaded simultaneously by a manual closing lever or large horizontal screw. A second lever could be worked rapidly (or in some models, a crank could be turned) to fire each barrel in succession. This earned the weapon its French nickname of moulin à café (coffee grinder). (A very similar name was earned by the hand-cranked, mechanically loaded, continuous-firing, [...] "coffee mill gun" [...] in America during the American Civil War.) ...|$|R

50|$|Añejos {{are often}} rested in barrels {{previously}} used to rest reposados. <b>The</b> <b>barrels</b> cannot {{be more than}} 600 liters (158 gallons), and most are in the 200-liter (52-gallon) range. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrels</b> used are from whiskey distilleries in the US or Canada, and Jack Daniels barrels are especially popular. This treatment creates many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark color and more complex flavors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> añejo tequila. After aging {{of at least one}} year, the añejo can be removed from <b>the</b> wood <b>barrels</b> and placed in stainless steel tanks to reduce <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> evaporation that can occur in <b>the</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
