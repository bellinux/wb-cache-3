Five types of cells were identified from embryonic suspension: spherical cytoplasm-rich, spherical vacuolated, oval vacuolated, elongated vacuolated, and irregular shaped cells. Each type of cell multiplied with certain geometric symmetry.

We hypothesized that the gene expression pattern of organized and growth arrested mammary acini would share similarities with breast tumors with good prognoses. Using Affymetrix HG-U 133 A microarrays, we analyzed the expression of 22, 283 gene transcripts in two HMEC cell lines, 184 (finite life span) and HMT 3522 S 1 (immortal non-malignant), on successive days post-seeding in a laminin-rich extracellular matrix assay. Both HMECs underwent growth arrest in G 0 /G 1 and differentiated into polarized acini between days 5 and 7. We identified gene expression changes with the same temporal pattern in both lines.

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila {{hedgehog}} (hh) gene encodes a secreted protein {{involved in}} <b>organizing</b> <b>growth</b> and patterning in many developmental processes. Hh appears to act by inducing the localized expression {{of at least}} two other signaling molecules, decapentaplegic (dpp) and wingless (wg), which then govern cell proliferation and patterning in surrounding tissue. Here, we demonstrate that cyclic AMP (cAMP) -dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is essential during limb development to prevent inappropriate dpp and wg expression. We also show that a constitutively active form of PKA can prevent inappropriate dpp and wg expression, but does not interfere with their normal induction by hh. We propose that the basal activity of PKA imposes a block on the transcription of dpp and wg and that hh exerts its organizing influence by alleviating this block...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{evolution}} of digits was an essential {{step in the}} success of tetrapods. Among the key players, Hoxd genes are coordinately regulated in developing digits, where they help <b>organize</b> <b>growth</b> and patterns. We identified the distal regulatory sites associated with these genes by probing the three-dimensional architecture of this regulatory unit in developing limbs. This approach, combined with in vivo deletions of distinct regulatory regions, revealed that the active part of the gene cluster contacts several enhancer-like sequences. These elements are dispersed throughout the nearby gene desert, and each contributes either quantitatively or qualitatively to Hox gene transcription in presumptive digits. We propose that this genetic system, which we call a “regulatory archipelago,” provides an inherent flexibility that may partly underlie the diversity in number and morphology of digits across tetrapods, as well as their resilience to drastic variations.

Wild-type cells are co-opted into new hair growths by b-catenin mutant cells, which non–cell autonomously activate Wnt signaling within the neighboring wild-type cells via Wnt ligands. This study demonstrates a mechanism by which Wnt/b-catenin signaling controls stem cell–dependent tissue growth non–cell autonomously and advances our understanding of the mechanisms that drive coordinated regeneration.

Signals across boundaries between compartments {{can result in}} local expression of secreted proteins <b>organizing</b> <b>growth</b> and patterning of tissues [1 – 6]. Sharp and straight interfaces between compartments are crucial for stabilizing the position of such organizers and therefore for precise implementation of body plans. Maintaining boundaries in proliferating tissues requires mechanisms to counteract cell rearrangements caused by cell division; however, the nature of such mechanisms remains unclear. Here we quantitatively analyzed cell morphology and {{the response to the}} laser ablation of cell bonds {{in the vicinity of the}} anteroposterior compartment boundary in developing Drosophila wings. We found that mechanical tension is approximately 2. 5 -fold increased on cell bonds along this compartment boundary as compared to the remaining tissue. Cell bond tension is decreased in the presence of Y- 27632 [7], an inhibitor of Rho-kinase whose main effector is Myosin II [8]. Simulations using a vertex model [9] demonstrate that a 2. 5 -fold increase in local cell bond tension suffices to guide the rearrangement of cells after cell division to maintain compartment boundaries. Our results provide a physical mechanism in which the local increase in Myosin II-dependent cell bond tension directs cell sorting at compartment boundaries...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin plays crucial roles in {{regulating}} plant growth development, including embryo and root patterning, organ formation, vascular tissue differentiation and growth responses to environmental stimuli. Asymmetric auxin distribution patterns {{have been observed}} within tissues, and these so-called auxin gradients change dynamically during different developmental processes. Most auxin is synthesized in the shoot and distributed directionally throughout the plant. This polar auxin transport is mediated by auxin influx and efflux facilitators, whose subcellular polar localizations guide the direction of auxin flow. The polar localization of PIN auxin efflux carriers changes in response to developmental and external cues in order to channel auxin flow in a regulated manner for <b>organized</b> <b>growth.</b> Auxin itself modulates the expression and subcellular localization of PIN proteins, contributing to a complex pattern of feedback regulation.

A great variety of surfaces exhibits a nano-scale order at thermal equilibrium, including adsorbate-induced reconstruction, surface dislocations networks, vicinal surfaces or more complex systems. Continuum models have been proposed where long-range elastic interactions are responsible for spontaneous periodic domain formation.
