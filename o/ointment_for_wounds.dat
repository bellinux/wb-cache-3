40|$|Mangroves are {{utilized}} {{in many parts}} of the world as a renewable resource. Harvested for durable, water-resistant wood, mangroves have been used in building houses, boats, pilings, and furniture. The wood of the black mangrove and buttonwood trees has also been {{utilized in}} the production of charcoal. Tannins and other dyes are extracted from mangrove bark. Leaves have been used in tea, medicine, livestock feed, and as a substitute for tobacco for smoking. Several workers have reported the usefulness of mangrove plants in traditional medicine [1 - 3]. In view of earlier research works the following mangrove species would be selected for the study of phytoconstituents. Suaeda monoica Forssk ex. Gmel belongs to Chenopodiaceae family is a salt marsh mangrove herb similar to Suaeda maritima in appearance. S. monoica is smaller in size, simple leaves which are edible. Traditionally, the leaf from S. monoica is known to use as a medicine for hepatitis and scientifically it is reported to be used as <b>ointment</b> <b>for</b> <b>wounds</b> and possess antiviral activity, because of the presence of triterpenoids and sterols [4, 5]. Sesuvium portulacastrum (L) belongs to Aizoaceace is a sprawling perennial herb that grows in coastal areas throughout the world, which is native to Africa, Asia, Australia, North America and South America, and has naturalised in many places. It is commonly known as shoreline purslane or sea purslane in English. It has smooth, fleshy, glossy green leaves that are linear and its flowers are pink or purple. The plant extract showed antibacterial and anticandidal activities and moderate antifungal activity. As well-known criteria of mangrove and mangrove associate plants are proved to have rich of high value secondary metabolites viz, saponins, alkaloids, polyphenols which possess antibacterial, antifungal, antiplasmodial and hepatoprotective activities [6]. Therefore, the present attempt has been made to identify the groups of phytoconstituent of S. monoica and S. portulocastrum qualitatively...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundLittle {{is known}} about multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) {{outbreaks}} in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). AimTo describe an MDRP outbreak in an LTCF and to clarify risk factors for MDRP acquisition. MethodsPatients who were positive for MDRP at an LTCF from January 2013 to January 2014 were analysed. A descriptive analysis, a caseâ€“control study, and a microbiological analysis were performed. FindingsA total of 23 MDRP cases were identified, 16 of which were confirmed in sputum samples. Healthcare workers were observed violating hand hygiene procedures when performing oral, wound, and genital care. Nasogastric tube and oxygen mask use was associated with MDRP acquisition in the respiratory tract, {{which might have been}} confounded by poor hand hygiene. Sharing unhygienic devices, such as portable oral suction devices for oral care, and washing bottles and <b>ointments</b> <b>for</b> <b>wound</b> and genital care with inadequate disinfection could explain the transmission of MDRP in some cases. Isolates from 11 patients were found to be indistinguishable or closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and harbouring the blaGES- 5 gene. Subsequent enhanced infection control measures were supported by nearby hospitals and a local public health centre. No additional cases were identified for a year after the last case occurred in January 2014. ConclusionAn outbreak of MDRP with an antimicrobial resistance gene, blaGES- 5, occurred in a Japanese LTCF. It was successfully controlled by enhanced infection control measures, which neighbouring hospitals and a local public health centre supported...|$|R
5000|$|He {{developed}} several {{treatments for}} knights, most notably for an infliction called [...] "Fistula In Ano," [...] a condition where a large, painful lump appears between {{the base of}} the spine and the anus, caused by long amounts of time sitting on a horse. He could successfully cut this lump out, and described how to do so in a historical document which still remains. In technical terms, the Fistula in Ano, without any regard to the strict definition of the word, is understood to be an abscess, running upon, or into the Intestinum Rectum; though an abscess in this part, when once ruptured, does generally, if neglected, grow callous in its cavity and edges, and become at last what is properly called a fistula. (This condition is now diagnosed as a sacrococcygeal fistula, more commonly known as a pilonidal cyst.) He also created an <b>ointment</b> <b>for</b> arrow <b>wounds</b> and clysters made out of hemlock, opium and henbane in 1376.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{evaluate}} the traditional marketed ayurvedic <b>ointment</b> formulation <b>for</b> <b>wound</b> healing activity using albino rats. In {{the present study}} ayurvedic marketed herbal formulations Jakhmeruz Pink ointment and Zadpola malam was evaluated <b>for</b> <b>wound</b> healing activity in excision model in albino rats. The Wister albino rats (180 - 210 g) of either sex used in the study. <b>For</b> the excision <b>wound</b> study, each group containing 6 animals respectively. A circular wound of about 2. 5 diameter made on the depilated dorsal thoracic region of the rats under light ether anesthesia in aseptic condition. the <b>ointment</b> was applied <b>for</b> 16 days the observation of percentage wound closure were made on 4 th, 8 th, 12 th and 16 th post wounding days. The activity was {{compared with that of}} control and silver sulfadiazine ointment as standard drugs. The parameters like epithilisation, weight of granuloma, scar formation, were counterchecked. The formulation showed a significantly higher contraction rate and shortened epithelisation period in the model. In excision model the 99 % healing (p< 0. 001) on sixteenth day compared to 85 % and 75 % of healing with silver sulfadiazine and control respectively. Thus it is concluded that the formulation has got potential wound healing activity justifying its use in traditional practice...|$|R

To assess the efficacy of uniformity, viscosity, diffusivity, rheology, stability, spreadability, permeability and other physical characteristics were evaluated. Two Formulations, formulation A (Aq. extract of Ficus racemosa) and B (Aqueous extract of Ficus benghalensis) were prepared with same bases. Both the Formulation A and B contains hard paraffin, cetostearyl alcohol, Light liquid paraffin and microcrystalline wax. Formulation B was found better than formulation A in all aspects like spreadability, viscosity, consistency, stability, diffusibility. In conclusion, it was clearly observed that Formulation B was better than formulation A...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clean wounds are a {{frequent}} occurrence {{in the medical}} field and medical providers provide varied advice <b>for</b> <b>wound</b> care. Topical antibacterial ointments are commonly used to facilitate wound healing in patients with these types of wounds. Topical antibacterial ointments {{have been shown to}} cause allergic contact dermatitis, may cause an increase in antibiotic resistance, and may be equally efficacious when compared to petrolatum-based <b>ointments</b> <b>for</b> healing clean <b>wounds.</b> Method: An exhaustive search of available medical literature was performed using Medline, CINHAL, and Cochrane databases. Search terms were: antibacterial agents, wound healing, and petrolatum. Articles were limited to humans and English language only. Studies were excluded if wounds were not clean, the study was not performed in a double blinded fashion, or if the study was not performed in the last 20 years. Results: Four studies were found through the literature search after inclusion and exclusion criteria were met. All studies found that petrolatum-based ointments were as efficacious in the healing of clean wounds as antibacterial agents. Two of the studies had occurrences of allergic contact dermatitis. Conclusion: Current studies suggest that petrolatum-based ointments are equally effective in healing clean wounds when compared to antibiotic based ointments. Using an antibiotic ointment does not decrease the rate of infection and puts patients at risk for allergic contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} was to {{evaluate}} the wound healing activity of developed polyherbal formulation in the form of ointment by using hydroalcoholic extracts of leaves of Ficus religiosa, Mentha arvensis and roots of Rauwolfia serpentina with excipients. The phytochemical studies revealed the presence of alkaloids, phytosterol, tannins, flavonoids and protein. The developed polyherbal <b>ointment</b> was examined <b>for</b> <b>wound</b> healing activity in two types of wound models on rats; the excision and incision wound model. The polyherbal formulation was applied once daily until complete healing of wound and it was noted that the period of epithelization significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced when compared with vehicle control group (15 Â± 0. 34) which was nearly comparable with standard drug group. The tensile strength of healed wound was significantly increased (P < 0. 05) as compared to vehicle control group. Hence the developed polyherbal formulation showed significant (P < 0. 05) wound healing activity as compared to control group. The obtained results were nearly compared with standard drug group betadine ointment in terms of contractibility, wound closure time and tensile strength...|$|R
40|$|Driven by {{the need}} to {{engineer}} robust surface coatings for medical devices to prevent infection and sepsis, incorporation of nanoparticles has surfaced as a promising avenue to enhance non-fouling efficacy. Microbial synthesis of such nanoscale metallic structures is of substantive interest as this can offer an eco-friendly, cost-effective and sustainable route for further development. Here we present a Mucor hiemalis-derived fungal route for synthesis of silver nanoparticles, which display significant antimicrobial properties when tested against six pathological bacterial strains (Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas brassicacearum, Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and three pathological fungal strains (Candida albicans, oxysporum, and Aspergillus flavus). These antimicrobial attributes were comparable to those of established antibiotics (streptomycin, tetracycline, kanamycin and rifampicin) and fungicides (amphotericin B, fluconazole and ketoconazole), respectively. Importantly, these nanoparticles show significant synergistic characteristics when combined with the antibiotics and fungicides to offer substantially greater resistance to microbial growth. The blend of antibacterial and antifungal properties, coupled with their intrinsic green and facile synthesis, makes these biogenic nanoparticles particularly attractive for future applications in nanomedicine ranging from topical <b>ointments</b> and bandages <b>for</b> <b>wound</b> healing to coated stents...|$|R
