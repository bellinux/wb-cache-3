Turning his force around to investigate, Linois hoped to {{encounter}} a merchant convoy but instead discovered the large British second rate HMS London looming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> ahead. Unable to escape, Linois fought until his ships were battered and he himself was badly wounded, but he eventually surrendered to the squadron under Admiral Warren that had followed London. Napoleon's fury at Linois was unabated and the French admiral remained a prisoner of war for the next eight years.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Océan ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness.</b> Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into the starboard side of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Océans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E

As he began {{traveling}} aimlessly experiencing the world, {{he realized that}} he was the Raven Father, Creator of All Life. Once he realized who he was, he gathered up his strength and flew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> to a new place which he called earth, but he was still alone, so he decided to create plants. As he flew around exploring this new world, he came upon a man whom the legend claims {{was the first of the}} Inuit people. Raven fed the man and taught the man to respect the world around him. Soon after, a woman came to be and Raven taught the both of them how to cloth themselves, build shelter, and make canoes to travel the water. As the two bred and spawned children, Raven cared for their children and educated them as he had done before.|$|E

She saw a man coming toward the pool and fought to be free until the hood fell off; the light helped the man make his way to safety and scared off the evil creatures. She {{struggled}} to follow until the hood fell back over her hair, and all the evil things came <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness,</b> trapping her under a big stone with a will-o'-the-wyke {{to sit on the}} cross-shaped snag and keep watch.|$|E

500|$|Dusk of Dawn, Du Bois's second autobiography, was {{published}} in 1940. The title refers to Du Bois's hope that African Americans were passing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> of racism into an era of greater equality. The work is part autobiography, part history, and part sociological treatise. Du Bois described the book as [...] "the autobiography of a concept of race elucidated and magnified and doubtless distorted in the thoughts and deeds which were mine Thus for all time my life is significant for all lives of men." ...|$|E

Seymour's most immediate problem was to secure his prize. Many of the unwounded prisoners were transferred to Amethyst under guard and at 01:05, the frigates were cut apart by severing the tangled rigging. Ten minutes later, the 74-gun [...] appeared <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> and at 01:30 a second frigate, [...] under Captain Philip Broke, arrived, drawn by the gunfire. Together, the three British ships removed the prisoners from Thétis and affected improvised repairs: Thétis had lost her remaining masts shortly after she had been boarded and Amethysts were in immediate danger of collapse. British casualties in the engagement were severe, with 19 killed and 51 wounded, but French losses were several times larger, with 135 dead, including Pinsum, and 102 wounded.|$|E

[...] When the group refused to allow women into the meeting, the chairman of the society which runs the hall cancelled the event. [...] He was heckled by many of those in the audience. [...] Choudary took the microphone from the chairman and led chants of [...] "sharia for UK", saying in reference to the exclusion of women: [...] "Jews and Christians will never make peace with you until you either become like them or adopt their ways." [...] Outside the hall, Choudary criticised British society, and predicted that Muslims would make up the majority within one or two decades.

500|$|Although {{raised in}} a Jewish home, Ginsburg became non-observant when she was {{excluded}} from the minyan for mourners {{after the death of}} her mother. There was a [...] "house full of women", but Ginsburg, as a woman, was excluded. Orthodox Judaism requires that ten bar mitzvahed men be present for a minyan, and women are excluded from being counted. She notes that her attitude might be different, following her attendance at a bat mitzvah ceremony in a more liberal stream of Judaism where the rabbi and cantor were both women. In March 2015, Ginsburg and Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt released [...] "The Heroic and Visionary Women of Passover", an essay highlighting the roles of five key women in the saga: [...] "These women had a vision leading <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> shrouding their world. They were women of action, prepared to defy authority to make their vision a reality bathed {{in the light of the}} day." [...] In addition, she decorates her chambers with an artist's rendering of the Hebrew phrase from Deuteronomy, [...] "Zedek, zedek, tirdof", ("Justice, justice shall you pursue") as a reminder of her heritage and professional responsibility.|$|E

[...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
