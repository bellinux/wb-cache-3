5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing that the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> {{to the marriage}} is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> to the marriage has been continually absent from the applicant, and the applicant has {{no reason to believe that}} the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own {{the right to use}} a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> owns the right to use the same mark everywhere else in the country. It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E

5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, {{and he realized that}} the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. <b>Other</b> <b>party</b> leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea was to keep the Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom general election, 2017, the Conservative Party won 317 seats (the Speaker of the House {{not being}} counted as a Conservative), {{more than any}} <b>other</b> <b>party,</b> though not enough to achieve an overall majority. The Conservative party, headed by the prime {{minister}} Theresa May, won 55 more seats than the Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn. The Scottish National Party (Scotland only) won 35 out of 59 Scottish seats in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2013, Rajoelina officially renounced his {{candidature}} in {{the next}} presidential election, then planned for May 2013. This decision followed a similar declaration {{on the part of}} former president Ravalomanana. Exclusion of both political figures from the next general election was a key precondition to international recognition of the elections, as defined by the Southern African Development Community in its roadmap toward ending the political crisis. Rajoelina expressed support for Edgar Razafindravahy, interim mayor of Antananarivo and the official candidate of the TGV party among several <b>other</b> <b>party</b> candidates, and declared his intention to run in the 2018 presidential election.|$|E
50|$|The Official Opposition {{party has}} {{advantages}} over <b>other</b> opposition <b>parties</b> in the House.

5|$|Perhaps most importantly, Pinckney's Treaty granted both Spanish and American ships {{unrestricted}} navigation rights {{along the}} entire Mississippi River, as well as duty-free transport for American ships through the Spanish port of New Orleans, opening much of the Ohio River basin for settlement and trade. Agricultural produce could now flow on flatboats down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans and Europe. Spain and the United States further agreed to protect the vessels of the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> anywhere within their jurisdictions and to not detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels.|$|E
5|$|Some females {{stay and}} defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area {{completely}} to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie {{down on top of}} the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> if it comes close.|$|E
5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E

5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3 {{supports}} split-screen multiplayer {{and online}} multiplayer. Five different game modes {{can be played}} online in the game. Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some modes is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI drivers are replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions differently to the offline mode. The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three modes are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player modes where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously. Team Crush is focused cooperative gameplay while Double Impact is about competing with each <b>other.</b> <b>Party</b> Crash is an eight-player score competition mode where players crash on a junction individually and their scores are compared. In April 2010, online services were shut down.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the French chemist Georges Urbain {{separated}} Marignac's ytterbia {{into two}} components: neoytterbia and lutecia. Neoytterbia later {{became known as}} the element ytterbium, and lutecia {{became known as the}} element lutetium. The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time, but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time. Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the <b>other</b> <b>party.</b> The Commission on Atomic Mass, consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke, Wilhelm Ostwald, and Georges Urbain, which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones, {{based on the fact that}} the separation of lutetium from Marignac's ytterbium was first described by Urbain. After Urbain's names were recognized, neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium.|$|E

5|$|In September 1201 one of Coutances' suffragan bishops, Lisiard, the Bishop of Sées died. King John objected {{when the}} cathedral chapter {{attempted}} to elect {{one of their}} own members as his successor. Coutances refused to recognise the result of the election, and the chapter divided into two parties, one favouring the elected chapter member, the <b>other</b> <b>party</b> another choice. Both parties appealed to the papacy, who eventually approved of the election of the Archdeacon of Sées, Silvester. Coutances had the right to consecrate the bishop however, and he refused to do so, arguing that the king's choice had been disregarded. Pope Innocent III then ordered another Norman archbishop to consecrate Silvester, but the king refused to allow Silvester to take possession of his see. This led Innocent to order Normandy laid under an interdict, but eventually Silvester was allowed to take possession of Sees.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Beshear's {{administration}} {{attempted to}} {{seize control of}} 141 gambling-related domain names {{in an attempt to}} block Kentucky residents from accessing those websites. Beshear claimed the sites were conducting illegal, unregulated gambling operations in the state and providing untaxed competition to the state's horse racing industry. Later that year, a Franklin County judge ruled that Beshear had the authority to seize the domain names, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned that ruling on appeal. Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court, partially on grounds that the web site owners were being represented by gambling associations and players groups who Beshear said had no legal standing in the case. In 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court agreed with Beshear and ordered the web site owners themselves to appear before the court. On December 23, 2015, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wingate ruled in favor of the state and awarded it $870 million in damages. The <b>other</b> <b>party</b> to the case, Amaya Gaming, announced they would appeal the decision.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the coup, Taraki and <b>other</b> <b>party</b> leaders initiated other radical Marxist policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. However, he ruled over a nation with a deep Islamic religious culture and {{a long history of}} resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control, and consequently many of these reforms were not actually implemented nationwide. Popular resentment of Taraki's drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout the country, reducing government control to only a limited area. The strength of this anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan civil war.|$|E
