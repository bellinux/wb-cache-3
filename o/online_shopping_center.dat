40|$|A {{very popular}} {{hypothesis}} of late is that grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> perform better {{and are less}} risky than other retail investments. This hypothesis is primarily based on three notions: 1) grocery stores are unique {{in their ability to}} attract shoppers on a regular basis, often two to three times a week. This provides a grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>center</b> with consistent traffic that benefits the in-line tenants; 2) Grocery stores represent a non-cyclical business. People need to eat whether the economy is strong or weak, therefore, grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> can rely on a minimum level of traffic regardless of economic conditions; 3) Many retailers have experienced significant sales leakage to the Internet. This has recently led to the concept of replacing large stores with small showrooms. However, the Internet has not impacted the grocery store business as significantly. Although some grocers have attempted to implement online stores, the model has been difficult to implement and unsuccessful. Therefore, many investors view grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> as a hedge to the threat of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> faced by other retailers. These three characteristics have led many core investors to allocate capital to grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> since they are viewed as stable and low-risk investments relative to other real estate alternatives. The purpose of this Thesis is to evaluate the performance of grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> relative to other real estate investments, primarily in terms of asset prices and capitalization rates. This Thesis will attempt to determine whether investors pay more for grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and whether a potential price premium is warranted based on actual performance. This Thesis will also measure the volatility of grocery-anchored <b>shopping</b> <b>center</b> prices compared to other retail and non-retail investments to help determine the relative risk of these investments. by Adam Schwank.

40|$|E-commerce in general, and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> in particular, are {{becoming}} popular ways of utilizing the Internet throughout the world. Social media is also becoming a widespread tool, {{not only for}} interaction with others but also for marketing. Despite this trend, there is a dearth {{of knowledge about the}} acceptance of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> and the use of social media in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia. Technology adoption levels in Saudi Arabia are growing rapidly but have yet to reach their full potential. One of the leading theories explaining <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> behaviour – the <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> acceptance model (OSAM) – has not been employed in previous studies of social media use or in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia to understand <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> To address this research problem, the researcher implemented a study using a positivist approach. Quantitative data was gathered using an online survey. This survey was conducted with Saudi residents who engage with <b>online</b> <b>shopping.</b> A data set of 423 completed survey responses is used in this thesis for statistical analysis. The data was collected using a random sample and was collected from January to September 2015. The structural equation modelling tested the hypothesised relationships between the constructs as postulated in the model. Nineteen of the hypothesised links were supported and ten were rejected. Eventually, the model that has statistical and explanatory power was confirmed. The findings indicate a positive relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention and other factors of online shopping acceptance in Saudi Arabia. A positive relationship is also seen between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> orientation and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> experience. The case examines the relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> orientation and <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> motivation. The same applies for the relationship between <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> and social media through the mediation of <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention. This research contributes to understanding the role of social media in OSAM in Saudi Arabia as a developing country, as OSAM incorporates social media as a new factor that influences acceptance aside from what is traditionally stipulated. A second contribution is the finding that shopping orientation is the most important construct affecting <b>online</b> <b>shopping</b> intention in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
