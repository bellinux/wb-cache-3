40|$|About 16, 000 out of 17, 000 {{miles of}} the Illinois Department of Transportation’s {{pavements}} were originally constructed as either <b>jointed</b> plain <b>concrete,</b> <b>jointed</b> reinforced <b>concrete,</b> or continuously reinforced concrete. Many of these pavements have been rehabilitated or {{are in need of}} rehabilitation. Typical repair of all portland cement concrete pavements is to repair the broken and D-cracked sections with patches and overlay with bituminous concrete. Bituminous concrete overlays of PCC pavements usually begin to fail at the reflected joints and patched areas of the old concrete pavement, in addition to areas where the underlying concrete has continued to deteriorate. Rubblization eliminates joints and cracks that may reflect through a bituminous concrete overlay. Ten projects using the rubblization method have been constructed in Illinois, seven of which incorporated experimental features and were closely monitored. The construction and performance of these seven projects are presented in this report. Performance has been very good, with less reflective cracking than on adjacent patch and overlay sections...|$|R

40|$|Mechanistic {{analysis}} of <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements has often considered only traffic loading in tensile stress calculation. The analysis is often {{reduced to a}} single or dual wheel load positioned at a free slab edge. More advanced analyses have included environmental loading, but this is usually limited to a linear temperature differential through the slab. This type of analysis usually predicts bottom-up transverse cracking {{in the center of}} the slab. However, field data has indicated that other failure modes can also occur. This paper quantitatively demonstrates how the failure mode of <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements can be transverse, corner, or longitudinal cracking, originating at either the top or bottom of the slab. The failure mode depends on the loading, slab geometry, environment, and material properties. The differential drying shrinkage of the concrete was found to be one of the most influential parameters in reproducing the observed failure modes of in-situ concrete pavement...|$|R
40|$|As <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> {{pavements}} age, {{they typically}} experience panel cracking, joint or crack faulting, and surface distress. To maintain user satisfaction and safety, the agency or owner must identify {{the causes of}} the distress and consider types of feasible repairs, if any. These repairs range from partial to full-depth concrete repairs for spalled or cracked panels, to load-transfer and ride-quality restoration schemes for faulted cracks and joints. Retrofitting dowel bars into a distressed and faulted concrete pavement has become a proven technique for restoring or improving the capacity of <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements. The backfill materials and installation techniques used in retrofitting dowel bars must, however, be carefully designed. Numerous field and laboratory trials have been carried out in Minnesota in the recent past, allowing engineers and contractors to refine the installation techniques and materials necessary to produce long-lasting and effective projects. This paper provides a history of the development of best practices for retrofitting dowel bars into <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements located in the extreme climate of Minnesota. The performance of field test sections, up to 13 years old, are discussed in relation to dowel bar location, long-term load-transfer capability, and durability of backfill materials. Implemented design changes based on results from accelerated loading laboratory studies are discussed. An effective installation method and materials testing process, required of contractors before constructing retrofit projects in Minnesota, is described. Retrofit dowel bar installation, in conjunction with restoration of the surface through diamond grinding, has been proven to significantly extend the capacity and serviceable life of many concrete pavements in Minnesota...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of sealing joints in rigid {{pavement}} is to prevent or {{reduce the amount of}} water infiltrating into pavement structure. It is well accepted that the presence of moisture in a pavement structure is a contributor to a variety of governing distress types that eventually deteriorates the pavement structure and decreases the pavement service life. Effectiveness of joint sealants to protect <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavement against water related distresses has been a focus of great interest recently. An experimental program was carried out on the Riverside Campus of Texas A&M University to study the effectiveness of different sealant types to limit drainage related infiltration of the joint under different joint openings and bonding conditions. Results confirmed that if joint seals are properly installed, they can be very effective in preventing moisture infiltration. Unsealed joints had significantly higher flow rates compared to joints with damaged sealants. The test results in this study have also demonstrated the effect of sealant proper installation on performance. Using experimental data the actual number of wet days was defined and analyzed. A faulting prediction model was developed. The erosion resistance of materials, number of wet days and traffic load were precisely defined and considered in this model. The mechanistic empirical model presented in this dissertation can effectively analyze the faulting and erosion in <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements. The model is capable to be calibrated for local conditions as a distinct advantage over other faulting models. The model was successfully implemented and calibrated into a computerized format. Results show that the model fits well with the field data and can be implemented for design and maintenance management purposes. By using the model the effectiveness of sealant in pavement sustainability can be determined. The most valuable outcome of this study is the demonstration mechanistically of the role of joint sealing on service life of <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements. Sealants, by limiting water infiltration into the pavement sublayers, can greatly improve concrete pavement performance...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a vehicle}} travels on <b>jointed</b> <b>{{concrete}}</b> roads {{the weight of}} the vehicle passes from one concrete panel to the next. As the vehicle traverses the joints its weight is placed {{on the edge of the}} panel, where the panel is least able to withstand the deflection force. This can cause cracks as pavement shears off the edge of the panel. On older highways built in the early-to-mid 20th century, dowel bars (steel rods) were placed across the joints to help transfer the load from one panel to the next.|$|R

The paper addresses all forms and combinations of dowel misalignment. Equations were developed to identify each misalignment type, and statistical analyses were performed on major categories for the entire project. A decision on the acceptance or rejection of a dowel bar, a joint, or a pavement section, can be made {{based on the results of}} the computations and specified tolerance values...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a number}} of {{pavement}} sealant research projects conducted in Wisconsin during the last several decades, and on the early experiences of some other transportation agencies, maintenance engineers of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation {{have come to believe that}} sealing of contraction joints of <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements is unnecessary. They believe even more. They claim that with respect to ride quality and total pavement performance, the performance of unsealed pavements is superior to that of sealed pavements. And they estimate “that Wisconsin saves $ 6, 000, 000 a year by not trying to have a sealed system. ” (1) In local and national forums, they suggested that similar savings await other states that in effect see the light and abandon the lost cause of pavement sealing. Finally, they challenged other professionals to prove them wrong. Generally, when claims such as these are made by research individuals, claims that contradict the observations of their professional colleagues and their predecessors of the last several generations, they are usually dismissed as the result of bad science or faulty logic. But when such claims are made by experienced professionals from respected professional organizations, they cannot be so easily dismissed. Consequently, this paper was developed to examine the case for and against the use of unsealed <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements, with a primary focus on the performance of Wisconsin test-pavements as described and discussed in recent papers on the subject.

The primary objective of the research presented in this report is to evaluate the adequacy of the design guidelines and make appropriate recommendations so that the guidelines can be adopted for design of jointed precast walls in seismic regions. The test data to date on such systems are those collected during the wall direction testing of the PRESSS test building. Hence, this data set has been employed in the validation process. Furthermore, in order to validate the design guidelines over a range of lateral displacements, an analytical procedure was first developed by reversing the suggested guidelines. Additionally, because of the shortcomings {{associated with the use of}} the equivalent stress block concept in design, an alternative analysis method was also considered, which was based on the monolithic beam analogy (MBA) originally developed for jointed frame systems. The analytical results from monotonic loading were compared to experimental {{response of the}} jointed wall established from the PRESSS test data. It was found that the analysis method based on the PRESSS guidelines underestimated the lateral load resistance of the jointed wall in the PRESSS test building by up to 22 % at large lateral displacements and overestimated by greater percentages at small displacements. When the force transferred through the shear connectors was based on the measured force-displacement response, the PRESSS guidelines and MBA underestimated the moment response of the jointed wall by 12 % and 5 %, respectively, at the maximum measured lateral displacement. However, utilizing the PRESSS guidelines with the measured force in the shear connectors, it was found that the neutral axis depth was overestimated by over 100 % and the post-tensioning elongation was underestimated by 26 %. It was also revealed that the framing action contributed to the moment resistance in the wall direction of the PRESSS building by as much as 25 %. Several recommendations are provided for improving the PRESSS design guidelines, which will simplify the design calculations while providing efficient design details for the precast jointed wall systems. With improvements, the PRESSS guidelines are shown to predict the observed performance of the jointed wall in the PRESSS test building satisfactorily...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{earthquakes}} {{highlighted the}} inadequacy of the current design criteria for the connection system of the cladding wall panels of precast buildings. A systematic {{solution to this problem}} consists in realising an isostatic panel-to-structure connection system that allows a seismic response of the frame structure with no reaction forces into the connections of the panels. This can be achieved by supporting each panel to the structure with two hinges, one at the top and one at the bottom, so to have a pure frame behaviour with a rigid-body motion of the pendulum arrangement of panels. However, the silicone sealant needed in between the joints can provide a certain degree of contrast to the pendulum motion. In order to quantify this contribution, a series of experimental tests has been carried out on both small assemblages of <b>concrete</b> blocks <b>jointed</b> with silicone strips and structural sub-assembly made by two full scale cladding panels with pendulum arrangement.

40|$|The Wisconsin Department of Transportation {{has been}} {{constructing}} <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> pavements incorporating open graded permeable base (OGPB) layers {{for a number}} of years. The OGPB layer has been constructed using non-stabilized, asphalt stabilized, and cement stabilized aggregates of varying gradations. Test sections have been established throughout the State of Wisconsin and have been monitored for performance for the last 5 years. To date, little if any performance variations after limited trafficking have been noted for jointed PCC sections constructed over OGPB layers as compared to those constructed over conventional dense graded aggregate base layers. Data was collected along USH 18 / 151 in lowa/Dane Counties from a total of 17 test sections constructed to monitor performance variations due to base layer design, transverse joint sealing practices, and transverse joint doweling. The field data collected for this research included slab dimensions, surface detections from central slab and slab comer positions, and slab temperature measurements at various slab depths. In addition to the collected field data, construction records were reviewed to determine base layer design and pavement surface thickness as measured by cores extracted after construction. The data was used in conjunction with back calculation procedures developed by the author to establish slab-by-slab interior and corner foundation support k-values. The ratio of corner k-value to interior k-value, termed the slab support ratio, was used to identify slabs which were not uniformly supported by foundation materials. This research concluded that for the test sections included, little or no evidence of poor support could be found. However, based on the limited data obtained, there were some indications of poor support due to base layer densification. As a result of this research investigation, the author recommends a more detailed study of certain test sections included in this study to better quantify the reasons for the indications of poor support. In addition, testing is recommended along other <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> test sections within Wisconsin to examine the impact of heavier trafficking on the quality of support provided by base layers of varying design...|$|R

50|$|Three main {{types of}} {{concrete}} pavements commonly used are Jointed plain <b>concrete</b> pavement (JPCP), <b>jointed</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> pavement (JRCP), and {{continuously reinforced concrete}} pavements (CRCP). JPCP’s are constructed with contraction joints which direct the natural cracking of the pavement. These pavements do not use any reinforcing steel. JRCP’s are constructed with both contraction joints and reinforcing steel to control the cracking of the pavement. High temperatures and moisture stresses within the pavement creates cracking, which the reinforcing steel holds tightly together. At transverse joints, dowel bars are typically placed to assist with transferring the load of the vehicle across the cracking. CRCP’s solely rely on continuous reinforcing steel to hold the pavement’s natural transverse cracks together. Prestressed concrete pavements have also {{been used in the}} construction of highways; however, they are not as common as the other three.

40|$|Timber has {{experienced}} renewed interests as a sustainable building material in recent times. Although traditionally {{it has been}} the prime choice for residential construction in New Zealand and some other parts of the world, its use can be increased significantly in the future through a wider range of applications, particularly when adopting engineered wood material, Research has been started on the development of innovative solutions for multi-storey non-residential timber buildings in recent years and this study is part of that initiative. Application of timber in commercial and office spaces posed some challenges with requirements of large column-free spaces. The current construction practice with timber is not properly suited for structures with the aforementioned required characteristics and new type of structures has to be developed for this type of applications. Any new structural system has to have adequate capacity for carry the gravity and lateral loads due to occupancy and the environmental effects. Along with wind loading, one of the major sources of lateral loads is earthquakes. New Zealand, being located in a seismically active region, has significant risk of earthquake hazard specially in the central region of the country and any structure has be designed for the seismic loading appropriate for the locality. There have been some significant developments in precast concrete in terms of solutions for earthquake resistant structures in the last decade. The “Hybrid” concept combining post-tensioning and energy dissipating elements with structural members has been introduced in the late 1990 s by the precast concrete industry to achieve moment-resistant connections based on dry jointed ductile connections. Recent research at the University of Canterbury has shown that the concept can be adopted for timber for similar applications. Hybrid timber frames using post-tensioned beams and dissipaters have the potential to allow longer spans and smaller cross sections than other forms of solid timber frames. Buildings with post-tensioned frames and walls can have larger column-free spaces which is a particular advantage for non-residential applications. While other researchers are focusing on whole structural systems, this research concentrated on the analysis and design of individual members and connections between members or between member and foundation. This thesis extends existing knowledge on the seismic behaviour and response of post-tensioned single walls, columns under uni-direction loads and small scale beam-column joint connections into the response and design of post-tensioned coupled walls, columns under bi-directional loading and full-scale beam-column joints, as well as to generate further insight into practical applications of the design concept for subassemblies. Extensive experimental investigation of walls, column and beam-column joints provided valuable confirmation of the satisfactory performance of these systems. In general, they all exhibited almost complete re-centering capacity and significant energy dissipation, without resulting into structural damage. The different configurations tested also demonstrated the flexibility in design and possibilities for applications in practical structures. Based on the experimental results, numerical models were developed and refined from previous literature in precast <b>concrete</b> <b>jointed</b> ductile connections to predict the behaviour of post-tensioned timber subassemblies. The calibrated models also suggest the values of relevant parameters for applications in further analysis and design. Section analyses involving those parameters are performed to develop procedures to calculate moment capacities of the subassemblies. The typical features and geometric configurations the different types of subassemblies are similar with the only major difference in the connection interfaces. With adoption of appropriate values representing the corresponding connection interface and incorporation of the details of geometry and configurations, moment capacities of all the subassemblies can be calculated with the same scheme. That is found to be true for both post-tensioned-only and hybrid specimens and also applied for both uni-directional and bi-directional loading. The common section analysis and moment capacity calculation procedure is applied in the general design approach for subassemblies...|$|R
40|$|A thin overlay 1 -inch thick {{was placed}} as a surface layer on the <b>jointed</b> <b>concrete</b> {{pavement}} on Business 59 in the Lufkin District. This mix was {{designed in the}} laboratory to have a balance of good rut resistance as measured by TxDOT’s Hamburg Wheel Tracking test (HWTT) and good reflection cracking resistance {{as measured by the}} Overlay Tester (OT). These Crack Attenuating Mixes (CAM) were designed and constructed based on TxDOT’s special specification SS 3109. A top quality granite aggregate was used with 1 percent lime and an asphalt content of 8. 3 percent with a PG 76 - 22 binder. This project was tested with both Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and the Rolling Dynamic Deflectometer (RDD). One area of poor load transfer efficiency (LTE) was noted. The overlay was placed in the summer of 2008. Performance to date has been good. After 1 year some low severity reflection cracks were found in the location where the RDD found poor LTE, and some additional low severity longitudinal cracks were found in one location where the longitudinal joint was directly in the wheel path. The one area of concern with this mi...|$|R
40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been observed}} {{in the last decade}} in seismic engineering with further refinements of performance-based seismic design philosophies and definition of corresponding compliance criteria. Following the worldwide recognized expectation and ideal aim to provide a modern society with high seismic performance structures, able to sustain a design level earthquake with limited or negligible damage, emerging solutions have been developed for high-performance, still cost-effective, seismic resisting systems, based on adequate combination of traditional materials and available technology. In this paper, an overview of recent developments and on-going research on precast <b>concrete</b> buildings with <b>jointed</b> ductile connections, relying on the use of unbonded post-tensioned tendons with self-centering capabilities, is given. A critical discussion on the conceptual behavior, design criteria and modeling aspects is carried out along with an update on current trends in major international seismic code provisions to incorporate these emerging systems. Examples of existing on site applications based on a recently developed cable-stayed and suspended solution for frame systems are provided as further confirmation of the easy constructability and speed of erection of the overall system.
