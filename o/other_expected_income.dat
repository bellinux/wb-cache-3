We claim that poorer individuals are safer borrowers because they place more value on {{the relationship with the}} bank. We study the dynamics of a monopolistic bank granting loans and taking deposits from overlapping generations of entrepreneurs with different levels of <b>expected</b> <b>income.</b> Matching the evidence of the Grameen Bank we show that a bank will focus on individuals with lower <b>expected</b> <b>income,</b> and will not disburse dividends until it reaches all the potential borrowers. We find empirical support for our theoretical results using data from a household survey from Bangladesh. We show that various measures of <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> are positively and significantly correlated with default probabilities...|$|R

During the reforms in 1990, majority insider privatization ensured workers took control of firms. The following condition had to be satisfied before workers would vote for restructuring, rVN ≤ λrVR +(1 -λ) rVU. The <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> stream for a worker, ex-post restructuring, {{must be at least}} as great as the current income stream in the non-restructured state, rVN. A worker is given a probability λ of remaining in the restructured firm, earning an income stream of rVR, and a probability (1 -λ) of becoming unemployed with an <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> stream of rVU. The <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> stream after restructuring must compensate the worker for the risk of becoming unemployed and for the forgone <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> stream from the non-restructured state. One can write down the <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> stream {{in the event of a}} flow into unemployment, rVU, and the <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> stream for a worker in the non-restructured state, rVN. The minimum ex-post income stream, rVR, necessary to induce an ex-ante vote for restructuring can be expressed as rVR = rVU + c/λ. Workers require a premium for exposing themselves to the risk of becoming unemployed during the restructuring process, as 0 < λ < 1. With endogenous restructuring, annual layoff and hiring rates in restructured enterprises, can fuel wage pressure over an above that created by exogenous government control of restructuring where λ = 1 [...].|$|R

Our model shows that greater supply uncertainty reduces the <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> from vertical FDI but increases the <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> from horizontal FDI. Greater demand uncertainty adversely affects the <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> under both production modes. Uncertainty about predatory actions by the host country is more costly to the multinational under vertical than under the horizontal mode. We examine sales by foreign affiliates of U.

Conditioning on host-country characteristics thought to influence FDI, we find evidence that volatility and sovereign risk have a greater negative impact on vertical FDI than on horizontal FDI.

40|$|I derive a {{function}} to represent how consumers discount {{the value of}} future resources, {{a function}} which depends on the amount (state) of presently available resources (wealth) relative to <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> in the long-run future. When presently available resources are scarce {{in the sense that}} consumers are borrowing constrained, this discount function approaches zero, implying that we put zero weight on the value of future resources and are concerned entirely about having sufficient resources for the present. When the amount of presently available resources relative to <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> is ample, this discount function approaches or approximates a constant future discount factor in a timeseparable expected utility function. The wealth-dependent discount function is positively related to aversion of future risks in consumption resources at low and moderate levels of risk aversion, so that we are predicted to discount future resources less as we become more risk averse.

Two groups of household samples regarding land holding types are: 1) paddy and upland arable land, and 2) upland arable land only. The time series data of crop prices in crop year 2003 / 04 - 2008 / 09 were used. The data of crop production obtained from the research project entitled Village and Regional Model for Sustainability of Highland Agricultural Systems in Northern Thailand in Year 2005 were also used in the analysis. The optimal production plans considering price risk were analyzed through the risk programming model called MOTAD (Minimization of the Total Absolute Deviation). The results suggest various optimal production plans {{with respect to the}} individual farmers’ <b>expected</b> <b>income</b> levels.
