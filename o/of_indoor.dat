5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots <b>of</b> <b>indoor</b> lacrosse are obscure, but its invention {{has been attributed to}} one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} raised {{criticism}} against several fundamental shortcomings in the network system. The most fundamental is the lack <b>of</b> <b>indoor</b> coverage. This has in part been reversed by increasing the signal strength in urban areas and installing repeaters at for instance medical clinics, Oslo Courthouse and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Other shortcomings are that the location of base stations are publicly know, allowing for easy sabotage and increased investment costs because of {{the choice of the}} proprietary TEDS instead of the open ETSI system.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma has {{teams in}} several minor leagues, {{including}} Minor League Baseball at the AAA and AA levels (Oklahoma City Dodgers and Tulsa Drillers, respectively), hockey's ECHL with the Tulsa Oilers, {{and a number}} <b>of</b> <b>indoor</b> football leagues. In the last-named sport, the state's most notable team was the Tulsa Talons, which played in the Arena Football League until 2012, when the team was moved to San Antonio. The Oklahoma Defenders replaced the Talons as Tulsa's only professional arena football team, playing the CPIFL. The Oklahoma City Blue, of the NBA G League, relocated to Oklahoma City from Tulsa in 2014, where they were {{formerly known as the}} Tulsa 66ers. Tulsa is the base for the Tulsa Revolution, which plays in the American Indoor Soccer League. Enid and Lawton host professional basketball teams in the USBL and the CBA.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} major {{international}} competition for {{track and field}} are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms <b>of</b> <b>indoor</b> track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics has been held every two years since 1985 {{and this is the}} only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} the Eton coach, Hirst also worked with young Yorkshire players during the school holidays, and {{maintained}} his coaching connection with the county until shortly before his death. Despite {{the differences in the}} backgrounds of the players, Hirst was equally respected at Eton and when he acted as a coach to the Yorkshire team. At Yorkshire Hirst worked with young players in the cricket nets at Headingley, took charge <b>of</b> <b>indoor</b> trials during the winter, and travelled with the team as coach on a tour to Jamaica in 1936. Many Yorkshire players, with vastly differing temperaments, came under his influence and improved as players. One of Hirst's most notable achievements as a coach was improving the bowling of George Macaulay {{to the point where he}} became a key member of the Yorkshire team.|$|E

5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists <b>of</b> <b>indoor</b> sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. Underfloor heating in the cages and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E
