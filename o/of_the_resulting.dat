For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.|$|E
5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E

5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it eliminates the subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, provided as a nutritional supplement for livestock, consumes {{a large portion}} of available iodine. Another significant use is a catalyst for the {{production of}} acetic acid by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. In these technologies, which support the world's demand for acetic acid, hydroiodic acid converts the methanol feedstock into methyl iodide, which undergoes carbonylation. Hydrolysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> acetyl iodide regenerates hydroiodic acid and gives acetic acid.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1940, Himmler {{opened up}} Waffen-SS {{recruiting}} to ethnic Germans {{that were not}} German citizens. In March 1941, the SS Main Office established the Germanische Leitstelle (Germanic Guidance Office) to establish Waffen-SS recruiting offices in Nazi-occupied Europe. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> foreign Waffen-SS units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix Waffen instead of SS. Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions, the SS-Wiking and SS-Nordland. Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the SS-Nederland legion, and their Walloon compatriots joined the SS-Wallonien. By the end of 1943 {{about a quarter of}} the SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe, and by June 1944, half the Waffen-SS were foreign nationals.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the condition represents a state of heightened sensitivity to antigenic stimuli, with cross-reactivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> cell-mediated immune response with cells of the epithelium. Some hypothesize that aphthous stomatitis is caused by expression of HLA class II antigens along with the normally found HLA class I antigens in epithelial cells, which results in them being recognized by the immune system as foreign cells rather than self. Various antigenic triggers have been implicated as a trigger, including L forms of streptococci, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus.|$|E
5|$|Later in the advance, Maxwell learnt from an English-speaking {{prisoner}} that a {{group of}} Germans in the adjacent post wished to surrender, but were afraid to give themselves up. Accompanied by two privates and the prisoner—who was to act as an interpreter—Maxwell approached the post. The three Australians, however, were immediately surrounded by a group of twenty German soldiers and disarmed. They seemed set to become prisoners themselves, before an artillery barrage fell on the position. Taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> confusion, Maxwell pulled out a concealed revolver and shot two of the Germans before escaping with his men under heavy rifle fire; one of the privates was subsequently wounded. Organising a party of men, he immediately attacked and captured the post.|$|E
