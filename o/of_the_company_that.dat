5|$|In September 1966, a {{friendly}} {{takeover of the}} Bradford brewers J. Hey & Company Ltd added 73 public houses to their estate. Webster's had a market value of £3.3million, and J. Hey had a value of £1million. The combined group had assets of over £4.5million (£65million in 2010 prices). Webster's continued to bottle Guinness under their Hey & Humphries subsidiary label into the late 1980s. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, consolidation, a good product and successful marketing made the company successful, according to The Times, with the social club trade accounted for around half of turnover. By 1967 Watney Mann owned 18.4 per cent of the company, and Webster's had a market capitalisation of £6million (£85million in 2010 prices) and owned 320 public houses and 12 off licences. Watney Mann had gradually increased their share to 27.1 per cent by 1972 when it initiated a takeover {{of the rest of}} the company. Samuel Webster & Sons was offered £18million for the 73 per cent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>that</b> Watney did not already own. The Watney Mann offer valued the entire company at almost £250million in 2010 prices. The takeover was {{a friendly}} one, and dependent upon the agreement of the Webster family, who owned 20 per cent of the company. Watney Mann was motivated by an increase to their tied estate. Following the takeover, Webster's continued as a regional subsidiary of the Watney Mann brewing empire, responsible for Yorkshire, Humberside, north Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire. The takeover saw heavy investment in the brewery and the Webster's brands enjoyed increased distribution nationally. That same year, Watney Mann itself was taken over by Grand Metropolitan.|$|E

40|$|Timely {{financial}} reporting {{is an essential}} ingredient for a well-functioning capital market. <b>The</b> objectives <b>of</b> this study are two-fold.

This study reports on <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> an empirical investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timeliness <b>of</b> financial reports by 211 non-financial <b>companies</b> listed on <b>the</b> Istanbul Stock Exchange. The descriptive analysis indicates <b>that</b> 59 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> prepares separate financial statements and 66 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> prepares consolidated financial statements release their financial statements less than the maximum time allowed after the financial yearend. 28 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> prepares separate financial statements and 16 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> prepares consolidated financial statements exceeded the regulatory deadline. The multivariate regression analysis indicates that both sign of income, audit opinion, auditor firm and industry affect timeliness. The findings indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>that</b> report net income, that have standard audit opinion, and that are operating in manufacturing industry release their financial statements earlier.

An Establishment Unit was created in March 1988, {{under the auspices of}} the Local Government Act 1974, to manage the transition of the Board to a commercial entity.
