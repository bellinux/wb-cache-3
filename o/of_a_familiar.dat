5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E

Their parents likely prefer it, and the availability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> job increases, but that is not enough. The convincing requirement for the student-athlete is whether their summer baseball experience will be top-notch. If Mahrt and Clites could make the domestic product equal or better than anywhere else, people would willingly come back home.|$|E

25|$|Constantine briefly {{transports}} {{himself to}} Hell through the possession <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> and sees Isabel damned to eternally relive her suicide. He briefs his findings to Angela. He explains {{to her that}} he was born with the power to see {{the true nature of the}} half-breeds. He attempted suicide to escape his visions, but was saved by paramedics. However, for the sin of attempting to take his own life, his soul is condemned for Hell. The two examine Isabel's room in the hospital and find a clue pointing to a prophecy in the Satanic Bible that Lucifer's son, Mammon, will attempt to claim Earth as his own kingdom. To do so, Mammon requires both a powerful psychic and assistance from God.|$|E
500|$|The third type of {{disorder}} discussed by Boris and Zeanah is termed [...] "disrupted attachment". This type of problem, {{which is not}} covered under other approaches to disordered attachment, results from an abrupt separation or loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> caregiver to whom attachment has developed. The young child's reaction to such a loss {{is parallel to the}} grief reaction of an older person, with progressive changes from protest (crying and searching) to despair, sadness, and withdrawal from communication or play, and finally detachment from the original relationship and recovery of social and play activities.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the general}} public, the parity of zero {{can be a}} source of confusion. In {{reaction}} time experiments, most people are slower to identify 0 as even than 2, 4, 6, or 8. Some students of mathematics—and some teachers—think that zero is odd, or both even and odd, or neither. Researchers in mathematics education propose that these misconceptions can become learning opportunities. Studying equalities like [...] can address students' doubts about calling 0 a number and using it in arithmetic. Class discussions can lead students to appreciate the basic principles of mathematical reasoning, such as the importance of definitions. Evaluating the parity of this exceptional number is an early example of a pervasive theme in mathematics: the abstraction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> concept to an unfamiliar setting.|$|E

500|$|Slants Nick Schager reacted negatively, stating [...] "Cowboys & Aliens mashes up genres with {{a staunch}} {{dedication}} to getting everything wrong, {{making sure that}} each scene is more inane {{than the one that}} preceded it"; giving the film one star out of four. Schager continued [...] "Cowboys & Alienss western accoutrements are [...] so false as to be stunning, with every steely-eyed glare from Craig's Man With No Memory, every confrontation between his Jake and Ford's grizzled Dolarhyde, and every silhouetted horseback ride across a sunset range seeming like a wan approximation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> genre staple. [...] Favreau's visuals have an inauthentic and bland blockbuster sheen, and his actors are similarly afflicted with a case of poseur-itis (Craig's affected silent-type glowering, Ford's gruff racism, or Wilde's blank, wide-eyed stares), failing to deliver a single believable line-reading or gesture." ...|$|E
500|$|Drax is {{physically}} abnormal, as {{are many of}} Bond's later adversaries. He has very broad shoulders, a large head and protruding teeth with diastema; his face is badly scarred from a wartime explosion. According to the writers Kingsley Amis and Benson—both of whom subsequently wrote Bond novels—Drax is the most successful villain in the Bond canon. Amis considers this to be [...] "because the most imagination and energy has gone into his portrayal. He lives in the real world... his physical presence fills Moonraker. The view is shared by Chancellor, who considers Drax [...] "perhaps the most believable" [...] of all Fleming's villains. The cultural historian Jeremy Black writes that as with Le Chiffre and Mr Big—the villains {{of the first two}} Bond novels—Drax's origins and war history are vital {{to an understanding of the}} character. Like several other antagonists in the Bond canon, Drax was German, reminding readers <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> threat in 1950s Britain. Because Drax is without a girlfriend or wife he is, according to the norms of Fleming and his works, abnormal in Bond's world.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{successes in}} Europe A Child of Our Time {{did not reach}} the United States until 1965, when it was {{performed}} during the [...] Aspen Music Festival, with the composer [...] present. In his memoirs Tippett [...] mentions another performance on that American tour, at a women's college in Baltimore, in which the male chorus and soloists were black Catholic ordinands from a local seminary. The first significant American presentations of the work came a decade later: at Cleveland in 1977 where Prince Charles, who was visiting, delayed his departure {{so that he could}} attend, and at Carnegie Hall, New York, where Colin Davis conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Festival Chorus. Reviewing this performance for The New York Times, Donal Henahan was unconvinced that the work's [...] "sincerity and unimpeachable intentions add up to important music". The spirituals were sung with passion and fervour, but the rest was [...] "reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> pious sermon" [...] in which the words were only intermittently intelligible. Meanwhile, the work had achieved its African debut, where in 1975 Tippett observed a performance with an improvised orchestra which incorporated the Zambian Police Band. The Zambian president, Kenneth Kaunda, was present, and entertained the composer afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|To {{maintain}} a philosophical balance, {{the argument for}} [...] "raw feels" [...] needs to be set {{side by side with}} the claim above. Viewing sensations as [...] "raw feels" [...] implies that initially they have not yet—to carry on the metaphor—been [...] "cooked", that is, unified into [...] "things" [...] and [...] "persons", which is something the mind does after the sensation has responded to the blank input, that response driven by motivation, that is, initially by pain and pleasure, and subsequently, when memories have been implanted, by desire and fear. Such a [...] "raw-feel" [...] state has been more formally identified as [...] "non-epistemic". In support of this view, the theorists cite a range of empirical facts. The following can be taken as representative. There are brain-damaged persons, known as [...] "agnosics" [...] (literally [...] "not-knowing") who still have vivid visual sensations but are quite unable to identify any entity before them, including parts of their own body. There is also the similar predicament of persons, formerly blind, who are given sight for the first time—and consider what it is a newborn baby must experience. A German psychologist of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz, proposed a simple experiment to demonstrate the non-epistemic nature of qualia: his instructions were to stand in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>familiar</b> landscape, turn your back on it, bend down and look at the landscape between your legs—you will find it difficult in the upside-down view to recognize what you found familiar before.|$|E
