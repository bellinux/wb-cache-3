5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer (born Jacob Liebmann Beer; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864) was a German opera {{composer}} of Jewish birth who {{has been}} described as perhaps the most successful stage composer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century. With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera 'decisive character'. Meyerbeer's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugène Scribe and were enhanced by the up-to-date theatre technology of the Paris Opéra. They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century, {{the works of}} Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France.

5|$|By 1882, Castle {{contained}} some 79 undergraduates out of 205 at {{the university}} as a whole.

Quite a few had more complicated bud-shaped domes, whose form derived from Baroque models of the late seventeenth century. Pear-shaped domes are usually associated with Ukrainian Baroque, while cone-shaped domes are typical for Orthodox churches of Transcaucasia.|$|E

5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts of the parish, the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population of the parish grew.

In the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nineteenth</b> century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E
