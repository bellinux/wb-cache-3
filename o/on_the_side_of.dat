5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller craters, {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary craters.

5|$|A call {{like this}} might be a bit ambiguous, but it was unsettling to those who were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the status quo.

Goldfaden and his troupe were left adrift in Saint Petersburg. They headed various directions, some to England, some to New York City, some to Poland, some to Romania.|$|E

5|$|According to Schwarz et al., seven traits unite K. langenbergensis and K. guimarotae, and {{separate}} them from other species referred to Theriosuchus. These include {{the presence of}} only two unique tooth morphotypes; the choanae being placed in shallow grooves rather than a bowl-like depression; the relatively wide top of the skull; the presence of antorbital and mandibular fenestrae in all life stages; and the relatively limited contact between the lacrimal and nasal. Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs from other species in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and {{the front of the}} squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
5|$|After Romania {{joined the}} war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Triple Entente in August and was quickly overrun by the Central Powers, the Russian {{efforts in the}} Black Sea {{in the second half}} of 1916 were focused in the west. Because German {{submarines}} never really accomplished all that much in the Black Sea, the February 1917 resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare led the Germans to temporarily abandon the Black Sea in lieu of the more target-rich Mediterranean. UB-14s whereabouts and activities during the latter half of 1916 and the first few months of 1917 are unreported in sources.|$|E
5|$|After the war Wiśniowiecki {{engaged in}} a number of {{conflicts}} with neighbouring magnates and nobles. Jeremi was able to afford a sizable private army of several thousands, and through the threat of it he was often able to force his neighbours to a favourable settlement of disputes. Soon after his return from the Russian front, he participated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of Dowmontów against another magnate, Samuel Łaszcz, located on his lands; soon after the victorious battle against Łaszcz he bought the lands from the Dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} video surfaced {{online in}} late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love {{interest in the}} original version. It begins {{with a view of}} the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the road and scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Another {{arm of the}} {{conspiracy}} was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East, while efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Central Powers, which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan {{that was at the}} time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E
