6000|$|Righteous wrath flamed {{hot in the}} ranger's breast. [...] "You {{keep your}} fist <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> or I'll smash your jaw," [...] he answered, and his voice was husky with passion. [...] "Get out of my way!"

60|$|Lord Lumley {{thanked her}} with a look, and took her hand. They stood {{together}} on the hearthrug, and I {{was on the other}} side facing the window. Suddenly my heart gave a great leap, and the color died <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Pressed against the dark pane I could see a pale, white face watching us. It was the face of my uncle, Count di Marioni.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do ye not speak, man?" [...] he said again; and I {{turned my}} eyes on him, looking as pitifully as might be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> blood-bedabbled <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|He held up {{his hands}} for a moment, as though to shut <b>out</b> the sight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> ablaze with scorn and hatred. There was a short silence. Then he spoke in a low tone, {{vibrating}} with intensity of feeling.|$|R

60|$|So they talked, meaning very well, and {{by and by}} {{it struck}} one o'clock. A cold shiver passed through me, and Marriot jumped from his chair.

Whatever my {{feelings}} were {{up to this point}} I had kept them <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> but I suppose a change came over me now.

6000|$|The {{sequel to}} this {{communication}} was that as {{early on the}} morrow as I dared I drove straight to Mr. Vereker's door. He occupied in those years one of the honest old houses in Kensington Square. He received me immediately, {{and as soon as}} I came in I saw I hadn't lost my power to minister to his mirth. He laughed <b>out</b> at sight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> which doubtless expressed my perturbation. I had been indiscreet--my compunction was great. [...] "I HAVE told somebody," [...] I panted, [...] "and I'm sure that person will by this time have told somebody else! It's a woman, into the bargain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was almost}} stunned; but I heard a scream from Marie, {{a storm of}} angry words from Kaldhein, and I felt sure {{he was about to}} inflict further injury. He was a much {{stronger}} man than I was, and probably was armed. With a sudden instinct of self-preservation I rolled down a little declivity on the edge of which I had fallen, and staggering to my feet, plunged into a thicket and fled. Even had I been in the full possession <b>of</b> <b>my</b> senses, I knew that under the circumstances I would have been of no benefit to Marie had I remained upon the scene. The last thing I heard was a shout from Kaldhein, in which he declared that he would kill me yet. For some days I did not go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> castle. <b>My</b> <b>face</b> was bruised, <b>my</b> soul was dejected. I knew there was no possible chance that I should meet Marie, and that there was a chance that I might meet the angry Colonel. An altercation at this time would be very annoying and painful to the lady, no matter what the result, and I considered it my duty to do everything that was possible to avoid a meeting with Kaldhein. Therefore, as I have said, I shut myself up within the walls of old Wulrick, and gave strict orders to my servants to admit no one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes sir, I have. From {{the time}} I {{found the first}} spring at Christmas, I have never ceased looking for another one. I had felt every knob on the {{fireplace}} and chimneypiece, and every stone up the chimney as far as I could reach. You know, sir, {{it is only in}} the half hour I get of a morning by being up before the other servants that I can try; indeed I only have half that time, for I must get some of the shutters open and appear to have began to do something to account for my time. Well, sir, at last I really seemed to have tried everywhere, and I almost gave up all hope of finding it, although I had quite made up my mind to go on searching as long as I stayed there, even if it was for ten years. Well, sir, yesterday morning I quite got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> temper with the thing, and I sat down on the ground in the great fireplace quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> heart; <b>my</b> <b>face</b> was quite close to the great iron dogs, so I said, [...] "Drat you, you look for all the world as if you were putting out your long tongues at me;" [...] and I took hold of the tongue nearest to me, and gave it a twist, and do you know, sir, it quite gave me a turn to find that the tongue twisted round in my hand. I twisted and twisted till the tongue came out in my hand, then I touched the spring behind the mantel, but nothing moved; then I tried the tongue of the other dog, and that came out too; but still nothing moved. Just then I heard the cook moving in the kitchen, so I had to put the tongues back again and go to my work; but all day I hardly knew whether I stood on my head or my heels, I wanted so much to see whether anything would come of it. Well, miss, this morning I got up quite early, and unscrewed the dogs' tongues, and looked in the places they had come <b>out</b> <b>of,</b> but could not see anything. Then I pushed the sharp end of the tongue into the hole, and twisted and poked about, but I could not find anything moved; then I put that tongue in again, and tried the other, and directly I pushed the sharp end in, I felt something give way, and then I heard a click. I jumped up and pushed the knob in the chimney, and directly something creaked, and the whole of the left hand side of the fireplace swung open like a low door, about four feet high, and beyond it was a little flight of stone stairs. I was so excited, sir, when I saw the door and the steps, and knew I had found the place I had been looking for so long, that I had to lean against the wall to support myself. After a little while I pushed the door back again, and heard it close with a click. Then I screwed the tongue into the mouth again, and went about my work, but all day I have hardly known whether I stood upon my head or my heels." ...|$|R
60|$|Feb. 23, '65.--I saw a large {{procession}} {{of young men}} from the rebel army, (deserters they are call'd, but the usual {{meaning of the word}} does not apply to them,) passing the Avenue to-day. There were nearly 200, come up yesterday by boat from James river. I stood and watch'd them as they shuffled along, in a slow, tired, worn sort of way; a large proportion of light-hair'd, blonde, light gray-eyed young men among them. Their costumes had a dirt-stain'd uniformity; most had been originally gray; some had articles of our uniform, pants on one, vest or coat on another; I think they were mostly Georgia and North Carolina boys. They excited little or no attention. As I stood quite close to them, several good looking enough youths, (but O what a tale of misery their appearance told,) nodded or just spoke to me, without doubt divining pity and fatherliness <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> for my heart was full enough of it. Several of the couples trudg'd along with their arms about each other, some probably brothers, as if they were afraid they might somehow get separated. They nearly all look'd what one might call simple, yet intelligent, too. Some had pieces of old carpet, some blankets, and others old bags around their shoulders. Some of them here and there had fine faces, still it was a {{procession of}} misery. The two hundred had with them about half a dozen arm'd guards. Along this week I saw some such procession, more or less in numbers, every day, as they were brought up by the boat. The government does what it can for them, and sends them north and west.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am an Injin," [...] said Bough of the Oak; [...] "my {{father was}} an Injin, {{and my mother was}} the {{daughter}} of an Injin. All my fathers were red men, and all their sons. Why should I wish to be anything else? I asked my brother, the medicine-priest, and he owned that Jews are pale- faces. This he should not have owned if he wished the Injins to be Jews. My skin is red. The Manitou of my fathers so painted it, and their child will not try to wash out the color. Were the color washed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> I should be a pale-face! There would not be paint enough to hide my shame. No; I was born red, and will die a red man. It is not good to have two faces. An Injin is not a snake, to cast his skin. The skin in which he was born he keeps. He plays in it when a child; he goes in it to his first hunt; the bears and the deer know him by it; he carries it with him on the warpath, and his enemies tremble at the sight of it; his squaw knows him by that skin when he comes back to his wigwam; and when he dies, he is put aside in the same skin in--which he was born. There is but one skin, and it has but one color. At first, it is little. The pappoose that wears it is little. There is not need of a large skin. But it grows with the pappoose, and the biggest warrior finds his skin around him. This is because the Great Spirit fitted it to him. Whatever the Manitou does is good.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his high}} school days, Isaac was {{previously}} involved in two punk bands and lived a straight-edge lifestyle. Grammy winning producer T-Bone Burnett, who worked with the Coen brothers on O Brother, Where Art Thou? said of Isaac, [...] "I haven't worked with an actor who could play and sing this style of music this well," [...] admits Burnett. [...] "You can't do it with bluster; {{you have to do}} it with the rawest honesty you can." [...] Isaac also developed a style of finger-picking that Burnett explains is [...] "a little bit like patting your head and rubbing someone else's stomach — in another country." [...] Isaac described his audition process thus: [...] "I first auditioned for the casting director, did a few scenes. Then I went home and recorded myself playing [...] "Hang Me." [...] That got sent to the Coens. Then I came in and auditioned for them, learned a few extra songs just in case. They sent that over to T Bone. And T Bone said, a famous line from The Producers 'I think we've found our Hitler!'" [...] Oscar Isaac [...] "was the opposite of what Coen brothers had initially been looking for: a classically trained actor. But he could also sing and play guitar." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Isaac further noted, [...] "Well, I knew that it was loosely based on Dave Van Ronk his memoir The Mayor of MacDougal Street, and he was like a six-foot-five, 250 pound Swede. So I came in, and out of the corner of my eye I saw a photograph of a very well-known musician - and I was encouraged because it was a guy who was a little smaller and a dark haired and had a beard. I was like, [...] "So you guys have that picture as kind of a reference?" [...] And they're like, [...] "Oh yeah. He came in. He killed it." [...] The blood just drained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> But then I did the audition and it went well and they called me back." [...] He also describes being influenced by Erik Franzen, an old friend of Dave Van Ronk's, who Davis says [...] "started teaching me this Travis-style picking, which I was not aware of - didn't know how to do it. It's this crazy syncopation. We'd play and I paid him for lessons and then we started playing in the Village. I opened for him a couple times at these open mics. He was like a trainer - the last day before the audition I played for him and then he looked at me and goes [...] "I see the big guy behind you giving the thumb's up." ...|$|E
