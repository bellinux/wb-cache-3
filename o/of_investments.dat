The article reveals that the growth <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital of the North in the post-crisis period {{is provided by the}} regions, carrying out major investment in oil and gas pipeline transport, oil extraction, production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. The changes in the sectoral structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital of the Northern regions are barely visible; the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in the traded sector is still high, especially in mining, due to the Northern regions’ specialization in the extractive industries. The share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in the public sector and social services remains low. The specific structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital has changed: the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in buildings (excluding housing) and structures has increased greatly; the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles has decreased due to insufficient investment in mining enterprises and financial shortages in manufacturing. In most regions the structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital by directions is characterized by the increase in the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles in new construction, investment in buildings and structures and the decline in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles modernization and reconstruction and acquisition of new fixed assets.

5|$|The {{enormous}} amount of public revenue created by the pipeline provoked debates {{about what to do}} with the windfall. The record $900 million created by the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale took place at a time when the entire state budget was less than $118 million, yet the entire amount created by the sale was used up by 1975. Taxes on the pipeline and oil carried by it promised to bring even more money into state coffers. To ensure that oil revenue wasn't spent as it came in, the Alaska Legislature and governor Jay Hammond proposed the creation of an Alaska Permanent Fund—a long-term savings account for the state. This measure required a constitutional amendment, which was duly passed in November 1976. The amendment requires at least 25 percent of mineral extraction revenue to be deposited in the Permanent Fund. On February 28, 1977, the first deposit—$734,000—was put into the Permanent Fund. That deposit and subsequent ones were invested entirely in bonds, but debates quickly arose about the style <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> and what they should be used for.|$|E
