5|$|The initial {{response}} to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued {{when it was clear}} that Louis VII of France would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> Quantum Praedecessores. In any case, Abbot Suger and other nobles were not in favour of Louis' plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted Bernard of Clairvaux, who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis' crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton {{approached}} Depp and [...] "within 10 minutes <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> the project, I was committed," [...] {{the actor}} remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, {{it gave him}} a [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. To get a handle on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E
500|$|U2's first {{ideas for}} Zoo TV {{emerged during the}} Lovetown Tour in 1989, when various aspects of radio {{programming}} intrigued the group, particularly the large radio audience their Dublin concerts reached. The wild antics of [...] "morning zoo" [...] radio programmes inspired the band to consider taking a pirate radio station on tour. They were also interested in using video {{as a way of}} making themselves less accessible to their audiences. The band developed these ideas in late 1990 while recording Achtung Baby in Berlin at Hansa Studios. While in Berlin, they watched television coverage of the Gulf War on Sky News, which was the only English programming available. When they became tired <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> the conflict, they tuned into local programming to see [...] "bad German soap operas" [...] and automobile advertisements. The band believed that cable television had blurred the lines between news, entertainment, and home shopping over the previous decade, and they wanted to represent this on their next tour.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{thought it was a}} [...] "confident finale" [...] to the fifth season, which [...] "had seen the series become progressively more surreal and self-aware." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that he thought the episode ended the season with a [...] "high note", and that Homer’s insensitive gossiping about his relationship [...] "presents lots of good bits. It completes this excellent year well." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was [...] "This is a place of learning, not a house <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> things!", which Homer tells his class after they demand him to reveal more secrets about him and Marge. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A−, and commented that episodes focusing on the relationship between Homer and Marge can [...] "never fail", and there are [...] "numerous opportunities for some classic Homer-isms" [...] in the episode. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. One-time Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] his fifth favorite episode of the show, and commented that Homer's line to Marge, [...] "I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence," [...] is [...] "so sweet, because he's right!" [...] It was placed at number seven on MSNBCs top ten The Simpsons episodes list. They felt the episode embodied Homer's qualities of being [...] "stupid, good-natured and mildly pathetic, [...] from his conversations with his brain [...] to his final proclamation that the one thing he can give Marge that no one else can is 'complete and utter dependence'." ...|$|E

And that is that the American people are sick and tired <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> your damn emails!" [...] Sanders later clarified that he thought Clinton's emails were a [...] "very serious issue", but Americans want a discussion on issues that are [...] "real" [...] to them, such as paid family and medical leave, college affordability, and campaign finance reform.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, Depp {{reunited with}} {{director}} Tim Burton, playing {{the title role}} in Ed Wood, a biographical film about one of history's most inept film directors. Depp later stated {{that he was at}} the time depressed about films and filmmaking, but that [...] "within 10 minutes <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> the project, I was committed." [...] He found that the role gave him a [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun" [...] and that working with Martin Landau, who played Bela Lugosi, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Ed Wood received critical acclaim, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times writing that Depp had [...] "proved himself as an established, certified great actor" [...] and [...] "captured all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood going, thanks to an extremely funny ability to look at the silver lining of any cloud." [...] Depp was nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{reported}} that the gunman in the 2006 Dawson College shooting in Montreal, Quebec, Kimveer Singh Gill, was interested in goth subculture. Gill's self-professed love of Goth culture was the topic of media interest, and it was widely {{reported that}} the word [...] "Goth", in Gill's writings, was {{a reference to the}} alternative industrial and goth subculture rather than a reference to gothic rock music. Gill, who committed suicide after the attack, wrote in his online journal: [...] "I'm so sick <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> jocks and preps making life hard for the goths and others who look different, or are different". Gill described himself in his profile on Vampirefreaks.com as [...] "... Trench ... the Angel of Death" [...] and he stated that [...] "Metal and Goth kick ass". An image gallery on Gill's Vampirefreaks.com blog had photos of him pointing a gun at the camera or wearing a long black trench coat.|$|E
2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time.

2500|$|O'Neal {{became a}} free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic {{basketball}} team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning. 82% answered [...] "no". O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill. He said the team [...] "just didn't respect [...]" [...] Another question in the poll asked, [...] "Is Shaq worth $115million?" [...] in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer. 91.3% of the response was [...] "no". O'Neal's Olympic teammates rode him hard over the poll. He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry. O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to [...] "feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond." [...] O'Neal also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him. On the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, it was announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121million contract. He insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money. [...] "I'm tired <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>about</b> money, money, money, money, money", O'Neal said after the signing. [...] "I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok", he added, referring to a couple of his product endorsements. The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: [...] "It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough." ...|$|E
