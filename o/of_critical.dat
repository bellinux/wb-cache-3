By integrating criticals even on low results by varying the critical severity (from A (minor) - J (extreme)) and the large variety <b>of</b> <b>criticals</b> (e.g. Slash, Krush, Puncture, Heat, Cold, Electricity, Impact, Unarmed Strikes and even some bizarre ones such as Internal Disruption and Essence criticals) every combat plays out differently. Critical results vary from simple additional hits, and added bleeding and stuns to limbs lopped off and internal organs destroyed. Player characters are not immune to the effects <b>of</b> a <b>critical</b> hit in this system.|$|R
