25|$|There is some {{controversy}} over who exactly should {{take responsibility for}} coordinating {{the care of the}} dual eligibles. There have been some proposals to transfer dual eligibles into existing Medicaid managed care plans, which are controlled by individual states. But many states facing severe budget shortfalls might have some incentive to stint on necessary care or otherwise shift costs to enrollees and their families to capture some Medicaid savings. Medicare has more experience managing the care <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> and is already expanding coordinated care programs under the ACA, though there are some questions about private Medicare plans’ capacity to manage care and achieve meaningful cost savings.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} Medicare Managed Care (MMC) penetration and percentage <b>of</b> disability in <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> (individuals age 65 and older). Considering disability {{as an indicator of}} one or more unsuccessfully managed chronic diseases, this study investigates the assumption that managed care improves coordination of care, as well as access to preventive care. If managed care’s mandate is being met, then it should be evidenced in decreased prevalence <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> disability. METHOD: Taking an ecological approach, this study used data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ, 2003) to compare the percentage <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> disability in counties from 30 states and the District of Columbia with high and low MMC penetration. Covariates representing various aspects of community context were introduced into a final multivariate linear regression to examine whether MMC penetration {{was a significant predictor of}} countywide percent <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> disability. RESULTS: While MMC penetration was a significant predictor <b>of</b> prevalence <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> disability in a bivariate analysis (r=- 0. 197, p 3 ̆c. 001), it lost its significance in the final multivariate model. CONCLUSION: While this study does not demonstrate a relationship between MMC penetration and prevalence <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adult</b> disability, it is possible that MMC, once fully implemented under the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, could lead to reduced prevalence of disability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract What {{happens if}} you put assistive robots in the hands <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>adults?</b> Will they accept or reject the robot? If they accept the robot, in which ways will the robot change the {{everyday}} lives <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>adults?</b> <b>Old</b> <b>adults</b> have a lifetime of experience technological changes.

If domestic assistive robots are adopted and adapted by seniors, then these robots will affect and {{will be affected by}} the social interaction they meditate. In order to understand how robots might support seniors in the future an understanding of the meaning of domestic assistive robots in their social context is essential.

50|$|In an experiment, for a single-task walking, 24% <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> have gait speed <0.8 m/s {{but for a}} dual-task {{of walking}} and talking, 62% <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> have gait speed <0.8 m/s. In {{practical}} terms, this means that a large proportion <b>of</b> healthy community-dwelling <b>old</b> <b>adults</b> may not walk fast enough to safely cross the street while simultaneously having a conversation. These findings support the assertion that generating spontaneous speech is highly demanding on cognitive resources and suggest that real world dual-task effects on gait may be underestimated by reaction time tasks.|$|R
25|$|Disengagement {{theory is}} the idea that {{separation}} of older people from active roles in society is normal and appropriate, and benefits both society and older individuals. Disengagement theory, first proposed by Cumming and Henry, has received considerable attention in gerontology, but has been much criticised. The original data on which Cumming and Henry based the theory were from a rather small sample <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> in Kansas City and from this select sample Cumming and Henry then took disengagement to be a universal theory. There are research data suggesting that the elderly who do become detached from society are those who were initially reclusive individuals and such disengagement is not purely a response to ageing.|$|E
25|$|Occupational {{therapists}} {{work with}} older adults to maintain independence, participate in meaningful activities, and live fulfilling lives. Some examples of areas that occupational therapists address with older adults are driving, aging in place, low vision, and dementia or Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When addressing driving, driver evaluations are administered {{to determine if}} drivers are safe behind the wheel. To enable independence <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> at home, occupational therapists perform falls risk assessments, assess clients functioning in their homes, and recommend specific home modifications. When addressing low vision, occupational therapists modify tasks and the environment. While working with individuals with AD, occupational therapists focus on maintaining quality of life, ensuring safety, and promoting independence.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{observed}} {{the effects of}} volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults,</b> those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% {{of those who did}} not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.|$|E

2500|$|Age is {{the most}} {{dominant}} factor in hip fracture injuries, with most cases occurring in people over 75.

Falls are {{the most common cause of}} hip fractures, around 30-60% <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> fall each year. This increases the risk for hip fracture and leads to the increase risk of death in older individuals, the rate of one year mortality is seen from 12-37%. For those remaining patients who do not suffer from mortality, half of them need assistance and cannot live independently. Also, older adults sustain hip fractures because of osteoporosis, which is a degenerative disease due to age and decrease in bone mass. [...] The average age for suffering a hip fracture is 77 years old for women and 72 years old for men. This shows how closely age is related to hip fractures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} against early {{diagnosis and treatment}} {{is based on the}} logic that many small thyroid cancers (mostly papillary) will not grow or metastasize. This viewpoint holds the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed (that is, will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if nothing is ever done about the cancer). [...] Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers. [...] Thyroid cancer is incredibly common, with autopsy studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one-third <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults</b> technically have thyroid cancer, which is causing them no harm. [...] It is easy to detect nodules that might be cancerous, simply by feeling the throat, which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis. Benign (non-cancerous) nodules frequently co-exist with thyroid cancer; sometimes, it is a benign nodule that is discovered but surgery uncovers an incidental small thyroid cancer. Increasingly, small thyroid nodules are discovered as incidental findings on imaging (CT scan, MRI, ultrasound) performed for another purpose very few of these people with accidentally discovered, symptom-free thyroid cancers will ever have any symptoms, and treatment in such patients has the potential to cause harm to them, not to help them.|$|E

Relative to the Census 2000, all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years and older and 85 years and older.

2500|$|Advances in MRI {{technology}} {{have provided the}} ability to see the brain structure in great detail in an easy, non-invasive manner in vivo. Bartzokis et al., has noted that there is a decrease in grey matter volume between adulthood and old age, whereas white matter volume was found to increase from age 19-40, and decline after this age. Studies using Voxel-based morphometry have identified areas such as the insula and superior parietal gyri as being especially vulnerable to age-related losses in grey matter <b>of</b> <b>older</b> <b>adults.</b> Sowell et al., reported that the first 6 decades of an individual's life were correlated with the most rapid decreases in grey matter density, and this occurred over dorsal, frontal, and parietal lobes on both interhemispheric and lateral brain surfaces. It is also worth noting that areas such as the cingulate gyrus, and occipital cortex surrounding the calcarine sulcus appear exempt from this decrease in grey matter density over time. [...] Age effects on grey matter density in the posterior temporal cortex appear more predominantly in the left versus right hemisphere, and were confined to posterior language cortices. Certain language functions such as word retrieval and production were found to be located to more anterior language cortices, and deteriorate as a function of age. Sowell et al., also reported that these anterior language cortices were found to mature and decline earlier than the more posterior language cortices. It has also been found that the width of sulcus not only increases with age, but also with cognitive decline in the elderly.|$|E
