A análise e enquadramento do sector em Portugal, bem como a análise, ainda que {{superficial}} da procura, no sentido de se perceber o seu comportamento e as suas novas exigências, constitui a primeira parte da tese, onde se irá demonstrar que a procura turística é particularmente sensível aos problemas de segurança, higiene e saúde, influenciando negativamente as taxas de ocupação no sector hoteleiro. Deste modo, foram propostas algumas medidas baseadas naquelas tendências mundiais que podem contribuir para prevenir e melhorar a segurança, higiene e saúde no sector hoteleiro em Portugal. O facto de se constatar, que algumas daquelas ainda não são contempladas na lei nacional, foram feitas recomendações para o serem no futuro. O objectivo desta tese consiste em analisar as causas da não regulamentação dessas medidas, tendo em vista a que no futuro se proceda ao reforço de medidas legislativas e regulamentares destinadas ao sector nestas áreas, resultando assim, num aumento das suas taxas de ocupação. A metodologia utilizada foi o método do inquérito por entrevista/questionário. Apesar de só ter sido possível analisar, dicutir e retirar conclusões sobre os hoteís e hotéis-apartamentos do distrito de Aveiro, foram feitas sugestões no sentido de explorar este estudo num âmbito nacional e de inquirir os organismos oficiais do sector, como processo de aumentar a provável precisão de respostas ao problema levantado pelo investigador nesta tese.
