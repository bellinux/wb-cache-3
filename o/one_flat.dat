25|$|On 28 June, the {{authorities}} stated {{that there were}} known survivors from 106 of the tower's 129 flats; eighteen people among the occupants of these flats were reported as dead or missing presumed dead, whereas most of those killed {{were said to have}} been in the remaining 23 flats between the 11th and 23rd floors. Some people from lower floors may have tried to move up the building, and it is thought a number of people may have ended up in <b>one</b> <b>flat.</b> Some victims were identified from twenty-six 999 calls made from inside the 23 flats.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto <b>one</b> <b>flat</b> car left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used to stack and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added {{to the ends of the}} flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.|$|E

25|$|On 7 May 1798 the French made {{an attempt}} to capture the Marcou Islands. They sent a large {{flotilla}} of boats, including of 52 gun-brigs and flat-bottomed ones with troops), to mount the attack shortly before dawn. Lieutenant Charles Papp Price of Badger and Lieutenant Bourne of Sandfly mounted a successful defence during which the British destroyed {{a number of the}} attacking boats and captured and sent back <b>one</b> <b>flat</b> (landing craft). Price was in command of a battery of 17 guns - four 4, two 6, and six 24-pounder long guns, and three 24, and two 32-pounder carronades - on the West Island, while Bourne was in command of a battery on East Island that consisted of Sandflys 68-pounder carronades. Bourne fired shells in support of Price's battery, which entailed firing over West Island. The French fired some 80 bow guns of 18 to 36 pounders for over two hours, but Price lost only one man killed and four wounded. The French lost some nine boats and sustained a large number of casualties from an attacking force that numbered an estimated 6-7,000 men.|$|E
25|$|The third (or {{technically}} {{fourth or}} fifth) primary melody {{in a march}} is called the trio. The trio is described as the main melody of the march. It is often played legato style in a softer dynamic, and features woodwinds more than brass. Sousa often used clarinets and euphoniums in lower tenor register in his trios. The trio is the most contrasting section, often containing variations of motifs heard in the previous two strains. The trio melody is often repeated once at a softer dynamic, or not repeated at all and goes right to the next section. Generally, it is played quietly for the first (or second) playthrough, then the next has a piccolo playing over the trio melody, and in the final playthrough, it is loud. In almost all cases, the trio modulates to the subdominant key of the march, meaning <b>one</b> <b>flat</b> {{is added to the}} key signature. Again, this is for the purpose of contrast and makes the trio more memorable to the listener. The fact that the key is now flatter also offers a more relaxing feel for those trios with softer instrumentation. For marches starting in minor keys, the trio usually modulates to the relative major. This key is maintained {{to the end of the}} piece.|$|E

500|$|Shōhō and {{the rest}} of the Main Force were spotted by {{aircraft}} from Lexington at 1040. At this time, Shōhōs combat air patrol (CAP) consisted of two A5Ms and one A6M Zero. The first dive bomber attacks all missed and the CAP shot down one Dauntless after it had dropped its bomb. The second squadron of Dauntlesses followed shortly afterwards and they hit Shōhō twice with [...] bombs. These penetrated the ship's flight deck and burst inside her hangars, setting the fueled and armed aircraft there on fire. A minute later the Devastators of VT-2 began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship. They hit Shōhō five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power. In addition, the hits flooded both engine and boiler rooms. Yorktowns aircraft delivered the coup de grace with another eleven hits from 1000-pound bombs in addition to two more torpedo hits.

500|$|A soprano recitative, [...] "" [...] (Alas! that {{my faith}} is yet so weak), adopts a {{modified}} version of the chorale melody as the continuo line. Gardiner notes the [...] "uncompromising" [...] way of changing the normal order: the soprano, usually singing a chorale cantus firmus (firm song) to the continuo, expresses weakness and insecurity here, marked [...] "a battuta", while the firm foundation is the chorale in the bass, to which the text of stanza three, [...] "" [...] (Therefore, I will hope in God), could be imagined. Gardiner points out a detail: the word [...] "Zeichen" [...] (sign) [...] "is given expressive, symbolic expression, a diminished seventh chord assigned to that word … formed by all three 'signs", one sharp (F-sharp), <b>one</b> <b>flat</b> (E-flat) and one natural (C). As Eric Chafe concludes, since St John's Gospel is known as the Book of Signs, and since the tonal plan of Bach's St John Passion appears to have been conceived as a form of play on the three musical signs (ie sharp, flat and natural key areas) this important detail in the plan of Aus tiefer Not perhaps possesses a wider significance, relating it to Bach's tonal-allegorical procedures in general.|$|E

At this time, Shōhōs CAP consisted of two Mitsubishi A5M [...] "Claudes" [...] and one Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The dive bombers of VS-2 began their attack at 1110 as the three Japanese fighters attacked the Dauntlesses in their dive. None of the dive bombers hit Shōhō, which was maneuvering to avoid their bombs; one Dauntless was shot down by the Zero after it had pulled out of its dive; several other Dauntlesses were also damaged. The carrier launched three more Zeros immediately after this attack to reinforce its CAP. The Dauntlesses of VB-2 began their attack at 11:18 and they hit Shōhō twice with [...] bombs. These penetrated the ship's flight deck and burst inside her hangars, setting the fueled and armed aircraft there on fire. A minute later the Devastators of VT-2 began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship. They hit Shōhō five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power.

500|$|Returning to Australia in November 1949, Eaton became Deputy Director of Training at the Department of Air, Canberra, {{where he}} {{remained}} until 1951. Later that year, {{he was appointed}} Officer Commanding No.78 (Fighter) Wing at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales. He had reverted to a substantive rank of wing commander since leaving Japan, as the RAAF shrank dramatically with demobilisation and many senior officers lost the temporary or acting ranks they had gained in wartime. On 15September, he landed a Vampire jet fighter at Point Cook with <b>one</b> <b>flat</b> tyre and one wheel retracted, after its undercarriage had become jammed. The plane skidded off the runway but Eaton was able to walk away, reportedly remarking [...] "Well, I didn't wreck it". He married Josephine Rumbles at Toorak Presbyterian Church in Melbourne on 10May 1952; the couple later had a son and two daughters. Following Britain's request to the Australian government for a Commonwealth garrison in the Mediterranean, in July 1952 Eaton led No.78 Wing on deployment to RAF Hal Far near Valletta, Malta, where its combat squadrons, Nos.75 and 76, were equipped with leased Vampire FB9s. As the overseas posting was {{for a minimum of}} two years, his new bride and the families of other staff were permitted to make the journey as well. The Australian airmen participated in many NATO exercises while stationed at Malta, and one year took first and second place in the Middle Eastern Gunnery Contest for the [...] "Imshi" [...] Mason Cup. Promoted to the substantive rank of group captain on 1January 1953, Eaton was granted command of RAF Ta'Kali when the wing transferred there from Hal Far in June.|$|E

These penetrated the ship's flight deck and burst inside her hangars, setting the fuelled and armed aircraft there on fire. A minute later, the Devastators began dropping their torpedoes from both sides of the ship. They hit Shōhō five times and the damage from the hits knocked out her steering and power. In addition, the hits flooded both engine and boiler rooms. Yorktowns aircraft trailed those from Lexington, and the former's Dauntlesses began their attacks at 11:25, hitting Shōhō with another eleven 1,000-pound bombs by Japanese accounts and the carrier came to a complete stop. Yorktowns Devastators trailed the rest of her aircraft and attacked at 11:29. They claimed ten hits, although Japanese accounts acknowledge only two. As the Devastators were exiting the area, they were attacked by the CAP, but the Wildcats protecting the torpedo bombers shot down two A5Ms and an A6M Zero. Total American losses to all causes were three Dauntlesses. After his attack, Lieutenant Commander Robert E.
