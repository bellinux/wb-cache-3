5|$|A {{variety of}} events {{have been held}} at the CAB, as well as {{receiving}} distinguished visitors. As part of the festivities for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the Olympic torch was passed through the hands {{of members of the}} First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the CAB. It is also a tradition that funeral processions of past LDS Church presidents pass in front of the Church Administration Building. The building has hosted visitors including Michelle Obama and George W. Bush.|$|E

5|$|Privy Counsellors {{have the}} right to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the Sovereign's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates, a {{privilege}} which was shared with heirs apparent of those hereditary peers who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999, diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual, retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords, the Dean of Westminster, Peers of Ireland, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. While Privy Counsellors {{have the right}} to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the Sovereign's Throne they do so only as observers and are not allowed to participate in any of the workings of the House of Lords. Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised. A notable recent instance of the exercising of this privilege was used by the Prime Minister, Theresa May, who watched the opening of the debate of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Stowe's {{writings}} about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During {{a visit to}} his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of loud and exuberant cheers.|$|E
5|$|Within an hour, White {{called his}} wife {{from a nearby}} diner; she met him at a church and was {{with him as he}} turned himself in. Many left flowers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> City Hall, and that evening 25,000 to 40,000 formed a {{spontaneous}} candlelight march from Castro Street to City Hall. The next day, the bodies of Moscone and Milk were brought to the City Hall rotunda where mourners paid their respects. Six thousand mourners attended a service for Mayor Moscone at St. Mary's Cathedral. Two memorials were held for Milk; a small one at Temple Emanu-El and a more boisterous one at the Opera House.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor also {{broke with}} {{tradition}} by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the White House. When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied {{the use of}} Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the Lincoln Memorial. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner. Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, {{with whom she had}} struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems with the staff when Bethune would visit the White House, Eleanor would meet her at the gate, embrace her, and walk in with her arm-in-arm.|$|E
5|$|Invited to the Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul's Cathedral in July 1981, Livingstone – {{a republican}} {{critical}} of the monarchy – wished the couple well but turned down the offer. He also permitted Irish republican protesters to hold a vigil <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> County Hall throughout the wedding celebrations, both actions that enraged the press. His administration supported the People's March for Jobs, a demonstration of 500 anti-unemployment protesters who marched to London from Northern England, allowing them to sleep in County Hall and catering for them. Costing £19,000, critics argued that Livingstone was illegally using public money for his own political causes. The GLC orchestrated a propaganda campaign against Thatcher's government, in January 1982 erecting {{a sign on the}} top of County Hall – clearly visible from the Houses of Parliament – stating the number of unemployed in London.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused {{on the grounds that it}} would look like they were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dr Fillgrave, {{with one}} foot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriage, but pausing {{at the sight of}} so well-turned-out a servant. [...] "Yes; I am Dr Fillgrave." ...|$|R

60|$|She was {{trembling}} {{so much that}} I wanted to bring her in and make her rest; but she would only sit down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stile, and there she whispered it, in this way.|$|R
5|$|Powderfinger {{were active}} in {{supporting}} causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances. In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November. They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the Sydney Opera House. The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World, was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people. In {{the wake of the}} 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005. The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area. The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected.|$|E
5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
5|$|Jesse Sage, {{associate}} director of the American Anti-slavery Group, and Jacobs persuaded Bok to move to Boston to work with the AASG. He was initially hesitant to leave his new friends in Ames, but according to Bok, the people at AASG were persistent. He arrived in Boston on May 14, 2000, AASG helped him find an apartment. A week after moving to Boston, he was invited to speak at a Baptist church in Roxbury and was interviewed by Charles A. Radin of The Boston Globe. Two days after his speech in Roxbury, Bok was asked to meet with supporters of AASG <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. He returned to Washington on September 28, 2000, and became the first escaped slave to speak before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Francis was invited to Washington again in 2002 for the signing of the Sudan Peace Act and met with President George W. Bush. It was during this trip to the White House that Bok became the first former slave to meet with a U.S. President since the 19th century.|$|E
60|$|As Lothair beheld {{the scene}} with gratification, <b>the</b> servant reappeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrace and invited him to descend. Guiding him through the garden, the servant retired as Lothair {{recognized}} Mrs. Campian approaching them.|$|R
60|$|She turned in, and sinking down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altar {{in front}} of Filippino Lippi's serene Virgin {{appearing}} to Saint Bernard, she waited in hope that the inward tumult which agitated her would by-and-by subside.|$|R
50|$|Before World War II, Goneim {{worked at}} Saqqara <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{mortuary}} temple of Unas.

25|$|Subsequently, race {{relations}} were unsettled. In 1907, a mixed-race man named William Burns, {{accused of the}} murder of a white policeman named August Baker, was lynched <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> the Cumberland jail.|$|E
50|$|A virus can induce {{changes in}} {{composition}} {{and organization of}} host cell cytoskeletal and membrane compartments, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> viral replication cycle. This process involves a number of complex interactions and signaling events between viral and host cell factors.|$|R

60|$|Austin {{was seated}} {{all in a}} heap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car. It was his {{coughing}} which I had heard from above. He had been holding his head in silence, {{but now he was}} muttering to himself and running his eyes over the car.|$|R
