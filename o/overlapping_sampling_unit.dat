40|$|Washington, D. C. 20212 Abstract: A {{number of}} {{procedures}} have been developed, {{beginning with the}} work of Keyfitz, for maximizing or minimizing the <b>overlap</b> of <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> for two stratified designs. Most of these procedures are not applicable at all, or are not feasible to implement, unless the number of units selected per stratum is very small. The previous procedures that the author is aware of for increasing or decreasing overlap when a large number of units per stratum are selected either do not generally yield an optimal overlap or do not guarantee fixed sample sizes. Furthermore, these overlap procedures have typically been developed for use when the two designs must be selected sequentially, as is the case when the second design is a redesign of the first design. In the current paper a very different, large sample per stratum procedure is presented for maximizing or minimizing overlap when the units can be selected for the two designs simultaneously, as may be the case for two different surveys. The procedure guarantees fixed sample sizes and also an optimal overlap if the two designs have identical stratifications, but can still be used, with loss of optimality, if the stratifications differ. An application of this procedure to the joint selection of samples for two Bureau of Labor Statistics compensation surveys is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Background&Aims:There are two {{different}} approaches to record presences of species in a plot: rooted (the plant roots in the <b>sampling</b> <b>unit)</b> and shoot (<b>overlapping</b> with the <b>sampling</b> <b>unit)</b> presence. However it was demonstrated theoretically that the different recording scheme swill lead to differences in richness counts and different shapes of species-area relationships (SARs), this aspect is not generally acknowledged in ecology. The aims of our study are to quantify how big the differences of rooted vs. shoot sampling in vascular plant species richness counts are at different spatial scale and analyze how these two sampling approaches influence the shape of SARs. Material & Methods: We used the plots of the BiodivERsA project SIGNAL in semi-natural grasslands of six Eurasian countries. In each study site we established six blocks of 2. 80 m x 0. 40 m, subdivided into 448 micro-quadrats of 25 cm 2. We recorded the vascular plant species composition {{in each of these}} micro-quadrats also with rooted and shoot sampling scheme. We calculated species richness values for ten different <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> sizes. To describe the rate of difference between the species richness obtained by the different sampling methods linear mixed-effect models were used. For detecting differences between rooted and shoot presence methods SAR models were applied based on species richness values. Main results & Interpretations: The effect of the different sampling scheme on species richness was scale dependent however effect size varied between different grassland types. Species richness recorded with shoot presence method was higher in every scale in the case of all sites, nevertheless the amount of relative differences became smaller with increasing plot size on every site. On the basis of our results we can confirm the statement that in case of comparing SARs from different studies it is essential to know which was used since if the method is uncertain, the comparison will not be responsible...|$|R

40|$|In the 2000 {{redesign}} of the Survey of Income and Program Participation sample, a two-stage sample design is adopted. In the first stage, two geographic Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units</b> are selected {{from each of}} the strata within each state. In selecting Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units,</b> if a Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> that was in the 1990 design is reselected in 2000, then the experienced field representative in that Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> can remain working on the survey. If a new Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> is selected, then a new field representative will have to be hired and trained. Therefore, reselecting as many of the Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units</b> that were in the 1990 design as possible would minimize this turnover of field representatives. This will help reduce nonsampling errors caused by the inexperience of newly hired field representatives and the costs to train them. The Bureau of the Census employs the Ernst (1986) algorithm to select Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Units</b> while maximizing the Primary <b>Sampling</b> <b>Unit</b> <b>overlap</b> between the 1990 and 2000 designs.

40|$|Sampled microarchitectural {{simulation}} of single-threaded applications is mature technology {{for over a}} decade now. Sampling multithreaded applications, on the other hand, is much more complicated. Not until very recently have researchers proposed solutions for sampled {{simulation of}} multithreaded applications. Time-Based Sampling (TBS) samples multithreaded application execution based on time—not instructions as is typically done for single-threaded applications—yielding estimates for a multithreaded application’s execution time. In this article, we revisit and analyze previously proposed TBS approaches (periodic and cantor fractal based sampling), and we obtain a number of novel and surprising insights, such as (i) accurately estimating fast-forwarding IPC, that is, performance in-between <b>sampling</b> <b>units,</b> is more important than accurately estimating sample IPC, that is, performance within the sampling units; (ii) fast-forwarding IPC estimation accuracy is determined by both the <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> distribution and how to use the <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> to predict fast-forwarding IPC; and (iii) cantor sampling is more accurate at small <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> sizes, whereas periodic is more accurate at large <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> sizes. These insights lead to the development of Two-level Hybrid Sampling (THS), a novel sampling methodology for multithreaded applications that combines periodic sampling’s accuracy at large time scales (i. e., uniformly selecting coarse-grain <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> across the entire program execution) with cantor sampling’s accuracy at small time scales (i. e., the ability to accurately predict fast-forwarding IPC in-between small <b>sampling</b> <b>units).</b> The clustered occurrence of small <b>sampling</b> <b>units</b> under cantor <b>sampling</b> also enables shortened warmup and thus enhanced simulation speed. Overall, THS achieves an average absolute execution time prediction error of 4 % while yielding an average simulation speedup of 40 × compared to detailed simulation, which is both more accurate and faster than the current state-of-the-art. Case studies illustrate THS’ ability to accurately predict relative performance differences across the design space...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the effect of <b>sampling</b> <b>unit</b> size on the perception of spatial patterns of earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris L.) middens. The implications for optimal sampling strategy for spatial interpolation were assessed. Spatial variation of midden density was investigated in Vaisakko forest, south-western Finland, using 225 sample points distributed on a square grid with a minimum distance of 25 m between samples. At each point, middens were counted within samples of sequentially increasing size (sample surface 0. 125, 0. 25, 1 m 2) and analysed by means of geostatistics. The results showed significant spatial continuity of midden distribution in all cases. Whereas, neither the estimate of mean middens density nor the global distribution pattern were markedly affected by <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> size, the total variance increased considerably with decreasing <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> area. Isotropic variograms for different <b>sample</b> <b>unit</b> sizes were all spherical but large discrepancies in the model parameters were observed.
