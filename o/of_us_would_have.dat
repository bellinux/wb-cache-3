A manager Muff Winwood recalls [...] "tearing his hair out" [...] in frustration, and admits that without Blackwell's enthusiastic support, [...] "the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> given him the boot." [...] Following persistent nagging from Boyd, Drake agreed to an interview with Jerry Gilbert of Sounds Magazine.|$|E
500|$|O'Connell {{came up with}} [...] "Swing," [...] a {{song that}} Rubano said [...] "speaks to what {{the sound of the}} band is right now". [...] "Where My Mouth Is" [...] was the last song {{recorded}} for New Again. According to Lazzara, the lyrics were [...] "the most blatant that I've ever been in a song". The demo for the song was originally acoustic with an organ, mostly instrumental, and ran for 6–7 minutes. Fazzi praised the track, as did Rubano. The song subsequently went through various arrangement changes. The riff for [...] "Cut Me Up Jenny" [...] came from Lazzara: [...] "I was so bored and so lazy, I picked up the guitar and then the [...] That's where it came from and we made a song out of it." [...] Lazzara described it as [...] "a little choppy" [...] with [...] "a nice groove to it". Fazzi said the track has a [...] "crazy 80s vibe, it's a very different song for Taking Back Sunday", while Rubano said it contained hints of Phoenix and Bloc Party. When [...] "Catholic Knees" [...] existed as a rough idea, Fazzi suggested that the group change the time signature to 7/4. Lazzara cited it as an example of Fazzi's influence on the band: [...] "Cause none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought to [...]" [...] Reyes compared the track to Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters.|$|E
2500|$|Barnett Newman {{credited}} Ingres as a progenitor {{of abstract}} expressionism, explaining: [...] "That guy was an abstract painter... He {{looked at the}} canvas more often than at the model. Kline, de Kooning—none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> existed without him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We were hidden, too, {{till they}} came at us," [...] he said; [...] "and very lucky it was, for some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>have</b> been hit, bad shots though they are." ...|$|R
2500|$|Haughey in 1990 {{had more}} {{difficulties}} than successes. The {{first half of}} the year saw Haughey in a leading role as European statesman when Ireland held the presidency of the European Community, which rotated semi-annually between the member states of the European Union. Haughey supported German Reunification and during the extraordinary Dublin Summit, which he called for in April, he pressed this viewpoint forward. He believed both Ireland and Germany were similar in that both countries were divided. During a Dáil debate on German Reunification, Haughey stated [...] "I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification".|$|E

5000|$|The changes {{described}} above are explained in Federal Register: 27 February 2006 (Volume 71, Number 38) page 9764, Commuter and Intercity Rail Station Platform Accessibility, [...] "Amtrak cars serving {{the area in}} which the commuter system will be operated. This means that cars in the eastern part <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> floor heights <b>of</b> 48 in above top of rail, while those in the southern/western part <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> floor heights <b>of</b> 15 in above top of rail. The purpose of this proposal is to prevent situations—some of which the Department has encountered—in which Amtrak and commuter rail cars with different floor heights use the same station platforms, complicating the provision of level entry boarding." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By jinks! {{but that}} was a narrow shave!" [...] gasped Dick, when they were safe. [...] "A little more and all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been under the ice." ...|$|E
60|$|Both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> willingly <b>have</b> left Darbyville, {{but where}} should we go? The only {{relation}} {{we had was}} an uncle,-- Captain Enos Moss,-- {{and he was on}} an extended trip to South America, and when he would return no one knew.|$|R
5000|$|... : They {{went out}} from us, {{but they were}} not of us; for if they <b>had</b> been <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{continued}} with <b>us.</b> But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not <b>of</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What right {{had they}} {{to marry her}} up to him?" [...] said Claude. [...] "I don't blame poor January. I suppose none <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> gentlemen, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> refused such a pretty toy, {{if we could have}} afforded it as he could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{the same}} I don't {{believe there was}} one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{had the nerve to}} tackle that broken leg of Alec's. I wouldn't for one," [...] {{declared}} Hal.|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{than likely}} every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been sick," [...] {{answered}} the young captain with a shudder. [...] "Then the Indians and the desperadoes {{could have walked}} in here without a struggle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{generally}} some {{way out of}} a mess," [...] Rogers said, [...] "if one does but think of it. If I had not thought of the French boats, we should have scattered, and a few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been overtaken, no doubt; but even an Indian cannot follow a single trail as fast as a man can run, and I reckon most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> carried our scalps back to camp.

60|$|FALDER. There {{were all}} sorts there. And what I mean, sir, is, that if we'd been treated {{differently}} the first time, and put under somebody that could look after us a bit, and not put in prison, not a quarter <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> got there.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I presume not. And I had {{not time}} {{to explain it to}} you when we were upon the cliffs, and so I simply {{directed}} you to keep back <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> That <b>would</b> <b>have</b> prevented all trouble, if you had only obeyed." ...|$|R
60|$|This, however, I knew not, and {{therefore}} was under continual apprehensions {{for a good}} while, and kept always upon my guard, I and all my army; for as there were now four <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> ventured a hundred of them fairly in the open field at any time.|$|R
6000|$|... "But for {{you there}} {{would not have been}} any battle at all," [...] Field said. [...] "I don't think any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone forward after that fellow warned us back had you not done so." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What did it matter?" [...] she cried. [...] "We are, {{or rather}} we were, so much alike {{then that the}} {{portrait}} of either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done for the other. It saved me the bother of being studied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that is why," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, [...] "it {{was left}} empty.

6000|$|... "Well, rooinek," [...] they exclaimed, [...] "you are a brave {{young fellow}} {{to make a}} fight alone against a dozen <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been wiser if you had gone away when you were {{lucky enough to get}} up the bank without being hit.

60|$|We cannot {{wonder that}} Harriet {{could not stand}} it. Any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left. We would not even stay with a cat that was in this condition. Even the Boinvilles could not endure it; and so, as we have seen, they gave this one notice.|$|E
60|$|Next day 'nothing {{particular}} happened.' Perhaps some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> regarded it differently. 'Passed a spar, but not {{near enough}} {{to see what it}} was.'

6000|$|... "Mother, I am glad; but, {{you see my}} state. It is for the child's sake I weep, {{that now}} never will be born. Had it won life even for an hour all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> dwelt {{together}} in bliss until eternity. But it cannot be--it cannot be." ...|$|E

6000|$|Alton's {{face was}} very grim. [...] "Well," [...] he said dryly, [...] "it means {{a good deal}} less to one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> than it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done a few weeks ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing in particular," [...] and Hetty glanced reflectively at the fire. [...] "Still, I don't {{think you}} would be content with any girl likely to look at you, and most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>have</b> {{a good deal more}} than we ever get." ...|$|R
