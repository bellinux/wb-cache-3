Focusing particularly on literature on femininities and embodiment, we consider how tattooed women’s bodies are read culturally, {{and the implications of}} this reading for our further understanding of the social construction <b>of</b> <b>femininities.</b> We explore how hegemonic notions <b>of</b> <b>femininities</b> and embodiment intersect in our cultural reading of women’s tattooed bodies. To conclude, we look at how femininities and embodiment are important in under- standing how femininity is constituted, how women experience their tattooed bodies differently, and what this means in terms of how the body is read culturally...|$|R

5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas <b>of</b> <b>femininity</b> with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, Boisselier often {{taught about}} the Raëlian {{perspective}} {{of the body and}} sexuality. She discussed these topics from a biological perspective, arguing that humans are essentially robots because they can be reprogrammed. Specifically, she maintained that hormones program the brain, and they provide humans with the freedom to choose from many possibilities. Raëlians emphasize sexual stimulation as a way to positively change their members, and Boisselier has stated that she sees the pursuit <b>of</b> <b>femininity</b> as a method of spiritual growth. The group highly values feminine beauty, and Raël has applauded Boisselier for maintaining her appearance, casting her as a role model.|$|E

This would explain why the women in the center panel are very much among the active participants in bringing about the Fall. At the time, the power <b>of</b> <b>femininity</b> was often rendered by showing a female surrounded by a circle of males. A late 15th-century engraving by Israhel van Meckenem shows a group of men prancing ecstatically around a female figure. The Master of the Banderoles's 1460 work the Pool of Youth similarly shows a group of females standing in a space surrounded by admiring figures.|$|E

40|$|Although most {{research}} linking health disadvantage with gender {{has focused on}} women, recent work indicates that hegemonic masculinities can also place the health of men at risk. The importance of comparing the experiences {{of women and men}} has been emphasised and this paper focuses on {{the ways in which the}} social constructions <b>of</b> <b>femininities</b> and masculinities affect how teenagers live with asthma or diabetes. The majority of girls incorporated these conditions and the associated treatment regimens into their social and personal identities, showing a greater adaptability to living with asthma or diabetes. However, this could have detrimental effects in terms of control, as girls sometimes lowered expectations for themselves. In addition, two aspects of the treatment regimens, diet and exercise, were found to disadvantage girls and advantage boys, because of contemporary meanings <b>of</b> <b>femininities</b> and masculinities. The social construction <b>of</b> <b>femininities</b> meant that these conditions were not seen as the threat that they were by the majority of boys interviewed, who made every effort to keep both conditions outside their personal and social identities by passing. The majority of boys maintained a 'valued' identity by feeling in control of their body and their condition. However, for the small minority of boys who were no longer able to pass the impact of chronic illness led to a 'disparaged' identity. The interaction of gender and health is seen as a complex two-way process, with aspects <b>of</b> contemporary <b>femininities</b> and masculinities impacting on the management of these conditions, and aspects of these conditions impacting in gendered ways upon the constructions of gender.

5|$|Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{appeared}} in a bikini in An Evening in Paris (1967), a film mostly remembered for the first bikini appearance of an Indian actress. She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked the conservative Indian audience, but it also set a trend of bikini-clad actresses carried forward by Parveen Babi (in Yeh Nazdeekiyan, 1982), Zeenat Aman (in Heera Panna 1973; Qurbani, 1980) and Dimple Kapadia (in Bobby, 1973) in the early 1970s. Wearing a bikini put her name in the Indian press as one of Bollywood's ten hottest actresses of all time, and was a transgression of female identity through {{a reversal of the}} state of modesty, which functions as a signifier <b>of</b> <b>femininity</b> in Bombay films. By 2005, it became usual for actors in Indian films to change outfits a dozen times in a single song — starting with a chiffon sari and ending up wearing a bikini. But, when Tagore was the chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification in 2005, she expressed concerns about the rise of the bikini in Indian films.|$|E
5|$|The eldest {{daughter}} of Charles Wintour, {{editor of the}} London Evening Standard (1959–76), her father consulted her {{on how to make}} the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the US, with stints at New York and House & Garden. She returned to London and was the editor of British Vogue between 1985 and 1987. A year later, she assumed control of the franchise's magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry {{has been the subject of}} debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views <b>of</b> <b>femininity</b> and beauty.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} ideals <b>of</b> genteel <b>femininity</b> that {{circulated in}} the Australian colony of Victoria between 1860 and 1901. During this period {{there was no}} single, well-defined model <b>of</b> ideal <b>femininity.</b> Rather, it was an ideological concept composed of conflicting expectations, admonishments and advice conveyed to genteel women about how they should feel, think and behave. This study <b>of</b> ideal <b>femininity</b> sheds light {{on the lives of}} colonial women, the role of mothers, the place of daughters, and the function of women in the building of the nation. These are important areas of historical investigation not least because the ideology <b>of</b> ideal <b>femininity</b> underpinned all aspects of nineteenth-century middle-class hegemony: to change the concept of the ideal woman was to change, however subtly, the concept of the family, of the home, of what men should be, of how society should function. This thesis seeks the ways that British ideals <b>of</b> genteel <b>femininity</b> were variously transplanted and transformed in the colonial landscape. In particular this study focuses on how the fragile and dependent ideal of the Angel in the House and the attendant figure of the vaporous invalid, forms <b>of</b> genteel <b>femininity</b> with resonance in Britain during this period, achieved only limited currency in nineteenth-century Victoria. A range of colonial conditions contributed to the rejection of these residual forms <b>of</b> genteel <b>femininity,</b> but this thesis attributes the change predominantly to the chronic labour shortage in the colonies. The shortage of available household servants in Victoria ensured that even genteel women were expected to contribute to the domestic labour economy, and as a result, during {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century genteel ideology changed to reflect a new acceptance of health, vigour and adaptability for genteel colonial women, and a concomitant rejection of weakness, frailty and dependence. This thesis posits the new labour demands as the cause of broad changes to genteel women’s behaviour, expectations and habitus. This study examines this shift in ideology in regard to genteel women generally, but more specifically in reference to four distinct groups of genteel colonial women: governors’ wives, clergy’s wives, governesses and middle-class Australian girls. These groups of women were all highly subject to expectations <b>of</b> ideal <b>femininity,</b> expected to live up to a predetermined version of how women should be and also compelled to act as exemplars to other genteel women. This analysis is informed by records left by these women themselves, which reveal their struggle to live up to definitions <b>of</b> ideal <b>femininity,</b> as well as the myriad versions <b>of</b> ideal <b>femininity</b> presented to these women by colonial society...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we explore}} how women with tattoos are portrayed in digital media. With {{a focus on}} the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>femininities,</b> we present a media analysis of digital articles and associated imagery published between September 2013 and February 2014 where women with tattoos are discussed and portrayed. A comprehensive search was conducted, with twenty five articles identified. The poster will focus on five of those articles, which are analysed through the means of Foucauldian Discourse Analysis. Our analysis explores how women with tattoos are constructed, analysing textual and visual representations in the digital media, to consider its implications for our understanding <b>of</b> <b>femininities</b> and embodiment in contemporary neoliberal British culture. The findings of the study contribute to our understanding of women with tattoos, by considering the 'fashion' aspect of body art, and the notion that there is a right and wrong way to be tattooed. There is also a clear difference between tasteful, discreet tattoos, and tattoos that are considered inappropriate. Think links to ideas of self-expression through decoration of the skin...|$|R

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{view this}} concentration of multiple {{functions as a}} typical and structural feature of the goddess, inherent to her being {{an expression of the}} nature <b>of</b> <b>femininity.</b> Others though prefer to dismiss her aspects <b>of</b> <b>femininity</b> and fertility and stress only her quality of being the spirit of youthfulness, liveliness and strength, regardless of sexual connexions, which would then change according to circumstances: thus in men she incarnates the iuvenes, word often used to design soldiers, hence resulting in a tutelary deity of the sovereignty of peoples; in women capable of bearing children, from puberty on she oversees childbirth and marriage. Thence she would be a poliad goddess related to politics, power and war. Other think her military and poliadic qualities arise from her being a fertility goddess who through her function of increasing the numbers of the community became also associated to political and military functions.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people in}} Western culture, {{both male and}} female, {{consider}} breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic and an important aspect <b>of</b> <b>femininity</b> and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage {{as part of their}} physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense <b>of</b> <b>femininity.</b> Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage. In South Africa, Wonderbra sponsors a National Cleavage Day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.|$|E
