40|$|As we use {{complex systems}} with <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> items in many {{technical}} applications {{we need to}} know basic characteristics of such system. Performance, safety and other are as much important as dependability measures. In real applications we {{have to take into account}} a related distribution of an observed variable. In terms of complex systems with <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> items it is a discrete random variable related to <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> item. The whole system and its failures (unexpected and inadvertent events) may have two typical types of distributions and their characteristics. We either consider a continuous variable (such as time, mileage, etc.) or a counting variable (such as number of cycles, sequences, etc.) regarding to a failure occurrence. As the <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> items is supposed to back up the main system function the total reliability of the system should be higher than. The main issue regarding the system using <b>one</b> <b>shot</b> items in their construction is to determine the probability of the task (mission) success. The paper presents both theoretical approach and practical example of the solution...|$|R
