40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is companies' outbound distribution network design in supply chain management. Within the present competitive market, it is a fundamental importance for companies to achieve high level business performance with an effective supply chain. Outbound distribution network design as an important part in supply chain management, to a large extent decides whether companies can fulfill customers' requirement or not. Therefore, such a study is important for manufacturers and retailers to be prominent in the intensive competition and gain customer loyalty, and then achieve competitive advantages and become order winner. The research approach adopted in this dissertation is qualitative research with documentary analysis, because the topic is more literature study based. Cases from different kinds of industries have been selected to be investigated, especially in their distribution systems. The findings from this research provide evidence that there is no single solution for distribution network design, and different industry may come out with different logistics systems. Even within the same industry sector, distribution strategies can be diverse due to changeable business environment, customers' demand and companies' capability.

40|$|The {{competitive}} {{landscape of the}} U. S. automotive market has transformed from the traditional 2 ̆ 2 Big Three 2 ̆ 2 players to too many viable players. In 2008 - 2009, the harsh market conditions, excess production capacity, capital asset redundancies, and many inefficient strategies submerged as the roadblocks for the US automakers to stay competitive and profitable in the North American market. In this new competitive era, cross-company collaboration in product development, standardizing and communizing supply base, sharing flexible manufacturing platforms, using common inbound and out bound logistics service providers and warehousing etc. can play vital roles for the US automakers to reduce overall cost and return to profitability. Through the horizontal collaboration in the <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> operations, these companies can create close-knit business partnership and act faster than the foreign rivals in delivering finished vehicles at the optimum cost. The optimization of <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> operations through consolidation and collaboration among OEMs has tremendous potential {{to contribute to the}} profitability by lowering the cost of transportation, in-house inventory, transportation time, and facility costs. The collaboration in the intra- and inter-OEM <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> operations is a critical area that the US automakers need to pay attention and prioritize in their cost reduction initiatives. This research presents an integrated collaboration framework for the <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> operations of the US automakers. In our framework, we propose three potential levels for the US automakers to form <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> collaboration: operational, tactical, and strategic. Our research proposition is to improve the performance of <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> systems of automotive OEMs by means of horizontal collaboration between plants and competing OEMs. The proposed research thus relates to the literature on logistics system design and management and horizontal collaboration in supply chain management. The collaboration framework is demonstrated through a real world case study in US automotive industry. The contribution of this research is the introduction of a framework for intra- and inter-OEM collaboration and the development of novel logistics network design and flow models integrated with inventory models, lost sales, and expedited shipment. Besides the contribution to the academic literature, the proposed collaborative distribution system is a new concept in the automotive industry. Hence, this novel research work will also benefit to the practitioners.

40|$|AbstractBackground;Despite of the {{significant}} role of packaging within logistics and supply chain management, packaging is infrequently studied as focal point in supply chain. Most of the previous logistics research studies tend to explain the integration between packaging and logistics through logistical packaging. In very rare cases, the studies mentioned about customer value. Therefore the major disadvantage of these studies is that, they didn’t consider logistical packaging and customer value delivery as related matters. As a result customers incur significant cost in repairing damages incurred during inbound and <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> operations because of poor packaging. Purpose;To explore how packaging solution manufacturers accounts for packaging requirements and delivers customer value through logistical packaging {{in order to enhance}} the efficiency in the customer’s inbound and <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> operations. Method;Through a qualitative research method combined with abductive research approach, a case study at Stora Enso packaging was conducted. Logistical packaging concept and customer value equation model has been introduced in this thesis. Then, data were collected and analyzed in the context of how does Stora Enso derives packaging requirements from customers so that it deliver customer values which ultimately enhance customers’ inbound and outbound logistic operations. Conclusion;The results after the analysis showed that, the packaging solution really affects performance of different activities in a logistics chain. Moreover, it showed how Stora Enso takes into consideration logistics requirements from customers and deliver value to these customers through logistical packaging. By delivering customer values such as light, strong and durable, flexible and cost efficient, having many fields of use, and completely renewable, a Stora Enso packaging solution enhance customer’s inbound and <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> operations by ensuring efficient transportation, maximum product protection, smooth handling, optimal warehouse space usage and less waste to the environment during disposal.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} {{neglected}} areas of the manufacturing (and retail) supply chain is the inbound logistics segment. Managing <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> {{has always been the}} strength of the Supply Chain organization (at manufacturers and retailers). The Marketing department has identified different logistics requirements for the finished goods segment. Customizing <b>outbound</b> <b>logistics</b> requirements (various distribution models are the outcome) based on the needs of specific customer segments is today a routine requirement. Similar to the Marketing department, the Purchase (Procurement) department has its own unique set of requirements for inbound raw materials / work-in-progress and other inbound material. In addition, modern JIT manufacturing methods push the Procurement Manager to aim to achieve lowest inventory models – often at the expense of higher inbound transportation costs. There is an inherent conflict in balancing the Just-in-time manufacturing practices (low inventory, shipment sizes, frequency of shipments) with inbound logistics and transportation needs (low cost, visibility of goods). The manufacturing or Retail organization needs to ask itself: Is it seeking the lowest integrated total logistics cost, the streamlined (and lowest) JIT inventory for its manufacturing needs or {{to strike a balance between}} the inherent conflict between the two aforementioned goals aimed towards achieving an optimally balanced and efficient supply chain...|$|E
