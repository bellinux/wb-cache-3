However, with parameters w, the number of trials, and p, the probability of success for each trial, the binomial random variable X {{is the sum of}} w independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables. Thus, the former is more general than the latter. So, in this paper, the randomly changing coupling strength is considered with the concept of binomial distribution. In addition, the Bernoulli random variable has been used in the concept of randomly occurring which has various types such as randomly <b>occurring</b> <b>delay,</b> randomly occurring uncertainties, randomly occurring nonlinearities, and so on [13 – 15].|$|E

These time-critical services often suffer from the delays ranging from small chunks to long peaks which can have severe implications on the Quality of Experience (QoE). Hence, it is worthwhile to identify the impact of different variations of delay on the end-user QoE. This research focused on the end-user QoE for three different distributions of <b>delays</b> <b>occurring</b> during an e-commerce shopping experiment. By keeping the overall waiting time of every sessions same, the study shows that the end-user QoE is different for different variety of delays.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the robust distributed state estimation problem for a class of uncertain sensor networks with multiple stochastic communication delays. A sequence of mutually independent random variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution is introduced to account for the randomly <b>occurred</b> communication <b>delays.</b> Both the discrete-time target plant and the sensor model are subject to parameter uncertainties as well as stochastic disturbance. The parameter uncertainties are norm-bounded and enter both the system and the measurement matrices. The external stochastic disturbance is given {{in the form of a}} scalar Wiener process. Through available output measurements from not only each individual sensor but also its neighbouring sensors, we aim to design distributed state estimators in order to approximate the state of the target plant. By using the Kronecker product, stochastic analysis is carried out to derive a sufficient criterion ensuring the estimation error systems to be convergent in the mean square sense for all randomly <b>occurred</b> <b>delays,</b> admissible stochastic disturbance and parameter uncertainties. Then, an explicit expression of the individual estimator is given in terms of the solution to a convex optimisation problem that can be easily solved by using the semi-definite programme method. A numerical example is given at the end of this article to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed theoretical results. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
