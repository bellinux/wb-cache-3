5|$|Although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of}} his assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. His daughters served as models for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures.</b>|$|E
5|$|He is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of 3 May 1791.|$|E
5|$|The {{decoration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> {{was done}} in private homes.|$|E
50|$|Some sources {{add another}} pentagram, inscribed within <b>the</b> inner {{pentagon}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest pentagram <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> <b>The</b> other pentagons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> {{do not have}} inscribed pentagrams.|$|R
50|$|All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Star Brigade <b>figures</b> {{came with}} {{spring-loaded}} weapons, which actually fired the ammo {{that came with}} <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> In some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armor-Tech <b>figures,</b> <b>the</b> spring-loaded weapon was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> {{a finite}} {{automorphism}} group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole space, its order is <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> symmetry group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> multiplied by <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> isomorphic versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|R
5|$|By the 1980s the {{sculpture}} was crumbling; cracks had developed, details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> had worn away, and moisture had eroded the internal structure. In wintertime the fountain {{had to be}} protected by a tarp. Weather, air pollution, and vandalism meant that {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars were now needed for restoration.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene was}} damaged in protest by James Anstice, {{a member of}} the Jesus Fellowship Church, who pushed over one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> and knocked the head off another. He was later ordered to pay £100 in compensation.|$|E
5|$|There {{was hardly}} a design element on the ceiling that was not {{subsequently}} imitated: the fictive architecture, the muscular anatomy, the foreshortening, the dynamic motion, the luminous colouration, the haunting expressions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> in the lunettes, the abundance of putti.|$|E
50|$|An {{animated}} {{figure is}} modeled with a skeleton of rigid segments connected with joints, called a kinematic chain. <b>The</b> kinematics equations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> define <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> joint angles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> and its pose or configuration. The forward kinematic animation problem uses the kinematics equations {{to determine the}} pose given the joint angles. The inverse kinematics problem computes the joint angles for a desired pose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lake shape {{resembles a}} slight figure eight with several {{distinct}} areas. South <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake lies Bean Lake State natural area {{which is a}} protected marsh. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight is usually covered in tall aquatic vegetation that reach out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water. In the north western portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight there is a sand bar which often has boats anchored and is swimming accessible.|$|R

The plane {{containing}} the various helical axes, h, (three of them shown here) is <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> <b>The</b> director points out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> in <b>the</b> center and it rotates {{as you move}} away from the center.|$|R
5|$|As soon as {{he arrived}} home, Etty began to work on {{ensuring}} he {{had at least one}} picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures.</b> His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of Pandora, Vulcan and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Belgravia is a {{district}} predominantly composed of early 19th-century residential buildings, {{many of which}} now serve diplomatic uses. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> commemorated by memorials here were influential in the early development of the area under the ownership of the Grosvenor family, later the Dukes of Westminster. Belgrave Square, which gives the locale its name, has a particularly high number of embassies, {{and as a result}} the public artworks there are of a strongly international character.|$|E
5|$|Critic Vivian Mercier {{was among}} the first to {{recognise}} Samuel Beckett's debt to Synge. Beckett was a regular member of the audience at the Abbey in his youth and particularly admired the plays of Yeats, Synge and O'Casey. Mercier points out parallels between Synge's casts of tramps, beggars and peasants and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> in Beckett's novels and dramatic works.|$|E
40|$|The polar motion data is {{analyzed}} to obtain accurate position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> axis {{referred to the}} Earth-fixed frame. <b>The</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> axis should be the basic object to which the geophysical events are linked. By <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> rigid dynamics, <b>the</b> relation between the rotational and <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> axes is derived. The polar motion is <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotational axis on the Earth's surface and therefore <b>the</b> exact position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> axis on <b>the</b> surface at each moment is obtained from the polar motion. Since <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recent data for the polar motion is very high, <b>the</b> obtained position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> axis is considered to keep good quality. As an average for a long duration <b>of</b> time, <b>the</b> obtained <b>figure</b> axis exhibits stable annual and semi-annual variations while it has no component with <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chandler wobble. Besides this general feature, it shows different patterns {{from year to year}} as well as small irregularities with shorter periods, most of which are considered to be significant but not attributed to the observational errors. Further, a simple model is introduced for <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seasonal variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> axis. <b>The</b> model explains both <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> axis obtained above and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotational speed which is so far known...|$|R
5000|$|The Sower by Jean-François Millet (1850) is {{influenced}} by the Apollo Belvedere in the treatment and pose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> in <b>the</b> piece. <b>The</b> pose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> is linked to the sculpture as Millet was attempting to heroise the peasant that he was depicting.|$|R
5000|$|For a given {{geometric}} {{figure in}} a given geometric space, consider the following equivalence relation: two automorphisms of space are equivalent {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> two images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> are <b>the</b> same (here [...] "the same" [...] does not mean something like e.g. [...] "the same up to translation and rotation", but it means [...] "exactly the same"). Then <b>the</b> equivalence class <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identity is <b>the</b> symmetry group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure,</b> and every equivalence class corresponds to one isomorphic version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|R
5|$|During Commando Hunt V (10 October 1970 to 30 April 1971) Air Force {{intelligence}} claimed 16,266 trucks {{destroyed and}} another 7,700 damaged {{during the dry}} season offensive. The Seventh Air Force headquarters in Saigon, chagrined by the enormity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures,</b> recomputed them and lowered the estimate to 11,000 destroyed and 8,000 damaged. In fact, there were only 2,500–3,000 PAVN trucks operating on the trail during 1970–1971, each carrying approximately four tons of materiel.|$|E
5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for {{the figure in the}} foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> {{used in the}} {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E
5000|$|A study {{analysed}} voting records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fifth European Parliament {{and ranked}} groups, concluding: [...] "Towards <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> are <b>the</b> more pro-European parties (PES, EPP-ED, and ALDE), whereas towards <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> are <b>the</b> more anti-European parties (EUL/NGL, G/EFA, UEN and EDD)." ...|$|R

5|$|On some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures,</b> however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation {{for this is that}} over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli was an {{inspiration}} to Leo Tolstoy, who based {{the figure of the}} Abbé Morio in War and Peace (1869) on him. He is also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of May 3, 1791. In his 1980 ten-page entry on Piattoli in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, historian Emanuel Rostworowski notes that, “despite two Italian monographs (by A.D. Ancon and G. Bozzolato)”, Piattoli still awaits a definitive biography.|$|E
5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding the mourning saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a simple fundamental domain for <b>the</b> holonomy group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary unipotent spherical CR uniformization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight knot complement, and deduce that small deformations of that holonomy group ({{such that the}} boundary holonomy remains parabolic) also give a uniformization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight knot complement. Finally, we construct an explicit 1 -parameter family <b>of</b> deformations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary unipotent holonomy group such that the boundary holonomy is twist-parabolic. For small values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twist <b>of</b> these parabolic elements, this produces a 1 -parameter family of pairwise non-conjugate spherical CR uniformizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight knot complement...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the colored}} stripes, across <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure,</b> which {{indicate}} <b>the</b> age and duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various lineages clearly imply {{that there is}} no evidence of direct continuity between extinct and extant lineages and also, multiple lineages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figured</b> hominids occurred contemporaneously at several points in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group.|$|R
5|$|Some B-class bracteates showing three godly {{figures have}} been {{interpreted}} as depicting Baldr's death, {{the best known}} of these is the Fakse bracteate. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> are understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
5|$|The {{panels of}} Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion are painted on light Sundeala boards, a {{material}} Bacon was using {{at the time}} as an inexpensive alternative to canvas. Each bears a single taut sculptural form pitched against a harsh orange background. The orange hue displays inconsistently across the canvasses, {{due in part to the}} low level of oil in the paint, which resulted in varying rates of absorption into the board. The pallid flesh tones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> were achieved by overlaying grey and white brushstrokes, while the figures' props were coloured using a variety of yellow, green, white, and purple tones.|$|E
50|$|Judges {{normally}} {{stand on}} the ice, off to one side, to watch <b>the</b> execution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> When <b>the</b> skater has finished, the judges typically check <b>the</b> alignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> from different angles, peer closely at <b>the</b> tracings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turns, and pace off <b>the</b> diameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles to check their sizes.|$|R
40|$|We give {{explicit}} equations {{that describe}} <b>the</b> character variety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight knot for the groups SL(3,C), GL(3,C) and PGL(3,C). This has five components of dimension 2, one consisting of totally reducible representations, another one consisting of partially reducible representations, and three components of irreducible representations. Of these, one is distinguished as it contains <b>the</b> curve <b>of</b> irreducible representations coming from $Sym^ 2 :SL(2,C) →SL(3,C) $. The other two components are induced by exceptional Dehn fillings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> eight knot.

However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>figure,</b> {{because they have the}} same base (the upper left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle) and the same height normal to that side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle.
