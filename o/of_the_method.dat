Operational modal analysis aims to find the modal properties; natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes of a structure while it is under operating conditions using its vibration data. Several methods of operational modal analysis are developed and they can broadly be divided into time-domain and frequency-domain. Theory of operational modal analysis and <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> chosen are presented in this thesis. <b>The</b> main objective <b>of</b> this thesis was to develop MATLAB functions which implements several <b>of</b> these <b>methods.</b> <b>The</b> <b>methods</b> are performed on two case studies. A shear frame with low and high damping where the exact modal parameters are known, this is done to check that <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> work properly and to see how damping influences <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> are used on the Hardanger Bridge, a bridge in operating conditions. The modal properties are extracted for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> and then compared on account <b>of</b> accuracy. <b>The</b> <b>methods</b> are also compared regarding ease of use and computational efficiency. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> found <b>the</b> natural frequencies for the low damping shear frame, but for high damping some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> proved to be inadequate. For damping ratio and mode shapes only a few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> managed to give satisfactory results.
