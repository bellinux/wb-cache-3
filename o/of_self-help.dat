25|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>self-help</b> {{approaches}} to resilience-building have been developed, drawing {{mainly on the}} {{theory and practice of}} cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). For example, a group cognitive-behavioral intervention, called the Penn Resiliency Program (PRP), has been shown to foster various aspects of resilience. A meta-analysis of 17 PRP studies showed that the intervention significantly reduces depressive symptoms over time.|$|E
25|$|In May 1997, Frank Field {{was made}} Minister for Welfare Reform. He {{approved}} of the principle <b>of</b> <b>self-help</b> through mutual organisations such as friendly societies, he thought the state should have only a small {{role to play in}} the provision of welfare, and he disliked means-testing and non-contributory entitlement. These ideas were out of step with those of the new Chancellor, Gordon Brown, in particular, and Field's ministerial tenure was short-lived.|$|E

In 1964 Project Concern expanded into Vietnam, during the Vietnam War, including training local volunteers in a network across nearby villages - a program that was expanded by 1967, earning local trust.

25|$|Antidepressant {{medications}} {{most commonly}} used to treat anxiety disorders are mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and tricyclic antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed for treatment of agoraphobia. Antidepressants are important because some have antipanic effects. Antidepressants {{should be used in}} conjunction with exposure as a form <b>of</b> <b>self-help</b> or with cognitive behaviour therapy. A combination of medication and cognitive behaviour therapy is sometimes the most effective treatment for agoraphobia.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option is}} {{self-help}} based on principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Using {{a book or}} a website, a person does the kinds of exercises {{that would be used}} in therapy, but they do it on their own, perhaps with some email or phone support from a therapist. A systematic analysis of trials testing this kind <b>of</b> <b>self-help</b> found that websites, books, and other materials based on cognitive-behavioral therapy could help some people. The best-studied conditions are panic disorder and social phobia.|$|E

40|$|Self-help {{groups are}} an {{interesting}} phenomenon and they {{could serve as a}} significant complement to the social services. Nevertheless they don't attract much attention in the Czech republic. In the theoretical part this thesis is trying to describe in detail how the self-help groups work, how they can complement social services and what are their risks and limitations. In the practical part a research was conducted in order to understand and map the situation <b>of</b> Czech <b>self-help</b> groups. This research was based on the internet search engine and registry of social services providers. The goal of the research was to map the self-help groups in the Czech republic in relation to geographical and typological allocation. The outcome of the research is a directory <b>of</b> active <b>self-help</b> groups that should serve both social workers and potencial clients <b>of</b> the <b>self-help</b> groups...|$|R

25|$|Peer support {{occurs when}} people provide knowledge, experience, emotional, social or {{practical}} help to each other. It commonly {{refers to an}} initiative consisting of trained supporters (although it can be provided by peers without training), and can take a number of forms such as peer mentoring, reflective listening (reflecting content and/or feelings), or counseling. Peer support {{is also used to}} refer to initiatives where colleagues, members <b>of</b> <b>self-help</b> organizations and others meet, in person or online, as equals to give each other support on a reciprocal basis.|$|E
25|$|The late 18th {{century and}} early 19th century saw the {{founding}} of many learned societies and professional bodies (for example, the Royal Society and the Law Society). Groups calling themselves civil engineers had been meeting for some years from the late 18th century, notably the Society of Civil Engineers formed in 1771 by John Smeaton (renamed the Smeatonian Society after his death). At that time, formal engineering in Britain {{was limited to the}} military engineers of the Corps of Royal Engineers, and in the spirit <b>of</b> <b>self-help</b> prevalent at the time and to provide a focus for the fledgling 'civilian engineers', the Institution of Civil Engineers was founded as the world's first professional engineering body.|$|E
