5|$|The city of Arlington had a {{population}} of 17,926 people {{at the time of}} the 2010 U.S. census, making it the ninth largest of eighteen cities in Snohomish County. From 1980 to 2010, Arlington's population increased by over 450 percent, fueled by the construction <b>of</b> <b>suburban</b> housing and annexations of outlying areas. The United States Census Bureau estimates the city's 2016 population at 19,112.

5|$|After a {{tentative}} creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution {{in the creation}} of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits. Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy; these cemeteries became inner-city once again when Paris annexed all neighbouring communes to the inside of its much larger ring <b>of</b> <b>suburban</b> fortifications in 1860. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux. Some of the most famous people in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Boston was {{estimated}} to have 667,137 residents (a density of 13,841 persons/sq mile, or 5,344/km2) living in 272,481 housing units— an 8% population increase over 2010. The city is the third most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million residents. Some 1.2million persons may be within Boston's boundaries during work hours, {{and as many as}} 2million during special events. This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>suburban</b> residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.|$|E

5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the opening of}} the three new stations 6,000 additional commuters used the northwest service. The Cumberland station became particularly attractive to suburban commuters from Des Plaines and Park Ridge; a study commissioned shortly after the station's opening found that only 12.4% of commuters parking in the Cumberland and Rosemont stations were Chicagoans. The influx <b>of</b> <b>suburban</b> commuters to the new Blue Line stops led to a fall in ridership on the Chicago & Northwestern's Northwest Line, which traditionally served the northwest suburbs near the new stops.|$|E

Further east, there are a pair of interchanges for Auburn as the freeway runs through a landscape that is a mix <b>of</b> <b>suburban</b> residential subdivisions and farm fields. The freeway is paralleled to the south by segments of Fisher Road in spots; about a half mile (0.8km) north is Midland Road. There is one last interchange for Mackinaw Road along the freeway before US10 ends at the cloverleaf interchange with I-75/US23 {{on the west side of}} Bay City. This junction is both the eastern terminus of US10 both in the state of Michigan and nationally.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} group Friends <b>of</b> <b>Suburban</b> Bristol Railways held {{a celebration}} in 2009 {{to mark the}} increase in passenger numbers.

The Severnside CRP also installed plant displays in 2008, and in 2011 distributed leaflets advertising train services to local residents, in association with Bristol City Council and Passenger Focus. In January 2017 a group called Friends of Parson Street Railway Station was formed to lobby for improvements to facilities and services at the station.|$|E

5|$|The new tracks {{built by}} the London, Midland and Scottish Railway allowed {{additional}} intermediate stations to be constructed on the local lines between 1932 and 1935. Increased local demand {{was caused by the}} expansion of the built up area <b>of</b> <b>suburban</b> London during the interwar period. The station at Upminster Bridge opened with platforms on the local electric lines on 17 December 1934. The station was operated by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway but was only served by District line trains. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground.|$|E
5|$|On February 25, 1970, the 11 Westinghouse-powered cars {{intended}} for Harrisburg service completed their performance testing. Penn Central {{refused to accept}} the cars, citing numerous technical issues with the cars and their general unsuitability for the service. They had worse acceleration than the Silverliners already in service, tended to overheat when making numerous closely spaced stops, and had difficulty climbing the grade out <b>of</b> <b>Suburban</b> Station. Additionally, the corridor lacked high-level platforms to effectively use the cars, and 15 substations would require expensive modifications. The 11 cars were unused for some time before Penn Central ultimately decided to lease the cars for use on the core New York - Washington service. They were moved back to the Budd plant for modifications in April. In July, the state authorized $100,000 to upgrade Silverliners for the Harrisburg service instead.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the station}} was opened, the UERL {{established}} Morden station, the southernmost on the system, as the hub for numerous bus routes heading further into suburban south London and northern Surrey. These routes {{had a significant impact}} on the Southern Railway's main line operations in the area, with the SR estimating in 1928 that it had lost approximately four million passengers per year. The UERL though was able to demonstrate that its passenger numbers on its buses to Sutton station were actually more than double those for Morden. Across the road from the station, the UERL opened its own petrol station and garage where commuters with cars could leave their vehicles during the day. The opening of the C and the Wimbledon to Sutton line led to rapid construction <b>of</b> <b>suburban</b> housing throughout the area. The population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, increased from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
