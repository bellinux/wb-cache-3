5|$|Coimbre died on November 4, 1989, when he {{was trapped}} in a house fire. The fire {{originated}} in the house's kitchen while he was cooking, consuming the structures wooden frame. When Coimbre tried to escape {{he was unable to}} <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door, because he had locked it with a padlock.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E

25|$|During his career, Turner {{would often}} pretend to rip <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{of his top}} when celebrating, a la Superman, a {{nickname}} Ron Artest used to call him by when they played together on the playgrounds of New York in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Of the cars, {{the most}} popular was the carrus, a {{standard}} chariot form descending to the Romans from a greater antiquity. The top was <b>open,</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> closed. One survives in the Vatican. It carried a driver and a passenger. A carrus with two horses was a biga; three horses, a triga; and four horses a quadriga. The tyres were of iron. When not in use, its wheels were removed for easier storage.|$|E
25|$|This was a {{tactical}} disadvantage for the GIGN; the positions {{were based on}} the aircraft being parked where the French authorities ordered the placement of the A300. When the aircraft moved, the GIGN had to quickly reorganise its forces. Favier placed snipers on the roof so they would have a view of the cockpit. He organised a cavalry charge of three passenger boarding stairs and thirty men to take over the aircraft. Favier planned to have two teams, each with 11 people, open the rear left and rear right doors of the A300. A third team of eight would <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> right door. The forces planned to isolate the cockpit, with Yahia, {{from the rest of the}} aircraft.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 May, the Soviets stormed the Reich Chancellery. In the {{official}} Soviet version, the battle {{was similar to that}} of the battle for the Reichstag. There was an assault over Wilhelmplatz and into the building with a howitzer to blast <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> doors and several battles within the building. Major Anna Nikulina, a political officer with Lieutenant-General I. P. Rossly's 9th Rifle Corps of the 5th Shock Army carried and unfurled the red flag on the roof. However, Beevor suggests that the official Soviet description is probably an exaggeration, as most of the German combat troops had left in the breakouts the night before, resistance must have been far less than that inside the Reichstag.|$|E
25|$|Boeselager was {{dispatched}} by Tresckow to urge his old commander, Kluge, {{to change}} his strategy and to join the conspiracy against Hitler. Kluge was now Commander-in-Chief in the West. Tresckow wanted Kluge to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in the West, begin negotiations for peace with the British and the Americans, and transfer units to the Eastern Front to fight the Soviets. Hitler and his national socialists would be eliminated. As Tresckow envisioned it, Kluge would arrange for the former's transfer {{so that he could}} help consolidate the coup. However, Kluge declined to participate in the plot or any planning. Boeselager continued to work with Tresckow and helped Wessel von Freytag-Loringhoven in procuring the British Hexogen plastic explosive and other parts used in the bomb meant to kill Hitler (a fact that his friends who were tortured by Hitler's security services never revealed).|$|E
25|$|Moyne {{arrived in}} his car with his driver, Lance Corporal Arthur Fuller, his secretary, Dorothy Osmond, and his ADC, Major Andrew Hughes-Onslow. The ADC went to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door of the {{residence}} and the driver got out {{to open the door}} for Moyne. They were suddenly told not to move, as Bet-Zuri emerged and shot Fuller in the chest, causing him to collapse in the driveway and bleed to death in minutes. Hakim then pulled the car door open and shot Moyne three times. The first bullet hit him in the neck on the right side, just above the clavicle, the second penetrated his abdomen, punctured his colon and large intestine, and became embedded {{to the right of the}} second lumbar vertebrae, while the third shot, fired after Moyne raised his right hand, ripped across four of his fingers and went in and out of his chest, causing no serious injuries.|$|E

25|$|In the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, Proctor's {{guns were}} {{commanded}} by Captain-Lieutenant Brewer and Lieutenants Barker and Ritter. During the fighting, British {{soldiers of the}} 40th Foot took refuge in the Chew House. Two of Proctor's guns and two captured 6-pound guns began firing at the house. They quickly blasted <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> doors, but unknown to the gunners, {{the front of the}} house was buttressed by two feet of stonework that resisted their round shot. The gunners also fired grapeshot at the second floor in an attempt to suppress the return fire. The 1st and 3rd New Jersey Regiments repeatedly tried to storm the building but they were driven off with heavy losses. During the action, four cannons from Brigadier General William Woodford's Virginia Brigade opened fire on the other side of the house, blowing open the back door and causing much damage. Some cannonballs passed entirely through the house by the windows, causing the Americans to believe that the defenders had their own artillery. The British successfully defended the Chew House and were rescued when the American army retreated.|$|E
500|$|Sometime after dawn, Kinoshita's team {{infiltrated}} the castle, {{set fire}} to a storehouse and the powder magazine, and then rushed to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> gates, cutting down whomever got in their way. With explosions erupting from the powder magazine and the other building burning fiercely, the castle defense quickly devolved into chaos, as the shocked and exhausted defenders thought they were under a full-scale attack from behind. [...] Kinoshita's men, filthy from the night's exertions and brandishing bloody swords as they rushed across the main courtyard, added to the impression. [...] The castle garrison was thrown into complete disarray as men were pulled from the parapets to face the nonexistent assault, while others threw down their weapons and surrendered. [...] When Kinoshita's team had attained the gatehouse they tied their gourds to spears and waved them to their allies below to signal they were in position, whereupon Kuroda's infantry charged the open gates and overran {{what was left of}} the castle's garrison. [...] While Kuroda's men mopped up the last of the resistance, Kinoshita's team found a place to rest while Horio Yoshiharu passed around a large gourd of sake he had taken from the castle's supply. [...] By the end of 27 September 1567 Inabayama Castle had fallen and the remaining lords of Mino province formally surrendered to Nobunaga.|$|E
2500|$|The Sherritt {{home was}} a typical period two-room slab hut, which Dan {{could see through the}} bedroom and kitchen to Joe in the back. When Weekes had first knocked, Constable William Duross had been talking with Sherritt and his wife in the kitchen. He joined the three other policemen, Henry Armstrong, Thomas P. Dowling, and Robert Alexander, in the bedroom. Even though they were big men, well-armed and {{experienced}} [...] "protectors", they remained there in the dark in fear while Sherritt was shot. Byrne then told Ellen Barry to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door of the hut. When she did, Dan Kelly was revealed a few feet away. Joe ordered the frightened women to leave the house, then the outlaws began shooting into the walls of the bedroom. The police threw themselves to the floor.|$|E
