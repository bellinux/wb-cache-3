40|$|The 9 Cr steels EUROFER and F 82 H-mod are the {{candidate}} materials for future fusion reactors. The {{extension of the}} <b>operation</b> <b>limits</b> including <b>temperature,</b> strength and toughness are still the scope of ongoing research. In a pulsed reactor operation, fatigue lifetime {{is one of the}} major properties for the steels. While the oxide dispersion strengthened EUROFER-ODS variant showed significant improvements in this area, the production costs and availability of large quantities of materials drastically limits its applications. In the present study, different surface nitriding treatments of EUROFER 972 have been performed and the impact on microstructure, dynamic fracture toughness and high temperature fatigue has been analysed. Four different states of EUROFER including different heat treatments, nitriding of the surface and the ODS variant are tested and compared in this work. Low cycle fatigue tests show the improvements after certain treatments. Charpy impact tests and microstructural investigation by scanning electron microscopy and analytical transmission electron microscopy are also performed to compare the materials against the reference (EUROFER 97). While conventional gas nitriding showed no beneficial effect on the material, the Hard-Inox-P treatment showed a significant improvement in the cycles to failure while retaining an acceptable toughness. Microstructural investigations showed the presence of very small chromium- and nitrogen-rich precipitates in the area close to the surface...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. A numerical method for analysing and quantifying the thermal behaviour of wind turbine nacelle of 2. 5 MW operating in the extreme winter conditions have been presented. The effects of the extreme external temperatures of - 30 oC, - 20 C and - 10 oC on the electrical equipment and mechanical components within the nacelle have been determined at the design wind speed of 12 m/s. Two cases, open and closed system applications, have been considered. For both cases without the AC at Text=- 30 oC,the surface temperatures of the gear box and generator are outside the <b>temperature</b> <b>limits.</b> When applying the AC to the systems, temperatures became inside the <b>operation</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits.</b> For closed system applications at Text=- 30 oC and - 20 oC, the surface temperatures of all components are inside the <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> with the capacities of the AC system, 5 kg/s at 0 oC, 5 kg/s at 10 oC with some icing problems inside wall of the nacelle. For closed system applications at Text=- 10 oC, the surface temperatures of components are inside the <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> with the AC capacities of 4 kg/s at 30 oC, 5 kg/s at 0 oC, 5 kg/s at 5 oC and 5 kg/s at 10 oC without icing problems. The simulation results have confirmed that, to maintain an acceptable temperature levels inside the nacelle and on the components for typical winter conditions, the air conditioning systems are needed. The air conditioning systems of the nacelle have to be optimized and adjusted properly as functions of wind turbines rated power, external wind velocity and temperatures. cf 201...|$|R
40|$|The mass, isotope, and isobar {{distributions}} of <b>limiting</b> <b>temperatures</b> for finite nuclei are investigated {{by using a}} thermodynamics approach together with the Skyrme energy density functional.

40|$|The {{method for}} {{determining}} the voltage security <b>operation</b> <b>limits</b> in a practical voltage security analysis (VSA) system based on VSAT software for large power systems is introduced in this paper. These <b>operation</b> <b>limits</b> include bus voltage limits, branch/corridor transfer power limits and P-load limit of the whole system. The voltage security <b>operation</b> <b>limits</b> {{are determined by the}} most critical contingency among the studied contingency set. The most critical contingency determines the P-load limit of the whole system, and all kinds of <b>operation</b> parameter <b>limits</b> are <b>operation</b> parameter values corresponding to this P-load limit under pre-contingency. An <b>operation</b> parameter <b>limit</b> is upper limit if the function relationship between this operation parameter and load power is an increasing curve, or lower limit if the function relationship between this operation parameter and load power is an decreasing curve. These <b>operation</b> parameter <b>limits</b> are helpful for operators to monitor the system operation state. © 2005 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Building fires {{can cause}} severe damages {{to not only}} human life but also {{building}} structures. Therefore, every nation requires a building regulation related to fire in aspect of safety of human and structural stability. The structural stability under fire condition can be evaluated by the fire test defined in each nation’s standard. However, {{the results from the}} test don’t satisfy the real situations of the building such as fire loads, opening size, loading and boundary condition of structural members, and etc. Meanwhile, performance based fire engineering design is regarded as an alternative evaluation method of fire. The fire engineering method has been regarded as a more rational method than the prescriptive method in terms of accuracy and cost efficiency. Recently, the <b>limit</b> <b>temperature</b> method is regarded as the easiest fire engineering method to evaluate the structural stability under fire. To make the backbone of a specification of <b>limiting</b> <b>temperature</b> method, <b>limiting</b> <b>temperatures</b> of various structural members are required.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{entanglement}} of general mixed states of a two qubit Heisenberg XYZ chain {{in the presence}} of a magnetic field, and its detection by means of different criteria. Both the exact separability conditions and the weaker conditions implied by the disorder and the von Neumann entropic criteria are analyzed. The ensuing <b>limit</b> <b>temperatures</b> for entanglement in thermal states of different XYZ models are then examined and compared with the <b>limit</b> <b>temperature</b> of the symmetry-breaking solution in a mean field type approximation. The latter, though generally lower, can also be higher than the exact <b>limit</b> <b>temperature</b> for entanglement in certain cases, indicating that symmetry-breaking does not necessarily entail entanglement.
