If the prisoner resisted signing, the inquisitors could always resume the torture by claiming that they had just halted the session, just for the signing, but did not really put an end to it.|$|E

Ronge had also garnered support from Robert Blum, a newspaper publisher in Saxony, who published writings of the new movement.|$|R
50|$|As Kasi {{was in the}} {{dangerous}} Durand Line border region, the informant was told to lure Kasi into Pakistan where he could be more easily apprehended. Kasi was tempted with a lucrative business offer—smuggling Russian electronic goods into Pakistan—which brought him to Dera Ghazi Khan, in the Punjab province of Pakistan, where he checked into a room at Shalimar Hotel. At 4 a.m. {{on the morning of}} June 15, 1997, an armed team of FBI officers working with the Pakistani ISI, raided Kasi's hotel room. His fingerprints were taken on the scene, confirming his identity. Sources disagree as to where Kasi was taken next—US authorities claim it was a holding facility run by Pakistani authorities, while Pakistani sources claim it was the U.S. embassy in Islamabad—before being flown to the US on June 17 in a C-141 transport. During the flight, Kasi made a full <b>oral</b> and written <b>confession</b> to the FBI.|$|R

50|$|Ronge's touring {{ministry}} {{brought about}} 100 new congregations to his movement. He decried declining spirituality {{and called for}} a separation from Rome, the formation of a German national church and an end to <b>oral</b> <b>confession,</b> priestly celibacy, Latin masses etc. During this time Johannes Czerski joined the movement. (In 1844, Czerski had resigned from his office in order to remove his congregation from the Roman Catholic Church.) A Leipzig council in 1845 brought the various congregations to a common agreement, and the number of congregations increased further to about 300. While free-thinking Protestants were sympathetic with the movement, the conservative Protestants did what they could to discourage it. Soon a split began within the movement between the more conservative Czerski and the more liberal Ronge, and an 1847 council in Berlin failed to mend it.|$|E
5000|$|The name Anabaptist means [...] "one who baptizes again". Their persecutors named them this, {{referring}} {{to the practice of}} baptizing persons when they converted or declared their faith in Christ, even if they had been [...] "baptized" [...] as infants. Anabaptists required that baptismal candidates {{be able to make a}} confession of faith that is freely chosen and so rejected baptism of infants. The early members of this movement did not accept the name Anabaptist, claiming that infant baptism was not part of scripture and was therefore null and void. They said that baptizing self-confessed believers was their first true baptism: I have never taught Anabaptism.… But the right baptism of Christ, which is preceded by teaching and <b>oral</b> <b>confession</b> of faith, I teach, and say that infant baptism is a robbery of the right baptism of Christ.

5000|$|There were {{significant}} debates on the anticlerical articles of the constitution. The liberal Constitution of 1857 already restricted the Roman Catholic Church as an institution, but the constitutional revision went even further. The 1914 Convention of Aguascalientes had already brought together victorious revolutionary factions, including Constitutionalists, Zapatistas, and Villistas, but discussions there did not center on anticlericalism. [...] However, the 1916-1917 constitutional congress had lengthy and heated debates over anticlericalism. A contention that fits {{the content of}} the debates is that for Constitutionalists anticlericalism was a nationalist rather than religious issue. [...] The Roman Catholic Church as an institution was seen to be antiliberal and antinationalist, so that [...] "the Catholic Church was an enemy of Mexican sovereignty and an obstacle to the triumph of liberalism and progress." [...] From this ideological viewpoint, the implementation of the Catholic Churchs agenda [...] "was exercised through its control of education, <b>oral</b> <b>confession,</b> etc." ...|$|E
50|$|The final signed {{confession}} by Self contained notable discrepancies; in the confession, Self stated he had dumped Shaw and Johnson's {{bodies in}} El Largo, which was over twenty {{miles from the}} marsh where police discovered the remains. Self also wrote in his confession that he strangled both girls to death, though reports from the medical examiner showed no evidence of strangulation. Three days after his confession, on June 23, 1972, Self provided further details to police in an <b>oral</b> <b>confession</b> that conflicted with his initial written confession. In an interview with Deputy Sheriff W.A. Turner and Deputy Sheriff Frank Beamer, Self claimed that he had picked up Shaw and Johnson from a Sizzler steakhouse, and that the two had driven around the El Largo neighborhood and gotten food from a local Jack in the Box restaurant. According to Beamer, Self claimed to have pulled over in a secluded area, and struck the girls {{over the head with}} a Coca-Cola bottle, and that he had stripped their clothes and thrown them on the highway; this conflicted {{with the fact that the}} girls' clothing was discovered with their remains. He then claimed to have thrown the girls' bodies in a culvert on Choate Road.|$|E
5000|$|During the Middle Ages, sexual {{activity}} was regulated very differently from now. The medieval Catholic Church regulated sex and all matters relating to sex very carefully, and often imposed harsh penances to punish wrong doers. Penances varied according to {{severity of the}} act committed, and also according to who committed the exploit. Most of the regulations were {{based on what the}} church considered sexual sins. However, due to the knowledge that people would inherently commit these sins, the church set up a system to absolve one’s sins, although enforcement sometimes wavered. Most of the sins the Catholic Church tried to fight against were based on their interpretation of the Bible, and many are still considered sins today, although they do not carry the same weight {{as they did in the}} Middle Ages. The church defined sin as a violation of any law of God, the Bible, or the church. Common sexual sins were premarital sex, adultery, masturbation, homosexuality, and bestiality. Many influential members of the church saw sex and other pleasurable experiences as evil and a source of sin, unless meant for procreation. Also, any non vaginal sex (oral, anal) in a non missionary position was frequently seen as sinful. The church considered masturbation a sin against nature because the guilty party was acting as both a man and woman. Also, law required clerics to avoid any sort of sexually tinged entertainment. However, canon law did allow sex in a marriage, as long as it intended to procreate and not just provide pleasure, even though some saw sex, even in marriage, as sinful and impure. Procreation caused no sin according to the church, as did having sex with a spouse in order to not commit adultery. Adultery, homosexuality, and masturbation were all seen as sins by the church; therefore, they also called for the vast regulation. The church also went to great lengths to control sexual practice by married couples. Sexual regulation by the church accounted for a great amount of literature and time. The church saw regulation as necessary to maintain the welfare of society. Canon law banned premarital sex, lust, masturbation, adultery, bestiality, homosexuality, and any sort of sex outside of marriage. Adultery was broken up into various categories by the Statutes of Angers: prostitution and simple fornication, adultery, defloration of virgins, intercourse with nuns, incest, homosexuality, and incidental matters relating to sex such as looks, desires, touches, embraces, and kisses. Adultery was typically grounds for divorce for a man if his wife fornicated with another, but adultery was not seen as a crime, just as a sin. Prostitution, although within the category of fornication, was less concrete in the law. Because the medieval canon law originated as an “offshoot of moral theology” but also drew from Roman law, it contributed both legal and moral concepts to canonistic writing. This split influence caused the treatment of prostitution to be more complex. Prostitution, although sinful, was tolerated. Without the availability of a prostitute, men could be led to commit a different Anger: defloration of a virgin. It was better to tolerate prostitution with all of its associated evils, than to risk the perils which would follow the successful elimination of the harlot form society. The church recognized sex as a natural inclination related to original sin, so sexual desires could not be ignored as a reality. Although the law attempted to strictly regulate prostitution, whorehouses abounded disguised as bathhouses or operated in secret within hotels and private residences. “Outside the official public brothels, prostitution in the public bathhouses, the inns and the taverns was common knowledge and was tolerated. Much of the church’s efforts were put toward controlling what was going on sexually in a marriage, especially regarding when a married couple could have sex. Sex was not allowed during pregnancy or menstruation, after a child birth, on Sunday, Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday, during each of the three Lents, feast days, quarterly ember days, or before communion. The church also denounced “unnatural” sexual relations between those of the same sex and also married couples. Also, upon marrying, a couple could not enter a church for thirty days. Due to human nature and the belief that all men sin (Romans 3:23), the Catholic Church provided means to absolve one’s sexual sins, so that they may become pure again. By applying penance to sin, the church gave people a way out. Penance was composed of 3 parts: interior sorrow, <b>oral</b> <b>confession,</b> and satisfaction through deeds. Because not all sexual sins are public, a private confession sufficed to declare one guilt free. Penances varied in length depending on what sin was committed. Adultery called for anywhere from 1 year to 15 years, depending on the confessors judgment of the sin. Adultery between two unmarried people called for a much lighter penance than that with a cleric, and even worse was fornication outside of a marriage. A 100-day penance would typically be given for one who confessed to masturbating for the first time, whereas a year would be given for a repeat offender. Also, because sex in marriage solely for pleasure was prohibited, married couples had to pray frequently for these “daily sins.” [...] Although the church developed very strict regulations on {{sexual activity}} that needed to be carried out to sustain the institutional and psychological structure of the Middle Ages, it had a hard time properly enforcing these regulations. Most violations occurred in the privacy of the bedroom, so the only witnesses to the sin were the guilty parties themselves, and they did not usually confess to such crimes. Also, the problem was widespread. Not only did the common people deviate from the rules, but the clerics themselves did not follow their own laws. In order to convict, accusation was required, and people didn’t usually have enough proof to back up an accusation, as law basically required a confession, and there was always a chance that if there was not enough proof, the accuser would be charged with false accusations. Even though the system was not foolproof, the church did produce a large number of institutions to inform the public of the law of sexual practice, and also had an extensive system of courts to deal with sexual misbehavior.|$|E
40|$|Adam Smith {{argued that}} the Catholic ‘superstition ’ of confessing sins to priests was exploitative. For Max Weber, it was also {{inferior}} to Calvinist predestination, which, by indirectly motivating self-examination, encouraged self-control and economic growth, a thesis extensively discussed at the macroeconomic level. This article looks at the microanalytics of these arguments, developing first a theory of <b>oral</b> <b>confession</b> as third-party enforcement. It proposes an adaptation argument, according to which Christian confession of sins evolved from public into auricular confession and, later, into selfexamination to efficiently provide self- and social-control. This efficient-adaptation hypothesis fits better with the empirical evidence, also explaining the modern decline of <b>oral</b> <b>confession</b> in favor of self-examination. This substitution between third- and firstparty enforcement {{is driven by the}} productivity gap of professional services, a serious case of Baumol’s disease that grows with lay education and cannot be cured with innovation, given the interpersonal nature of the service...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the historical thought of several key English reformers regarding the assimilation or rejection of different aspects of late medieval notions of the sacrament of penance during the Henrician phase of the English Reformation. It is a study primarily concerned with how notions of penance in the theology of these reformers were inherited from patristic, humanist, and continental reformers and how the evangelicals reworked them. While these reformers did not agree on all matters of theology, important points of contact can be found in how they understood the roles of contrition, confession, and satisfaction within a framework that denied the efficacy of human participation in the forgiveness of sins. There are three distinct sections. The two chapters of the first section are concerned with establishing the context of sacramental penance in the sixteenth century. The first chapter identifies distinct phases of the evolution of notions of sacramental penance from the early church through the scholastics, and the second chapter explores the theology of three important influences on the evangelicals—John Wycliffe, Desiderius Erasmus, and Martin Luther—and shows that while their views were unique, they shared important points of connection with the evangelicals in England. The second section consists of the next four chapters, which are dedicated to individual English exiled evangelicals from 1524 - 1535. Chapter three identifies Tyndale’s unique use of terminology in his redefining of the terms and rearranging of the formula of sacramental penance as he focused on the covenantal language of Christ’s blood as the satisfaction in place of human effort. Chapter four is concerned with Robert Barnes’ notion of the coexistence of contrition and confession, with <b>oral</b> <b>confession</b> occurring after forgiveness has been made. Chapter five details John Frith’s notion of repentance as related to an earthly purgation of sins and a passive, effortless turning from them. Chapter six examines George Joye’s notion of how an effective confession was to be made to God or to man. The third section comprises only one chapter (seven), and it contends that these exiles had significant influence on the later Henrician formularies, and that within them an evangelical notion of confession prevailed, particularly in the relationship of confession and purgatory, but also the understanding of the relationship between sorrow for sin and its forgiveness...|$|E
