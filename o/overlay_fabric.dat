40|$|FPGAs {{are going}} mainstream. Major {{companies}} that were not traditionally FPGA-focused are now seeking ways to exploit the benefits of reconfigurable technology and provide it to their customers. In order to do so, a debug ecosystem that provides for effective visibility into a working design and quick debug turn-around times is essential. Overlays {{have the opportunity to}} {{play a key role in}} this ecosystem. In this overview paper, we discuss how an <b>overlay</b> <b>fabric</b> that allows the user to rapidly add debug instrumentation to a design can be created and exploited. We discuss the requirements of such an overlay and some of the research challenges and opportunities that need to be addressed. To make our exposition concrete, we use two previously-published examples of overlays that have been developed to implement debug instrumentation.

40|$|Fragile fabrics in textile {{collections}} {{are subject to}} deterioration due to use, exhibition, and improper storage conditions. Textile conservators often sew sheer <b>fabrics</b> as <b>overlays</b> directly over weakened fabrics {{to protect them from}} abrasion and to help maintain the integrity of the objects. Conservators rely on subjective opinions about fabric properties in choosing materials for their overlay treatments because '-objective data are not available. Textile properties, such as abrasiveness, of sheer <b>overlay</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{play a role in the}} success of conservation treatments over time. A survey of textile conservators provided data about the u,se of <b>overlay</b> <b>fabrics</b> including criteria for selection and type of objects being treated. Cross tabulation of the data revealed trends in the use of sheer <b>overlay</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Eleven fabrics were purchased from retailers. Properties, such as yarn type and woven or knit structure, were described, and eleven different textile performance tests were run. Nylon net was significantly more abrasive than polyester georgette and polyester English net. Three nylon nets were the sheerest fabrics. Other properties o...|$|R

Built in 1909, the building was used during the early 1900s as Boeing's original manufacturing plant. Through photographs, film, oral histories, and restoration of work stations the exhibits in the Red Barn illustrate how wooden aircraft structure with <b>fabric</b> <b>overlays</b> were manufactured {{in the early years}} of aviation and provides a history of aviation development through 1958.|$|R
50|$|Its {{wing and}} {{empennage}} were aerodynamically {{similar to those}} of the Caudron Simoun, though the single-piece wing was structurally closer to that of the record-setting Rafale racer. The wing was tetragonal in plan, with more sweep on the trailing edge than on the leading edge, though the tips were semi-elliptical. It had an all-wood structure with a single box spar which incorporated an upper flange of gumbo-limbo, a Central and South American wood of particularly high bulk modulus, together with spruce and plywood ribs. The ply skin was finished with a <b>fabric</b> <b>overlay.</b> Its ailerons were carried on auxiliary spars.|$|R
40|$|A {{full-scale}} test road was constructed on US 64 between Cimarron and Ute Park, New Mexico in 1987. The {{purpose of this}} test pavement was to evaluate three new polymer modifiers used as additives in the asphalt pavement. A controlled, full-scale experiment was designed and constructed to evaluate the long-term performance of these admixtures at two levels of modification each. Control sections were constructed in conjunction with each polymer section {{resulting in a total}} of fourteen test sections in the westbound direction of the two-lane facility. In addition, test sections to compare fabric interlayer performance were added during construction in the opposite lanes. These fourteen test sections include pavement <b>overlay</b> with <b>fabric</b> as an interlayer and without fabric as an interlayer. Complete documentation of this work is contained in an earlier research paper (Shuler, et al, 1992). This paper documents the condition of the pavement test sections after eighteen years service and indicates that while differences exist in cracking performance between the different polymer modifiers, and differences between interlayer and non-interlayer sections is also present, the difference in cracking performance between the polymer modified westbound lanes and the unmodified eastbound lanes is very significant...|$|R
40|$|Pavement {{rehabilitation}} {{is rapidly}} {{becoming one of}} the most important issues facing many highway departments. Asphalt concrete overlay is one of the commonly used methods for rehabilitating deteriorated pavements. One major type of distress influencing the life of an overlay is reflective cracking. Reflective cracking in the overlay allows water to percolate into pavement structure and weaken subbase, and contributes to many forms of pavement deterioration, including increased roughness and spalling. Although these nonwoven fabrics have generally been successful in asphalt overlay applications, there is no synthesis to their performance. In the past, the role of paving fabrics to reduce reflective cracking has not been clearly evaluated. As a result, there is a lack of consistent considerations of paving fabric option in pavement management systems. In this project, applications and effectiveness of stress-relieving interlayers, known as paving fabrics, to reduce reflective cracking is synthesized. Basic functions of paving fabrics, long-term performance, and recent innovations are discussed. In addition, a survey of the current paving fabric applications in the State of Mississippi was conducted to determine the various practices and performances of the paving fabric systems to reduce reflective cracking. The field performance of <b>overlays</b> using <b>fabric</b> interlayers has generally been successful, although there have been cases where the paving fabric systems provided little or no improvements. A summary of state-of-the-art practices as well as possible directions for future research is reported...|$|R
40|$|The millenary {{construction}} of Naples produced, in the dialectic with a singular orography, a remarkable “double” condition: the mythic hypogeum spatiality {{and the city}} built above it. Moreover, in Naples {{there are two different}} spatial qualities related to this condition: the first one is related to “functional” spaces, excavated in the tuff bank for transportation of commodities, people, water and for quarrying; the second one concerning the relationship between archaeological level {{of the city and the}} quota of the current city. Napoli sotterranea – the “underground Naples” – is rich and articulated, having had different origin and uses: quarries, underground tombs, cisterns, tunnels, catacombs and a network of galleries more than one million of square metres broad that intercepted in different ways the life of the city inhabitants, first being the system for the water supply in the ancient age up to raid aid shelters during the second world war. But, as said, there is another spatial condition under the city in Naples, that is the archaeological level of the city. In fact, on one hand, the entire Greek-roman city influenced the <b>overlaying</b> urban <b>fabric,</b> today still readable and correspondent to the ancient level below; on the other hand, in a more significant way, the ancient ruins of the classical monuments often became, through foundation, appearance, incorporation, part of the new city as churches, monuments or houses, stratified over time. All these spaces, with their singular qualities, are today occasions for projects that, never as in this case, must be a wise project, able to read the ancient and produce the new...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the characteristics of}} morphing in fashion design through the documentaries on morphing and fashion. The characteristics of morphing in fine art, media, and design area were categorized as reversible metamorphosis, sequential dissolve and blurring of interpolation boundaries. The results were as follow in fashion design. Reversible metamorphosis showed an automatic silhouette transformation by remote control, the metamorphosis of folding method by wearer’s own movements and the automatic silhouette transformation by the air pressurizing method. It represented the thoughts of omnipotence as in {{the feeling of the}} magical world, the human desire for control in life, the rationalization of magical thinking and imaginative power, {{the creation of a new}} dress space and the extension of dress function. Sequential dissolve showed juxtaposition in the same area by the time order, juxtaposition in virtual space through the computer graphics, the series of fashion photography by steel cut of the dress making process and the blending of digital film and fashion design. It represented the approach for the storytelling of fashion show, implication of creative fashion design process and the creation of organic forms and the feeling of fantasy through artificial technology. The blurring of interpolation boundary showed an <b>overlay</b> of different <b>fabrics</b> with transparent boundaries, an overlay of different patterns with transparent boundaries and the blending of fabrics through the visual mixing of color. It represented the obfuscation of the object, the connotation o...|$|R
