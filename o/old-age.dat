5|$|With a {{majority}} of seats in the Labour-Protectionist government, Labour caucus by early 1908 had become restive as {{to the future of}} the Deakin minority government. With the Deakin ministry in trouble, Deakin spoke to Fisher and Watson about a possible coalition, and following a report agreed to it providing Labour had {{a majority}} in cabinet, that there was immediate legislation for <b>old-age</b> pensions, that New Protection was carried and that at the following election the government would promise a progressive land tax. No coalition was formed, however the pressure from Labour brought about productive change by Deakin: he agreed to a royal commission into the post office, <b>old-age</b> pensions were to be provided from the surplus revenue fund and £250,000 set aside for ships for an Australian Navy. New Protection was declared invalid by the High Court in June, Fisher found the tariff proposals of Deakin unsatisfactory, while caucus was also dissatisfied with the <b>old-age</b> pension proposals. Without Labour support the Deakin government collapsed in November 1908.|$|E
5|$|Convent of St. Vincent de Paul, {{operated}} by the Daughters of Charity, an order of French nuns. Housing an orphanage, <b>old-age</b> home, and a shelter for mentally and physically handicapped people, {{it was the first}} structure to be erected on Mamilla Street, in 1886. It, too, occupies its original site.|$|E
5|$|Neild {{was not a}} {{supporter}} of party discipline, refusing to follow Sir Josiah Symon's leadership of the Free Trade Senators. He spoke against the dictation test for non-British immigrants and the deportation of Kanaka workers, and continued to advocate free trade and <b>old-age</b> pensions. Having won the fifth position at the 1901 election, Neild faced re-election in 1903, and his impassioned support of the British Empire saw him elected {{at the head of}} the poll despite failing health.|$|E
5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of <b>old-age</b> pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Fisher {{returned}} {{as prime minister}} after the 1910 election, which saw Labor attain majority government {{for the first time}} in its history. Fisher's second government passed wide-ranging reforms – it established <b>old-age</b> and disability pensions, enshrined new workers' rights in legislation, established the Commonwealth Bank, oversaw the continued expansion of the Royal Australian Navy, began construction on the Trans-Australian Railway, and formally established what is now the Australian Capital Territory. At the 1913 election, however, Labor narrowly lost its House of Representatives majority to the Liberal Party, with Fisher being replaced as prime minister by Joseph Cook.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an <b>old-age</b> assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct a new reformatory at La Grange.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, <b>old-age</b> pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E
5|$|Neild {{began to}} {{encounter}} difficulties in {{his political career}} {{towards the end of}} the 1880s; his oversight of the establishment of the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office for personal gain. In 1895 he began to agitate for <b>old-age</b> pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence motion in September which brought down the Reid government.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} assume responsibility for financing social programs such as <b>old-age</b> pensions and unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory <b>old-age</b> pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{devoted his}} support {{to a variety}} of causes, {{including}} a transcontinental railway and equal pay for women. He opposed a federal <b>old-age</b> pension scheme on the grounds of lack of funds, and also opposed the Immigration Restriction Bill, although he supported the White Australia policy in principle. He opposed the proposed form of the dictation test and supported James Macfarlane's amendment requiring the test to be administered in a language known to the immigrant, moving his own amendment after Macfarlane's was defeated. He also expressed reservations about the deportation of Kanaka labourers, supporting the reduction in their use but advocating that those resident in Australia {{for at least five years}} be permitted to remain. He vigorously opposed compulsory arbitration, and voted against the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day of the oral {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out with a group of younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they were afraid that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam <b>old-age</b> home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E
5|$|The new {{voting system}} {{increased}} the socialists' influence in parliament significantly, but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party. Partly {{as a result}} of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger, the Christian People's Party, the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum novarum encyclical of 1891. This gained it considerable popular support, especially in Flanders. In 1894, the Belgian Workers' Party adopted the Charter of Quaregnon, which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979. By 1911, the party had 276,000 members, making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe. As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers' Party, Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme, including sickness compensation (from 1894), voluntary <b>old-age</b> insurance (1900) and unemployment insurance (1907). The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900.|$|E
5|$|Under Mandela's presidency, welfare {{spending}} increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and <b>old-age</b> pensions, which {{had previously been}} set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E
5|$|A land tax, {{aimed at}} {{breaking}} up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while {{coverage of the}} Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants. In addition, {{the age at which}} women became entitled to the <b>old-age</b> pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty. The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates. Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin. Eligibility for pensions was also widened. From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension. That same year, the value of a pensioner's home was excluded from consideration when assessing the value of their property.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often <b>old-age</b> retired people.|$|E

25|$|After 1982, {{there was}} a retrenchtment of the welfare system, {{especially}} regarding <b>old-age</b> pensions, unemployment benefits, and disability pensions/early retirement benefits.|$|E
25|$|By {{the advent}} of World War II, California had an <b>old-age</b> {{assistance}} law, unemployment compensation, a 48-hour work week maximum for women, an apprentice law, and workplace safety rules.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Belgium {{created a}} welfare net {{particularly}} early, {{thanks in part}} to the trade unions. Sickness compensation was established in 1894, voluntary <b>old-age</b> insurance in 1900 and unemployment insurance in 1907, achieving good coverage nationwide much more quickly than its neighbours.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, Social Security is the {{commonly}} used {{term for the}} federal <b>Old-Age,</b> Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. The original Social Security Act {{was signed into law}} by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, and the current version of the Act, as amended, encompasses several social welfare and social insurance programs.|$|E
25|$|The pratītyasamutpāda {{doctrine}} {{connects the}} Four Noble Truths to the Twelve Nidanas doctrine of Buddhism, states Ian Harris. The second truth {{is compatible with}} the twelve 'dependently originated' links from Avidya to Jaramarana (<b>old-age</b> and death). The third truth is compatible with its reversal, which results from the broken link because of an end to Avidya.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 2014, Wogan {{was a guest}} {{reporter}} on Bang Goes the Theory, on which he discussed <b>old-age</b> dementia. From 12 to 16 May 2014, Wogan appeared on the Channel 4 game show Draw It!. On 10 November 2014, in the run up to that year's Children in Need telethon, Wogan guest hosted an episode of The One Show with Alex Jones.|$|E
25|$|When Helvering v. Davis {{was argued}} before the Court, {{the larger issue}} of {{constitutionality}} of the <b>old-age</b> insurance portion of Social Security was not decided. The case was limited to whether the payroll tax was a suitable use of Congress's taxing power. Despite this, no serious challenges regarding the system's constitutionality are now being litigated, and Congress's spending power may be more coextensive, as shown in cases like South Dakota v. Dole during the Reagan Administration.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} {{of some kind}} of demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical correlation linking dropping fertility to social and economic development. Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes lead to lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes. Scholars also debate to what extent various proposed and sometimes inter-related factors such as higher per-capita income, higher female income, lower mortality, <b>old-age</b> security, and rise of demand for human capital are involved.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, Child's Allowance was introduced, payable at {{the rate}} of five shillings per week for a first for an unendowed child under 16 years {{dependent}} on an invalid or permanently incapacitated <b>old-age</b> pensioner. From July 1945 onwards, Additional Benefit for Children of five shillings per week became payable in respect of the first child to any person qualified to receive unemployment or sickness benefit having the custody, care and control of one or more {{children under the age of}} 16.|$|E
25|$|Ethel {{had never}} had children, a fact that she regretted in her <b>old-age</b> and so Willy became her {{surrogate}} child, and she loves him dearly. Willy goes everywhere that Ethel goes and so she is devastated when he is kidnapped in 1986. She searches for him everywhere and even holds a seance {{to see if she}} can contact him, but Willy is nowhere to be found. Detective Roy Quick (Douglas Fielding) works on the case and eventually finds Willy in the possession of an old Latvian refugee, who has renamed him Rasputin. Willy is returned to an overjoyed Ethel, although she has to pay the man in order to get him to relinquish ownership. Ethel has been a lifelong friend of Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Dot Cotton (June Brown) and the trio remain close in their <b>old-age.</b> They can often be found reminiscing or gossiping in The Queen Victoria public house, where Ethel also regularly thrills the punters with her repartee, her version of the cancan, or her plain sense of fun. Out of the three Ethel is the most light-hearted and she is never frightened {{to stand up to the}} over-bearing Lou and interfering Dot. She has her run-ins with both over the years, and yet their friendship endures right to the last.|$|E
25|$|The Rebbe's {{decision}} {{to move to the}} United States was not a permanent one. Throughout his travails in the Holocaust, he always had in mind the goal of settling in Israel. Toward that end, he established the Kiryat Sanz neighborhood in the beachside city of Netanya in 1958. In so doing, he was the first Rebbe to establish a Haredi neighborhood in an Israeli development town. Over the next few years, he raised money for the establishment of key neighborhood institutions, including girls' and boys' schools and yeshivas, an orphanage, and an <b>old-age</b> home.|$|E
25|$|Chelmsford has a Park & Ride {{service that}} is based at nearby Sandon, just off the A12 at Junction 18. It runs from 7am to 7pm, Monday to Saturday, with five bus stops around the city (one near High Chelmer for shopping), and charges £2.50 per adult and is free for <b>old-age</b> {{pensioners}} or people {{under the age of}} 16. An adult weekly ticket is £12.50 and Adult monthly £47.00. It has a capacity of 1,200 cars. Opened in March 2006, it has proved highly successful and is widely used.|$|E
25|$|In {{domestic}} affairs King strengthened the Liberal policy {{of increasing the}} powers of the provincial governments by transferring to the governments of Manitoba, Alberta, and Saskatchewan the ownership of the crown lands within those provinces, as well as the subsoil rights; these in particular would become increasingly important, as petroleum and other natural resources proved very abundant. In collaboration with the provincial governments, he inaugurated a system of <b>old-age</b> pensions based on need. In February 1930, he appointed Cairine Wilson as the first female senator in Canadian history.|$|E
25|$|In {{domestic}} policy, {{a number}} of social security reforms were carried out during Smuts’s second period in office as Prime Minister. <b>Old-age</b> pensions and disability grants were extended to 'Indians' and 'Africans' in 1944 and 1947 respectively, although there were differences {{in the level of}} grants paid out based on race. The Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1941 “insured all employees irrespective of payment of the levy by employers and increased the number of diseases covered by the law,” and the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1946 introduced unemployment insurance on a national scale, albeit with exclusions.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{many such}} floors are multipurpose. For instance, a {{community}} hall {{might be used}} for play groups and <b>old-age</b> groups, for dances, aerobics and sports, and for seating for plays. The floor may have to support heavy objects like pianos. There may also be requirements for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Cost of repair after damage by vandals or stiletto heels is also a consideration. Note that the necessity to serve multiple purposes can often be eased {{by the use of}} a gym floor cover to protect the floor.|$|E
25|$|Prosperity {{returned}} to Canada during the Second World War and {{continued in the}} following years, {{with the development of}} universal health care, <b>old-age</b> pensions, and veterans' pensions. The financial crisis of the Great Depression had led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a crown colony ruled by a British governor. In 1948, the British government gave voters three Newfoundland Referendum choices: remaining a crown colony, returning to Dominion status (that is, independence), or joining Canada. Joining the United States was not made an option. After bitter debate Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.|$|E
25|$|Forecasting life {{expectancy}} and mortality forms an important subdivision of demography. Future trends in {{life expectancy}} have huge implications for <b>old-age</b> support programs like U.S. Social Security and pension since the cash flow in these systems {{depends on the}} number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in pay-as-you-go systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.|$|E
25|$|The Social Security Organization is {{responsible}} for insuring employed citizens in urban areas and their dependents, {{with the exception of}} government workers. All salaried and wage workers are covered, as are self-employed persons who voluntarily join. It also insures many <b>old-age</b> pensioners. The Medical Service Insurance Organization covers government employees, students, and inhabitants of rural areas. The Imam Khomeinei Relief Foundation insures the poor who are not covered by other insurance schemes, while the Military Personnel Insurance Organization provides health insurance to members of the armed forces. Beyond these schemes, {{there are a number of}} private and semi-public insurance programs that cover the more affluent members of society.|$|E
