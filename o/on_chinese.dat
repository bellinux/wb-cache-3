5|$|Ouw Peh Tjoa was {{directed}} and produced by The Teng Chun for his company, Cino Motion Pictures. Since releasing Sam Pek Eng Tay in 1931, {{based on the}} legend of the Butterfly Lovers, The Teng Chun had released a series of films based <b>on</b> <b>Chinese</b> legends and folktales, including Pat Bie To (Eight Beautiful Women; 1932) and Pat Kiam Hiap (Eight Swordsmen; 1933). These stories were selected because the peranakan Chinese in the Indies were unable to understand Mandarin and Cantonese imports from China, but wanted to see films based <b>on</b> <b>Chinese</b> mythology. Overall, The Teng Chun's films emphasised the martial art silat and were generally profitable, allowing him to dominate the industry.|$|E

5|$|In September 2010, China {{temporarily}} blocked all {{exports of}} rare earths to Japan {{in the midst}} of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries.

A December 2010 report published by the US DoE found that the American economy vulnerable to rare-earth shortages and estimates that it could take 15 years to overcome dependence <b>on</b> <b>Chinese</b> supplies. China raised export taxes for some rare earths from 15 to 25%, and also extended taxes to exports of some rare-earth alloys that were not taxed before.

5|$|Choe's diary {{accounts}} of his travels in China became widely {{printed in the}} 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also refer to his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective <b>on</b> <b>Chinese</b> culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed in his writing represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed Chinese culture as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Kowloon was a {{skirmish}} between British and Chinese vessels off the Kowloon Peninsula, China, on 4 September 1839.

The skirmish was the first armed conflict of the First Opium War and occurred when British boats opened fire <b>on</b> <b>Chinese</b> war junks enforcing a food sales embargo on the British community. The embargo was ordered after a local Chinese man died in a drunken brawl with British sailors. The Chinese authorities did not consider the punishment meted out by British officials to be sufficient and as a result, suspended food supplies {{in an attempt to}} force the handover of the culprit. In response, the British summoned nearby warships to force the Chinese to lift the embargo.|$|E
