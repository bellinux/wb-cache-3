25|$|Fiscal {{incentives}} in <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> and low-tax jurisdictions favour the British Crown dependencies, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Ireland as tax-optimizing routes for channelling {{equity and}} capital investments into India. Widespread use of favourable double-taxation bilateral treaties and Special purpose entity structures (Structured investment vehicle held Off-balance-sheet) substantially distorts statistical data on business relations between India and individual member States of the EU28.|$|E
500|$|Thanks to {{specialisation}} {{in a few}} high-return sectors, at {{purchasing power}} parity Jersey has high economic output per capita, substantially ahead {{of all of the}} world's large developed economies. Gross national income in 2009 was £3.7 billion (approximately £40,000 per head of population). However, this is not indicative of each individual resident's purchasing power, and the actual standard of living in Jersey is comparable to that in the United Kingdom outside central London. The island is recognised as one of the leading <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> The growth of this sector however has not been without its controversies as Jersey has been characterised by critics and detractors as a place in which the [...] "leadership has essentially been captured by global finance, and whose members will threaten and intimidate anyone who dissents." [...] In June 2005 the States introduced the Competition (Jersey) Law 2005 to regulate competition and stimulate economic growth. This competition law was based on that of other jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|The BVI Business Companies Act {{is based}} largely on New Zealand company law, but has been {{modified}} to include many of the characteristic features of <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> (such as removing restrictions on financial assistance and thin capitalisation, and permitting distribution in specie). [...] It has also adopted some slightly novel and radical steps, such as abolishing the concept of share capital and rules relating to share premium. [...] Some of these developments were a little advanced even for the offshore market, and have taken some time to bed down. [...] The Act has now been copied wholesale by the Isle of Man, and {{it remains to be}} seen if the act becomes as widely copied as the old International Business Companies Act.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> (OFC) is a small, low-tax {{jurisdiction}} {{specializing in}} providing corporate and commercial services to non-resident offshore companies, {{and for the}} investment of offshore funds. The term was coined in the 1980s. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> as [...] "a country or jurisdiction that provides financial services to nonresidents {{on a scale that}} is incommensurate with the size and the financing of its domestic economy." [...] Although information is still limited, there is strong evidence that OFCs captured a significant amount of global financial flows and functions both as back doors and partners of leading <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> especially since the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|An <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre,</b> {{although}} not precisely defined, {{is usually a}} small, low-tax jurisdiction specialising in providing corporate and commercial services to non-residents {{in the form of}} offshore companies and the investment of offshore funds.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> {{also provide}} {{registrations}} for ships (notably Bahamas and Panama) or aircraft (notably Aruba, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands).|$|E
5000|$|Although most <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> {{originally}} rose {{to prominence}} by facilitating structures which helped to minimise exposure to tax, tax avoidance {{has played a}} decreasing role {{in the success of}} <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> in recent years. Most professional practitioners in offshore jurisdictions refer to themselves as [...] "tax neutral" [...] since, whatever tax burdens the proposed transaction or structure will have in its primary operating market, having the structure based in an offshore jurisdiction will not create any additional tax burdens.|$|E
50|$|Views of <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> {{tend to be}} polarised. Proponents {{suggest that}} reputable <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> play a {{legitimate}} and integral role in international finance and trade, and that their zero-tax structure allows financial planning and risk management and makes possible some of the cross-border vehicles necessary for global trade, including financing for aircraft and shipping or reinsurance of medical facilities. Proponents point to the tacit support of offshore centres by {{the governments of the}} United States (which promotes <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> by the continuing use of the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC)) and United Kingdom (which actively promotes offshore finance in Caribbean dependent territories to help them diversify their economies and to facilitate the British Eurobond market). Opponents view them as draining tax revenues away from developed countries by allowing tax arbitrage, and rendering capital flows into and out of developing countries opaque. Very few commentators express neutral views.|$|E
50|$|In Malaysia, {{the term}} Federal Territory (Malay: Wilayah Persekutuan) {{is used for}} the three territories governed {{directly}} by the federal government, namely Kuala Lumpur (national capital), Putrajaya (federal government administrative centre) and Labuan (international <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} most major forms of {{taxation}} in the Territory {{has led to}} the country being included on most recognised lists of tax havens, although the jurisdiction prefers to style itself as a modern <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{pressure}} groups suggest that <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> engage in [...] "unfair tax competition" [...] by having no, or very low tax burdens, and {{have argued that}} such jurisdictions {{should be forced to}} tax both economic activity and their own citizens at a higher level. Another criticism levelled against <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> is that while sophisticated jurisdictions usually have developed tax codes which prevent tax revenues leaking from the use of offshore jurisdictions, less developed nations, who can least afford to lose tax revenue, are unable {{to keep pace with the}} rapid development of the use of offshore financial structures.|$|E
5000|$|The FATF {{blacklist}} or OECD blacklist {{has been}} {{issued by the}} Financial Action Task Force since 2000 and lists countries which it judges to be non-cooperative in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, calling them [...] "Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories" [...] (NCCTs). Although non-appearance on the blacklist was perceived to be a mark of approbation for <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> (or [...] "tax havens") who are sufficiently well regulated to meet all of the FATF's criteria, in practice the list included countries that did not operate as <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres.</b> The FATF updates the blacklist regularly, adding or deleting entries.|$|E
50|$|From 1991 the Act {{was remarkably}} {{successful}} generating {{large numbers of}} incorporations.

50|$|Small {{countries}} or city-states that are extremely reliant {{on international trade}} are sometimes called entrepôts, which typically engaged in the re-export of products produced elsewhere, or finance and services (see <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre).</b> Modern-day examples include Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai.|$|R

5000|$|With its {{connotations of}} {{financial}} secrecy and tax avoidance, [...] "tax haven" [...] {{is not always}} an appropriate term for <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres,</b> {{many of which have}} no statutory banking secrecy, and most of which have adopted tax information exchange protocols to allow foreign countries to investigate suspected tax evasion.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, the International Monetary Fund {{calculated}} {{based on}} Bank for International Settlements data that for selected <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres,</b> on-balance sheet cross-border assets held in <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> reached {{a level of}} $4.6 trillion {{at the end of}} June 1999 (about 50 percent of total cross-border assets). Of that $4.6 trillion, $0.9 trillion was held in the Caribbean, $1 trillion in Asia, and most of the remaining $2.7 trillion accounted for by the major international finance centres (IFCs), namely London, the U.S. IBFs, and the Japanese offshore market. [...] The U.S. Department of Treasury estimated that in 2011 the Caribbean Banking Centers, which include Bahamas, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Netherlands Antilles and Panama, held almost $2 trillion dollars in United States debt. Of this, approximately US$1.4 trillion is estimated to be held in the Cayman Islands alone.|$|E

50|$|In 1994, two Australian {{real estate}} {{developers}} presented schemes to the Vanuatu government involving the sale of Vanuatu passports to investors. In the first, real estate developer John Avram and his Melbourne-based associates suggested developing an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> on Moso Island with its own bank, casino, companies registrar, financial markets, and through it to offer Vanuatu residency and citizenship to business investors. The scheme was approved but never came to fruition. Later in the same year, the Olilian group proposed attracting roughly 3,000 wealthy Asian investors by establishing an <b>offshore</b> <b>financial</b> <b>centre</b> and free trade zone with commercial, hotel, medical, and residential facilities at Luganville {{on the island of}} Espiritu Santo and offering Vanuatu passports to investors. However, the promoters were charged with fraud the following year, and the scheme failed.|$|R
