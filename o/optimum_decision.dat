40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{we propose}} novel {{decision}} support system (DSS) named OPEC-DSS to support OPEC’s decisions on oil production level. OPEC-DSS is based on two important factors in oil prices; the first is OPEC oil production level (OPEC-PL) {{and the second is}} USA oil imports level (USA-IL). The OPEC-DSS support the analysers and decision-makers in three following issues: 1) OPEC-DSS can propose the <b>optimum</b> <b>decisions</b> on OPEC-PL and USA-IL. 2) It can illustrate the strategies stabilizing the oil prices. 3) OPEC-PL can calculate the optimum OPEC-PL when USA-IL has been determined. The proposed system is based on Game Theory (GT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In GT model, OPEC plays with USA, as one of the major purchaser, to reach the maximum payoff formed by ANN. In fact the ANN is oil price predictor applied by the game model. The Nash Equilibrium Point(s) (NEPs) of the game is the <b>optimum</b> <b>decisions</b> and the strategies, fixing the oil prices, can be extracted by payoff function. According to the experimental results, the model can be used for decision-making in production, imports and exports of crude oil...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the <b>optimum</b> <b>decision</b> rule for an m-interval oddity task in which m- 1 intervals contain the same signal {{and one is}} different or odd. The <b>optimum</b> <b>decision</b> rule depends {{on the degree of}} correlation among observations. The present approach unifies the different strategies that occur with "roved" or "fixed" experiments (Macmillan & Creelman, 1991, p. 147). It is shown that the commonly used decision rule for an m-interval oddity task corresponds to the special case of highly correlated observations. However, as is also true for the same-different paradigm, there exists a different <b>optimum</b> <b>decision</b> rule when the observations are independent. The relation between the probability of a correct response and d′ is derived for the three-interval oddity task. Tables are presented of this relation for the three-, four-, and five-interval oddity task. Finally, an experimental method is proposed that allows one to determine the decision rule used by the observer in an oddity experiment...|$|E

40|$|<b>Optimum</b> <b>decision</b> fusion in the {{presence}} of malicious nodes - often referred to as Byzantines - is hindered by the necessity of exactly knowing the statistical behavior of Byzantines. By focusing on a simple, yet widely studied, set-up in which a Fusion Center (FC) is asked to make a binary decision about a sequence of system states by relying on the possibly corrupted decisions provided by local nodes, we propose a game-theoretic framework which permits to exploit the superior performance provided by <b>optimum</b> <b>decision</b> fusion, while limiting the amount of a-priori knowledge required. We first derive the <b>optimum</b> <b>decision</b> strategy by assuming that the statistical behavior of the Byzantines is known. Then we relax such an assumption by casting the problem into a game-theoretic framework in which the FC tries to guess the behavior of the Byzantines, which, in turn, must fix their corruption strategy without knowing the guess made by the FC. We use numerical simulations to derive the equilibrium of the game, thus identifying the optimum behavior for both the FC and the Byzantines, and to evaluate the achievable performance at the equilibrium. We analyze several different setups, showing that in all cases the proposed solution permits to improve the accuracy of data fusion. We also show that, in some instances, it is preferable for the Byzantines to minimize the mutual information between the status of the observed system and the reports submitted to the FC, rather than always flipping the decision made by the local nodes as it is customarily assumed in previous works...|$|E

40|$|Under the {{prevailing}} financial constraints and rapid infrastructure deterioration, funding decisions for renewal (rehabilitation) projects have become large challenges for engineers and economists alike. However, existing prioritization and ranking methods suffer from serious drawbacks of not considering multi-year and multi funding scenarios. Moreover, optimization {{efforts in the}} literature employ sophisticated mechanisms without providing a structured strategy or justification behind the funding solution. To overcome these drawbacks and to arrive at optimum and economically justifiable infrastructure funding decisions, this research provides a decision support system by adopting well-established concepts from the science of Microeconomics that relate to Consumer Theory and Behavioural Economics. The new decision support system has been developed with two components: (1) an enhanced benefit-cost analysis (EBCA) heuristic approach that arrives at <b>optimum</b> <b>decisions</b> by targeting equilibrium among the different renewal expenditure categories, using the equal marginal utility per dollar concept; and (2) a visual what-if analysis inspired by the indifference maps concept to study the sensitivity of decisions under different budget levels. The developed decision support system has been validated {{through a number of}} case studies including a case study were different categories of assets (pavements, bridges) are co-located. The results proved the capability of the system to arrive at <b>optimum</b> funding <b>decisions</b> supported with economic justification. Using the behavioural economic concept of “Loss-aversion”, this research also compared the strategy of minimizing loss against the typical strategy of maximizing gain in the infrastructure funding decisions. In essence, this research is aiming at improving this crucial infrastructure funding problem by integrating the two worlds of microeconomics and asset management. Such integration will help provide <b>optimum</b> funding <b>decisions,</b> increase the credibility of funding methods to the public, and justify the spending of tax payer’s money on infrastructure rehabilitation projects...|$|R
