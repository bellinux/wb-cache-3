50|$|Many {{applications}} use two-fluid nozzles {{to achieve}} a controlled small drop size over a range of operation. Each nozzle has a performance curve, and the liquid and gas flow rates determine the drop size. Excessive drop size can lead to catastrophic equipment failure or may have an adverse effect on the process or product. For example, the gas conditioning tower in a cement plant often utilizes evaporative cooling caused by water atomized by two-fluid nozzles into the dust laden gas. If drops do not completely evaporate and strike a vessel wall dust will accumulate, resulting in the potential for flow restriction in the <b>outlet</b> <b>duct,</b> disrupting the plant operation.|$|E

After passing through the first stage turbine wheel, the gas was redirected by the stator blades and entered the second stage turbine wheel. The gas then left the turbine through exhaust ducting, passed through the heat exchanger, and exhausted into the thrust chamber through a manifold directly above the fuel inlet manifold. Power from the turbine was transmitted {{by means of a}} one-piece shaft to the pump. The velocity of the LOX was increased through the inducer and impeller. As the LOX entered the outlet volute, velocity was converted to pressure and the LOX was discharged into the <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> at high pressure.|$|E

50|$|No {{official}} statement was made after that decision, but Ralph Robin, {{managing director of}} Rolls-Royce and board member of IAE, indicated problems with the low-pressure system posed {{a serious threat to}} deliver the engine in 1992. Airbus was formally notified about the technical risk in mid-March. He insisted that the problems IAE faced at the same time with the high-pressure compressor of the V2500 were not connected to the SuperFan delay. IAE also contended that the SuperFan was not more than an engineering study and they never committed to develop that engine. Nevertheless, further studies of the geared turbofan concept were announced.In contradiction to IAE's understanding of the SuperFan as an engineering study, the vice chairman of the Lufthansa board, Reinhardt Abraham, made clear that the Lufthansa board had received verbal as well as written confirmations that the SuperFan was a fixed development program. He admitted that Lufthansa had realized the risks in the SuperFan program but had relied on the experience and reputation of the IAE shareholding companies. When asked for the delay's reason, he revealed that in a meeting at the beginning of 1987 IAE presented several technical problems that had arisen: not only the gearbox was mentioned, but also the variable-pitch mechanism and the bypass <b>outlet</b> <b>duct.</b> But in Abraham's opinion these problems could have been solved by investing more, he blamed the problems with the V2500 high-pressure compressor as the trigger to cancel the SuperFan. This assumption is supported by the fact, that a core engine which is optimized for a conventional turbofan, can not be used for a geared turbofan without extensive modifications to prevent compressor surge during low thrust ratings.When {{it was clear that the}} SuperFan would not be available, Airbus decided to offer the CFM56-5C on the A340. In order to achieve comparable performance data to the SuperFan-powered version, the wingspan was extended by 2.6 meters to allow a larger fuel capacity.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} created to address an {{important}} issue currently faced by test facilities measuring static pressure for air-conditioning and heat pumps. Specifically, ASHRAE Standard 37, the industry standard for test setup, requires an <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> of a certain length, based on the unit outlet geometry, and this ducting added to the unit height {{may result in a}} test apparatus height that exceeds psychometric test room dimensions. This project attempted to alter the <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> in a way that reduces the test apparatus height while maintaining the reliability of the ASHRAE Standard 37 testing setup. The investigation was done in two scenarios, the first, which altered the direction of the flow after the unit with an elbow and measured static pressure downstream of the elbow, and the second which inserted a passive resistive piece in the flow to decrease the required distance between the unit and the static pressure measurement. Three air handling units were used in Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 testing, with the two smallest units additionally being tested in Scenario 1 with an over-sized duct. The scenario tests were required to be within 5 % power and 2. 5 % airflow of a baseline test following ASHRAE Standard 37. he results for Scenario 1 have shown that ASHRAE Standard 37 can be modified to reduce testing height restrictions by using a square elbow with turning vanes, provided it is oriented in a specific way in relation to the blower. Furthermore, additional Scenario 1 testing on the over-sized <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> shows that possibilities exist for using a single over-sized duct to successfully meet ASHRAE Standard 37 testing conditions when testing a variety of units. Finally, the results of Scenario 2 have shown that the height constraints of the <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> can be reduced by installing a passive resistive device consisting of a mesh at the outlet; however, this approach applies only to those units with the heat exchanger located downstream of the blower.

The study showed that vortex strength, generator scale, and secondary flow field structure have a complicated and interrelated influence on the engine face distortion, over and above the initial geometry and arrangement of the generators. The installed vortex generator performance was found to be a function of three categories of variables: the inflow conditions, the aerodynamic characteristics associated with the inlet duct, and the design parameters related to the geometry, arrangement, and placement of the vortex generators within the <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> itself...|$|E

A zonal RANS/LES approach is introduced for the simulation: the region of interest at tip is computed with full large-eddy simulation (LES), while Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) is used at inner radii. Detailed comparisons with the experiment show that the simulation gives a good description of the flow. In the region of interest at tip, a remarkable prediction of the velocity spectrum is achieved, over about six decades of energy. The simulation precisely captures both the tonal and broadband contents. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the simulation allows identifying a tip-leakage vortex (TLV) wandering, whose influence onto the spectrum is also observed in the experiment. This phenomenon might be due to excitation by upstream turbulence from the casing boundary layer and/or the adjacent TLV. It may be a precursor of rotating instability.

40|$|Linear {{acoustic}} network {{models are}} commonly used to characterize the acoustic behaviour of flow duct systems. In such a model, each element is represented, independent of the elements up- and downstream, by a so-called acoustic two-port. The behaviour of the complete system can be retrieved by simple matrix multiplications from the two-port representations of the individual components. Although this characterization approach is limited to low frequencies, below the traversal cut-on frequency of the inlet and outlet ducts, it allows making an in-depth analysis of the acoustic transmission properties of a duct system and its components. The accuracy of the two-port characterization of an acoustic element depends solely on a plane wave decomposition in its in- and <b>outlet</b> <b>duct.</b> The established linear multiple microphone technique computes the wave amplitudes from measured pressure fluctuations at two or more axial positions in the in- and outlet ducts.

40|$|International audienceTurbofan {{broadband}} noise {{prediction is}} a major concern for industry and probably the most challenging issue for Aeroacoustic community. The dominant source mechanism is attributed to the rotor turbulent wakes impacting on the outlet guide vanes. Unsteady computations of the full rotor-stator stage are generally out of reach so that interaction noise is commonly assessed using analytical models (related to Amiet's theory) and averaged turbulence characteristics issued from a steady RANS calculation and isotropic homogeneous turbulence assumption. However these models are questionable to accurately describe the turbulent rotor wakes characterized by a non-uniform spatial distribution stretched in the flow direction. Thus, a hybrid method based on a 3 -D Zonal Detached Eddy Simulation of the flow around a single rotor blade is investigated to provide a full description of the turbulent wakes directly used in the Amiet-based code. The reliability of this approach is checked thanks to the comparisons of turbulent velocity and acoustic spectra respectively with hot-film probe and microphone measurements performed in Snecma engine test rig. A quite good agreement is shown between numerical and experimental turbulent velocity spectra and also the von Karman spectrum model, when mean turbulence characteristicsare well adjusted. Moreover, sound pressure and power spectra in the <b>outlet</b> <b>duct</b> predicted by ZDES-Amiet coupling are reasonably close to the available measurements, and not so far from RANS-based ones...|$|E

In addition, based on combining the TEM with the boundary element method (BEM) by establishing the pressure and its derivative continuum conditions on the inlet and outlet surface, the sound radiation from the inlet and <b>outlet</b> of <b>ducts</b> can also be investigated. Finally, the effects of various interactions between the sound source and acoustic treatment have been discussed in this survey. The numerical examples indicate that it is quite important to consider the effect of such interactions on sound attenuation during the acoustic design of aeroengine nacelle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental work on concurrent active {{noise and vibration}} control for a ventilation duct. The active noise control system is used to reduce the air-borne noise radiated via the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> whereas the active vibration control system is used to both reduce the structure-borne noise radiated by the duct wall and to minimise the structural feed-through effect that reduces {{the effectiveness of the}} active noise control system. An elemental model based on structural mobility functions and acoustic impedance functions has been developed to investigate the principal effects and limitations of feed-forward active noise control and decentralised velocity feedback vibration control. The principal simulation results have been contrasted and validated with measurements taken on a laboratory duct set-up, equipped with an active noise control system and a decentralised vibration control system. Both simulations and experimental results show that the air-borne noise radiated from the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> can be significantly attenuated using the feed-forward active noise control. In the presence of structure-borne noise the performance of the active noise control system is impaired by a structure-borne feed-through effect. Also the sound radiation from the duct wall is increased. In this case, if the active noise control is combined with a concurrent active vibration control system, the sound radiation by the <b>duct</b> <b>outlet</b> is further reduced and the sound radiation from the duct wall at low frequencies reduces noticeably...|$|R
