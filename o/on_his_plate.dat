He auditioned for the second season because he still wanted to see how far he could push himself. He says being on the show was [...] "a life-altering experience." [...] The hardest part, for him, was the lack of food; he lost [...] while filming the series. Back at home after the show, he says he never leaves food <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> and reminds himself every day of how he has a bed to sleep in and home to live in. he cites patience, emotional strength, the will to live, and physical strength as the things which allowed him to get through the show.|$|E

2500|$|By 1861 William, not Catherine, {{agreed to}} the {{conditions}} of sale, {{but he was still}} negotiating a reduction in price for his lots until 1871. [...] He felt he should get the reduction that had been previously offered to his wife and his neighbors of $3.00 an acre. [...] Catherine died on Sept 26th 1865 before these negotiations were finalized. [...] In the end he paid $5.00 an acre. [...] Finally, he received the deeds for Lots 32 and 33. [...] By then he was living on Lot 33, along with Catherine’s mother Mary KaKaKe and her children, Martha and Moses, whom he'd been taking care of since Mary’s husband disappeared. [...] He was also supporting his own younger children and his grandchildren by his daughter, Sophia Staves, who had died in 1875.

2500|$|On 12 December 1995, Goss {{called the}} poll for 3 February 1996, {{pleading}} with {{voters in the}} electorate to end the political instability [...] "bedevilling" [...] the state. He said the date would give voters the [...] "shortest campaign possible and the earliest opportunity" [...] to make their choice, acknowledging that the 1995 result was [...] "a kick in the pants", but insisting the Government had learned its lesson. Both the Coalition and Labor campaigns asked their parties' Federal leaders {{to stay away from}} the campaign in order that state and federal issues not become conflated. Goss told the Sunday program that he felt [...] "there's a bit of an 'It's Time' factor developing" [...] for Prime Minister Paul Keating, and that if he was to lose the poll, [...] "I'll accept the responsibility for that and it won't be any southern politician who's been here." [...] Meanwhile, Liberal campaign director Jim Barron believed federal Opposition Leader John Howard had [...] "got enough <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> anyway" [...] and that there was [...] " [...] necessity to bring in other key political figures from outside the State." ...|$|E

We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>plate.</b> He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
