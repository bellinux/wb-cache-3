5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises the problem <b>of</b> <b>how</b> (<b>and</b> whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious {{that she could not}} adequately describe him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires an understanding <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>and</b> why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E

It was published by Broadside Books, a division of HarperCollins. Research for the book was conducted by the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit investigative research organization founded by Peter Schweizer and Steve Bannon and funded by billionaires Robert Mercer and the Koch Brothers, among others. It has been adapted into both a film and a graphic novel.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his great}} wealth, David Astor lived modestly, putting his money {{to good use}} through a network of benefactions and charities. Although he proved a {{brilliant}} editor, he lacked the drive for profits like other newcomers to the business who took advantage to increase rapidly both their advertising and circulation {{at the expense of}} The Observer. When The Daily Telegraph launched a Sunday edition in 1961 it changed what had been a staid industry and the ensuing battles for advertising changed the character <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>and</b> what newspapers were all about. The aggressive marketing by The Sunday Times under Canadian newspaper tycoon Roy Thomson hurt circulation while the paper's unions were making repeated demands that drove costs to a point where the operation became an unsustainable business.|$|E
25|$|Thorntoun {{house and}} estate {{was part of}} the ancient Barony of Robertoun and is first {{recorded}} as belonging to a branch of the Montgomeries, descended from Murthhaw Montgomery, who is mentioned in the Ragman's Roll of 1296. A Johne of Montgomery of Thornetoun is mentioned in a legal document of 1482. By the beginning of the 17th century Thorntoun had passed into the ownership of another ancient and renowned Ayrshire family, the Mures, a branch of the Mures of Rowallan Castle near Kilmaurs. Some confusion exists in the surviving records, for either an Archibald or a James Mure , Burgess of Glasgow, married Margaret, daughter of Robert Ross of Thorntoun on 27 June 1607. Nothing is known <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>and</b> when this Ross family came to possess Thorntoun. A Hew Muir was one of their sons, and another, James Muir of Thorntoun, married a Janet Naper, who died in 1626. Robert Muir, son of James & Janet, is mentioned in a document of 1634.|$|E

25|$|From {{the sociological}} perspective, group {{processes}} scholars study how power, status, justice, and legitimacy impact {{the structure and}} interactions that take place within groups. Group processes scholars study how group size affects the type and quality of interactions that take place between group members, an area of study initiated {{by the work of}} the German social theorist, Georg Simmel. Dyads consist of two people and triads consist of three people, and the fundamental difference is that one person who leaves a dyad dissolves that group whereas the same is not true of a triad. The difference between these two types of groups also indicates the fundamental nature of group size, which is that every additional member of a group increases the group's stability but also decreases the possible amount of intimacy or interactions between any two members. Groups are also distinguished in terms <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>and</b> why the members know each other, and this stems from whether they are members of primary groups consisting of close friends and family held together by expressive ties; secondary groups consisting of coworkers, colleagues, classmates, etc. held together by instrumental ties; or reference groups consisting of people who do not necessarily know or interact with each other but who use each other for standards of comparison for appropriate behaviors. Group processes researchers also study interactions between groups, such {{as in the case of}} Muzafer Sherif's Robbers Cave Experiment.|$|E

[...] He commented, [...] "it should be clear that a reader seeking a single, nonredundant and objective account of targeted killing should find another book. On the other hand, this collection of essays provides several original and useful treatments of various aspects of the subject." [...] Sofaer said that the book could have given more weight to the law enforcement model <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>and</b> when to use deadly force against individuals.|$|E

500|$|Season four {{also sees}} the writers {{exploring}} teenage sexuality through him, {{in a small}} arc with Faith, with whom Steven S. DeKnight compares him in their characterization of misguided youth with superpowers; and the overarching arc with his father's love Cordelia. Jeffrey Bell states Arthurian Legend's animosity between King Arthur, his son Mordred, and their love triangle with Guinevere as inspiration for the Connor-Cordelia-Angel plot line. Whedon notes that while he already has decided that Cordelia and Connor {{were going to have}} sex, the story had to be changed and move faster because Charisma Carpenter became pregnant. The Cordelia plot line additionally gave writers opportunity to explain Connor's birth via Jasmine, a character brought in to replace Carpenter as final villain. Taking Jasmine as a base point the writers started connecting back the dots they'd set up in previous seasons. In the words of DeKnight, [...] "It's always been the big mystery <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>and</b> why Darla and Angel have a child, 'cause vampires are sterile. We find out this miracle birth was created kind of like a secret ingredient all planned out to sleep with Cordelia and create this superbeing." ...|$|E
