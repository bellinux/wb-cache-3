5|$|The legend tell of {{the demon}} Malla {{and his younger}} brother Mani, who had gained the boon of invincibility from Brahma, {{creating}} chaos on the earth and harassing the sages. When the seven sages approached Shiva for protection after Indra and Vishnu confessed their incapability, Shiva assumed the form (Avatar) of Martanda Bhairava, as the Mahatmya calls Khandoba, riding the Nandi bull, leading an army of the gods. Martanda Bhairava is described as shining like the gold and sun, covered in turmeric also known as Haridra, three-eyed, with a crescent moon on his forehead. The demon army was slaughtered by the gods and finally Khandoba killed Malla and Mani. While dying, Mani offers his white horse to Khandoba as an act of repentance and asks for a boon. The boon is that he be present in every shrine of Khandoba, that human-kind is bettered and that he be given an offering <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> flesh. The boon was granted, and thus he was transformed into a demigod. Malla, when asked by the deity if he asked for a boon, asks for the destruction of the world and human-flesh. Angered by the demon's request, Khandoba decapitates him, and his head falls at the temple stairs where it will trampled by devotees' feet. The legend further describes how two Lingas appeared at Prempuri, the place where the demons were killed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{elucidate}} whether CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk {{was able to}} inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine [interleukin (IL) - 17 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α], RAGE, and caspase- 3 expression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) rats. A total of 24 Wistar female rats, were randomly assigned into four groups: control group (C), CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk group (CM), CFA-induced RA-rats group (RA), and the RA group treated by CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk (RAM). The severity of erythema and swelling in lower extremities were counted by scoring. IL- 17, TNF-α, RAGE, and caspase- 3 expression in synovial membranes were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and western blotting. Erythema and swelling in the RA group was significantly attenuated by goat's milk CSN 1 S 2 (p    0. 05). Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of IL- 17, RAGE, TNF-α, and caspase- 3 {{were higher in the}} RA group compared with the control group. CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk decreased RAGE and TNF-α expression, but increased the IL- 17 and caspase- 3 expression. In conclusion, CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk decreased erythema, swelling, and inflammation in lower extremities. The CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk also decreased TNF-α and RAGE expression in the synovial membrane of ankle joints. Unfortunately, CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk may induce the production of IL- 17. Therefore CSN 1 S 2 protein <b>of</b> <b>goat's</b> milk may provide a nutritional therapy for attenuating the inflammation found in rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R

25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. The cooked pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E

Another tradition, claims that the origin of the word Khatik has been derived from the Hindi word khat, which, means an immediate killing.

While other sources claim that the word khatik is said to have originated from the Sanskrit word kathika, which means to butcher or hunter.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Oaxaca {{is based on}} agriculture, {{especially}} {{in the interior of}} the state. Only 9% of the territory is suitable for agriculture due to the mountainous terrain, so there are limits to this sector. The production of food staples, such as corn and beans, is mostly for internal consumption but this production cannot meet demand. The total agricultural production of the state was estimated at 13.4million tons with a value of 10,528 million pesos in 2007. As of 2000, 1,207,738 hectares are used for the raising of crops, most of which occurs during the annual rainy season, with only 487,963 having crops growing year round. Only 81,197 hectares have irrigation. The variation of climate allows for a wider range of agricultural crops than would otherwise grow in a geographical region of this size. Oaxaca is the nation's second highest producer of grains and agave. It is third in the production of peanuts, mango and sugar cane. It is the second largest producer <b>of</b> <b>goat</b> meat, providing about 10% of the national total. In the more temperate areas crops such as corn, beans, sorghum, peanuts, alfalfa and wheat are grown. In more tropical areas, crops also include coffee, sesame seed, rice, sugar cane and pineapple.|$|E
25|$|Of {{wild species}} of ungulate, deer are the {{preferred}} prey family. In {{a study in}} the Italian Alps, the most common prey species of all was the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), which made up 32.2% of nest remains. The roe deer was also a prominent prey item in the French Pyrenees (14.9%) and Switzerland (14.6%), respectively. In several parts of the Scottish Highlands, red deer (Cervus elaphus) are eaten with some regularity, the maximum representation there being 22.3% of prey remains in the Northwest Highlands. In North America, several deer species, but mainly mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawns, were significant in the diet in Washington state (14.3%) and California (12.7%). Around the Himalayas, the small white-bellied musk deer (Moschus leucogaster) is reportedly a favorite prey item (though no quantitative analysis are known). In the near Arctic regions of Scandinavia, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) of both semi-domestic and wild stock are fed on with some regularity; one study in northern Sweden found reindeer formed 11.4% of prey items. In the northernmost stretches of Alaska, golden eagles are more scarce than in equivalent areas of Scandinavia and only occasionally hunt wild reindeer. However, golden eagles were reportedly the most prolific predator of neonatal calves from the Porcupine caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) herd of central Alaska. Partial moose (Alces alces) remains have been found at a nest in Sweden. Live fawns and carrion probably comprise most of the golden eagle's consumption of deer (certainly in larger-bodied species such as red deer). Among wild bovids, eagles are reportedly the main predator of Saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) calves in Mongolia and are regularly reported to take chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) and Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) calves in Europe. Mongolian gazelles (Procapra gutturosa) comprised about 15% of the remains found at a nest in Mongolia. Up to seven wild species <b>of</b> <b>goat,</b> five other wild species of sheep and at least two wild gazelle species are confirmed golden eagle prey. In North America, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are occasionally hunted.|$|E
