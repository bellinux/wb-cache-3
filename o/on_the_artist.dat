5|$|Clarkson's {{book had}} an {{important}} influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> J. M. W. Turner, who displayed a painting at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1840 entitled The Slave Ship. The painting depicts a vessel from which a number of manacled slaves have been thrown into the sea, to be devoured by sharks. Some of the details in the painting, such as the shackles worn by the slaves, {{appear to have been}} influenced by the illustrations in Clarkson's book. The painting was shown at an important time in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide, as the Royal Academy exhibition opened one month before the first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The painting was admired by its owner, John Ruskin. It has been described by the 20th-century critic Marcus Wood {{as one of the few}} truly great depictions in Western art of the Atlantic slave trade.|$|E

25|$|Heinrich Wölfflin was not {{the only}} scholar to invoke {{psychological}} theories in the study of art.

Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably homosexual.|$|E

25|$|From 1943 and 1944, Xul’s {{painting}} {{was influenced by}} his thoughts of the Second World War.

25|$|The {{fact that}} Warhol's {{homosexuality}} influenced {{his work and}} shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> and {{is an issue that}} Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (e.g., Popism: The Warhol 1960s). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of Liza Minnelli, Judy Garland, and Elizabeth Taylor, and films such as Blow Job, My Hustler and Lonesome Cowboys) draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence's friends {{asked the}} Scottish poet Thomas Campbell {{to write the}} artist's biography, but he passed the task on to D.E. Williams whose two rather {{inaccurate}} volumes were published in 1831. It would be nearly 70 years later, in 1900, before another biography of Lawrence appeared, this time by Lord Ronald Gower. In 1913 Sir Walter Armstrong, {{who was not a}} great admirer of Lawrence, published a monograph. The 1950s saw the publication of two further works: Douglas Goldring's Regency portrait painter, and Kenneth Garlick's catalogue of Lawrence's paintings (a further edition was published in 1989). Sir Michael Levey, curator of the National Portrait Gallery's 1979–80 Lawrence exhibition, produced books <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> in 1979 and 2005. Lawrence's entanglements with the Siddons family {{has been the subject of}} three books (by Oswald Knapp, André Maurois, and Naomi Royde-Smith) and a recent radio play.|$|E

500|$|To {{capitalize}} on Monk's popularity with intellectual and bohemian fans from venues {{such as the}} Five Spot Café, Riverside released Misterioso and reissues of his older records with designs referencing 20th century works of art. The album's cover art is a reproduction of Giorgio de Chirico's 1915 painting The Seer, which was originally painted {{as a tribute to}} French poet Arthur Rimbaud. Monk biographer Robin Kelley argued that, because Rimbaud had [...] "called <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> to be a seer in order to plumb the depths of the unconscious in the quest for clairvoyance", the painting was the best choice for the cover: [...] "The one-eyed figure represented the visionary; the architectural forms and the placement of the chalkboard evoked the unity of art and science—a perfect symbol for an artist whose music has been called 'mathematical.'" [...] According to musicologist Robert G. O'Meally, the cover reflected [...] "the mysterious violations of convention of perspective, the silences, and oddly attractive angles (the overall futuristic quality) in Monk's music".|$|E

2500|$|Louis Kenton {{was the son}} of a {{flour and}} grain {{salesman}} from Philadelphia.

Kenton married Eakins's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Macdowell, on May 31, 1899. Eakins gave the painting to his sister-in-law by 1901, so it may well have been intended as a marriage portrait. The marriage was brief and not happy, with notes from Susan Macdowell Eakins's diaries indicating that Kenton was physically violent.|$|E
