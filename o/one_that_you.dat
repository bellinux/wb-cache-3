500|$|All {{but two of}} {{the drum}} tracks are {{composed}} of samples performed by drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig. Because Ó Cíosóig was suffering from physical and personal problems during the album's recording, samples of various drum patterns {{that he was able to}} perform in his condition were recorded. According to Shields, [...] "t's exactly what Colm would have done, it just took longer to do." [...] Ó Cíosóig recovered enough to play live on two of the album's songs, [...] "Only Shallow" [...] and [...] "Touched", the latter of which was composed and performed entirely by the drummer. Shields believes that listeners are unable to tell the difference between Ó Cíosóig's live drumming and the drum loops aside from the tracks intended to have an obviously [...] "sampled" [...] sound, like the dance-oriented [...] "Soon". The album makes extensive use of samples, with Shields stating, [...] "Most of the samples are feedback. We learnt from guitar feedback, with lots of distortion, that you can make any instrument, any <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can imagine".|$|E

[...] He later declares [...] "that he is a changed man who can now be trusted" [...] as shown in the lines, [...] "Take me as I am / Not who I was / I'll promise I'll be / The <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can trust." [...] During the chorus, Brown sings [...] "So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because it could get ugly / before it gets beautiful." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown [...] "sings in his signature semi-high pitch", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Holly Frith of Entertainment Wise noted that Rihanna [...] "may be the inspiration" [...] for the lyrics.
