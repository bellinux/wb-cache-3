500|$|On 18 June 1999, Ackah {{anonymously}} telephoned Brent social services, expressing {{concern over}} Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer {{who received the}} call at the <b>One</b> <b>Stop</b> <b>Shop</b> at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, {{and what happened to}} it was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of [...] "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" [...] the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make sure her concerns were being addressed. Ackah said that she was told by the person {{on the other end of}} the telephone that [...] "probably they [...] had done something about it". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted [...] "a significant missed opportunity" [...] to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events [...] "wholly unbelievable". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it [...] " [...] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's [...] "inept handling" [...] of a genuine child protection case.|$|E

40|$|In many markets, the {{unplanned}} retail centre (also {{known as}} the downtown, town, city or strip centre) continues to lose market share to the planned shopping centre. Rejuvenation strategies focusing on infrastructure and aesthetic design, recreational appeals, promotion and a managed approach have met with mixed success. Many of these strategies revolve around improving how the unplanned centre offers its merchandise. A more direct alternative is the actual composition of businesses in a retail centre, and what they offer shoppers. There are four attributes of a retail centre's composition that determine its appeal; the number of merchants, the merchandise-mix, its major attractors, {{and its ability to}} provide for <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> <b>shopping.</b> This study provides statistical insight into the composition offered by a sample of 38 planned centres and 33 unplanned centres. Across all four attributes the planned centre was found to enjoy a significant advantage. These findings pose a major problem for the unplanned centre. Its inability to provide for <b>one</b> <b>stop</b> <b>shopping</b> offers little appeal to convenience-oriented shoppers. Similarly, its lack of major attractors is unlikely to draw the other important shopper typology, the leisure-oriented consumer...|$|R
