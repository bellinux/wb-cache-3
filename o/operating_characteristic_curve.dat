50|$|Receiver <b>Operating</b> <b>Characteristic</b> <b>Curve</b> Explorer and Tester (ROCCET) is an open-access {{web server}} for {{performing}} biomarker analysis using ROC (Receiver <b>Operating</b> <b>Characteristic)</b> <b>curve</b> analyses on metabolomic data sets. ROCCET is {{designed specifically for}} performing and assessing a standard binary classification test (disease vs. control). ROCCET accepts metabolite data tables, with or without clinical/observational variables, as input and performs extensive biomarker analysis and biomarker identification using these input data. It operates through a menu-based navigation system that allows users to identify or assess those clinical variables and/or metabolites that contain the maximal diagnostic or class-predictive information. ROCCET supports both manual and semi-automated feature selection {{and is able to}} automatically generate a variety of mathematical models that maximize the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker(s) while minimizing the number of biomarkers used in the biomarker model. ROCCET also supports the rigorous assessment of the quality and robustness of newly discovered biomarkers using permutation testing, hold-out testing and cross-validation.|$|E

The optimal thresholds of twitch pressure and thickening fraction to predict {{failure of the}} spontaneous breathing trial were, respectively, 7.2  cmH 2 O and 25.8 %, respectively. The receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>curves</b> were 0.80 (95 % CI 0.70 – 0.89) for twitch pressure and 0.82 (95 % CI 0.73 – 0.93) for thickening fraction. Both receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>curves</b> were similar (p[*]=[*] 0.83). A twitch pressure value lower than 11  cmH 2 O (the traditional cutoff for diaphragm dysfunction) predicted failure of the spontaneous breathing trial with a sensitivity of 89 % (95 % CI 72 – 98 %) and a specificity of 45 % (95 % CI 30 – 60 %).|$|R

40|$|Meta-analyses {{are popular}} tools to {{summarize}} the results of publications. Prognostic performances of a marker are usually summarized by meta-analyses of survival curves or hazard ratios. These approaches may detect a difference in survival according to the marker but do not allow evaluation of its prognostic capacity. Time-dependent receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>curves</b> evaluate {{the ability of a}} marker to predict time-to-event. In this article, we describe an adaptation of time-dependent summary receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>curves</b> from published survival curves. To achieve this goal, we modeled the marker and the time-to-event distributions using non-linear mixed models. First, we applied this methodology to individual data in kidney transplantation presented as aggregated data, in order to validate the method. Second, we re-analyzed a published meta-analysis, which focused on the capacity of KI- 67 to predict the overall survival of patients with breast cancer...|$|R

50|$|A {{well-known}} statistical problem {{arises when}} ascertaining rates for disorders and conditions {{with a relatively}} low population prevalence or base rate. Even assuming that lay interview diagnoses are highly accurate in terms of sensitivity and specificity and their corresponding area under the ROC curve (that is, AUC, or area under the receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve),</b> a condition with a relatively low prevalence or base-rate is bound to yield high false positive rates, which exceed false negative rates; in such a circumstance a limited positive predictive value, PPV, yields high false positive rates even in presence of a specificity which {{is very close to}} 100%.|$|E
50|$|Sensitivity {{therefore}} quantifies the avoiding {{of false}} negatives, and specificity {{does the same}} for false positives. For any test, there is usually a trade-off between the measures - for instance, in airport security since testing of passengers is for potential threats to safety, scanners may be set to trigger alarms on low-risk items like belt buckles and keys (low specificity), {{in order to increase}} the probability of identifying dangerous objects and minimize the risk of missing objects that do pose a threat (high sensitivity). This trade-off can be represented graphically using a receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>curve.</b> A perfect predictor would be described as 100% sensitive, meaning all sick individuals are correctly identified as sick, and 100% specific, meaning no healthy individuals are incorrectly identified as sick. In reality, however, any non-deterministic predictor will possess a minimum error bound known as the Bayes error rate.|$|E

40|$|PET using 18 F-FDG is {{increasingly}} {{used for the}} diagnosis and grading of tumors. Several studies have been performed that evaluate the diagnostic and grading performance of 18 F-FDG PET for soft-tissue sarcoma, but each study has had a limited sample size. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis of the evidence. Methods: Relevant studies were iden-tified from MEDLINE and EMBASE. Diagnostic and grading performance were evaluated for qualitative visualization; stan-dard uptake value (SUV, cutoffs of 2. 0 and 3. 0); and metabolic rate of glucose (MRG, cutoff of 6. 0 mol/ 100 g/min). Quantita-tive data synthesis included independent weighting of sensitiv-ity and specificity, construction of summary receiver <b>operating</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>curves,</b> and pooled analyses. Results: The meta-analysis included 15 studies with 441 soft-tissue lesions (227 malignant, 214 benign).
