5|$|De Hauteclocque {{arrived in}} London on 25 July 1940, {{and met with}} de Gaulle, who {{announced}} that he was promoting him to Chef d'escadrons (major). He also encountered his cousin Pierre de Hauteclocque, Xavier's brother, who was serving with the 13e Demi-Brigade de Légion Étrangère (13e DBLE, an infantry regiment of the French Foreign Legion). This was the largest unit that had joined the Free French Forces. After participating in the Battles of Narvik, it had found itself in Britain when France surrendered. Formed after the war began, it contained many men who had fought for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War, and many refugees from Nazi and Fascist countries. De Hauteclocque then offered his <b>own</b> <b>services</b> to the unit, but its commander, Colonel Raoul Magrin-Vernerey, rejected his offer on the grounds that he was high-born, over-qualified and a cavalryman.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} about vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings, {{the problems of}} compensating the many thousands of people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might accidentally break through into Hell, construction began in 1860. The new railway was built beneath the existing New Road, running from the Great Western Railway's terminus at Paddington to Farringdon and the meat market of Smithfield. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its <b>own</b> <b>services</b> and acquiring other local railways in the areas north and west of London.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, Arnold sent {{a letter}} {{accepting}} Clinton's terms and proposing a meeting to André through yet another intermediary: William Heron, {{a member of the}} Connecticut Assembly whom he thought he could trust. In an ironic twist, Heron went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his <b>own</b> <b>services</b> to the British as a spy. He then took the letter back to Connecticut, suspicious of Arnold's actions, where he delivered it {{to the head of the}} Connecticut militia. General Parsons laid it aside, seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion. Four days later, Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of the wife of a prisoner of war. Eventually, a meeting was set for September 11 near Dobb's Ferry. This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river fired on his boat, not being informed of his impending arrival.|$|E

5|$|The MR grew steadily, {{extending}} its <b>own</b> <b>services</b> and acquiring {{other local}} railways {{north and west}} of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he wanted to unify a string of companies to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin negotiated {{to take control of}} the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and extend the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London were poor, and although still roundabout, the scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.|$|E

SENAPA was composed of 15 constituent companies and 10 operational units.

25|$|Although {{the trading}} {{position}} was buoyant in the mid-1840s, as railways developed and improved their <b>own</b> <b>services,</b> the canal lost traffic heavily {{as the years}} passed. Thomson says that the Blackhill inclined plane was only used for about 37 years (i.e. until about 1831) but this is completely inconsistent with traffic volumes, and Hutton's statement that it worked until 1887 is more convincing. From that time the declining traffic volume did not require the continued use of the inclined plane, and after standing idle for some years it was finally scrapped.|$|E

Regular services there are still offered in English {{under the auspices of}} the Church of Scotland. The Huguenots accounted for nearly 20% of Amsterdam's inhabitants in 1700. Being Calvinists, they soon integrated into the Dutch Reformed Church, though often retaining their own congregations. Some, commonly referred by the moniker 'Walloon', are recognisable today as they offer occasional services in French.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the age of}} {{the motor}} vehicle many Hospital Boards ran their <b>own</b> <b>services.</b> From 1957 to 1990 the Hospital Act stipulated that Hospital Boards had to provide an {{ambulance}} service. Many contracted that out to St John or had ad hoc arrangements with them, often for after hours staffing. When the Hospital Act was replaced by Health Boards, many of these Boards saw this as a chance to avoid being responsible and subsequently St John took over from many Boards (e.g. Thames, Bay of Plenty, Wanganui, Palmerston North, Waipawa, Dannevirke, Nelson, West Coast, Ashburton, Southland). Marlborough stayed a Hospital-based service until 2007 and Taranaki until 2011. Wairarapa was the last region with a hospital-based service, ceasing in March 2012 and being taken over by Wellington Free Ambulance.|$|E

He returned to Denver and shifted into publishing; in 1897 he sold his entire stock of negatives and his <b>own</b> <b>services</b> to the Detroit Publishing Co. (formerly called the Detroit Photographic Company, owned by William A. Livingstone), after the company had acquired the exclusive ownership and rights to the photochrom process in America. Jackson joined the company in 1898 as president - just when the Spanish–American War gained the nation's fervent interest - bringing with him an estimated 10,000 negatives which provided {{the core of the}} company's photographic archives, from which they produced pictures ranging from postcards to mammoth-plate panoramas.|$|E

25|$|The Christ Church {{building}} {{survived the}} war with relatively little structural damage compared to other Winchester churches, perhaps due to the vestry's accommodations. Nonetheless, parishioners were appalled that the wardens allowed it {{to be used by}} Episcopal Union chaplains, and conducted their <b>own</b> <b>services</b> in private homes on Sundays and Wednesdays, or attended Lutheran or Presbyterian services to avoid seeing Union worshipers. Union Generals Philip H. Sheridan and George A. Custer were attended Christmas services at Christ Church in 1864. The building did suffer smashed windows, since it was used as a jail at least once (for captured Confederates, as were the Lutheran and Presbyterian churches), and perhaps as a hospital by both armies. Religious services were relatively rare. By 1864, of 96 communicants, at least 77 were women. Moreover, during the war at least 1400 soldiers who died at hospitals in town were buried in the relatively new Episcopal cemetery at Mt. Hebron (the cemetery itself starting as a Lutheran cemetery though when that church burned down in 1853 four additional denominations including Presbyterians and Episcopalians established adjacent cemeteries there).|$|E
25|$|On 27 October 1971 {{the country}} {{changed its name}} from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Republic of Zaire, and Air Congo changed its name to Air Zaïre. In the same year, the airline placed an order for three Boeing 737-200s, and {{occasionally}} operated Lockheed L-100 Hercules on lease from the Zairean government for cargo operations. The airline ordered two McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and five Boeing 737s on 3 January 1973. The DC-10s were delivered to the airline in 1973, and in February 1973, the airline announced that it was to acquire a Boeing 747-100. The 747 was operated on a lease and was only operational with the airline for approximately a year. It was during this period that Zairean President Mobutu gained renown for commandeering aircraft belonging to the airline in order to transport himself and his entourage on shopping trips to Europe. In the spring of 1973, it was reported that when travelling to West Germany, Mobutu requisitioned the Boeing 747 for himself, and utilised one of the airlines' DC-10s to transport his wife, leaving the airline short of jets for its <b>own</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
