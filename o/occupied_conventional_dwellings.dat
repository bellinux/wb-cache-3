This paper presents a numerical investigation of airflow and heat transfer in the slot-vented room with the radiant floor heating unit.

Spatial distributions of indoor air temperature and velocity, as well as the heat transfer rates along the radiant floor and the outer wall, have been presented and analyzed covering the domains from complete natural convection to forced convection dominated flows. The numerical results demonstrate that the levels of average temperature in the room with lateral slot-ventilation are higher than those without slot-ventilation, but lower than those in the room with ceiling slot-ventilation. Overall, the slot-ventilation room with radiant floor heating unit could offer better indoor air quality through increasing the indoor air temperature and fresh air exchanging rate simultaneously. Concerning the airborne pollutant transports and moisture condensations, the performance of radiant floor heating unit will be further optimized in our future researches...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{modelling}} and {{simulation of}} the effects of electric fields on a single spherical cell are undertaken. Of interest is the effect that different electric field waveforms have on the induced transmembrane potential of the cell and by consequence the electropermeabilization of the cell membrane in terms of pore density or the fraction of the cell area that the pores <b>occupy.</b> <b>Conventional</b> biotechnology processes of electroporation make use of unipolar electric field pulses, which are known to generate undesirable conditions such as asymmetrical electropermeabilization. These electrical protocols also contribute to lower efficiencies in electroporation based applications (in terms of uptake of molecules in the cell) by being sensitive to cell radii. Until recently, theoretical models of electroporation have lagged behind the experimental research. In order to optimize the efficiency of electroporation, {{it is important to consider}} as many biological and physical aspects as possible and it is a necessity that a variety of electric pulse parameters be tested. Thus a comprehensive model which can predict electropermeabilization as a result of any form of applied electric field and other important electroporation parameters is necessary. None of the existing theoretical modelling studies present simulations of dynamic electroporation modelling as a cell response to bipolar electric field wave-shapes. Developing such a model is the aim of this thesis. In this thesis two numerical models are developed. These models consider electroporation as a dynamic process and include the non-linear dynamic effects of membrane electropermeabilization. The first model assumes all pores are identical and small (0. 76 nm radius) and is capable of simulating transmembrane potential and pore density temporally and spatially, given any form of applied electric field and other important electroporation system parameters such as external medium, membrane, and cytoplasm complex dielectric properties. The piece-wise step response model presented here is used to simulate cell response to several different applied electric field wave-shape pulses. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{the logic}} {{operations}} <b>occupied</b> in <b>conventional</b> carry select adder (CSLA) and BEC-based carry select adder (CSLA) i. e., binary to excess- 1 converter based carry select adder {{are estimated to}} study the data dependence and to identify redundant logic operations. We have removed all the redundant logic operations included in the conventional CSLA and proposed a new logic formation for CSLA. In the proposed idea, the carry select (CS) function is planned before the calculation of final-sum which is unlike from the conventional approach. Bit patterns of two expecting carry words (corresponding to cin = 0 and 1) and fixed cin bits are used for logic optimization of CS and generation units. A capable CSLA design is obtained using improved logic units. The proposed carry select adder (CSLA) design involves considerably less area and delay than the recently proposed BEC-based carry select adder. Due to the slight carry-output delay, the proposed CSLA design is a good nominee for square-root (SQRT) CSLA. A theoretical estimate shows that the proposed SQRT-CSLA involves nearly 35 % less area–delay–product (ADP) than the BEC-based SQRT-CSLA, which is finest between the existing SQRT-CSLA designs, for the different input bit-widths.

40|$|AbstractFormation of the blastocoel in earlyXenopusembryos was {{studied with}} a novel biotin-permeability assay and newly {{generated}} tight junction markers. The blastocoel forms at the first cleavage division since functional tight junctions which excluded biotin and established a segregated intraembryonic compartment were found at the 2 -cell and all subsequent developmental stages. Unexpectedly, tight junctions before the 64 -cell stage were not at their normal apical positions, but were found deep in the embryos, up to 200 μm from the apical surface. In these positions, the tight junctions left large areas of ion permeable lateral membranes exposed to the extraembryonic environment, explaining why electrophysiological experiments record a decrease in embryonic input resistances concomitant with early cleavage stages. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the recessed tight junctions did not influence the distribution of C-cadherin and Na+,K+ATPase. Both markers were present apical to recessed tight junctions, indicating that the maintenance of polarization of these basolateral markers does not require tight junctions. With further development, tight junctions assumed an increasingly apical location until, by the 2000 -cell stage, they <b>occupied</b> their <b>conventional</b> positions between the blastomeres at the apical/lateral membrane boundaries...|$|R

In this report, we provide mechanistic insight into the inhibitory complex formation of the lipid mediator sphingosylphosphorylcholine with calmodulin, the most central and ubiquitous regulator protein in calcium signaling. We applied crystallographic, thermodynamic, kinetic, and spectroscopic approaches using purified bovine calmodulin and bovine cerebral microsomal fraction to arrive at our conclusions. Here we present 1) a 1. 6 -Å resolution crystal structure of their complex, in which the sphingolipid <b>occupies</b> the <b>conventional</b> hydrophobic binding site on calmodulin; 2) a peculiar stoichiometry-dependent binding process: at low or high protein-to-lipid ratio calmodulin binds lipid micelles or a few lipid molecules in a compact globular conformation, respectively, and 3) evidence that the sphingolipid displaces calmodulin from its targets on cerebral microsomes. We have ascertained the specificity of the interaction using structurally related lipids as controls. Our observations reveal the structural basis of selective calmodulin inhibition by the sphingolipid.

6000|$|Carlyle's message may {{be summed}} up in two imperatives,--labor, and be sincere. He lectured and wrote chiefly for the upper classes who had begun to think, {{somewhat}} sentimentally, of the conditions of the laboring men of the world; and he demanded for the latter, not charity or pity, but justice and honor. All labor, whether of head or hand, is divine; and labor alone justifies a man as a son of earth and heaven. To society, which Carlyle thought to be <b>occupied</b> wholly with <b>conventional</b> affairs, he came with the stamp of sincerity, calling upon men to lay aside hypocrisy and to think and speak and live the truth. He had none of Addison's delicate satire and humor, and in his fury at what he thought was false he was generally unsympathetic and often harsh; but we must not forget that Thackeray--who knew society much better than did Carlyle--gave a very unflattering picture of it in Vanity Fair and The Book of Snobs. Apparently the age needed plain speaking, and Carlyle furnished it in scripture measure. Harriet Martineau, who knew the world for which Carlyle wrote, summed up his influence when she said that he had [...] "infused into the mind of the English nation ... sincerity, earnestness, healthfulness, and courage." [...] If we add to the above message Carlyle's conceptions of the world as governed by a God of justice who never forgets, and of human history as [...] "an inarticulate Bible," [...] slowly revealing the divine purpose, we shall understand better the force of his ethical appeal and the profound influence he exercised on the moral and intellectual life of the past century.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{accepts the}} biblical story as factual and {{supports}} an [...] "early" [...] Exodus hypothesis, {{prior to a}} biblical date posited as ca. 1440 BCE. According to the author, [...] "The Exodus was in fact two separate exoduses. The first exodus followed a 1628 BCE. Minoan eruption that produced {{all but one of}} the first nine plagues. The second exodus followed an eruption of a volcano off the Aegean island of Yali almost two centuries later, creating the tenth plague of darkness and a series of tsunamis that … drowned III and the pursuing Egyptian army." [...] Sivertsen's account would fit chronologically with the conquest of Jericho and suggests that the Israelites were in Canaan before the end of the sixteenth century BCE. Per this view, the first exodus occurred ca. 1628 BCE. As a result, it is possible that the Israelites were indeed at Jericho when City IV was destroyed ca. 1550 BCE. Also, according to this view, the Israelites and the Hyksos are separate groups of people, and the first Exodus from Egypt occurred before the expulsion of the Hyksos. As a result, this interpretation of the exodus does not suffer from the difficulties that come from identifying the Israelites with the Hyksos rulers of Egypt. This book advocates the High Egyptian Chronology which dates the reign of Thutmose III to the time period from 1504 BCE to 1450 BCE rather than the time period from 1479 BCE to 1425 BCE that it <b>occupies</b> in the <b>Conventional</b> Egyptian chronology. Sivertsen also argues that the mummy from the Deir el-Bahri cache in the Valley of the Kings that was labeled as Thutmose III is actually the mummy of a different person. As a result, it is possible that the second exodus occurred in 1450 BCE (which is close to the traditional early date of 1447 BCE) and it is also possible that the reign of Thutmose III ended at the time of this exodus.|$|R
40|$|The thesis investigates {{perceptions}} {{of climate change}} (CC) among stakeholders within Norwegian and German energy sector, {{and the implications of}} climate perception for personal behaviour. The main focus of investigation is to examine how climate change is perceived in all its aspects: causes, consequences, measures, policies {{and the role of the}} individual confronted with its challenges. The background is to examine how the increasingly dramatised threat of climate change is received and treated by individuals who are daily employed with energy issues, as the energy sector represents one of the major challenges when it comes to solving the problem of climate change. Energy production based on fossil fuels is one of the major contributors to green house gas (GHG) emissions in the developed and newly developing countries, where 70 % of the CO 2 emissions emerge by the production and consumption of energy. Based on one of the core assumptions of institutional theory, which claims that institutions affect policy and hence the flow of history, the climate perceptions among these respondents may be a neglected factor in the account for the main obstacles to a transition of the current energy systems in Norway and Germany from a fossil-fuel based into a renewable one. The thesis’ major theoretical approach is explanation-based theory, which emphasises the importance of studying (and comparing) cases within a context. A sample of twenty experts from public and private energy institutions in Norway and Germany was used as a case study. The public institutions present in the thesis are some of the central institutions within the energy sector in both countries. Their areas of responsibility reach from electricity production, power grids, and renewable energy to petroleum production. The private institutions are large scale energy companies involved in electricity and petroleum production. Qualitative interviews are used as the primary research method. A comprehensive literature review of official documents and previous research on the energy sector in Norway and Germany was nevertheless necessary to create a contextual background against which the empirical findings are analysed. In order to maintain the claim of full anonymity with respect to person and institution, the findings are analysed according to three groups of institutions. The first group consists of institutions that are primarily <b>occupied</b> with <b>conventional</b> energy – here defined as not (new) renewable energy – production, analysis and politics etc; the second includes institutions whose focus is more on renewable energy and climate policy. To simplify, I called them the public/energy group and the public/environment group. The private companies made up the last group; i. e. the private group. The findings reveal that there are major disparities among the respondents’ climate and energy perceptions, and that group (and sector) belonging is more important for the interviewees’ CC perception and behaviour than their nationality. The public/energy group is mainly constituted of individuals that are sceptical about climate change and critical towards the official climate policies. They do not regard it as a personal responsibility to reduce GHG emissions individually, and have hence not undertaken measures to do so in their private lives. Contrary to the public/energy group, the public/environmental group reflects the outspoken political agenda and expresses confidence in the reports from the international panel on climate change (IPCC). The respondents in this group also stress the individual’s potential for action, and detail about their personal efforts to become more climate friendly. The private group interviewees are all clear that they regard the threat of climate change as real, but they are not as idealistic as the environmental group when it comes to undertake measures in their private lives. Even though the sample is too small to be generalised, the findings imply that the public/energy group may represent an obstacle for the implementation of major emission reduction measures in Norway and Germany. The fact that the public/energy and private group hold diverging climate perceptions opposes previous research that account for the historical inter-linkages between the two groups. This may be explained with the role of business and industry in the climate negotiations. Other studies have shown that private actors turned from being climate sceptical and lobbying against the creation of binding negotiations into being pro-climate after the signing of the Kyoto protocol. Another explanation can nevertheless be that the respondents from the public/energy group are the persons with the most knowledge about the actual potentials for energy saving, efficiency and development of renewable energy in Norway and Germany. Faced with the enormous challenge of reducing GHG emissions in our highly energy dependent societies, this may make them conclude that the task is infeasible and hence lead towards a denial of the anticipated climate crisis...|$|R
