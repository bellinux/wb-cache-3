5000|$|The use {{of digital}} badges as {{credentials}} remained largely {{under the radar}} until 2011, following the release of [...] "An <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> System Framework," [...] a white paper authored by Peer 2 Peer University and The Mozilla Foundation. In the paper, badges are explained as [...] "a symbol or indicator of an accomplishment, skill, quality or interest," [...] with examples of badge systems used by the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, PADI diving instruction, and the more recently popular geo-locative games, like Foursquare. The report asserts that badges [...] "have been successfully used to set goals, motivate behaviors, represent achievements and communicate success in many contexts" [...] and proposes that when learning happens across various contexts and experiences, [...] "badges can have a significant impact, {{and can be used}} to motivate learning, signify community and signal achievement." [...] The report also makes clear that the value of badges comes less from its visual representation than from the context around how and why it was conferred. The stronger the connection between the two, the more effective the badging system will be. [...] "Badges are conversation starters," [...] the report explains, [...] "and the information linked to or 'behind' each badge serves as justification and even validation of the badge." [...] For example, a badge should include information about how it was earned, who issued it, the date of issue, and, ideally, a link back to some form of artifact relating to the work behind the badge.|$|E

40|$|Open Badges is an {{open source}} code concept {{developed}} by the Mozilla Foundation to identify the learner's knowledge and skills and to display them in a modern way. Although the concept was originally meant to display informal learning, {{it can also be}} applied to formal education. Indicating competences electronically makes it possible to display competences for which traditional certificates are unsuitable. It also enables completely new features such as a restricted validity period for a certificate. The <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> concept also can make education marketing more effective, and it might be thought as a future solution for identifying competences acquired earlier when moving from one study level to another. The Master Studies in Mathematical Information Technology at the Kokkola University Consortium Chydenius participates in the <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> Factory project consortium launched in 2014. The consortium is developing an application that will enable the creation, management and issuance of skill badges in accordance with the <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> concept. The consortium is also piloting the application and the <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> concept in connection with higher education.

They can be stored in various online environments, including the Mozilla 'Backpack' and social media platforms. <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> have been used to evidence informal learning, professional development, community and voluntary work. This study is part of an ongoing project at a UK Higher Education Institution (HEI) to evaluate the potential of awarding Digital <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> in different contexts across the institution. It was decided to trial <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> on a programme run by Learning Development staff in the Library to support high achieving students, acknowledging and rewarding soft-skills acquired as part of the programme. Central {{to the success of the}} scheme was ‘buy-in’ from the students themselves; in order that the <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> had meaning and value to the recipients, a Participatory Design approach was adopted to engage students in the development process. Participatory Design is an iterative methodology that 'attempts to examine the tacit, invisible aspects of human activity' (Spinuzzi, 2005, p. 164) and incorporates them into co-produced systems. Soft-skills are an important complement to formal education in the 21 st Century workplace (Devedžić et al., 2015). Measuring and rewarding ‘soft-skills’ such as; critical thinking, communication, leadership and team-working, has proved problematic in the past. Key objectives were to establish a set of soft-skills metrics and, a sustainable approach to acknowledging the acquisition of those skills. This presentation will discuss the outcomes from the study, including an assessment of the sustainability of <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> as a mechanism for rewarding soft-skills acquisition in an informal setting...|$|R

40|$|For {{several decades}} {{members of the}} American Evaluation Association have {{discussed}} and disputed the issue of evaluator certification. Our past inability {{to agree on a}} certification solution may have been partially caused by the weaknesses of traditional certification systems, which rely on candidates obtaining a degree and completing a comprehensive exam. In this article we propose a certification system based on digital open badges. The <b>open</b> <b>badge</b> framework uses a top-down design to structure and understand the certification process as micro-certification units. These types of systems are adaptable and clearly communicate the evidence of knowledge, skill, and experience represented by the credential. The potential benefits of using an <b>open</b> <b>badge</b> infrastructure make this an enticing option and viable solution for the AEA to establish policy and practice regarding an efficient, rigorous and credible way to certify evaluators.

40|$|It can be {{difficult}} to gain recognition for skills and experience acquired in informal as well as some formal settings. To solve this, Mozilla developed a credential-issuing platform for what they call <b>Open</b> <b>Badges.</b> Mozilla (n. d.) explained that “Badges provide a way for learners to get recognition for [skills gained in these settings], and display them to potential employers, schools, colleagues and their community ” (Mozilla, n. d.). <b>Open</b> <b>badges</b> are an example of a disruptive innovation. Christensen, Horn, and Johnson (2011) explained that disruptive innovations are products that are able to satisfy the need of an untapped market that was not currently being served by the more established and costly products. <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> are marketed towards the non-consumption areas of education. For example, <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> reward the informal acquisition of skills and achievements that are not being recognized in today’s formal educational system.

In addition, widespread initiatives such as Mozilla’s <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> Framework expand {{the potential of}} badging {{into the realm of}} open education. In this paper, we explicate the concept of open badges. We highlight some of the ways that researchers have examined badges as part of educational practice and also highlight the different definitions of open-ness that are employed in popular and scholarly thought. By considering badges from three different perspectives (motivation, pedagogy, and credential) and the concept of openness from three different perspectives (production, access and appropriation) we develop a framework to consider the tensions where these competing conceptions meet. This explication illuminates how the ideas of open and badges intersect, and clarifies situations where these concepts come into direct conflict or mutually enhance each other. Our analysis pinpoints and elucidates particular areas where research is needed to better understand the complex phenomenon of open badges, and also offers design considerations for developers, educators, and organizations that are actively involved in open badges...|$|E
40|$|Creativity is now {{an exposed}} trait. This {{is due to the}} high need for innovation, {{original}} and useful solutions that serve the development of the organization, their effective market entry and long-term survival. This publication is a collection of papers prepared under The First National Conference “CREATIVE VIBES.

No one would argue that creativity is an incentive to innovation and change which boosts the growth of economy. The question behind this statement is how to direct creativity into success and development of organisations? In the context of research on creativity, this paper aims to introduce the concept of Open Badges – a standard of describing and documenting skills, competences and achievements gained anywhere and anytime.

50|$|Online or digital badges are not {{dissimilar}} to {{the concept}} of the Europass CV. <b>Open</b> <b>badges</b> do however challenge the existing practices in a more radical manner, in that the process is much more decentralized and removed from the traditional quality assurance bodies:A digital badge is an online representation of a skill you’ve learned. <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> take that concept one step further, and allows you to verify your skills, interests and achievements through credible organizations. And because the system is based on an open standard, you can combine multiple badges from different issuers to tell the complete story of your achievements - both online and off. Display your badges wherever you want them on the web, and share them for employment, education or lifelong learning.A key criticism of <b>open</b> <b>badges,</b> such as those developed by Mozilla, is that they lack a credible quality assurance component. On the positive side, <b>open</b> <b>badges</b> are free and allow for the inclusion of various forms of learning, including non-formal and informal learning.|$|R
40|$|Open online {{learning}} courses such as cMOOCs and xMOOCs differ from conventional courses yet it remains uncertain how, and if, existing common yet costly practices associated with teacher-driven formative and summative assessment strategies {{can be made}} to work in this new context. For courses that carry no charge for registration or participation, authors of open online courses have to consider alternative approaches to engaging, motivating and sustaining study and for helping participants manage, plan and demonstrate their own learning. One such approach is that of open badges or similar such visual public symbols that communicate to others a particular quality, achievement or affiliation possessed by the owner. This paper reports the role, reception and use of open badges in two ‘massive’ open online courses delivered in 2013 with attention to varied functions of badges and the a distinction between formative and summative applications. The paper will then draw upon data from end of course surveys, which specifically asked about badges, pre-course surveys, and user comments made during the course on platforms such as Twitter to examine what value participants ascribed to the open badges. Although there was found to be a broadly positive response to badges in both MOOCs, the reasons for this were often very different, and approximately a quarter of respondents remained sceptical or concerned about their role. The paper concludes by reflecting on the <b>open</b> <b>badge</b> as a formative instrument for providing the learner with an indication of progress and achievement...|$|E

The "Mindergie" {{game has}} been {{designed}} and tested {{at the main campus}} of the Open Universiteit {{in the context of the}} project “Energy Conservation Behaviour Toolkit - Incentive Mechanisms for effective decrease of energy consumption at the workplace” which has been funded from May 2012 – November 2012 from the SURFnet Innovation grant for sustainable ICT solutions. The game about energy consumption and conservation at the workplace has been scripted and played using the ARLearn toolkit. The main purpose was to provide the users with useful information on the What, Why, and How as well as to motivate them to get involved and committed. The game was played in weekly rounds structured around certain topics. The first week started with an introduction to the game and the technologies used to play it. The second and third week were then mainly about electricity and respectively gas consumption and conservation at the workplace. Finally the fourth week dealt with individual consumption footprints and alternative conservation strategies. The main items that could be found in the rounds were: information, actions, and challenges. All the items appeared in the ARLearn message list or opened automatically when they became available. From time to time users were asked to answer questions, either as part of an item or in the course of quizzes. Usually when answering questions, read information, perform actions, or master challenges new items appeared. Users did not have to do everything at once. They could return at any moment and proceed with the game. During the game users could earn badges that demonstrate a skill, achievement, or quality (based on Mozilla's <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> Infrastructure). If users successfully answered questions, read information, performed actions, or mastered challenges they received a badge for that...|$|E
