We found that Leishmania growth doubled in HIV- 1 –infected macrophages and that anti-Tat antibodies reduced the exacerbated protozoan replication by 70 %. Recombinant Tat increased Leishmania replication and overrode the leishmanicidal effect induced by interferon-g, allowing Leishmania replication even {{in the presence of}} this cytokine. Tat induced cyclooxygenase (COX) – 2 expression and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) synthesis, and a COX- 2 inhibitor abolished the Tat-mediated augmentation of Leishmania replication. Moreover, PGE 2 increased Leishmania growth, which was abrogated by anti–trans-forming growth factor (TGF) –b 1 monoclonal antibodies. Neutralization of TGF-b 1 reduced parasite growth in Leishmania-infected macrophages exposed to Tat by 50 %. Our findings suggest that Tat generates a milieu permissive to Leishmania growth in individuals infected with HIV- 1.

40|$|The {{polymorphic}} fungus Candida albicans {{is one of}} {{the most}} versatile <b>opportunistic</b> <b>pathogens</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans.</b> Many organs of the human body are potential targets for infection by this pathogen, but infection is commonly localized in the gastrointestinal tract, an environment providing anaerobic growth conditions. We describe a chemically defined anaerobic growth medium for four strains of Candida albicans (A 72, SC 5314, MEN, and 10261). It is a defined liquid glucose-phosphate-proline growth medium supplemented with oleic acid, nicotinic acid, and ammonium chloride. The cells did not require or respond to added ergosterol. Oleic acid and nicotinic acid are growth factors which are required only for the anaerobic growth of C. albicans. An important technical feature of this study was the use of anaerobically grown inocula to study anaerobic growth. Anaerobically, the cells grew exclusively as mycelia at 25, 30, and 37 °C. The doubling time at 30 °C was ca. 20 h. The cells did not produce farnesol and did not respond to exogenous farnesol, and they were resistant to the highest tested levels of amphotericin B and four of the azole antifungals.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of prokaryotic and {{eukaryotic}} cells exhibit a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, indi-cating that resistance to potentially toxic compounds is mediated by their active efflux from the cell. We have sought to determine whether resistance to azoles in some strains of Candida species may be {{due in part to}} active drug efflux. Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) is a fluorescent compound that is transported by a {{wide variety of}} MDR cell types. We have shown that certain azole-resistant strains of Candida albicans, C. glabrata, and C. krusei accumulate less Rh 123 than azole-susceptible ones. In C. albicans, Rh 123 accumulation was growth phase and temperature dependent and was increased by proton uncouplers and by reserpine, an MDR modulator. This is consistent with an energy-dependent efflux mechanism for Rh 123, mediated by an MDR transporter. In C. glabrata, but not in C. albicans, there was competition between Rh 123 and fluconazole for efflux. Thus, in C. glabrata, Rh 123 and fluconazole appear to be transported via a common MDR-like transporter, whereas in C. albicans, the Rh 123 transporter does not appear to transport azoles.

40|$|Vibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} and {{has been}} recognized as an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>pathogen</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> as well as marine animals. However, the virulence mechanisms for this species of Vibrio have not been elucidated. This study characterized multiple mechanisms that induce cell death in fish cells upon infection with a V. alginolyticus strain, ZJO. The bacterium required its type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to cause rapid death of infected fish cells. Dying cells exhibited some features of apoptotic cells, such as membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Further studies showed that caspase- 3 was activated by the T 3 SS of the ZJO strain, confirming that infection with V. alginolyticus rapidly induces T 3 SS-dependent apoptosis in fish cells. Infection with the ZJO strain also led to membrane pore formation and release of cellular contents from infected fish cells, as evidenced by lactate dehydrogenase release and the uptake of a membrane-impermeable dye. Importantly, inhibition of apoptosis did not prevent ZJO-infected cells from releasing cellular contents and did not block cell rounding. Taken together, these data demonstrate that infection with V. alginolyticus may promote at least three different T 3 SS-dependent events, which lead {{to the death of}} fish cells. This study provides an important insight into the mechanism used by Vibrio species to cause host-cell death...|$|E

Methicillin-resistant S. aureus ST 398 is highly prevalent in pigs in Europe and North America. The mechanism of successful pig colonization by MRSA ST 398 is poorly understood. Previously, we developed a nasal colonization model of porcine nasal mucosa explants to identify molecular traits involved in nasal MRSA colonization of pigs. Results We report the analysis of changes in the transcription of MRSA ST 398 strain S 0462 during colonization on the explant epithelium. Major regulated genes were encoding metabolic processes and regulation of these genes may represent metabolic adaptation to nasal mucosa explants. Colonization was not accompanied by significant changes in transcripts of the main virulence associated genes or known human colonization factors. Here, we documented regulation of two genes which have potential influence on S. aureus colonization; cysteine extracellular proteinase (scpA) and von Willebrand factor-binding protein (vWbp, encoded on SaPIbov 5). Colonization with isogenic-deletion strains (?vwbp and ?scpA) did not alter the ex vivo nasal S. aureus colonization compared to wild type. Conclusions Our results suggest that nasal colonization with MRSA ST 398 is a complex event that is accompanied with changes in bacterial gene expression regulation and metabolic adaptation.

Current mammalian model systems have certain disadvantages in that obtaining results is time consuming {{owing to the}} relatively long life spans and these results have low statistical resolution because sample sizes are usually small. We have therefore evaluated the potential of Drosophila melanogaster as an additional model system with which to dissect the host-pathogen interactions that occur during Candida albicans systemic infection. To do this, we monitored the survival of wild-type flies infected with various C. albicans clinical isolates that were previously ranked for murine virulence. From our lifetime data we computed two metrics of virulence for each isolate. These correlated significantly with murine survival, and were also used to group the isolates, and this grouping made relevant predictions regarding their murine virulence. Notably, differences in virulence were not predictably resolvable using immune-deficient spz(-/-) flies, suggesting that Toll signalling might actually be required to predictably differentiate virulence. Our analysis reveals wild-type D. melanogaster as a sensitive and relevant model system; one that offers immense genetic tractability (having an extensive RNA interference library that enables tissue-specific gene silencing), and that is easy to manipulate and culture.

B. cenocepacia harbours a large, multi-replicon genome with a high GC-content, the reference genome of strain J 2315 includes 7374 annotated genes. This study aims to annotate transcription start sites and identify novel transcripts on a whole genome scale. Methods: RNA extracted from B. cenocepacia J 2315 biofilms was analysed by differential RNA-sequencing and the resulting dataset compared to data derived from conventional, global RNA-sequencing. Transcription start sites were annotated and further analysed according to their position relative to annotated genes. Results: Four thousand ten transcription start sites were mapped over the whole B. cenocepacia genome and the primary transcription start site of 2089 genes expressed in B. cenocepacia biofilms were defined. For 64 genes a start codon alternative to the annotated one was proposed. Substantial antisense transcription for 105 genes and two novel protein coding sequences were identified. The distribution of internal transcription start sites can be used to identify genomic islands in B. cenocepacia.

Individual strains of Mycobacterium avium, an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>pathogen</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans,</b> have previously been shown to differ in terms of growth and persistence. In order to cover {{a wide spectrum of}} virulence, we selected four M. avium isolates (2151 SmO, 2151 SmT, SE 01, TMC 724) that have distinct intramacrophage replication characteristics and cause differential activation in human macrophages. Following infection with each of these strains, the expression of 12, 558 genes in human macrophages was systematically analyzed by microarray technology. Fifty genes (including genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, signaling, and adhesion molecules) were differentially expressed more than twofold in response to all of the M. avium isolates investigated and therefore constitute a common macrophage signature in response to M. avium. The magnitude of regulation of most of these genes was directly correlated with the host cell-activating capacity of the particular H. avium strain. The regulation of a number of genes not previously associated with mycobacterial infections was apparent; these genes included genes encoding lymphocyte antigen 64 and myosin X. In addition, individual response patterns typical for some M. avium isolates could be defined by the pronounced upregulation of interleukin- 12 p 40 (IL- 12 p 40) (in the case of 2151 SmO) or the specific upregulation of SOCS- 1 and IL- 10 (in the case of SE 01) in macrophages. TMC 724, a strain of avian origin, could not be classified by any one of these schemes, possibly indicating the limits of pathogen categorization solely by immune response signatures...|$|E
40|$|Cryptosporidium spp. and Enterocytozoon bieneusi are two {{prevalent}} <b>opportunistic</b> <b>pathogens</b> <b>in</b> <b>humans</b> and animals. Currently, few {{data are}} available on genetic characterization of both <b>pathogens</b> <b>in</b> rabbits in China. The aim {{of the present study}} was to understand prevalence and genetic characterization of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi in rabbits. We collected 215 fecal samples from 150 Rex rabbits and 65 New Zealand White rabbits on two different farms in Heilongjiang Province, China. Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing the partial small subunit of ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA, respectively. Cryptosporidium was detected in 3. 3 % (5 / 150) of Rex rabbits and 29. 2 % (19 / 65) of New Zealand White rabbits. All the 24 Cryptosporidium isolates were identified as C. cuniculus. Enterocytozoon bieneusi was only found in 14. 7 % (22 / 150) of Rex rabbits. Five known genotypes: CHN-RD 1 (n =  12), D (n =  3), Type IV (n =  2), Peru 6 (n =  1), and I (n =  1), and three novel ones CHN-RR 1 to CHN-RR 3 (one each) were detected. By analyzing the 60 -kDa glycoprotein (gp 60) gene sequences of C. cuniculus isolates, three subtypes were obtained: VbA 28 (n =  2), VbA 29 (n =  16), and VbA 32 (n =  3). All these three C. cuniculus subtypes were reported previously <b>in</b> <b>humans.</b> Four known E. bieneusi genotypes have been found to be present <b>in</b> <b>humans.</b> The three novel ones fell into zoonotic group 1. The results suggest zoonotic potential of C. cuniculus and E. bieneusi isolates in rabbits...|$|R
50|$|Mycoplasma orale {{is a small}} {{bacterium}} {{found in}} the class Mollicutes. It belongs to the genus Mycoplasma, a well-known group of obligate intracellular parasites that inhabit humans. It also {{is known to be}} an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>pathogen</b> <b>in</b> immunocompromised <b>humans.</b> As with other Mycoplasma species, M. orale is not readily treated with antibiotics due to its lack of a peptidoglycan cell wall. Therefore, this species is relevant to the medical field as physicians face the task of treating patients suffering from infections with this microbe. It is characterized by a small physical size (0.1 micrometer in diameter on average), a small genome size, and a limited metabolism. It is also known to frequently contaminate laboratory experiments. This bacteria is very similar physiologically and morphologically to its sister species within the Mycoplasma genus; however, its recent discovery leaves many questions still unanswered about this microbe.|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>pathogen</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> lungs, {{where its}} secretable LasB {{metalloproteinase}} {{can be a}} virulence factor. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) participates in pericellular proteolysis and the adherence/migration of epithelial cells and leukocytes recruited during infection and shows functional regulation by various proteinases via limited endoproteolysis occurring within its three domains (D 1 to D 3). We thus examined the proteolytic activity of LasB on uPAR by using recombinant uPAR as well as uPAR-expressing, human monocytic, and bronchial epithelial cell lines. Protein immunoblotting and flow immunocytometry using a panel of domain-specific anti-uPAR antibodies showed that LasB is able to cleave uPAR both within the sequence linking D 1 to D 2 and at the carboxy terminus of D 3. Comparison of LasB-producing and LasB-deficient bacterial strains indicated that LasB is entirely responsible for the uPAR cleavage ability of P. aeruginosa. Based on amino-terminal protein microsequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of the cleavage of peptides mimicking the uPAR sequences targeted by LasB, cleavage sites were determined to be Ala 84 -Val 85 and Thr 86 -Tyr 87 (D 1 -D 2) and Gln 279 -Tyr 280 (D 3). Such a dual cleavage of uPAR led to the removal of amino-terminal D 1, the generation of a truncated D 2 D 3 species, and the shedding of D 2 D 3 from cells. This proteolytic processing of uPAR was found to (i) drastically reduce the capacity of cells to bind urokinase and (ii) abrogate the interaction between uPAR and the matrix adhesive protein vitronectin. The LasB proteinase is thus endowed with a high potential for the alteration of uPAR expression and functioning on inflammatory cells during infections by P. aeruginosa...|$|R
