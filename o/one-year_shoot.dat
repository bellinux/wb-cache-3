40|$|Purpose. To study {{effects of}} low {{temperatures}} on Lavandula angustifolia plants and their response {{depending on their}} age and variety as well as identify critical temperature values for such structure elements of plants as bark, cambium, wood, pith. Methods. Field investigation, spectrometric analysis, statistical evaluation. Results. Topicality of investigation of Lavandula angustifolia to be grown in the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine was highlighted. Low temperature effects on structural elements of shoots for 8 varieties of domestic and foreign selection were analyzed. One-year shoots have suffered the most from low temperatures – 4. 5 points on a six-point scale, two- and three-year shoots were damaged in a lesser degree – from 0. 8 to 2 points. Plants of ‘Feuervogel’ and ‘Maestro’ varieties with total damage coefficient of 11. 3 % and 10. 6 % accordingly were the most resistant to low temperatures. These varieties can be recommended to producers for further introduction to the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine. Conclusions. Tissues of a lavender <b>one-year</b> <b>shoot</b> were most damaged by low temperatures regardless of a variety, but this organ is ephemeral and can be removed without causing damage to a plant. Two- and three-year shoots, which provide plant recovery, were significantly less damaged. None of the plants from 8 studied lavender varieties was lost {{under the influence of}} low temperatures, though some of them were damaged significantly. Such varieties as ‘Feuervogel’, ‘König Humbert’, ‘Veseli notky’ (pith damage is on the level of 1 – 2 points), ‘Maestro’ (0. 8 – 2. 5 points) were the most resistant to low temperature exposure which allows to conclude about successful lavender cultivation under conditions of the Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{changes of}} morphological indicators of Rhus typhyna L. in roadside plantations in Pavlograd, Ukraine. Experimental plots were placed {{at a distance}} from 1 to 130 m from the road. The control group of plants was at a distance of 1500 m from the highway. The plants were measured for length and thickness of annual sprout, number of leaves on it, the content of chlorophyll in leaves and accumulation of cadmium and lead in the tissues of these organs. It was found that, compared to the relatively clean area, the greatest decrease in the length and thickness of the annual shoots of the trees in the plantations, was for those which were at a distance of one metre from the highway. The number of leaves on a <b>one-year</b> <b>shoot</b> was significantly decreased compared to controls at all sites except those situated at a distance of one hundred and thirty meters from the path of moving sources of pollution. We evaluated the impact of transport emissions on the assimilatory apparatus. Within the twenty-five meter zone, there was an increase {{in the area of the}} leaf. The assimilation surface area was significantly decreased relative to values in the conditionally clean area only in the plants growing at a distance from one to five meters from the road. We identified a negative effect of the ingredients of motor emissions on chlorophyll content in leaves. The amount of chlorophyll a decreased with decreasing distance from the plantation to the road within the forty-meter area. Changes in the content of chlorophyll b lacked a clear pattern. The concentration of this pigment increased compared with control in a five-meter area, at a distance of twenty five meters it significantly decreased and did not differ from the indicators in the relatively clean areas, which were growing at a distance of forty and one hundred and thirty meters from the road. The amount of chlorophyll a + b in the leaves decreased compared to the control. Lead accumulated in these plant organs in the forty-meter zone. The amount of cadmium in the tissues of the leaf was significantly higher than the control values on plots located at a distance of twenty five meters. The strongest negative effects of phytotoxicants on susceptible plants occurred in plantations in the five-meter zone, which led to deterioration of the decorative quality of the plants...|$|E
40|$|The present study, {{carried out}} in the period 2007 - 2009 in the Sandomierz Upland, did not show a {{significant}} effect of foliar fertilization on trunk thickness and canopy volume in the cultivar Łutówka. However, under the influence of urea applied three times in combination with Florovit at a concentration of 0. 5 %, a clear increasing trend was observed in the above mentioned parameters used to assess the strength of growth. In years of abundant fruiting, this study showed a significant increase, or on the verge of significance, in yield after threefold application of urea and Florovit in combination.

40|$|Kalei' {{is a new}} scab-resistant apple {{cultivar}} {{released by}} the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Queensland. It is a large apple (average weight 200 g) and trees are highly productive. Crop load management is important as overthinning and/or under-thinning can reduce yield and fruit quality. Artificial Spur Extinction (ASE) is a crop load management tool to regulate floral bud type and density {{just prior to the}} onset of spring budbreak. The impact of ASE on the productivity and quality of 'Kalei' was studied across three seasons at Applethorpe, Queensland, with trees on MM. 106 and M. 26 rootstocks trained as a Vertical Axis (2500 trees ha- 1). ASE was compared with conventional (Conv) crop load management (no bud removal, and hand thinning seven to eight weeks after full bloom). In the ASE treatments, axillary buds borne on <b>one-year</b> old <b>shoots</b> were removed, whilst spur buds, and terminal buds of <b>one-year</b> old <b>shoots</b> (≥ 2. 5 cm) were set to a predetermined bud density. ASE increased the proportion of terminal buds borne on shoots, compared with Conv management. ASE consistently improved fruit set, with fewer flower buds failing to set fruit and a higher proportion of flower buds setting 2 or 3 fruit. In 2012 and 2013, the mean fruit weight of 'Kalei' apples was greater with ASE than Conv management. By removing competing sinks early in the season using ASE, remaining fruitlets are given the space and resources to attain fruit size potential. No increase in yield was observed with ASE in both seasons.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the material of}} forecasting for grape yield of next year and establishing the optimal loading if cutting of bushes. The material includes 14 varieties of grapes, 11 of them are technical and 3 are table ones. For each year of stable high yield of grapes, {{it is necessary to}} pre-set the optimum length of fruit cutting of shoots and optimum load on the bush healthy eyes. To do this for each variety on the eve of trimming bushes we perform optimum productivity analysis of wintering buds of fruit along the length of shoots, i. e. we implement forecasting of grape yield for next year. We have a plan of forecasting for yields of vineyards by microscopy of wintering buds on <b>one-year</b> <b>shoots</b> of fruit ripened grapes in order to establish the potential of embryonic establishment of inflorescences in the central holes of buds. Based on the analysis of buds, the indices were calculated for wintering fruiting buds and their degree of damage during the growing season. It was revealed, that the majority of grape varieties under study shows high tab embryonic inflorescences in central buds in overwintering buds for next year yield. Higher rates at a rate of fruiting buds were wintering in the varieties: Moldova (section 27). - 1. 66; Bianca (section 6). - 1. 83; Kunlean (section 15). - 1. 71; Merlot (section 14). - 1. 64; Saperavi (section 56). - 1. 76.

In order to evaluate obstacles to male reproductive in the C. mollissima, a morphological and histological characterization of male flower of chestnut cultivar ‘Yanshanzaofeng’ were examined by paraffin section technique and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that male catkins with floral primordia were formed in the buds of <b>one-year</b> olds <b>shoots</b> in later April. Later, a protoderm, ground meristem and a procambium had differentiated in young anthers. Each young anther soon developed to four microsporangia.

40|$|In {{breeding}} apples for {{a region}} where winter hardiness is an important consideration, the desirability of having some rapid and reliable means of separating the few winter hardy seedlings produced from the great number of less hardy ones is obvious. Any elimination {{that can be made}} in the first year or two of seedling growth is economical from the standpoint of both time and cost. From previous investigations, it is apparent that many factors are involved in working with the electro-conductivity method as a measurement of winter hardiness. Several of these factors are discussed in this paper. Studies were begun in the spring of 1949 and carried through the fall of the same year. The material used throughout this investigation consisted of shoots from 16 standard horticultural varieties of apples. All of the material used in the experiment were obtained from the University of Nebraska fruit farm at Union, Nebraska. The varieties were grouped as follows starting with the variety showing the least amount of resistance to cold and ending with the variety of greatest resistance:Cortland, Grimes Golden, Joan, Golden Delicious, Sharon, Secor, Winesap, Hawkeye, Wealthy, Haralson, Jonathan, Beacon, Red Duchess, Virginia Crab, and Hibernal. Two year old shoots were found to have nearly twice as much resistance to a temperature of 15 ° F. as the <b>one-year</b> old <b>shoots</b> had. It was found that waxing the cut ends of a sample reduced the electrolyte loss to almost 50 percent less than that of a sample with unwaxed ends. There was a greater spread in specific conductance readings between varieties when the ends of each piece were waxed. Very little difference was found between varieties when shoots were allowed to exosmose without being frozen. The rapidity with which the estimation of injury can be accomplished and the convenience of the precise numerical values obtained by electrical conductance makes the application of this method very valuable in studying winter hardiness of plants.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the German environmental specimen bank <b>one-year</b> old spruce <b>shoots</b> (Picea abies) and pine shoots (Pinus sylvestris) serve as bioindicators for the atmospheric pollution. Sampling is performed in two urbanized areas in western and eastern Germany (Warndt and Duebener Heide, respectively), and in seven different rural locations. Prior to archiving conifer shoots are continuously analyzed for a set of 17 individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The results from the two urbanized areas show that the atmospheric contamination with PAH has declined by about 75 % between 1985 and 2004 at Warndt and by about 85 % between 1991 and 2004 at Duebener Heide. However, Sigma PAH concentrations stayed virtually constant at both locations {{since the end of the}} 1990 s at levels of about 100 ng g(- 1) wet weight (ww). In spruce shoots from rural areas current concentrations of PAHs are significantly lower and vary between 8 and 61 ng g(- 1) ww. In all shoot samples the four low molecular aromatics phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and chrysene dominate the pattern by contributing 60 to 90 % to Sigma PAH. The group of high molecular weight aromatics is dominated by benzo[b, j, k]fluoranthene, especially in spruce shoots originating from greater altitudes remarkable amounts of six and seven ringed PAHs could be detected.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{relationship of}} branching habit to cytokinin content of apple shoots (Malusxdomestica Borkh.) was investigated. <b>One-year</b> old apple <b>shoots</b> are acrotonic (distal branching), more strongly so in Granny Smith than in Braeburn. In the first trial, long, 1 -year old Granny Smith and Braeburn apple shoots were sprayed on 29 August 1995 to break rest with dinitro-o-cresol (DNOC) oil (5 %). The cytokinin {{contents of the}} xylem sap, the combined bark and buds, and the wood were determined in distal and proximal shoot halves over the next 6 weeks. Budburst (terminal and lateral buds) was first visible (green tip) in both cultivars on 20 September 1995. A greater increase in cytokinin content of distal xylem sap, coupled with elevated cytokinin in the distal wood, reflect the overall acrotony of both cultivars. The strong acrotony of Granny Smith {{is reflected in the}} higher cytokinin concentration in distal portion 1 week before the proximal portion of the shoot. The differential distribution of cytokinin reflects the pattern of budburst and may be correlated with growth habit. In a subsequent trial, Granny Smith shoots chilled and forced in the absence of roots showed an increase in cytokinin content of the bark and buds, and the wood as growth resumed. This was roughly comparable in magnitude to the increase observed under field conditions. The cytokinin increase in rootless shoots and differential distribution of cytokinin prior to sprouting, support the hypothesis that shoot-derived, rather than root-derived, cytokinins act to trigger spring budburst. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the important problems of large cities. In connection with this, comprehensive study of the mechanisms of the corresponding reactions of tree species, introduced in the process of landscaping, to various environmen tal factors is required. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the influence of urban technogenic environmental pollution on the anatomical characteristics of Quercus rubra Linnaeus, 1753 annual shoots. The object of research was 35 -year-old plants of Q. rubra, which grew in a non-polluted site (conditionally clean zone), the Botanical Garden of DNU (plot 1), and in a polluted site (roadside planting) (plot 2) of Dnipro City. Industrial emissions of the city’s western, northeastern and northwest industrial complexes also have an effect on plants, depending on the wind direction. For anatomical research, the annual shoots were taken at the tips of the vegetation from the south-eastern side of the model trees at a height of 2 m and fixed in 70 % alcohol. Cross sections were made at a distance of 1 cm from the beginning of growth. Phloroglucine was used to dye the cells. The influence of industrial and automobile emissions on the structural parameters of Q. rubra shoots was investigated. We established that the membrane thickened evenly in both control and experimental plants. Cork thickness of Q. rubra shoots growing in the roadside plantation was higher than in plants of the Botanical Garden by 57. 5 %. Increasing its thickness in plants exposed to atmospheric air pollution has an adaptive value. Q.  rubra shoots have a tabulate type of collenchyma, the tangent walls of whose cells thicken. The collenchyma cells of the control variant of shoots are larger. This tissue was thicker in Q. rubra shoots from the polluted site by 26. 8 % compared to those from the non-polluted zone. The parenchyma cells of the primary cortex were large and contained chloroplasts. The thickness of this histological element on the shoot circumference varied considerably both in the control and experimental variants, which is the result of its uneven formation. This is due to the fact that the shape of the shoot core resembles a pentagonal star, and the layers of phloem and xylem tissues repeat its shape. The thickness of each of them in the cross section of the shoots in various places varied little, while the parenchyma of the primary cortex above the ray cells was narrower, and between them was thicker, as a result the thickness of the shoots was aligned in a circle. In areas where the parenchyma of the primary cortex was narrower, it was better developed in the shoots of experimental plants than the control ones, but where its layer was thicker, it was more developed in plants of the control variant. The diameter of the primary cortex in the shoots of the experimental variant in its narrower parts was 120. 5 % of the control, and in the broader – 87. 6 %, which is due to unequal changes in the thickness of the primary cortex parenchyma, possibly with different rates of cell division. In the <b>one-year</b> Q. rubra <b>shoots,</b> the hard bast resembled a circle ruptured by parenchymal cells. Environmental pollution does not affect formation of soft bast in Q. rubra annual shoots. The difference between the thickness of the layer of this element in the control and experimental plants was statistically insignificant. The width of the bark (soft and hard bast) somewhat decreased in shoots of the roadside trees due to the thinning-out of the hard bast. The thickness of the wood tissue of the Q. rubra shoots was practically the same in both variants of the experiment, although it is known that the formation of xylem of certain species of plants is sensitive to environmental pollution. According to our data, the distribution of vessels in the wood of the Q. rubra annual shoots on both experimental sites had no clearly expressed annular-vessel type. On the cross section, the vessels are arranged relatively evenly along the width of the entire ring. The location of the woody parenchyma apotracheal does not depend on the location of vessels. Histochemical reactions showed that a large amount of starch grains and fat drops are deposited in the core and ray cells. The diameter of the core was measured in two directions: in narrower and broader places. Plant shoots of the polluted site have a significantly more developed core in the narrower place by 1. 44 times, in the broad – 1. 56 times. The adaptation of the Q. rubra shoots to technogenic pollution takes place through thickening of the cork and collenchyma, thereby reducing the possibility of penetration into the internal tissues of industrial and automotive emissions. There was virtually no change in the thickness of the circle of soft bast and wood in conditions of environmental pollution. In the conditions of multicomponent environmental pollution there are adaptive changes in the parameters of the histological elements of the Q. rubra shoots – thickening of the phellem and structural element of the primary cortex – collenchyma, which helps to protect the internal tissues from the penetration. of pollutants. Environmental pollution practically did not affect the thickness of the layer of soft bast and wood in the Q. rubra shoots. This testifies to the stability of the most important functions of the Q. rubra shoots to phytotoxicants of anthropogenic origin. The components of industrial and automotive emissions have a negative effect on the formation of hard bast and core of Q. rubra shoots, which manifests itself in reduction in their thickness...|$|R
