5000|$|Trusted Computing Group {{members have}} refused to {{implement}} owner override. [...] Proponents of trusted computing believe that owner override defeats the trust in other computers since remote attestation can be forged by the <b>owner.</b> <b>Owner</b> override offers the security and enforcement benefits to a machine owner, but does not allow him to trust other computers, because their owners could waive rules or restrictions on their own computers. Under this scenario, once data is sent to someone else's computer, {{whether it be a}} diary, a DRM music file, or a joint project, that other person controls what security, if any, their computer will enforce on their copy of those data. This has the potential to undermine the applications of trusted computing to enforce DRM, control cheating in online games and attest to remote computations for grid computing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn human-dog relationships, {{positive}} {{interaction and}} social attention may mutually dampen stress responses. In humans, attachment representations and personality {{are linked to}} the modulation of individual stress reactions. We investigated the connections between dog attachment to the <b>owner,</b> <b>owner</b> attitudes and relationship toward the dog, and the personality of both on stress coping in dogs during the Ainsworth Strange Situation Procedure for dogs. For the first time, dog attachment patterns were assessed via the original Ainsworth attachment classification system. In addition, cortisol was measured from saliva in the context of play with the owner and 2 threat situations, once with and once without the owner present. We found that dogs classified as “securely attached” secreted less cortisol during the attachment (P = 0. 008) and play situations (P = 0. 031) and showed by trend a stronger cortisol reactivity during the threat situation when the owner was absent (P = 0. 086) than dogs which were classified as “insecure. ” The higher the owner's self-reported insecure-ambivalent attachment toward the dog and perception of the dog as a social support, the higher was the dog's cortisol reactivity during the Ainsworth Strange Situation Procedure (P = 0. 004 and P = 0. 018). Furthermore, it was found that owners high in neuroticism and agreeableness had dogs with low cortisol reactivity (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 001). Older dogs showed less cortisol reactivity than younger ones (P = 0. 023). Male dogs of male owners tended to show the lowest cortisol reactivity compared to all other human gender-dog sex combinations (P = 0. 008). In conclusion, results show that secure dog attachment to the owner, owner-dog relationship, and personality of both influence the dog's stress coping...|$|E
40|$|By {{using data}} from the 1995 Property Owners and Managers Survey (POMS), this study explores the role of owner {{characteristics}} (socioeconomic and behavioral) and ownership characteristics in predicting the likelihood of using multifamily property for retirement purposes. In addition, this study examines the likelihood of reporting a profit in the prior year among those who purchase multifamily properties for retirement purposes. The sample consists of property owners who own multifamily real estate other than their primary residence (N = I, 3 19). Property owners with retirement savings motive (RSM) {{were more likely to be}} male, White, have income more than $ 100, 000, own more than 30 units, and be located in the Midwest. Property owners who reported a profit in the prior year were more likely to be male, White, own property more than 10 years, own 30 or more units, and be located in the Midwest. The results of logistic regression analysis indicate that gender, income, the amount of time contributed to maintenance by the <b>owner,</b> <b>owner</b> living at the property, individual ownership, and the number of units in the property were significantly related to the likelihood of owning real estate for retirement purposes. Being older, White, having higher income, contributing to maintenance, being an individual owner, owning the property for more than 10 years, and owning more than live units were significantly related to the likelihood of reporting a profit in the prior year. By identifying who is purchasing multifamily properties for retirement purposes and their likelihood of success, educators, researchers, financial planners, and economists can gain a better understanding of the multifamily housing market. Individual investors, financial planners, lenders, and researchers can utilize this information to expand, develop, or reline models that measure the quality of a financial deal (i. e., the probability of making a profit and/or risk of default) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} {{of water resources}} and waste water varies between the countries of the EU. For many years, {{a large part of the}} water in Europe has been contaminated by, among other things, insufficiently treated waste water and emissions from agriculture. The EU Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC and the Urban Waste Water Directive 91 / 271 /EEC are intended to harmonize fresh-water management and waste water management within the whole EU, aiming at safeguarding drinking water of good quality and a high quality of all water within the EU today and in the future. There are however some problems concerning the waste-water directive. One problem is the huge investment needed in Slovakia to fulfil the demands of the waste-water directive for waste-water management in larger communities (with more than 2000 inhabitants). Many waste-water treatment plants need to be upgraded or built, and in addition a large part of the households in eastern Slovakia are not yet connected to a municipal water-supply and waste-water collecting system (including waste-water treatment). Subsidies from the EU’s structural funds are needed for Slovakia to fulfil the requirements of the waste-water directive. Because this directive only applies to larger communities, smaller communities and private sewage are not affected by the directive and therefore, in general, not eligible for financial funding from EU. Financial funding, however, is needed for addressing inadequate sewage in small communities with poor socioeconomic and municipal financial resources. For water protection to be effective, it is important to take also private sewage emissions into consideration, even though they might appear insignificant. Point emissions from insufficient private sewage (private sewage systems with insufficient waste-water treatment or emission of untreated waste water), primarily in small, tightly clustered communities in Slovakia or for example in Sweden in areas where weekend houses are being converted into permanent dwellings, are potential sources of pollution that can cause health or/and environmental problems. Inadequate private sewage can thus reduce the quality of both surface and ground water and have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems, which in turn makes it more difficult to reach the quality standards of the Water Framework Directive and its daughter directives. This applies to both Slovakia and Sweden. The private sewage solutions that are recommended today are often satisfactory but not without problems. To give an example, miniature waste water treatment plants are expensive to put in place, require technological knowledge on the part of the property owner and they also require a daily flow of waste water to function properly. Improper handling of the miniature water treatment plant may cause inefficient or no water treatment at all, in some cases the bacterial content of the waste water may increase instead of being reduced. To address the problem concerning private sewage it is important that (1) waste-water solutions are adapted to local circumstances and financial funding are given to economically week municipalities (2) the property <b>owner</b> (<b>owner</b> of the private sewage) regularly controls the quality of the out-going treated wastewater (if it is possible) and (3) that efficient inspections with injunctions (from authorities) are carried out to discover faulty private sewage. Unfortunately financial funding, in general, is not given to small municipalities and/or inappropriate private sewage and inspections, both in Slovakia and Sweden, are generally slow...|$|E
