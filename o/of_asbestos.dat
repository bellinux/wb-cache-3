5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{was then}} the second largest gold {{producer}} in the world, after South Africa. The colony's gold output had expanded greatly during the 1930s, and it remained the territory's main source of income during the war, though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals, most prominently chrome and asbestos. Southern Rhodesia {{became one of the}} two main sources of chrome for the Allies (South Africa was the other) and the world's third largest producer <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> after Canada and the Soviet Union. By {{the end of the war}} the mines at Shabani and Mashaba were turning out 1.5million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> a year, in addition to 600,000 tonnes of chrome. Gold output reached peak levels in 1941–42 and thereafter subsided. Southern Rhodesia also exported tungsten, mica and tin, and provided coal for the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. The Southern Rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit the colony's natural resources and increase production, but also set up some state industries in an attempt to spark growth. The establishment of the RATG prompted a minor economic boom, and also caused the primary direct demand placed on Southern Rhodesia's black population during the early stages of the war—a programme of conscripted labour to build the aerodromes.|$|E

5|$|After the Sounds vacated Greer, Mayor Dean {{expressed}} interest in converting the facility to a community sporting complex or a new city park, but, {{nearing the end of}} his term, ultimately deferred the decision to the next mayor (Megan Barry, elected 2015). In the meantime, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch recommended that the stadium be demolished due to the potential costs for any renovation, including the removal <b>of</b> <b>asbestos.</b> The department asked Mayor Barry for $800,000 to fund the demolition of the concourse and seating bowl so as to expand the green space at the property which could then be sold to private developers. , the ballpark, now dilapidated and vadazlied, is still standing.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on serpentine cliffs and talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely {{threat to the}} species is expansion <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed serpentine. None of the sites are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. The species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned of the dangers <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as {{they were allowed to}} return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E

Asbestos was precoated with a well-adhered film of nylon 6, 6, a polymer especially compatible with the epoxy phase. The proposed pretreatment procedure involves serial application to the <b>asbestos</b> <b>of</b> two immiscible solutions of hexamethylenediamine and adipoyl chloride, or impregnation in nylon 6, 6 solution. Combination <b>of</b> the treated <b>asbestos</b> grades with high modulus aramid fibers was followed to investigate the reduction <b>of</b> the <b>asbestos</b> content in only-asbestos-based engineering plastics. The results from the tensile tests revealed composition regions of a possible positive hybrid effect, i. e. a better performance was effected than that encountered in the only-Kevlar or only-asbestos-filled composites at the same fiber content...|$|R

5|$|In his article, Winter {{wondered}} why Coandă did not add the novel feature of fuel injection and air stream combustion to his May 1911 patent applications if that feature {{had been present}} during his supposed flying experience five months earlier. Rather, Winter noted that the August 1910 patent filings in French were {{essentially the same as}} the May 1911 ones in English, and that all the descriptions were applicable to air or water flowing through the device, meaning that the patents could not possibly include fuel combustion in the jet stream. He also noted that no mention was made in the early patents <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> or mica heat shields, or of any fuel injection or combustion.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is left of}} the old Ashford town centre, {{apart from}} a cluster of medieval half-timbered {{buildings}} in Middle Row and around the churchyard in the town centre. A number of old buildings were removed {{to make way for the}} controversial ring road around the centre, including four public houses. Further demolition was required to build Charter House, an eight-story office building for Charter Consolidated, that opened in 1975. Charter subsequently moved back to London in 1985, and the building is now being converted into flats, though progress stalled owing to the discovery <b>of</b> <b>asbestos.</b> Charter compensated for the demolition by funding a restoration scheme on North Street, preserving several historic buildings.|$|E
5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 a large wooden collar {{was added to}} the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity of private houses and the Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower and kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.|$|E

5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E

25|$|In Australia, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used in construction and other industries between 1946 and 1980. From the 1970s there was increasing concern about the dangers <b>of</b> <b>asbestos,</b> and its use was phased out. Mining ceased in 1983. The use <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> was phased out in 1989 and banned entirely in December 2003. The dangers <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> are now well known in Australia and there is help and support for sufferers from asbestosis or mesothelioma.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the ban, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in the construction industry}} in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356–04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition <b>of</b> <b>asbestos</b> contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense.
