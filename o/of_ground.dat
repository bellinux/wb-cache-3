40|$|M. A. When Glaser {{departed}} from the University of California, Strauss was left to answer to those who critiqued grounded theory for its seeming looseness, its lack of variation, and the tangled description of it in their joint book, Discovery <b>of</b> <b>Grounded</b> Theory (Stern, 1994). Strauss' need to respond to critics led him in 1987 and in 1990, together with Corbin, to modify their description <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory from its original concept of emergence to a densely codified, structured operation (Stern, 1994). Strauss's development <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory differed considerably from the method that he and Glaser developed in 1967. Glaser (1992) said that what Strauss and his co-author, Corbin called "grounded theory" is "full conceptual description", and not grounded theory. Which method does the novice in grounded theory pursue? Which of the two methods is grounded theory? The goal {{of the present study}} is to provide the novice in grounded theory with an overview on the development and split in the methods. The aim is to help the beginning researcher make an informed decision when choosing one of the two particular methods <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. The first chapter of the book is a discussion of the history and development of qualitative research. The second chapter is a discussion of the history and development <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory, which flows into a dialogue between Glaser, and Strauss and Corbin about their differences concerning the methods <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. The originators <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory wrote their method mainly for qualitative researchers. Qualitative research developed out of the need to study social phenomena {{from the perspective of the}} participants. It moved away from numeric means of verifying theory, to develop an improved understanding of human behaviour and experience. Glaser and Strauss (1967) based the original approach to grounded theory on these assumptions about qualitative research. Strauss and Corbin (1994) then moved back to some of the positivistic assumptions of verification and interpreting the phenomena for the participants. This shift brought a major split in the methods <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. The rationale for this study is to provide a clear understanding on where grounded theory stemmed from. Strauss and Corbin published a book in which they explicated their method <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. Glaser (1992) felt that the original method <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory was lost in Strauss and Corbin's (1990) book and he set out to correct the methods outlined in their book. He wrote a book analysing Strauss and Corbin's (1990) ideas <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. This dissertation presents the reader with a detailed explanation of Strauss's method and Glaser's method <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. Epistemologically Strauss and Corbin (1990) seem to have a different stance from Glaser (1992) with regard to grounded theory. I found that Strauss and Corbin's lack of reference to past books and publications <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory might have caused them to depart from the original and fundamental ideas <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory. Strauss and Corbin returned to that which grounded theory moved away from. From this point of view, I would rather support the Glaserian method <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory because it holds more purely to the original method <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory, notwithstanding that Strauss and Corbin did make tremendous contributions to the grounded theory methodology. This division in grounded theory will not end unless the loyal followers <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory somehow merge the two theories to develop a unified theory...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Ph. D. {{thesis is}} the study and the {{investigation}} of the transient behaviour <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems. The Ph. D. thesis includes the review of the relative bibliography <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems, the description and the elaboration of the experiments and the analysis of the experimental results, the circuital and field approach <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems and conclusions or assumptions about the influence of different parameters (layout <b>of</b> the <b>grounding</b> system, quality <b>of</b> the soil, waveform and peak value of the injected current) on the transient behaviour <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems. The first chapter of the Ph. D. thesis includes the review of the up-to-date scientific research bibliography, associated with the transient behaviour <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems. The papers are grouped in this review, according to their content, as follows: a) the steady state b) the transient state, c) the resistivity and multi-layer structure <b>of</b> the <b>ground,</b> d) the ionisation of the soil and e) the methodologies <b>of</b> simulation <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems. The experimental arrangements and the methods of tests and measurements, which have been used in the present thesis, are in detail described in its second chapter. These arrangements are used for the experimental study of a) the transient behaviour <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems, b) the soil ionisation and c) the soil resistivity and the grounding resistance. The third chapter includes the presentation and {{the investigation of the}} experimental results and the arisen conclusions. The used experimental approaches (experiments in scale model, experiments in real grounding systems and experiments studying the soil ionisation) have essentially contributed in the elaboration, the inference and the verification of the suppositions of the present study. This verification is also proved through the convergence between experimental and computed (using the circuital and field approach) results of this Ph. D. thesis. The fourth chapter presents several simulation methods (circuital and field approach) of the transient behaviour <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems and comparisons between the experimental and simulation results of this work, with relevant results of other researchers. The chapter also presents a proposed methodology, which uses a developed genetic algorithm (GA) for the calculation of the parameters of the multi-layer structure <b>of</b> the <b>ground.</b> In the end, a method of Monte-Carlo simulation is applied, which evaluates the <b>grounding</b> resistance <b>of</b> towers of a transmission line. The conclusions are summarized in the fifth chapter, showing clearly the contribution of the present study in the research of the transient behaviour <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems. ...|$|R

What Is Grounded Theory? Grounded theory is a relatively new approach to research originally defined as “the discovery of theory from data ” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. XX). In their seminal work The Discovery <b>of</b> <b>Grounded</b> Theory, the originators <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory, Barony Glaser and Anselm Strauss, described the research process as the discovery of theory through the rigors of social research. A more detailed defini-tion forwarded by Strauss and Corbin (1990) is as follows: A grounded theory is one that is inductively derived from the study of the phenomenon it repre-sents. That is, it is discovered, developed and provisionally verified through systematic data col-lection and analysis of data pertaining to that phenomenon. Therefore, data collection, analysis and theory stand in reciprocal relationship to one another. (p. 23) Grounded theory research is discovered empirically, through induction, not deduction.

DISCUSSION: The significant strengths <b>of</b> <b>grounded</b> theory that have resulted in its enduring prominence in qualitative research include its clearly articulated analytical process and its emphasis on the generation of pragmatic theory that is grounded in the data of experience. When applied properly and thoughtfully, grounded theory can address research questions of significant relevance to the domain of medical education...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve better {{lightning}} protection and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements, the needs for a proper grounding system and the knowledge of its transient behaviour become crucial. The present work is focused towards developing engineering models for transient analysis <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> system with sufficient accuracy and simplicity for lightning studies. Firstly, the conventional uniform transmission line approach for a single grounding conductor is modified and extended to grounding grids. Secondly, in order to overcome the drawbacks of all the existing transmission line approaches, for the first time, a non-uniform transmission line approach is developed for modelling the transient behaviour of different types <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems. The important feature of such an approach is in its capability to include the electromagnetic couplings between different parts <b>of</b> the <b>grounding</b> system using space and time dependent per-unit length parameters. High voltages and currents induced in the grounding systems due to lightning always produce ionization in the soil. This phenomenon should be included during the transient analysis <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems. In the present work, an improved soil ionization model including residual resistivity in ionization region is developed. The fact that there exists residual resistivity in ionization region (7 % of the original soil resistivity) can be proved by the experiments {{reported in the literature}} and the experiments carried out at the high voltage lab of Uppsala University. The advantage of including residual resistivity is that the beneficial influence of soil ionization in reducing the potential rise <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> system will not be overestimated, especially in high resistivity soil. Finally, the transmission line approaches are adopted for studying the response <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems due to lightning for different applications. These are, influence of soil parameters on the transient behaviour <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> systems, transient analysis <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> structures in stratified soils, investigation of the validity of existing definitions for effective length/area <b>of</b> different <b>grounding</b> structures, current distribution in the shields <b>of</b> under <b>ground</b> cables associated with communication tower, and influence of insulator flashover and soil ionization around the pole footing on surge propagation in Swedish railway system...|$|R

This paper argues that this promise is illusory. It is not possible to give an analysis of intrinsicality in terms <b>of</b> <b>grounding</b> that is consistent with these theories.
