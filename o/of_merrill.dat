40|$|In {{the poetry}} <b>of</b> James <b>Merrill,</b> {{and in his}} later work in particular, the poet clearly, {{sometimes}} even ostentatiously, utilizes a particular blend of gay sensibility and camp aesthetic to frame and enhance the meanings of his poems. Yet, critics and scholars often misread or disregard these poetic gestures and the poet’s sexuality in general, resulting in a diminished understanding <b>of</b> <b>Merrill’s</b> work. This study examines a line <b>of</b> <b>Merrill’s</b> poetry in which geologic and crystalline imagery are posed as emblems of queer experience {{in an effort to}} show the necessity <b>of</b> reading <b>Merrill</b> from a queer perspective. The emblems Merrill uses in these poems are firmly rooted in his personal experience and sexual development. Nevertheless they offer nuanced insight to any reader willing to engage them on their own terms, that is, with consideration for the poet’s personal, queer (read gay male of a certain era) context...|$|R

25|$|The 2008 {{financial}} credit crisis {{led to the}} collapse of several notable investment banks, such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (one of the largest investment banks in the world) and the hurried sale <b>of</b> <b>Merrill</b> Lynch and the much smaller Bear Stearns to much larger banks, which effectively rescued them from bankruptcy. The entire financial services industry, including numerous investment banks, was rescued by government loans through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Surviving U.S. investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to traditional bank holding companies to accept TARP relief. Similar situations occurred across the globe with countries rescuing their banking industry. Initially, banks received part of a $700 billion TARP intended to stabilize the economy and thaw the frozen credit markets. Eventually, taxpayer assistance to banks reached nearly $13 trillion, most without much scrutiny, lending did not increase and credit markets remained frozen.|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2008, Bank of America {{announced}} {{its intention to}} purchase Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. in an all-stock deal worth approximately $50billion.

Around the same time Bank of America was reportedly also in talks to purchase Lehman Brothers, however a lack of government guarantees caused the bank to abandon talks with Lehman. Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy the same day Bank of America {{announced its}} plans to acquire Merrill Lynch. This acquisition made Bank of America the largest financial services company in the world. Temasek Holdings, the largest shareholder <b>of</b> <b>Merrill</b> Lynch & Co., Inc., briefly became one of the largest shareholders of Bank of America, with a 3% stake.
