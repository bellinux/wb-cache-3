5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least <b>one</b> <b>good</b> without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|Availability of {{substitute}} goods: The {{more and}} closer the substitutes available, {{the higher the}} elasticity is likely to be, as people can easily switch from <b>one</b> <b>good</b> to another if an even minor price change is made; There is a strong substitution effect. If no close substitutes are available, the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is sick of Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) {{pointless}} text messages. After one text, Darryl tells Andy {{that he is}} one bad text {{away from}} being blocked, but Andy wagers that he is <b>one</b> <b>good</b> text from a high five, to which Darryl agrees. Darryl then gets a text from Andy telling {{him to come to}} the parking lot, where there are pigeons eating an ice cream cone. Darryl laughs and gives Andy a high five.|$|E

5|$|In {{a simple}} {{exchange}} economy, the contract curve describes {{the set of}} bundles that exhaust the gains from trade. But in a Robinson Crusoe/Friday economy, there {{is another way to}} exchange goods – to produce less of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> and more of the other.|$|E
5|$|With {{economies of}} scale, the PPF would curve inward, with the {{opportunity}} cost of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> falling as more of it is produced. Specialization in producing successive units of a good determines its opportunity cost (say from mass production methods or specialization of labor).|$|E
5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E

5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> could be produced only by diverting resources from the other good, resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player is judged by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, <b>one</b> <b>good</b> and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E
5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, <b>one</b> <b>good</b> and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed private railroad car to take her from city to city when the show toured.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, <b>one</b> <b>good</b> thing about it, {{and that was}} the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E

25|$|Scarcity is {{represented}} in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume beyond the PPF (such as at X) and by the negative slope of the curve. If production of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> increases along the curve, production of the other good decreases, an inverse relationship. This is because increasing output of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter.|$|E

25|$|The {{slope of}} the curve at a point on it gives the {{trade-off}} between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> costs in units forgone of the other good, {{an example of a}} real opportunity cost. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. Along the PPF, scarcity implies that choosing more of <b>one</b> <b>good</b> in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good. Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.|$|E
