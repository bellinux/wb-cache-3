5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, present-day Argentina offered fewer {{economic}} advantages {{compared to other}} parts of the Spanish Empire such as Mexico or Peru, which caused it to assume a peripheral position within the Spanish colonial economy. It lacked deposits of gold or <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals,</b> nor did it have established native civilizations to subject to the encomienda.|$|E
5|$|The Little Applegate River's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled about 11,000 {{years ago by}} the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede Native American tribes. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the early 19th century. Two boomtowns—Sterlingville and Buncom—were founded in the 1850s and grew rapidly as gold and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> were discovered. They slowly declined in population as the supply of gold was exhausted; only three buildings remain in Buncom, while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the gold}} coins were {{certainly}} the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> were undoubtedly also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{have lived}} in the Chetco River's {{watershed}} for the last one to three thousand years. Several explorers, including Sir Francis Drake, George Vancouver, and Jedediah Smith, visited the region between the 16th and 19thcenturies, and found the Chetco people inhabiting the area. Non-indigenous settlers arrived soon after gold and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> were discovered in the 1840s and 1850s. The town of Brookings was founded in the early 20th century, and incorporated in 1951. Fourteen thousand residents of Brookings and Harbor rely on the Chetco for drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} rocks in Oregon, {{some of the}} {{formations}} in these terranes date to the Triassic, nearly 250million years ago. Between 165 and 170million years ago, in the Jurassic, faulting consolidated the Klamath terranes offshore during what geologists call the Siskiyou orogeny. This three- to five-million-year episode of intense tectonic activity pushed sedimentary rocks deep enough into the mantle to melt them and then forced them to the surface as granitic plutons. Belts of plutons, which contain gold and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals,</b> run through the Klamaths and include the Ashland pluton, the Grayback batholith east of Oregon Caves National Monument, the Grants Pass pluton, the Gold Hill pluton, the Jacksonville pluton, and others. Miners have worked rich deposits of gold, silver, copper, nickel, and other metals in several districts of the Klamaths. Placer mining in the mid-19thcentury soon led to lode mining for gold. Aside from a mine in eastern Oregon, the Greenback Mine along Grave Creek, a Rogue tributary, was the most productive gold mine in Oregon.|$|E
50|$|Francisco del Puerto {{was rescued}} by the Venetian Sebastian Cabot, {{and told him}} about myths of sources of silver in the area. This {{promoted}} further explorations in the area. There was no silver, nor any <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal,</b> but those initial myths influenced the modern name of Argentina.|$|R
50|$|Skaergaardite is {{associated}} with igneous intrusions containing well-preserved, oxide-rich, tholeiitic gabbro. It is found as inclusions in titanian magnetite, ilmenite, pyroxenes, and plagioclase. Skaergaardite can occur as an inclusion by itself, but is more commonly found in composite microglobule inclusions of copper iron sulfide minerals and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> bearing minerals.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{explosive}} tendency of this compound, industrial techniques for extracting purifying gold compounds are very few. There was a novel biogas extraction of <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> from scrapped electronics that worked very well, but {{the creation of}} fulminating gold and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> amines limits its widespread use. However, there are patents and methods that use fulminating gold as an intermediate {{in a process of}} turning low purity gold into high purity gold for electronics.|$|R

50|$|After the {{discovery}} of the Comstock Lode in 1859, the town developed seemingly overnight on the eastern slopes of Mount Davidson, perched at a 6200-foot elevation. Below the town were dug intricate tunnels and shafts for silver mining. The Comstock Lode discovery and subsequent growth of Virginia City was unequaled by the history of <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> discoveries. By 1876 Nevada produced over half of all the <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> in the United States. The Comstock produced silver and gold ore valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars. The wealth supported the Northern cause during the American Civil War and flooded the world monetary markets, resulting in economic changes.|$|R

50|$|Few {{of these}} {{machines}} remain. Despite being sold or leased in very large numbers for a mainframe system of its era, {{only a few}} System/360 computers still exist, and few of them still run. Most machines were scrapped when {{they could no longer}} profitably be leased, certainly for the value of the gold and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> content of their circuits but possibly also to keep these machines from competing with IBM's newer computers, such as the System/370. As with all classic mainframe systems, complete System/360 computers were prohibitively large to put in storage, and too expensive to maintain.|$|R
50|$|Gold {{does not}} rot. Neither does silver, or any <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> or gem. They are, moreover, useless, their {{aesthetic}} value not entering into the equation. One can heap {{up as much}} of them as one wishes, or take them in trade for food. By the tacit consent of mankind, they become a form of money (one accepts gold in exchange for apples {{with the understanding that}} someone else will accept that gold in exchange for wheat). One can therefore avoid the spoilage limitation by selling all that one has amassed before it rots; the limits on acquisition thus disappear.|$|R
25|$|Mining as an {{industry}} underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe. The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron. <b>Other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> were also used, mainly for gilding or coinage. Initially, many metals were obtained through open-pit mining, and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths, rather than through deep mine shafts. Around the 14th century, the growing use of weapons, armour, stirrups, and horseshoes greatly increased the demand for iron. Medieval knights, for example, were often laden with up to 100 pounds of plate or chain link armour in addition to swords, lances and other weapons. The overwhelming dependency on iron for military purposes spurred iron production and extraction processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{main thread}} running {{through much of}} Umicore's history is the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK), a company {{incorporated}} in 1906 to exploit the vast natural resources of the Congo Free State, later the Belgian Congo and now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Initially the UMHK concentrated on mining the state's extensive copper deposits, before diversifying into cobalt, tin, uranium (in which it at one point held a near-monopoly in global supply) and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals.</b> The company also constructed casting and smelting facilities, eventually growing {{to such an extent}} that it represented around half of all revenues taken in by the Congolese government. In early January 1967, the UMHK was nationalized by the regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko, and over $800 million of the company's assets were seized by the state.|$|E
25|$|Techniques of collage {{were first}} {{used at the}} time of the {{invention}} of paper in China, around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in Japan, when calligraphers began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their poems. The technique of collage appeared in medieval Europe during the 13th century. Gold leaf panels started to be applied in Gothic cathedrals around the 15th and 16th centuries. Gemstones and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> were applied to religious images, icons, and also, to coats of arms. An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of Mary Delany. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for memorabilia (e.g. applied to photo albums) and books (e.g. Hans Christian Andersen, Carl Spitzweg).|$|E
40|$|The Oligo–Miocene {{volcanic}} cycle {{was accompanied}} by intense hydrothermal phenomena, which produced extensive alteration zones and ore deposition, mostly of <b>precious</b> <b>metals.</b> The low price of gold before the seventies prevented any considerations for these occurrences. The worldwide development of studies concerning volcanic-related deposits caused renewed interest {{in this kind of}} epithermal mineralizations in the island and a prospecting program was developed in the eighties. A series of field surveys showed that hydrothermal alteration halos are widespread in the volcanic terrains, and Au–Ag bearing mineralised outcrops were detected in a few localities. An exploration program was performed which reached the ore evaluation stage in two areas. At present the Furtei mine is currently the only high sulfidation gold mine in Europe, while soil sampling confirmed that the Osilo area offer potential for low sulfidation <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> occurrences. Several <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> indications will be explored in the near future...|$|R
50|$|The artistic remains {{uncovered}} at Sri Ksetra {{are primarily}} Buddhist. However {{the existence of}} sculpture and fragments depicting Hindu deities, most often Vishnu, suggests that Vaishnavism was practice alongside Buddhism. Remains at Sri Ksetra suggest a thriving Buddhist culture that existed in this Pyu settlement. The variety of Buddhist material includes votive tablets, stone sculptures, bronze and <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> sculptures, architectural fragments and reliquary objects. Along with other artefacts including hand made beads crafted from stone, glass, terracotta and bone, rings and silver bowls and plates.

500|$|The {{discovery}} {{of gold and}} <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metals</b> in the watershed brought settlers to {{the region in the}} 1840s and 1850s. Nickel, cobalt, and chromium were also mined. The town of Harbor was founded on the south bank of the Chetco River in 1891, and a ferry service across the river opened in 1904. It was shut down in 1915 when the Chetco Bridge opened. In 1912, the Brookings Lumber & Box Company moved north from the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California to the southern Oregon coast region. The company constructed a sawmill in 1914, and founded the town of Brookings. Brookings was not incorporated until 1951. The region remained relatively isolated due to its mountainous terrain until 1924, when Highway 101 was extended from Crescent City, California, to Brookings. In 1932, the Isaac Lee Patterson Bridge was completed over the Rogue River to the north, connecting the region {{to the rest of the}} Oregon coast. In 1917, a [...] wharf was built at the mouth of the river. Jetties were constructed on either side of its mouth by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1957.|$|E

This masterpiece of Phidias is mostly made of ivory and precious stones, and not of gold. Yet the statue is magnificent. Besides, gold or any <b>other</b> <b>precious</b> <b>metal</b> only gives rise to beauty if it is properly used.
