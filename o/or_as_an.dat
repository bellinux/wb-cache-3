5|$|Boitani {{discusses}} the modern {{use of the}} character of Troilus in a chapter entitled Eros and Thanatos. Love and death, the latter either as a tragedy in itself <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> epic symbol of Troy's own destruction, therefore, are the two core elements of the Troilus myth for the editor of the first book-length survey of it from ancient to modern times. He sees the character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in the manner of Ulysses and also blocked from the possibility of development as an archetypal figure of troubled youth by Hamlet. Troilus' appeal for the 20th and 21st century is his very humanity.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{can occur}} accidentally <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to end one's life. CO is a colorless and odorless gas which is initially non-irritating. It is produced during incomplete burning of organic matter. This can occur from motor vehicles, heaters, or cooking equipment {{that run on}} carbon-based fuels. It can also occur from exposure to methylene chloride. Carbon monoxide primarily causes adverse effects by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) preventing the blood from carrying oxygen. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase are affected. Diagnosis {{is based on a}} HbCO level of more than 3% among nonsmokers and more than 10% among smokers.|$|E

This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and honey badger with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey badger. These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Koubek {{was hired}} to help {{renovate}} the long-shuttered, historic Willard Hotel. The original hotel (consisting of six townhouses joined together) was built in 1816, renovated and enlarged by leaseholder Henry Willard in 1847, and the current 12-story structure erected in 1901. Due to mismanagement and competition from more modern hotels, the Willard closed in 1968. With the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue in the 1960s and 1970s, the Willard was threatened repeatedly with demolition. In May 1974, the National Trust for Historic Preservation paid Koubek $25,000 to study saving the hotel, either as a hotel, as a mixed-used structure, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> office building. The Willard's owners, Charles Benenson and Robert Arnow, had earlier commissioned Koubek to design a modern office building for the site which would have required demolition of the structure.|$|E

5|$|Nico Ditch was {{constructed}} some {{time between the}} end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman conquest in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> administrative boundary. It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist Anglo-Saxons, or {{it may have been a}} late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the Middle Ages.|$|E

He appears again in 1258, when he participated in the coup launched by his elder brother Michael Palaiologos, then megas konostaulos, against the regent for the underage John IV Laskaris (r. 1258–1261), George Mouzalon. After Mouzalon's murder, Michael placed the young emperor under the protection of John and their half-brother Constantine. Michael quickly secured his own nomination as regent, and in turn appointed John as megas domestikos and sent him to command the Nicaean army in Macedonia, with Alexios Strategopoulos and John Raoul Petraliphas as subordinate commanders.|$|E

It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23 January, either as an agreed precaution against discovery <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> unauthorised act by Quintal—in either case, there was now no means of escape. The island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers—uninhabited, virtually inaccessible, with plenty of food, water and fertile land. For a while, mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably. Christian settled down with Isabella; a son, Thursday October Christian, was born, as were other children. Christian's authority as leader gradually diminished, and he became prone to long periods of brooding and introspection.|$|E

5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and {{the taking of}} certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis {{is based on the}} blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E
5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group.
