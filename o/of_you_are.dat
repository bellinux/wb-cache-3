5|$|The telenovela {{features}} Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, {{who both}} {{appeared in the}} successful telenovela Muñeca Brava, as lead actors. The {{relationship between the two}} was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in You Are the One on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muñeca Brava, the narrative <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> the One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. You Are the One organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.|$|E

All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls.

According to Brown, he had rejected an offer to play a larger role, and limited his attendance to a single day because of scheduling demands.|$|E

According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked at everyone and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. If we start to play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E

500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, because I {{feel that it}} is my most representative film, the one that is the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The two <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 24, 1953, Steiger {{played the}} title role in Paddy Chayefsky's [...] "Marty" [...] episode of the Goodyear Television Playhouse. The role had {{originally}} been intended for Martin Ritt, who later became a director. [...] "Marty" [...] {{is the story of}} a lonely and homely butcher from the Bronx in search of love. The play was a critical success that increased Steiger's public exposure; Tom Stempel noted that he brought [...] "striking intensity to his performance as Marty, particularly in giving us Marty's pain". As Steiger refused to sign a seven-year studio contract, he was replaced with Ernest Borgnine in the film Marty (1955), which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as the Best Actor Oscar for Borgnine. 1953 proved to be Steiger's breakthrough year; he garnered Sylvania Awards for Marty and four other best performances of the year—as Vishinsky and Rudolph Hess in two episodes <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> There, as gangster Dutch Schultz in a thriller, and as a radar operator in My Brother's Keeper.|$|E

On September 9, 1992, ABC {{announced that it}} would be switching the format of its political coverage to give less recognition to staged sound bites. [...] "We're aware that a lot <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers on World News Tonight. [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine. There will be less attention to staged appearances and sound bites designed exclusively for television." [...] After Bill Clinton was elected as president in November 1992, Jennings featured the new administration in two of his specials for children; he anchored President Clinton: Answering Children's Questions in February 1993; and Kids in the Crossfire: Violence in America in November 1993, a live special from a Washington, D.C. junior high school which featured Attorney General Janet Reno and rapper MC Lyte.|$|E

500|$|Steiger's early roles, {{although}} minor, were numerous, {{especially in}} television series {{during the early}} 1950s, when he appeared in more than 250 live television productions over a five-year period. He was spotted by Fred Coe, NBC's manager of program development, who increasingly gave him bigger parts. Steiger considered television to be what repertory theatre had been for an earlier generation, and {{saw it as a}} place where he could test his talent with a plethora of different roles. Soon afterward he began receiving positive reviews from critics such as John Crosby, who noted that Steiger regularly gave [...] "effortless persuasive performances". Among Steiger's credits were Danger (1950–53), Lux Video Theatre (1951), Out There (1951), Tales of Tomorrow (1952–53), The Gulf Playhouse (1953), Medallion Theatre (1953), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1953), and as Shakespeare's Romeo in [...] "The First Command Performance of Romeo and Juliet (1957)" [...] episode <b>of</b> <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> There in 1954, under director Sidney Lumet. He continued to make appearances in various playhouse television productions, appearing in five episodes of Kraft Theatre (1952–54), which earned him praise from critics, six episodes of The Philco Television Playhouse (1951–55) and two episodes of Schlitz Playhouse of Stars (1957–58). Steiger made his big screen debut in 1953, with a small role in Fred Zinnemann's Teresa, shot in 1951. Steiger, who described himself as [...] "cocky", won over Zinnemann by praising his direction. Zinnemann recalled that Steiger was [...] "very popular, extremely articulate and full of remarkable memories", and the two remained highly respectful of each other for life.|$|E

Her birth took fifteen hours, and it was like we were working against each other, like she was raging for the remainder of darkness that she knew then as light. Womb-light, deeper than a bruise.
