5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an <b>overcast</b> day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an <b>overcast</b> day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E

Hoidge's counterattack foiled the German. Bowman and Maybery remained to join the attack on Voss. Hoidge, having broken off his pursuit of the falling Pfalz, changed the drum magazine in his Lewis gun, and climbed to join battle.|$|E
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of August1, a strong central dense <b>overcast,</b> an area of high, thick clouds, developed over the center of circulation, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Throughout the next day, the system gradually developed an eye within the central dense <b>overcast,</b> leading to further strengthening. Operationally, Guillermo was thought to have briefly leveled out in intensity on August2; however, in post-storm analysis, the NHC discovered that a steady period of rapid intensification took place. Unlike most hurricanes in the eastern Pacific, Guillermo was investigated by Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft during its rapid intensification stage. The aircraft released several dropsondes into the storm to gather meteorological data. This mission {{marked the first time}} the Hurricane Hunters recorded high-resolution wind data from flight level to within several meters of the ocean surface inside the eyewall of a major hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Director of {{photography}} Darius Khondji was initially reluctant about {{working on a}} musical but was inspired by Parker's passion for the project. For the film's visual style, Khondji and Parker were influenced by the works of American realist painter George Bellows. Khondji shot Evita using Moviecam cameras, with Cooke anamorphic lenses. He used Eastman EXR 5245 film stock for exteriors in Argentina, 5293 for the Argentinean interiors, and 5248 for any scenes shot during <b>overcast</b> days and combat sequences.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Labonte {{was asked}} to leave the band due to {{personal}} and artistic differences. He had ideas for a side project while {{a member of the}} band, and went on to form All That Remains. The band looked for a replacement vocalist and eventually recruited Milford, MA native Brian Fair of the pioneering metalcore band <b>Overcast.</b> The band had been friends with Fair for years. After a US Summer tour with Shai Hulud, <b>Overcast</b> disbanded and the band asked Fair if he would like to join Shadows Fall. While on tour Shadows Fall was signed to Century Media Records. The band recorded its second studio album Of One Blood with Fair on vocals in 2000, and the release included re-recorded songs from Somber Eyes to the Sky. In 2001, David Germain decided to leave the band due to alcoholism, and was replaced by former Stigmata and Burning Human drummer Jason Bittner.|$|E

30|$|We must report that, {{the length}} of data used in this work does not allow the {{proposed}} models to adapt to all types of weather conditions, this will cause a decrease in performance of our models {{especially in the case}} of <b>overcasting</b> days. Also, to increase forecast horizon the use of only local collected data is not sufficient, in this case the use of weather forecasts will be an obligation. Those issues will be resolved in future works.|$|R

5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on <b>overcast</b> days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely <b>overcast</b> (when polarised light may be used).|$|E

40|$|This {{review article}} {{describes}} {{the current status of}} resin-bonded fixed partial denture, splint and <b>overcasting</b> design. Several such designs have been introduced through the years, but there is no typical standard yet for the design of anterior resin-bonded prostheses. On the other hand, the design of posterior resin-bonded prostheses has generally been a standard D-shaped structure. To splint abutment teeth, including pathological mobile teeth, the application of resin-bonded retainers with additional retentive structures is recommended. Although a conventional design for resin-bonded overcastings has not been established yet, it is usually easy to add mechanical structures. The problem in clinical practice is the esthetics of the retainers, although the key to solving this problem may be to apply tooth-colored material...|$|R

5|$|A mid-level ridge over Mexico {{caused the}} cyclone to track {{steadily}} northwestward. With warm water temperatures and low vertical wind shear, the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Ileana. Convection developed and organized into a central dense <b>overcast,</b> and with abundant low-level moisture, rapid deepening was expected. An eye {{formed in the}} center of the convection, and Ileana attained hurricane status late on August22. On August23, about 48hours after forming, Ileana reached major hurricane status and a peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) about 60mi (100km) southeast of Socorro Island. It also attained an atmospheric pressure of 955mbar, as well as an eye diameter of 23mi (37km).|$|E

By the afternoon of June 2, the center exhibited an elongated appearance within its associated central dense <b>overcast,</b> a large area of organized mid-tropospheric convection. Around 1800 UTC that same day, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 990 mbar (hPa; 29.23 inHg).|$|E
30|$|We {{wanted to}} know whether the {{reduction}} of the light intensity by the greenhouse sheeting was substantial or negligible for seedlings’ photosynthetic performance. In order to estimate the maximum capacity of photosynthetic performance, a light response curve was created in March 2011, using 9, two-month old seedlings raised in a greenhouse from the same set of cones originating from Denali, with the same protocol stated previously. In addition, in the field, light levels inside and outside the greenhouses were measured using a light sensor on the LiCor 6400 XT photosynthesis system. The sensor was placed facing directly to the sun light and data were recorded every 2  seconds for one minute. Data were obtained both sunny and <b>overcasting</b> days, obtaining 2 – 4 data per either inside or outside a greenhouse, then averaged.|$|R
40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} {{is employed}} {{to apply a}} mechanically stable reinforcing pattern to polymeric microsieves prepared by float casting, where particles are used as molds for the pores. A mixture of silica particles and nonvolatile monomers is cast onto a water surface and subsequently photopolymerized to produce membranes consisting of a polymer film with embedded particles. These composite membranes are transferred onto an aluminum foil. Subsequently, a UV-curable ink is directly inkjet-printed onto the membranes in line patterns of grids or honeycombs and cured by UV radiation to create a mechanically reinforcing pattern. Afterwards, the particles and the aluminum foil are removed by chemical etching. The reinforcing pattern <b>overcasts</b> 40 % of the previously manufactured membrane, is mechanically stable, and gives the microsieves such a robustness {{that they can be}} handled in further manufacturing processes...|$|R
