25|$|It is {{important}} to remember that unlike, for example, Roman roads, these medieval routes were not essentially physical entities—thin strips of land with physical boundaries; rather they were rights of way, sometimes with legal and traditional status. Routes tended to follow the line <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance,</b> twisting and turning to avoid poorly drained areas and land that was easily overlooked. Where there was a hill to climb or a difficult area to pass through, multiple tracks would develop, the traveller taking the easiest route. Routes may also have varied seasonally as changing weather affected the condition of the pathway.|$|E
25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E

2500|$|The Santa Anas are {{katabatic}} winds—Greek for [...] "flowing downhill", arising {{in higher}} altitudes and blowing down towards sea level. Santa Ana winds originate from high-pressure airmasses over the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. Any low-pressure area over the Pacific Ocean, {{off the coast}} of California, can change the stability of the Great Basin High, causing a pressure gradient that turns the synoptic scale winds southward down {{the eastern side of the}} Sierra Nevada and into the Southern California region. Cool, dry air flows outward in a clockwise spiral from the high pressure center. This cool, dry airmass sweeps across the deserts of eastern California toward the coast, and encounters the towering Transverse Ranges, which separate coastal Southern California from the deserts. The airmass, flowing from high pressure in the Great Basin to a low pressure center off the coast, takes the path <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> by channeling through the mountain passes to the lower coastal elevations, as the low pressure area off the coast pulls the airmass offshore.|$|E
2500|$|Arcos, a British-Soviet {{trading company}} that {{temporarily}} served as liaison between two countries without diplomatic ties, declared a public competition for its Moscow headquarters in 1924.

Moisei Ginzburg criticized the ‘’Arcos’’ draft as lacking any true novelty, which {{was expected of}} constructivist architecture: it {{was little more than}} a traditional office block wrapped in modern materials.

According to Khan-Magomedov, by 1927 the Vesnins, fed up with indiscriminate copies of their own work, also subscribed to Ginzburg's opinion.

2500|$|Infiltration {{occurs when}} an IV fluid or {{medication}} accidentally enters the surrounding tissue {{rather than the}} vein. It may occur when the vein itself ruptures (the elderly are particularly prone to fragile veins due to a paucity of supporting tissues), when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device, when the device is not sited correctly, from increased vein porosity or when the entry point of the device into the vein becomes the path <b>of</b> <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> (e.g. if a cannula is in a vein for some time, the vein may scar and close {{and the only way}} for fluid to leave is along the outside of the cannula where it enters the vein). Infiltration is an inadvertent administration of a nonvesicant solution/drug into the tissue, which happens so often when the tourniquet isn't removed in a timely fashion. [...] Infiltration is characterized by coolness and pallor to the skin as well as localized swelling or edema. It is treated by removing the intravenous access device and elevating the affected limb so that the collected fluids can drain away. Sometimes injections of hyaluronidase can be used to speed the dispersal of the fluid/drug. Infiltration {{is one of the most}} common adverse effects of IV therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue, most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent, in which case it is called extravasation and extensive necrosis can occur.|$|E

50|$|Exploring {{the physics}} and {{engineering}} behind this design, requires looking at basic magnetism. A standard bar magnet has two magnetic poles: north and south. (The north will read positive on a gauss meter {{and the south}} will read negative.) Magnetic field are mapped using magnetic flux lines. These lines are a graphical representation of the magnetic field density. They show the direction of flow for the magnetic field and represent relative field strength - the closer together the lines are, the stronger the magnetic field. Flux lines will always travel from the north pole to the nearest south pole and always leave and enter surfaces at 90°, or perpendicular to the surface. They can only travel in straight lines or curved paths, which means they can never make a sudden, abrupt change in direction. Flux lines will also always follow a path <b>of</b> <b>least</b> magnetic <b>resistance.</b> Most importantly, they can never cross one another.|$|R

50|$|Swirl: Variable {{geometry}} {{can create}} a beneficial air swirl pattern, or turbulence in the combustion chamber. The swirling helps distribute the fuel and form a homogeneous air-fuel mixture - this aids the initiation of the combustion process, helps minimise engine knocking, and helps facilitate complete combustion. At low revolutions per minute (rpm), {{the speed of the}} airflow is increased by directing the air through a longer path with limited capacity (i.e., cross-sectional area) - and this assists in improving low engine speed torque. At high rpms, the shorter and larger path opens when the load increases, so that a greater amount <b>of</b> air with <b>least</b> <b>resistance</b> can enter the chamber - this helps maximise 'top-end' power. In double overhead camshaft (DOHC) designs, the air paths may sometimes be connected to separate intake valves so the shorter path can be excluded by de-activating the intake valve itself.|$|R

30|$|Among {{the methods}} using {{bilinear}} shear springs, the assessment method proposed by (Tomazevic 1978) {{which is usually}} known as the POR method and the FEMA 356 method are well-known and extensively used. The POR method is an equivalent static, simplified nonlinear assessment method which assumes that the failure occurs only in the piers without any damage of spandrels. This method, which is historically the first seismic assessment method for structural masonry, {{is based on the}} storey mechanism approach. The procedure consists of a separate inter-storey shear-displacement curve for each storey, in which each masonry pier is typically modelled by a linear elastic, perfectly plastic shear spring of limited ductility. The FEMA 356 method also employs nonlinear shear springs to model the force-displacement response of individual piers. The spandrels of URM walls are only considered to affect the boundary conditions of the piers, i.e. fixed ends or cantilever. The force-displacement relationship for each pier is defined based on the governing failure mode, which is taken as the failure mode <b>of</b> <b>least</b> lateral <b>resistance.</b> In conclusion, the macro-elements that are based on bilinear idealization of the experimental resistance envelope are not reliable, particularly regarding the prediction of the ultimate displacement capacity, due to large scatter in available experimental data.|$|R
