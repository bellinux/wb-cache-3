40|$|Recent {{events have}} underscored {{the need for}} the United States {{government}} to provide streamlined emergency response procedures and subsequent dose estimations for personnel responding to incidents involving radioactive material. Indeed, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements Report No. 138 (NCRP 2001) indicates that exposures received by first responders will be important for a number of reasons, including planning for the appropriate use of key personnel in an extended emergency situation. In response, the Department of Homeland Security has published Protective Action Guides (DHS 2006) to help minimize these exposures and associated risks. This research attempts to provide some additional radiological exposure knowledge so that an Incident Commander, with limited or no information, can make more informed decisions about evacuation, sheltering-in-place, relocation of the public, turn-back levels, defining radiation hazard boundaries, and in-field radiological dose assessments of the radiation workers, responders, and members of the public. A method to provide such insight begins with providing a model that describes the physics of radiation interactions, radiation source and geometry, collection of field measurements, and interpretation of the collected data. A Monte Carlo simulation of the model is performed so that calculated results can be compared to measured values. The results of this investigation indicate that measured organ absorbed doses inside a tissue equivalent phantom compared favorably to the derived organ absorbed doses measured by the Panasonic thermoluminescence dosimeters and with Monte Carlo ??????N?????? Particle modeled results. Additionally, a Victoreen 450 P pressurized ion chamber measured the integrated dose and these results compared well with the Panasonic right lateral TLD. This comparison indicates that the Victoreen 450 P ionization chamber could potentially serve as an estimator of real-time effective dose and <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> if energy and angular dependence corrections could be taken into account. Finally, the data obtained in this investigation indicate that the MCNP model provided a reasonable method to determine <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> and effective dose of a simulated Radiological Dispersal Device in an Inferior-Superior geometry with Na 99 mTcO 4 as the source of radioactive material...|$|E
30|$|Previously {{published}} {{papers on}} dosimetry of bombesin analogues were hardly comparable {{as they used}} various radionuclides, including 99 mTc [28, 29], 64 Cu [31], 18 F [32] or 68 Ga [30, 33, 34], different tracer molecules, different study subjects and dosimetry methodologies. Organ-absorbed dose estimations were heterogeneous even among studies using 68 Ga-labelled bombesin analogues [30, 33, 34]. Absorbed doses of single organs varied greatly between the present study and that of Zhang et al. on the 68 Ga-labelled GRPR agonist NOTA-Aca-BBN [33]. As an example, {{based on the results}} obtained with OLINDA/EXM 1.1 (Additional file 2 : Table S 2), the absorbed dose to the gallbladder was three times higher, whereas the absorbed dose to the pancreas was 368 times lower in [33] than in the present study. In turn, our <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> estimations were, on average, about 70 times higher than those of Zhang et al. [33] (full data not shown). Nevertheless, EDs for reference person were similar: 2.76 E- 02 vs 3.1 E- 02  mSv/MBq in [33] and the present study, respectively. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that organs with the highest wT, such as the gonads (wT[*]=[*] 0.2), received nearly similar doses in both studies.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} image quality and {{dosimetry}} on the Varian cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) system between software Version 1. 4. 13 and Version 1. 4. 11 (referred to as "new" and "old" protocols, respectively, {{in the following}} text). This study investigated <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> total effective dose, and image quality of the CBCT system for the head-and-neck and pelvic regions. Methods and Materials: A calibrated Farmer chamber and two standard cylindrical Perspex CT dosimetry phantoms with diameter of 16 cm (head phantom) and 32 cm (body phantom) were {{used to measure the}} weighted cone-beam computed tomography dose index (CBCTDIw) of the Varian CBCT system. The absorbed dose of different organs was measured in a female anthropomorphic phantom with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) and the total effective dose was estimated according to International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 103. The dose measurement and image quality were studied for head-and-neck and pelvic regions, and comparison was made between the new and old protocols. Results: The values of the new CBCTDIw head-and-neck and pelvic protocols were 36. 6 and 29. 4 mGy, respectively. The total effective doses from the new head-and-neck and pelvic protocols were 1. 7 and 8. 2 mSv, respectively. The absorbed doses of lens for the new 200 ?X and old 360 ?X head-and-neck protocols were 3. 8 and 59. 4 mGy, respectively. The additional secondary cancer risk from daily CBCT might be up to 2. 8 %.

The developing embryo/fetus presents a high sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Therefore, estimation of the radiation dose delivered to the embryo/fetus and pregnant patients from PET examinations to assess potential radiation risks is highly praised. We constructed eight embryo/fetus models at various gestation periods with 25 identified tissues according to reference data recommended by the ICRP publication 89 representing the anatomy of the developing embryo/fetus. The developed embryo/fetus models were integrated into realistic anthropomorphic computational phantoms of the pregnant female and used for estimating, using Monte Carlo calculations, S-values of common positron-emitting radionuclides, <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose,</b> and effective dose of a number of positron-emitting labeled radiotracers. The absorbed dose is nonuniformly distributed in the fetus. The absorbed dose of the kidney and liver of the 8 -week-old fetus are about 47. 45 % and 44. 76 % higher than the average absorbed dose of the fetal total body for all investigated radiotracers. For F- 18 -FDG, the fetal effective doses are 2. 90 E- 02, 3. 09 E- 02, 1. 79 E- 02, 1. 59 E- 02, 1. 47 E- 02, 1. 40 E- 02, 1. 37 E- 02, and 1. 27 E- 02 mSv/MBq at the 8 th, 10 th, 15 th, 20 th, 25 th, 30 th, 35 th, and 38 th weeks of gestation, respectively.

40|$|International audience: Bone sarcoma as {{a second}} {{malignancy}} is rare but highly fatal. The present knowledge about radiation-absorbed organ dose-response is insufficient to predict the risks induced by radiation therapy techniques. The objective {{of the present study}} was to assess the treatment-induced risk for bone sarcoma following a childhood cancer and particularly the related risk of radiotherapy. Therefore, a retrospective cohort of 4, 171 survivors of a solid childhood cancer treated between 1942 and 1986 in France and Britain has been followed prospectively. We collected detailed information on treatments received during childhood cancer. Additionally, an innovative methodology has been developed to evaluate the dose-response relationship between bone sarcoma and radiation dose throughout this cohort. The median follow-up was 26  years, and 39 patients had developed bone sarcoma. It was found that the overall incidence was 45 -fold higher [standardized incidence ratio 44. 8, 95  % confidence interval (CI) 31. 0 - 59. 8] than expected from the general population, and the absolute excess risk was 35. 1 per 100, 000 person-years (95  % CI 24. 0 - 47. 1). The risk of bone sarcoma increased slowly up to a cumulative radiation <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of 15  Gy [hazard ratio (HR)  =  8. 2, 95  % CI 1. 6 - 42. 9] and then strongly increased for higher radiation doses (HR for 30  Gy or more 117. 9, 95  % CI 36. 5 - 380. 6), compared with patients not treated with radiotherapy. A linear model with an excess relative risk per Gy of 1. 77 (95  % CI 0. 6213 - 5. 935) provided a close fit to the data. These findings have important therapeutic implications: Lowering the radiation dose to the bones should reduce the incidence of secondary bone sarcomas. Other therapeutic solutions should be preferred to radiotherapy in bone sarcoma-sensitive areas...|$|E

The two most common radiolabelled pharmaceutical agents used are Tc 99 m-MAG 3 (MAG 3 is also called mercaptoacetyltriglycine) and Tc- 99 m-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentacetate). Tc- 99 m-DTPA is filtered by the glomerulus and used to measure the glomerular filtration rate and is the second most commonly used renal radiopharmaceutical, primarily because it is the least expensive. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to obtain the bio-kinetic data of organ activity as well as <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> of Tc 99 m-DTPA for single photon emitters. Methods: We have carried out a method to obtain accurate organ activity with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Tc- 99 m-DTPA radiopharmaceutical medicine was used as single photon emitters and we have demonstrated effective decay method and conventional method to obtain accurate organ (seven) activity with single photon emission computed SPECT. The observed organ activity is due to the Tc 99 m-DTPA is obtained and the data is compared among male, female and ICRP (international committee for radiation protection) - 53 recommended data as well. Results: The outcome of study revealed that, dose absorbed power of male is greater than female, so in nuclear medicine centre absorbed doses should be estimated separately both for male and female for more proper treatment opportunity. It is also observed that there is no good agreement of absorbed dose values among male, female and ICRP- 53 recommended data. Conclusions: Our achieved result is due to the extreme variation in food values and fundamental needed elements are certainly different between Bangladeshi peoples and foreigners. In case of foreigner's it is almost equal for male and female, whereas for Bangladeshi male and female it is certainly different. [Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol 2016; 5 (4. 000) : 1239 - 1244...|$|E

The <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> values calculated by PHITS for the inner organs are in a good agreement with the experimental data.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Short-term {{toxicological}} evaluations {{have been}} reported for alpha-radioimmunotherapy (RIT) preclinical assays, particularly using bismuth- 213 (213 Bi). Toxicity is greatly influenced by the pharmacokinetics and binding specificity of the vector. It is difficult to assess the effect of non-specific irradiation due to the presence and persistence of the circulating radiopharmaceutical in the blood. To assess this we performed an acute and chronic toxicity study in mice injected with 213 Bi-labeled Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a paragon of a long-term circulating vector. METHOD: Biodistribution kinetics of BSA and of two non-specific antibodies were evaluated after intravascular administration and the <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> for each vector labeled with 213 Bi was calculated. Groups of nude mice were injected with 3. 7, 7. 4 and 11. 1 MBq of 213 Bi-BSA and were followed-up for 385 days. Biochemical plasma parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were measured and blood cell counts (white blood cells, platelets and red blood cells) were performed. Histological examination of mouse organs was performed at different time points in the follow-up period. RESULTS: Hematological toxicity was transient and non-limiting for all evaluated activities since at the highest injected activity (11. 1 MBq) mice died with liver and kidney failure but a normal blood cell count (median survival time of 189 days). This liver toxicity was objectified by an increase of both ALT and AST and by histological examination. Mice injected with 7. 4 MBq of 213 Bi-BSA had a median survival time of 324 days with increased plasma BUN and creatinine, due to impaired kidney function that was confirmed by histological examination. Injection of 3. 7 MBq 213 Bi-BSA was safe, with no obvious plasma enzyme modifications nor significant histological abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Hematological toxicity was not a limiting feature in this study. Hepatic injury leading to liver failure was observed at the highest injected dose {{which is consistent with}} liver damage observed in human clinical trials. For the intermediate injected activity, the benefit-risk balance should be evaluated because of the risk of long-term toxicity to kidney. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|E

30|$|Alternatives {{have been}} {{suggested}} to try and reduce the imaging burden on patients, such as a hybrid 2 D/ 3 D imaging approach [6 – 8]. This method uses multiple planar acquisitions which require less imaging time and only a single SPECT acquisition {{that is used to}} scale the TAC for the volume of interest. However, the choice of time point for the SPECT acquisition will affect results, and the assumption of a fixed spatial radioactivity distribution within the target and comparable kinetics from planar and tomographic imaging is questionable [9]. Another method that may benefit patients is that of limited duration SPECT acquisitions aimed at satisfactory quantification as opposed to clinical diagnostic imaging, to obtain multiple time point SPECT data for dosimetry [10]. However, neither of these approaches address the issue of patients returning to the clinic on subsequent days following their treatment. Heikkonen et al. have demonstrated the feasibility of using two SPECT/CT scans (at 24 and 168 [*]h) to estimate kidney dosimetry following Lutate treatment with acceptable accuracy when compared to estimates derived from three time points [11], which they recommend be performed after each treatment cycle. This does still represent a large burden on clinical facilities, and in our experience, it is the late time point that is the most difficult for patients to return for. A recent study by Sundlöv et al. [8] explored possible methods to simplify renal dosimetry through abbreviated scanning and dosimetry protocols, concluding that the use of a single SPECT/CT at 96 [*]h acquired every cycle in conjunction with planar data was sufficient to derive reliable renal dose estimates, highlighting the importance of a late imaging time point. This has been further advocated by Hänscheid et al. [12] who reported on a simplified method requiring only a single quantitative SPECT/CT acquired 4 [*]days after administration of Lutate to derive adequate estimates of <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose.</b> Garske et al [13] demonstrated the feasibility of using complete imaging at cycle 1 to derive an effective half-life for an individual patient that could then be used to estimate TACs at subsequent cycles based on only 24 [*]h imaging [13]. Whilst changes in tumour burden and patient disease status may alter effective half-life at later cycles, this technique offers a compromise between patient-specific measures and simplified dosimetry for patients that are not at high risk of renal toxicity.|$|E

To be used as input in OLINDA/EXM 2.0, time-integrated activity coefficients were derived from manually drawn regions of interest over the following body regions: brain, thyroid, lungs, heart, liver, gallbladder, spleen, stomach, kidneys, adrenals, red marrow, pancreas, intestines, urinary bladder and whole body. <b>Organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> and effective dose (ED) were calculated with OLINDA/EXM 2.0 using the NURBS voxelized phantoms adjusted to the ICRP- 89 organ masses and ICRP 103 tissue-weighting factors. Additional <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> estimations were performed with OLINDA/EXM 1.1 to be comparable with similar previous publications.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Fibrosis is {{involved}} in many chronic diseases. It affects the functionality of vital organs, such as liver, lung, heart and kidney. Two novel imaging agents for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of fibrosis have previously pre-clinically demonstrated promising target binding and organ distribution characteristics. However, the relevant disease monitoring in the clinical setup would require multiple repetitive examinations per year. Thus, it {{is of paramount importance}} to investigate the absorbed doses and total effective doses and thus, the potential maximum number of examinations per year. Methods: Two cyclic peptide (c[CPGRVMHGLHLGDDEGPC]) analogues coupled via an ethylene glycol linker (EG 2) to either 2 -(4, 7 -bis(2 -(tert-butoxy) - 2 -oxoethyl) - 1, 4, 7 -triazonan- 1 -yl) acetic acid (NO 2 A-Col) or 4 -(4, 7 -bis(2 -(tert-butoxy) - 2 -oxoethyl) - 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononan- 1 -yl) - 5 -(tert-butoxy) - 5 -oxopentanoic acid (NODAGA-Col) were labelled with 68 Ga. The resulting agents, [68 Ga]Ga-NO 2 A-Col and [68 Ga]Ga-NODAGA-Col, were administered in the tail vein of male and female Sprague–Dawley rats (N = 24). An ex vivo organ distribution study was performed at the 5 -, 10 -, 20 -, 40 -, 60 - and 120 -min time points. The resulting data were extrapolated for the estimation of human organ and total body absorbed and total effective doses using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM 1. 1) assuming a similar organ distribution pattern between the species. Time-integrated radioactivity in each organ was calculated by trapezoidal integration followed by a single-exponential fit to the data points extrapolated to infinity. The resulting values were used for the residence time calculation. Results: Ex vivo organ distribution data revealed fast blood clearance and washout from most of the organs. Although the highest <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> was found for kidneys (0. 1 mGy/MBq), this organ was not the dose-limiting one and would allow for the administration of over 1460 MBq per year for both [68 Ga]Ga-NO 2 A-Col and [68 Ga]Ga-NODAGA-Col. The total effective dose was the limiting parameter with 0. 0155 / 0. 0156 (female/male) mSv/MBq and 0. 0164 / 0. 0158 (female/male) mSv/MBq, respectively, for [68 Ga]Ga-NO 2 A-Col and [68 Ga]Ga-NODAGA-Col. This corresponded to the total amount of radioactivity that could be administered per year of 643 and 621 MBq before reaching the annual limit of 10 mSv. Thus, up to six examinations would be possible. The residence time and organ absorbed doses in liver and spleen were higher for [68 Ga]Ga-NODAGA-Col as compared to [68 Ga]Ga-NO 2 A-Col. Conclusion: The limiting parameter for the administered dose was the total effective dose that would allow for at least six examinations per year that might be sufficient for adequate disease monitoring in longitudinal studies and a routine clinical setup...|$|E
40|$|The mysterious {{death of}} Mr. Alexander Litvinenko who was most {{possibly}} poisoned by Polonium- 210 (210 Po) in November 2006 in London {{attracted the attention}} of the public to the kinetics, dosimetry and the risk of this high radiotoxic isotope in the human body. In the present paper, the urinary excretion of seven persons who were possibly exposed to traces of 210 Po was monitored. The values measured in the GSF Radioanalytical Laboratory are in the range of natural background concentration. To assess the effective dose received by those persons, the time-dependence of the organ equivalent dose and the effective dose after acute ingestion and inhalation of 210 Po were calculated using the biokinetic model for polonium (Po) recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the one recently published by Leggett and Eckerman (L&E). The daily urinary excretion to effective dose conversion factors for ingestion and inhalation were evaluated based on the ICRP and L&E models for members of the public. The ingestion (inhalation) effective dose per unit intake integrated over one day is 1. 7  ×  10 − 8 (1. 4  ×  10 − 7)  Sv Bq− 1, 2. 0  ×  10 − 7 (9. 6  ×  10 − 7)  Sv Bq− 1 over 10  days, 5. 2  ×  10 − 7 (2. 0  ×  10 − 6) Sv Bq− 1 over 30  days and 1. 0  ×  10 − 6 (3. 0  ×  10 − 6) Sv Bq− 1 over 100  days. The daily urinary excretions after acute ingestion (inhalation) of 1  Bq of 210 Po are 1. 1  ×  10 − 3 (1. 0  ×  10 − 4) on day  1, 2. 0  ×  10 − 3 (1. 9  ×  10 − 4) on day  10, 1. 3  ×  10 − 3 (1. 7  ×  10 − 4) on day  30 and 3. 6  ×  10 − 4 (8. 3  ×  10 − 5) Bq d− 1 on day  100, respectively. The resulting committed effective doses range from 2. 1  ×  10 − 3 to 1. 7  ×  10 − 2  mSv by an assumption of ingestion and from 5. 5  ×  10 − 2 to 4. 5  ×  10 − 1  mSv by inhalation. For the case of Mr. Litvinenko, the mean <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> as a function of time was calculated using both the above stated models. The red bone marrow, the kidneys and the liver were considered as the critical organs. Assuming a value of lethal absorbed dose of 5  Gy to the bone marrow, 6  Gy to the kidneys and 8  Gy to the liver, the amount of 210 Po which Mr. Litvinenko might have ingested is therefore estimated to range from 27 to 1, 408  MBq, i. e 0. 2 – 8. 5  μg, depending on the modality of intake and on different assumptions about blood absorption...|$|E
30|$|Six {{low-risk}} {{prostate cancer}} patients were injected with 133 – 178 [*]MBq [68 Ga]PSMA- 11 and examined with four PET/CT acquisitions from injection to 255 [*]min post-injection.

40|$|The {{technical}} {{basis for}} the dose estimates for several radiophar-maceuticals used in nuclear cardiology is reviewed, and cases in which uncertainty has been encountered in the dosimetry of an agent are discussed. Also discussed {{is the issue of}} uncertainties in radiation dose estimates and how to compare the relative risks of studies. Methods: Radiation <b>dose</b> estimates (<b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> and effective doses) from different literature sources were directly compared. Typical values for administered activity per study were used to compare doses that are to be expected in clinical applications. Results: The effective doses for all agents varied from 2 to 15 mSv per study, with the lowest values being seen for 13 N-NH 3 and 15 O-H 2 O studies and the highest values being seen for 201 Tl-chloride studies. The effective doses for 99 mTc- and 201 Tl-labeled agents differed by about a factor of 2, a factor that is comparable to the uncertainty in individual values...|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> from internally incorporated radionuclides {{is based on}} the so-called specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) which represent the fraction of energy emitted in a given source region that is absorbed per unit mass in a specific target organ. Until recently, photon SAFs were calculated using MIRD-type mathematical phantoms. For electrons, the energy released was assumed to be absorbed locally ('ICRP 30 approach'). For this work, photon and electron SAFs were derived with Monte Carlo simulations in the new male voxel-based reference computational phantom adopted by the ICRP and ICRU. The present results show that the assumption of electrons being locally absorbed is not always true at energies above 300 - 500 keV. For source/target organ pairs in close vicinity, high-energy electrons escaping from the source organ may result in cross-fire electron SAFs in the same order of magnitude as those from photons. Examples of <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> per unit activity are given for F- 18 -choline and I- 123 -iodide. The impact of the new electron SAFs used for <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> calculations compared with the previously used assumptions was found to be small. The organ dose coefficients for the two approaches differ by not more than 6 % for most organs. Only for irradiation of the urinary bladder wall by activity in the contents, the ICRP 30 approach presents an overestimation of approximately 40 - 50 %...|$|R
30|$|The {{bone marrow}} (BM) is a main organ {{at risk in}} Lu- 177 -PSMA- 617 therapy of {{prostate}} cancer and Lu- 177 -Octreotate therapy of neuroendocrine tumours. BM dosimetry is challenging and time-consuming, as different sequential quantitative measurements must be combined. The BM <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> from {{the remainder of the}} body (ROB) can be determined from sequential whole-body planar (WB-P) imaging, while quantitative Lu- 177 -SPECT allows for more robust tumour and <b>organ</b> <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses.</b> The aim was to investigate a time-efficient and patient-friendly hybrid protocol (HP) for the ROB <b>absorbed</b> <b>dose</b> to the BM. It combines three abdominal quantitative SPECT (QSPECT) scans with a single WB-P acquisition and was compared with a reference protocol (RP) using sequential WB-P in combination with sequential QSPECT images. We investigated five patients receiving 7.4  GBq Lu- 177 -Octreotate and five patients treated with 3.7  GBq Lu- 177 -PSMA- 617. Each patient had WB-P and abdominal SPECT acquisitions 24 (+ CT), 48, and 72  h post-injection. Blood samples were drawn 30  min, 80  min, 24  h, 48  h, and 72  h post-injection. BM <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> from the ROB were estimated from sequential WB-P images (RP), via a mono-exponential fit and mass-scaled organ-level S values. For the HP, a mono-exponential fit on the QSPECT data was scaled with the activity of one WB-P image acquired either 24, 48, or 72  h post-injection (HP 24, HP 48, HP 72). Total BM <b>absorbed</b> <b>doses</b> were determined as a sum of ROB, blood, major organ, and tumour contributions.|$|R
