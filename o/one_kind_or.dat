5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E

25|$|The {{essence of}} deep-rooted spirit lore is that {{supposed}} spirits of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another – spirits of the dead, phantasms of the living, wraiths, or nature entities like fairies move through the physical landscape along special routes. In their ideal, pristine form, at least, such routes are conceived of as being straight, having {{something in common with}} ley lines. By the same token, convoluted or non-linear features hinder spirit movement i.e. labyrinths and mazes.|$|E
25|$|Further acclaim {{greeted the}} {{director}} in 1996 with Les voleurs (Thieves) (1996), an ambitious and complex crime drama. The film jumps through time and switches narrative perspectives in a Rashomon-style exploring family and amorous ties. It postulates a fatalistic world bound by family origins and intense romantic longings {{in which every}} character is trapped into becoming a thief of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another, emotionally as well as existentially. This film earned Téchiné nominations for the César and Golden Palme at Cannes, {{as well as a}} host of other honors.|$|E
25|$|Fairies are {{generally}} described as human in appearance and having magical powers. Diminutive fairies of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another {{have been recorded}} for centuries, but occur alongside the human-sized beings; these have been depicted as {{ranging in size from}} very tiny up {{to the size of a}} human child. Even with these small fairies, however, their small size may be magically assumed rather than constant. Some fairies though normally quite small were able to dilate their figures to imitate humans. On Orkney they were described as short in stature, dressed in dark grey, and sometimes seen in armour.|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics have}} argued for similar analogues between Andrade's {{sexuality}} and Macunaíma's complex status. [...] Though Andrade was not openly gay, {{and there is}} no direct evidence of his sexual practices, many of Andrade's friends have reported after his death that he was clearly interested in men (the subject is only reluctantly discussed in Brazil). [...] It was over a pseudonymous accusation of effeminacy that Andrade broke with Oswald de Andrade in 1929. [...] Macunaíma prefers women, but his constant state of belonging and not belonging is associated with sex. [...] The character is sexually precocious, starting his romantic adventures at the age of six, and his particular form of eroticism seems always to lead to destruction of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another.|$|E

40|$|The {{second part}} of Ajdukiewicz’s classic paper on Syntactic Connexion is devoted to a {{discussion}} of languages involving variable-binding operators such as quantifiers, integrals, and the like. Ajdukiewicz argues that such operators are not genuine functors, and consequently that those languages run afoul of the basic functor/argument schema. At most he suggests that all variable-binders might be restricted to <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> only, <b>or</b> to the combination of ordinary functors with a “circumflex” operator (the terminology is from Whitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica). And that suggestion has ever since become quite popular, particularly under the impact of Church’s Lambda Calculus...|$|R
40|$|The {{proof of}} the long-standing {{conjecture}} is presented that Markovian quantum master equations {{are at odds with}} quantum thermodynamics under conventional assumptions of fluctuation-dissipation theorems (implying a translation invariant dissipation). Specifically, except for identified systems, persistent system-bath correlations of at least <b>one</b> <b>kind,</b> spatial <b>or</b> temporal, are obligatory for thermalization. A systematic procedure is proposed to construct translation invariant bath models producing steady states that well-approximate thermal states.

John W. Campbell Jr., the godfather of this genre, would have approved. The movie {{is really all about}} ideas. It only seems to be about emotions. How real are our emotions, anyway? How real are we? Someday I will die. This laptop I'm using is patient and can wait.” Moon also received positive reviews at the Sundance Film Festival.|$|R

Thus monogenēs (μονογενὴς) may be used both as an adjective monogenēs pais, meaning unique and special. Its Greek meaning is often applied to mean [...] "one of a <b>kind,</b> <b>one</b> and only". Monogenēs (μονογενὴς) may be used both as an adjective monogenēs pais, only child, or only legitimate child, special child, and also on its own as a noun; o monogenēs [...] "the only one", or [...] "the only legitimate child".|$|R

Upon his first sight of the Bay the former Emperor has been quoted as exclaiming [...] "Quel Bon Pays" [...] ("what a lovely country") and he compared it favourably to Porto Ferrago on Elba. Napoleon also helped the prosperity of Torquay in another way: local smugglers did very good business 'importing' French brandy during the Napoleonic Wars and since then smuggling of <b>one</b> <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another has not completely stopped. It was during these wars that Admiral Nelson visited the town on 18 January 1801, visiting Torre Abbey Mansions and later dining in Cockington.|$|E

In 1931 his monologue [...] "I'm a Specialist" [...] {{was made into a}} hit record (Victor 22859) by popular recording artist Frank Crumit (music by Nels Bitterman).

Never once during his time of office did he fail to attain the certificate. There were no women police officers in Halifax during his time in office, he did not approve of them. This was in contrast to his brother Frank Richardson, Chief Constable of Salisbury, who attested the first female police officer in England.|$|E
