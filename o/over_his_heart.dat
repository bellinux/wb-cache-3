5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed his hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to}} the bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} the Battle of Peachtree Creek the 33rd Alabama lost its regimental commander, Colonel Samuel Adams, {{who had been with}} it from its inception. Walking along the front line early that morning {{inspecting}} his men, Adams was shot by a Federal sharpshooter; he sat down by a small oak tree with both hands <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> and died there. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Crittenden took command of the regiment that day.|$|E
500|$|Filming one take of {{the scene}} in which Miguel kills Fleeter, Smits accidentally picked up a real knife instead of a prop knife and stabbed Jeff Chase in the chest. Though he was not wearing [...] "a metal {{breastplate}} {{like a lot of}} actors do in a scene like that," [...] Chase had a piece of plastic [...] "the size of a Post-it note" [...] <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> which was struck by the knife. He was unable to stop Smits when he picked up the knife as he was bound in Saran wrap and had his mouth taped shut with duct tape for the scene. Chase said that in rehearsals Smits had missed the plastic with the prop knife [...] "eight out of ten times." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Gilligan played for the Gentlemen against the Players at the Oval. In the first innings, he was struck heavily <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> by a delivery from Frederick Pearson; {{it was obvious that}} he was hurt, and he was out shortly afterwards. Although the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval was less prestigious than its Lord's counterpart and generally mattered less to participants, Gilligan chose to bat the next day and scored a century batting at number 10. Even so, the Gentlemen lost the game by six wickets. Gilligan was never again as effective a cricketer, and he later conceded that batting in the second innings was a mistake. It is likely that the strain of the innings did as much harm as the original blow, although Gibson later wrote that Gilligan's subsequent long life suggests that he was not too badly hurt, and that it is unlikely too much damage was done. Nevertheless, Gibson concludes [...] "there is no doubt that he was badly shaken up, and whatever the reason, the magic departed".|$|E
500|$|Gardner was {{executed}} on June 18, 2010, at 12:15am Mountain Daylight Time by a firing squad at Utah State Prison in Draper. He {{was placed in}} restraints on a black metal chair with a hood covering his head. Sandbags were arranged around him to absorb ricochets. The firing squad {{was made up of}} five anonymous volunteers who were certified police officers. The officers stood about [...] from Gardner, aiming at a white target positioned <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> One of their [...]30-caliber Winchester rifles was selected at random and loaded with a non-lethal wax bullet so that they would not know with certainty who fired the fatal shots. According to the Utah Department of Corrections, the squad used a countdown cadence beginning with five and simultaneously firing right before two. His dark blue jumpsuit made it difficult to see the blood from his wounds. A medical examiner removed Gardner's hood to reveal his lifeless face. After verifying Gardner's lack of pulse at the neck and pupillary light reflex, the medical examiner pronounced him dead at 12:17am. He {{was the first person to}} be executed by firing squad in the United States since the execution of John Albert Taylor 14 years earlier. A commemorative coin was commissioned for prison staff who participated in the execution.|$|E
500|$|With Webber's {{departure}} for the NBA after his sophomore season, the 1993–94 Wolverines team entered the season ranked {{fifth in the}} nation as it opened the season against number13 [...] Since his grandmother had been born on December 25, Howard got a tattoo reading [...] "Jannie Mae" [...] <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> during Christmas break. During the season, Howard contracted the chicken pox in January. [...] Michigan had a 21–6 (13–4 Big Ten) record and tied with the Purdue Boilermakers for the conference lead with one game remaining. [...] Michigan then lost (for {{the third time in}} its last four games) to a struggling [...] team, and finished second in the Big Ten. After the season, Howard was selected as a first team All-Big-Ten member along with his teammate Rose, Purdue's Robinson, Michigan State's Shawn Respert, and Indiana's Damon Bailey. In the opening round of the 1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Howard helped Michigan to a 78–74 overtime victory over [...] by scoring 28points and adding 9rebounds before fouling out.

Howard scored 24points and had 11rebounds before fouling out with 2:49 remaining in the 78–71 victory. [...] Howard earned the regional MVP award with a game-high 30points and 13rebounds in the Elite Eight round, despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes and losing against the Arkansas Razorbacks, which had United States President Bill Clinton in attendance as a vocal supporter. [...] On April 18, Howard announced his intention to enter the 1994 NBA draft. [...] The following day, Rose announced he would enter the draft as well. Howard was 37 credit hours short of University of Michigan degree requirements, but said he intended to keep his promise to his grandmother that he would earn his diploma.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Billy Wright, also from Portadown, took over {{command of the}} UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade from Jackson. The Mid-Ulster Brigade, founded in 1972 by its first commander, Billy Hanna, {{operated}} mainly in the Lurgan and Portadown areas. Fulton soon became Wright's closest associate and right-hand man and had an [...] "extreme fixation and obsession over Wright; he even had an image of Wright tattooed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hidalgo {{was turned}} over to the Bishop of Durango, Francisco Gabriel de Olivares, for an {{official}} defrocking and excommunication on July 27, 1811. He was then found guilty of treason by a military court and executed by firing squad on July 30 at 7 in the morning. Before his execution, he thanked his jailers, Private Soldiers Ortega and Melchor, in letters for their humane treatment. [...] At his execution, Hidalgo placed his right hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> to show the riflemen where they should aim. He also refused the use of a blindfold. His body, along with the bodies of Allende, Aldama and José Mariano Jiménez were decapitated, and the heads were put on display on the four corners of the Alhóndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. [...] The heads remained there for ten years {{until the end of the}} Mexican War of Independence to serve as a warning to other insurgents. [...] Hidalgo's headless body was first displayed outside the prison but then buried in the Church of St Francis in Chihuahua. Those remains would later be transferred in 1824 to Mexico City.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to his uncompromising stance as an upholder of Ulster loyalism and {{opposition}} to the peace process, Wright has, since his death, become the most revered loyalist icon and cult figure {{in the history of}} the Troubles. His image adorns countless murals in housing estates in Portadown and elsewhere throughout Northern Ireland. However one of the most well-known of these, that on a wall near Portadown F.C.'s Shamrock Park home ground, was removed in 2006 with a mural of George Best painted in its stead. His picture appears on tee shirts, fridge magnets, key rings, and plates. He is regarded as a martyr and hero by hardline loyalists; many of whom have tattoos bearing his likeness. It is considered to be a status symbol in Portadown for loyalist men and women to display a Billy Wright tattoo on one's arm, leg, or back. Some of his more ardent devotees even have them on the private parts of their anatomy. His successor Mark [...] "Swinger" [...] Fulton had one tattoed <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> Most of these tattoos were created by a Bolton-based member of Combat 18, who tattooed many LVF supporters with Wright's image at houses in Portadown's loyalists estates whilst visiting for the Twelfth.|$|E

6000|$|The {{men of the}} Mountains {{were all}} awake, {{squatting}} like grasshoppers, and gossiping together close about their watch-fire.
