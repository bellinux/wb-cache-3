5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival {{supersonic transport}} programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested that}} opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E

Lawrence Beesley described the sound as [...] "a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck." [...] The noise was so loud that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.|$|E
500|$|Pattersons {{crew was}} alert because the destroyer's captain had taken seriously the earlier daytime {{sightings}} of Japanese warships and evening sightings of unknown aircraft, {{and told his}} crew {{to be ready for}} action. At 01:43, Patterson spotted a ship, probably Kinugasa, 5,000 meters dead ahead and immediately sent a warning by radio and signal lamp: [...] "Warning! Warning! Strange ships entering the harbor!" [...] Patterson increased speed to full, and fired star shells towards the Japanese column. Her captain ordered a torpedo attack, but his order was not heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> from the destroyer's guns.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 7 November 1976, three insurgents {{from a group of}} seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of Birchenough Bridge in Manicaland province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas. There were eight four-man [...] "stops" [...] involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of the aircraft. [...] "They are going to get me this time," [...] he yelled, sardonically; [...] "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!" [...] Kaye and his MAG gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. [...] "Go nail gooks!" [...] Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their Alouette III gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old national service MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an FN FAL battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian Vietnam veteran, aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.|$|E

2500|$|Performers {{who favor}} a [...] "traditional" [...] style do not {{necessarily}} believe they are replicating the exact style of shanty singing of the 19th century. However, within the constraints of modern contexts, they tend to adhere to certain stylistic traits that {{are believed to have}} characterized the genre historically. These may include a loud or full voice, an emphatic, strident—even harsh—tone (as if to carry <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of wind and waves), and tempos and rhythms that are reasonably conducive to working. They often perform a capella or only with light instrumentation typical of sailors (e.g. concertina). In general, performances may be more [...] "rough around the edges" [...] and be of variable length to accommodate impromptu changes in verses.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese troops used tàigǔ drums {{to motivate}} troops, to help set a marching pace, and {{to call out}} orders or announcements. For example, during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC, the effect of drum on soldier's morale is {{employed}} to change {{the result of a}} major battle. Fife-and-drum corps of Swiss mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the snare drum carried over the player's right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using traditional grip). It is to this instrument that the English word [...] "drum" [...] was first used. Similarly, during the English Civil War rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different regiments and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats only they recognized. In the mid-19th century, the Scottish military started incorporating pipe bands into their Highland Regiments.|$|E

2500|$|Entwistle {{picked up}} two nicknames {{during his career}} as a musician. He was nicknamed [...] "The Ox" [...] because of his strong {{constitution}} and seeming ability to [...] "Eat, drink or do more than the rest of them." [...] He was also later nicknamed [...] "Thunderfingers". Bill Wyman, bass guitarist for the Rolling Stones, described him as [...] "the quietest man in private but the loudest man on stage". Entwistle {{was one of the first}} to make use of Marshall stacks in an attempt to hear himself <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> of his band members, who famously leapt and moved about on the stage, with Pete Townshend and Keith Moon smashing their instruments on numerous occasions (Moon even used explosives in his drum kit during one memorable television performance on the [...] "Smother Brothers Comedy Hour"). Townshend later remarked that Entwistle started using Marshall amplification to hear himself over drummer Keith Moon's rapid-fire drumming style, and Townshend himself also had to use them just to be heard over Entwistle. They both continued expanding and experimenting with their rigs, until they were both using twin stacks with new experimental prototype 200 watt amps, at a time when most bands used 50–100 watt amplifiers with single cabinets. All of this quickly gained the Who a reputation for being [...] "the loudest band on the planet", a point well proven when they famously reached 126 decibels at a 1976 concert in London, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the loudest rock concert in history. The band had a strong influence at the time on their contemporaries' choice of equipment, with Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience both following suit. Although they pioneered and directly contributed to the development of the [...] "classic" [...] Marshall sound (at this point their equipment was being built/tweaked to their personal specifications), they only used Marshall equipment for a couple of years. Entwistle eventually switched to using a Sound City rig, with Pete Townshend following suit later as well. Townshend points out that Jimi Hendrix, their new label mate, was influenced beyond just the band's volume. Both Entwistle and Townshend had begun experimenting with feedback from the amplifiers in the mid-1960s, and Hendrix did not begin destroying his instruments until after he had witnessed the Who's [...] "auto-destructive art".|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{metrology}} exploits quantum correlations to make precise measurements {{with limited}} particle numbers.

Motivated by practicality we then look at the squeezed cat-state, which has recently been made experimentally, and shows further precision gains <b>over</b> <b>the</b> shot <b>noise</b> limit and a 3 -fold improvement in <b>the</b> QFI <b>over</b> <b>the</b> optimal Gaussian state.
