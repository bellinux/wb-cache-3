25|$|The mid 19th century {{brought a}} {{succession}} of calamities that crippled the South African wine industry. In 1859 <b>oidium</b> first appeared and quickly spread through the Cape. This {{was followed by a}} series of agreements made in 1860s (most notably the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty) between the Gladstone government and France that reduced the preferential tariffs which had benefited South African wine in favor of French wine exports. In 1866, the phylloxera epidemic reached the Cape, causing widespread devastation that would take more than 20 years to recover from.|$|E
25|$|During the Risorgimento (Italian unification) of the 19th century, many Piemontese {{winemaker}}s {{and land}} owners played a pivotal role. The famous Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi was a winemaker {{who in the}} 1850s introduced {{the use of the}} Bordeaux mixture to control the spread of <b>oidium</b> that was starting to ravage the area's vineyards. Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour was a wealthy vineyard owner who went abroad to study advance viticulture prior to founding the political newspaper Il Risorgimento. He was highly influential in the adoption of many French viticultural techniques among the Piemontese vineyards.|$|E
25|$|But just as French vignerons were {{recovering}} from <b>oidium</b> came a new mysterious ailment that caused decay or {{death in the}} grapevines. The cause was a tiny louse, known as phylloxera, imported from North America. This louse targets the rootstock of the vine. The solution to this epidemic also came from North America in the grafting of naturally resistant American rootstocks to the European vines. However, while the importing of this new North American plant material helped {{to stave off the}} phylloxera epidemic, it brought with it yet more problems-the fungal disease of downy mildew that first surfaced in 1878 and black rot that followed in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars, Tuscany {{returned}} to the rule of the Habsburgs. It was at this point that the statesman Bettino Ricasoli inherited his family ancestral estate in Broglio located {{in the heart of the}} Chianti Classico zone. Determined to improve the estate, Ricasoli traveled throughout Germany and France, studying the grape varieties and viticultural practices. He imported several of the varieties back to Tuscany and experimented with different varieties in his vineyards. However, in his experiments Ricasoli discovered that three local varieties— Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Malvasia— produced the best wine. In 1848, revolutions broke out in Italy and Ricasoli's beloved wife died, leaving him with little interest to devote to wine. In the 1850s <b>Oidium</b> Uncinula necator and war devastated most of Tuscany's vineyards with many peasant farmers leaving for other parts of Italy or to emigrate to the Americas.|$|E
500|$|The Carménère grape {{has known}} {{origins in the}} Médoc region of Bordeaux, France and was also widely planted in the Graves until the vines were struck with <b>oidium.</b> It is almost {{impossible}} to find Carménère wines in France today, as a Phylloxera plague in 1867 nearly destroyed all the vineyards of Europe, afflicting the Carménère grapevines in particular such that for many years the grape was presumed extinct. When the vineyards were replanted, growers could not replant Carménère as it was extremely hard to find and more difficult to grow than other grape varieties common to Bordeaux. The region's damp, chilly spring weather gave rise to coulure, [...] "a condition endemic to certain vines in climates which have marginal, sometimes cool, wet springs", which prevented the vine's buds from flowering. Yields were lower than other varieties and the crops were rarely healthy; consequently wine growers chose more versatile and less coulure-susceptible grapes when replanting the vines and Carménère planting was progressively abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|Chemical treatments, using {{pesticides}} and herbicides, {{in order to}} protect the vines against cryptogamic diseases such as mildew, <b>oidium,</b> grey rot, etc., and against insects such as the Eudemis and the Cochylis. [...] Every effort is made to minimize the environmental effects of these procedures.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} events brought this golden age of {{prosperity}} to an end. In the 19th century, scientific interest in collecting botanical species led to the exchange of many specimens from around the world—with the unintended consequence of introducing new diseases and aliments to populations that had no natural resistances to these diseases. North America, in particular, {{was the source of}} several grape ailments that would devastate the French wine industry. It started in the 1850s with the introduction of powdery mildew, or <b>oidium,</b> which not only affected the skin color of the grapes but also reduced vine yields and the resulting quality of the wines. The 1854 vintage was particularly hard hit, producing the smallest yields seen in more than 60 years. A solution to the problem was discovered in 1857 when Henri Marès devised a technique of sulfuring vines to combat <b>oidium.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{end of the}} 19th {{century was}} a {{difficult}} time for the Chablis growers. Firstly, with new railway systems linking {{all parts of the}} country with Paris, there was inexpensive wine from regions in the Midi that undercut Chablis. The vineyards were affected by <b>oidium</b> from 1886, and then phylloxera from 1887. Effective replacement of vinestocks to counter phylloxera took some 15 years. Many Chablis producers gave up winemaking, the acreage in the region steadily declining throughout much of the early 20th century. By the 1950s there were only [...] of vines planted in Chablis.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 85% of Madeira is {{produced}} {{with the red}} grape, Negra Mole. The four major white grape varieties used for Madeira production are (from sweetest to driest) Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho and Sercial. These varieties also lend their names to Madeira labeling, as discussed below. Occasionally one sees Terrantez, Bastardo and Moscatel varieties, although these are now increasingly rare on the island because of <b>oidium</b> and phylloxera. After the phylloxera epidemic, many wines were [...] "mislabeled" [...] as containing one of these noble grape varieties, which were reinterpreted as [...] "wine styles" [...] rather than true varietal names. Since the epidemic, Tinta Negra or [...] Negra Mole and Complexa are the workhorse varieties on the island, and are found in various concentrations in many blends and vintage wines. Bastardo, Complexa and Tinta Negra are red grape varieties.|$|E
2500|$|The late 19th century saw {{a period}} of {{economic}} and political upheaval. First came <b>oidium</b> and then the phylloxera epidemic would take its toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of Europe. The chaos and poverty following the Risorgimento heralded the beginning of the Italian diaspora that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands. Those that stayed behind and replanted choose high-yielding varieties like Trebbiano and Sangiovese clones such as the Sangiovese di Romagna from the nearby Romagna region. Following the Second World War, the general trend in the world wine market for cheap, easy-drinking wine saw a brief boom for the region. With over-cropping and an emphasis on quantity over quality, the reputation of Chianti among consumers eventually plummeted. By the 1950s, Trebbiano (which is known for its neutral flavours) made up to 30% of many mass-market Chiantis. By the late 20th century, Chianti was often associated with basic Chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a fiasco. However, during the same period, a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of DOC regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality style of Chianti. These wines eventually became known as the [...] "Super Tuscans".|$|E
2500|$|The 19th century {{brought a}} series of calamities to most wine {{producing}} regions of Italy-including the phylloxera epidemic, <b>oidium,</b> downy mildew and the political upheaval of the Risorgimento. According to the 1889 writings of the French wine historian Dr. C. B. Cerletti, {{one of the few}} Italian wine regions to emerge from this period relatively unscathed was Valpolicella. In the 1950s, the [...] "Amarone" [...] style of winemaking was rediscovered. In 1968, the Valpolicella region received official recognition for quality wine production when it was granted its own DOC. However, with DOC recognition also came a large expansion of vineyard areas that were permitted to produce Valpolicella DOC wine, including land in the fertile plains of the Po River, which tend to produce excessively large yields of grapes with varying qualities. Additionally the grape composition for Valpolicella wines were expanded to include varieties of lower potential quality such as Molinara and Rondinella. This led to a general drop in quality, which had a detrimental impact on not only the area's reputation on the international wine market but also on sales and prices. As winemaking became less profitable, the vineyards in the most labor-intensive areas (such as the hillsides in the classico zone) were uprooted and abandoned. This shifted the source of grape production even further away from the better quality producing hillside regions down to the fertile plains.|$|E
2500|$|The 20th century saw {{peaks and}} valleys in the {{popularity}} of Chianti and eventually lead to a radical evolution in the wine's style due {{to the influence of}} the [...] "Super Tuscans".

60|$|And now of {{the wine}} which once delighted the world, and which has not yet become 'food for the antiquary.' To begin with, a few dates and figures are necessary. In 1852, that terrible year for France, the <b>Oïdium</b> fungus {{attacked}} the vine, and soon reduced to 2,000 the normal yearly production of 20,000 and even 22,000 pipes.|$|E
60|$|Before 1810 Tenerife {{exported}} her wines {{not from}} Santa Cruz, but from Orotava, {{the centre of}} commerce. Here, {{since the days of}} Charles II., there was an English Factory with thirty to forty British subjects, Protestants, under the protection of the Captain-General; and their cemetery lay at the west end of El Puerto, whose palmy days were in 1812-15. The trade was then transferred to the modern capital, where there are, and have been for years, only two English wine-shipping firms, Messieurs Hamilton and Messieurs Davidson. The seniors of both families have all passed away; but their sons and grandsons still inhabit the picturesque old houses on the 'Marina.' In 1812-15 the annual export of wine was 8,000 to 11,000 pipes. The Peace of 1815 was a severe blow to the trade. Between 1830 and 1840, however, the vintage of the seven chief islands averaged upwards of 46,000; of these Tenerife supplied between 4,000 and 5,000, equivalent to the total produce {{since the days of the}} <b>oïdium.</b> In 1852 Admiral Robinson reduced the number of pipes to 20,000, worth 200,000l. In 1860-65 I saw the grape in a piteous plight: the huge bunches were composed of dwarfed and wilted berries, furred and cobwebbed with the foul mycelium. The produce fell to 100-150 pipes, and at present only some 200 to 300 are exported. The Peninsula and the West African coast take the bulk; England and Germany ranking next, and lastly Spain, which used the import largely in making-up wines. The islanders now mostly drink the harsh, coarse Catalonians; they still, however, make for home consumption a cheap white wine, which improves with age. It is regretable that fears of the <b>oïdium</b> and the phylloxera prevent the revival of the industry, for which the Islands are admirably fitted. Potatoes and other produce have also suffered; but that is no obstacle to their being replanted.|$|E
6000|$|... the lair of the sea-wolves, or seals. With its vivid {{lines of}} sugar-cane, its terraces, its fine remains of forest vegetation, and its {{distances}} of golden lights, of glazed blue half-lights, and of purple shades, {{it looks like}} a stage-rake, a décor de théatre. Tunny-fishing, wine-making, and sugar-boiling have made it, from a 'miserable place,' a wealthy townlet whose tall white houses would not disgrace a city; two manufactories show their craft by heaps of bagasse, or trash; and the deep shingly bay, defended by a gurgulho of basaltic pillars, is covered with piscator's gear and with gaily painted green boats. 'Seal's Lair' was the model district of wine-production, like its neighbour on the north-western upland, Campanario, famous for its huge Spanish chestnut: both were, however, wasted by the <b>oidium</b> of 1852. In 1863 it partially recovered, under the free use of sulphur; but now it has been ravaged by the more dangerous phylloxera, which is spreading far faster than Mr. Henry Vizetelly supposes.|$|E
60|$|I sampled the new wines carefully; and, {{with due}} remembrance of the peaches in 'Gil Blas,' I {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that they are no longer what they were. The wine is tainted with sulphur in its odorous union with hydrogen. It is unduly saccharine, fermenting irregularly and insufficiently. For years the plant has constantly been treated against <b>oidium</b> with antiseptics, which destroy the spores and germ-growths; and we can hardly expect a first-rate yield from a chronically-diseased stock. Still the drink is rich and highly flavoured; and, under many circumstances, it answers better than any kind of sherry. No more satisfactory refreshment on a small scale than a biscuit and a glass of Bual. Moreover, the palate requires variety, and here finds it in a harmless form. But as a daily drink Madeira should be avoided: even in the island I should prefer French Bordeaux, not English claret, with an occasional change to Burgundy. Meanwhile, 'London particular' is a fact, and the supply will probably exceed the demand of the present generation.|$|E
60|$|The traffic began about 1835 with {{an export}} of only 1,275 lbs.; and between 1850 and 1860 the lb. was {{worth at least}} ten francs. Admiral Robinson [Footnote: Sea-drift, a volume {{published}} by subscription. Pitman, London, 1852.] in 1852 makes the export one million of lbs. at one dollar each, or a total of 250,000l. During the rage of the <b>oïdium</b> the cultivation was profitable and raised the Canaries high in the scale of material prosperity. In 1862 the islands exported 10,000 quintals, or hundred-weights, the total value being still one million of dollars. In 1877-78 the produce was contained in 20,000 to 25,000 bags, each averaging 175 lbs., at a value of half a crown per lb.: it was then stated that, owing to the increased expense of irrigation and of guano or chemical manures, nothing under two shillings would repay the cultivator. In 1878-79 the total export amounted to 5,045,007 lbs. In 1879-80 this figure had fallen off to 4,036,871 lbs., a decrease of 5,482 bags, or 1,008,136 lbs.; moreover the prices, which had been forced up by speculation, declined from 2s. 6d.-3s. 4d. to 1s. 8d. and 1s. 10d. [Footnote: These figures are taken from the able Consular Report of Mr. Consul Dundas, printed in Part viii., 1881.] When I last visited Las Palmas (April 1880), cochineal, {{under the influence of}} magenta and mineral dyes, was selling at 1s. 4d. instead of one to two dollars.|$|E
60|$|Look at {{the analogy}} of {{domestic}} animals. That is the analogy to which breeding reformers always point with special pride: {{but what does it}} really teach us? That you can't improve the efficiency of animals in any one point to any high degree, without upsetting the general balance of their constitution. The race-horse can run a mile on a particular day at a particular place, bar accidents, with wonderful speed: but that is about all he is good for. His health as a whole is so surprisingly feeble that he has to be treated with as much care as a delicate exotic. 'In regard to animals and plants,' says Sir George Campbell, 'we have very largely mastered the principles of heredity and culture, and the modes by which good qualities may be maximised, bad qualities minimised.' True, so far as concerns a few points prized by ourselves for our own purposes. But in doing this, we have so lowered the general constitutional vigour of the plants or animals that our vines fall an easy prey to <b>oidium</b> and phylloxera, our potatoes to the potato disease and the Colorado beetle; our sheep are stupid, our rabbits idiotic, our domestic breeds generally threatened with dangers to life and limb unknown to their wiry ancestors in the wild state. And when one comes to deal with the infinitely more complex individuality of man, what hope would there be of our improving the breed by deliberate selection? If we developed the intellect, we would probably stunt the physique or the moral nature; if we aimed at a general culture of all faculties alike, we would probably end by a Chinese uniformity of mediocre dead level.|$|E
