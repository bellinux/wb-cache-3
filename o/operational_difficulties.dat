By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 knots.|$|E

5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock.

An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired.

In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts.

Conversion units, such as No. 6 OTU, was detailed to provide conversion training for crews, who were to fly the Consolidated Liberator, Boeing Fortress and Handley Page Halifax. Training still remained below what was needed, owing to manpower requirements on the front line. It was not until October 1944, that it became widely accepted to give crews refresher training on new types of aircraft, that this practice became policy. Even so, one conversion course {{was all that was}} afforded to any crew. Increasing the training hours from 72 to 87 helped in some respects. Also, by 1945, it had become standard practice for Squadron Leaders to visit and help the OTUs keep pace with changes <b>operational</b> <b>difficulties,</b> by reporting back to the schools on how best the OTU establishment could serve the needs of Squadrons, through training or otherwise.|$|E

40|$|Generally {{forest fires}} {{are related to}} human {{activities}} and need an effective fire prevention and suppression organization, based on a deep knowledge of the territory, fire behaviour and suppression system resources network. To organise monitoring, prevention and fire fighting operations, {{the knowledge of the}} risk level for different areas is important. To evaluate the probability that a forest fire occurs and to organise prevention and management of fire fighting activities, both simple and easy-to-use risk and <b>operational</b> <b>difficulty</b> indices were implemented. CNR-IBIMET and DISTAF Dept., on commitment of Tuscany Region, developed a multistep process for the evaluation of the risk, {{that can be used to}} assess land planning and to organise seasonal fire fighting resources. This model is called Final Risk Index (FRI); it is the result of the combination of the following two indices, which are initially developed separately. The concerned indices are the Global Risk Index (GRI), and <b>Operational</b> <b>Difficulty</b> Index in Fire Fighting (ODIF). The fire risk index processes different parameters to generate two hazards: static and dynamic, merged to obtain the Global Risk Index (GRI). It is very helpful to estimate the probability of forest fire occurrence, but it does not provide information on for-est fire extinction <b>difficulties.</b> The <b>operational</b> <b>difficulty</b> index in fire fighting (ODIF) resumes all the factors affecting fire fighting activity by air and by ground and suggests the extinction efficiency of forest fires in a given area.

5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs only. Beginning in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal Transit Administration granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms {{would not have been}} possible because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause <b>operational</b> <b>difficulties</b> with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight passing track like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 million in federal stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and Alewife. The work was then intended to be finished by the end of 2010.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the {{majority}} of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost {{as soon as they}} landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The <b>operational</b> <b>difficulties</b> that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective.

The British failed to disrupt production at the Focke-Wulf plant at Bremen or to destroy more Condors in the field, due to poor bombing accuracy and improved German defences.|$|E

25|$|The {{officer corps}} was {{decimated}} in the Great Purge and operational level effectiveness suffered. The 6,000 officers lost {{and then the}} subsequent massive expansion schemes, which {{increased the number of}} personnel from 1.5 million in 1938 to five million in 1941 flooded the VVS with inexperienced personnel and the infrastructure struggled to cope. It still left the VVS short of 60,000 qualified officers in 1941. Despite the expansion of flight schools from 12 to 83 from 1937 to June 1941, the schools lacked half their flight instructors and half of their allotted fuel supplies. Combined with these events, training was shortened a total of seven times in 1939-1940. The attrition and loss of experienced pilots in Barbarossa encouraged a culture of rapid promotion to positions beyond some pilots' level of competence.
