5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} Surekill and inquire {{as to the}} company's client, Carlton Chase. Doggett asks if Dwight did time, and he {{responds}} that he did. Doggett asks why Chase would have called Surekill just before his death. After the agents leave, Dwight confronts Tammi about the message, and she lies. Meanwhile, Randall watches Tammi through a wall. Tammi returns to Surekill {{early the next morning}} and rushes in to get the deposit book showing she has taken from the Surekill account out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk,</b> but is caught by Dwight and Randall. Dwight is interrupted by the FBI, who have a search warrant. Doggett opens the box Tammi was trying to dispose of, which contains nothing, much to her surprise. Dwight claims he runs a clean business, but Scully pulls out several folders containing invoices for Chase.|$|E
500|$|In March 1897 {{as members}} of the Household {{prepared}} to depart for Cimiez for the Queen's annual visit, they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party, and decided to resign if he did so. When Harriet Phipps, one of the Queen's maids of honour, informed her of the collective decision, the Queen swept the contents <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> onto the floor in a fury. The Household backed down, but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria. She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by [...] "race prejudice" [...] and jealousy. When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez, the Household forced him to leave, which Victoria thought [...] "disgraceful", and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed, explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted. Ponsonby wrote in late April, [...] " [...] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man, and his one idea in life seems to be to do nothing and to eat as much as he can." [...] Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity, and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him. On receiving Elgin's reply that they were [...] "Respectable and trustworthy... but position of family humble", Hamilton concluded [...] "the Munshi has done nothing to my knowledge which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture... enquiries wd not be right, unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation." [...] He did, however, authorise further investigation of the [...] "Mohamedan intriguer named Rafiuddin". Nothing was ever proven against Ahmed, who later became a Bombay government official and was knighted in 1932. The effect of the row, in Hamilton's words, was [...] "to put him [...] more into his humble place, and his influence will not be the same in the future".|$|E
2500|$|Couric {{was dubbed}} [...] "America's Sweetheart" [...] {{largely due to}} her co-anchor role for 15 years on The Today Show. On May 12, 2003, Couric guest-hosted The Tonight Show with Jay Leno {{as part of a}} swap campaign, and had 45 percent more viewers than on other nights. She has been the only guest host used by Jay Leno on either The Tonight Show or his short lived The Jay Leno Show. Leno filled in for her on Today that same day. CNN and the New York Daily News noted that instead of using Leno's regular solid desk, [...] "workers cut away the front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>desk</b> to expose her legs while she interviewed American Idol judge Simon Cowell and Austin Powers star Mike Myers".|$|E

Wilhelmina offers Daniel's staff a 15% rise in pay and most of Daniel's workforce join her leaving him and Alexis in a difficult position, with only Amanda, Betty, Christina, Henry and (perhaps) a few others to reconstruct the magazine before the deadline - while Wilhelmina asks her father for the financial backing she needs for Slater.|$|R
50|$|NCIS {{discovers that}} one of its former investigative assistants found brutally stabbed to death was selling details for how to rob a {{warehouse}} full of valuable possessions. They discover that the warehouse contains items seized from a former Navy officer (JoBeth Williams) who used a Ponzi scheme to cheat many people out of their money. While investigating the warehouse, the team finds that something hidden in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>desks</b> was stolen. In order to find the killer, Gibbs makes a deal with the officer to downgrade her sentence to house arrest in return for divulging his identity. However, it is a ploy by Gibbs to lure out the real killer, a robber who lost his money trying to launder it through the officer's accounts. The officer grabs her notebook containing the accounts where she hid her money and flees, technically breaking her house arrest agreement. Gibbs and Ziva swoop in, arresting both the killer and the officer {{while at the same time}} getting the evidence they needed to put her away for life. Meanwhile, budget cuts cause personnel to be reorganized in NCIS, including the transfer of the Spain team to Washington DC. Tony immediately becomes infatuated with the new team leader, who apparently returns his feelings.|$|R
