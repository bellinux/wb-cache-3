5000|$|Asian pot-bellied pigs, a {{small type}} of {{domestic}} pig, have made popular house pets in the United States {{beginning in the}} latter half of the twentieth century. Domestic farmyard pigs have also been known to be kept indoors, but due to their large size and destructive tendencies, they typically need to be moved into an <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> as they grow older. Most pigs have a fear of being picked up by the stomach, but will usually calm down once placed back on the floor. Pigs are rarely used as working animals. An important exception is the use of truffle pigs [...] - [...] ordinary pigs trained to find truffles.|$|E

Moreover, the rats were not randomly scattered throughout the pen area, but had organized themselves into twelve or thirteen local colonies of a dozen rats each. He noted that twelve rats is the maximum number that can live harmoniously in a natural group, beyond which stress and psychological effects function as group break-up forces.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to test the effect of floor cage in <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> on productive performance and carcass characteristics of a rabbit local population characterized by slow growing rate. A sample of 48 rabbits female 57 days old was divided into two groups: Indoor group, housed in colony cages indoor at the density of 14 animals/m 2 and Outdoor group, in wire net floor colony cages in <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen,</b> at the density of 5 animals/ m 2. The animals were fed a commercial feed and ad libitum alfa-alfa hay. Individual live weight and cage feed consumption were checked every week and feed conversion ratio was calculated; at 103 ± 2 days old a sample of 24 animals was slaughtered and carcass traits were recorded. The results showed that the Outdoor group had the highest live weight and the best daily weight gain, together with an higher feed intake. Outdoor group showed the lower mortality, the higher slaughtering weight, the higher reference carcass incidence and hind leg percentage. These favourable results encouraged this kind of rearing system characterized also by lower investment costs...|$|E

40|$|This study applies {{qualitative}} behaviour assessment (QBA) for {{the first}} time to dairy buffaloes, using three groups of observers with different cultural backgrounds and different levels of experience in animal behaviour observation and buffalo farming. Eight buffalo heifers aged 16 – 18 months were subjected to two isolation tests, one performed in the indoor part of their home environment, and one in a novel outdoor paddock. Animals were filmed individually for 2. 5 min, and the resulting 16 video clips were shown to three observer panels, consisting of 11 applied animal behaviour scientists from 6 European countries, 11 Italian animal scientists with a background in buffalo farming but no experience in behavioural observation, and 14 Italian undergraduate animal science students with no particular experience. A free choice profiling method was used to instruct observers in QBA, and data for the three panels were analysed separately using Generalised Procrustes Analysis. All three panels showed significant inter-observer agreement (p < 0. 001) and generated two main consensus dimensions characterised as ‘calm-agitated’ and ‘curious-shy’. There were significant correlations between buffalo scores provided by each of the three observer panels on both these dimensions (dim 1 : Kendall W = 0. 96, n = 3, 2 = 43. 28, p < 0. 001; dim 2 : W = 0. 68, n = 3, 2 = 30. 73, p < 0. 01). Buffaloes viewed in the familiar indoor pen were assessed by all three panels as more calm and less agitated (dimension 1) than animals viewed in the novel <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> (Wilcoxon z = − 2. 52, p < 0. 01, z = − 2. 52, p < 0. 01, z = − 2. 38, p < 0. 01 for Panels 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Scores on dimension 1 for the same animals viewed in either indoor or <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> were correlated at r = 0. 60 (p < 0. 10), 0. 74 (p < 0. 05) and 0. 71 (p < 0. 05) for Panels 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Quantitatively, buffalo in the <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> displayed longer bouts of running and higher frequencies of sniffing (both p < 0. 05) than those in the indoor pen. Principal component analysis showed meaningful associations between qualitative and quantitative assessments, allowing qualitative dimensions to play a valuable role in interpreting the animals’ state. The main outcomes of this study are that QBA can be usefully applied to scientific studies of dairy buffalo, and that substantial differences in observer background do not appear to diminish the reliability of QBA...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous {{behavioral}} studies (Minichiello et al., Neuron 1999; 24 : 401 – 414) {{showed that}} mice deficient for the TrkB receptor in the forebrain {{were unable to}} learn a swimming navigation task with an invisible platform and were severely impaired in finding a visible platform in the same setup. Likewise, additional behavioral deficits suggested a malfunction of the hippocampus and proximally connected forebrain structures. In order to discriminate whether the behavioral impairment was caused either by deficits in spatial memory and learning, or alterna-tively by loss of behavioral flexibility, 8 trkB mutant, 13 wild-type, and 22 heterozygous mice were implanted with transponders and released for 21 days into a large <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> (10 10 m).

Duck reared in an <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen,</b> were monitored during the last part of their egg-laying period. The experimental period lasted 9 weeks and the animals were submitted to the following densities: 1 st through 2 nd wk: 1 bird/m 2 (D 1); 3 rd wk: 2 birds/m 2 (D 2); 4 th wk :D 1; 5 th wk: 6 birds/m 2 (D 6); 6 th wk:D 1; 7 th wk: 4 birds/m 2 (D 4); 8 th through 9 th wk:D 1. The following parameters were recorded: egg production, individual live weight (LW), serum cortisol level and behavioural activities. Data suggest a reduction in well-being for animals reared in D 6 and D 4. The data indicate that the increased density is responsible for behavioural and haematological abnormalities suggesting a stressfull situation. However, this condition is reversible with the decrease in density and is not associated with a decrease in egg production...|$|E

We assessed postrelease behaviors and survival of three groups of black-footed ferrets, each with dierent prerelease experience. Eighteen ferret kits 60 days of age were moved with their dams from cages to 80 -m 2 <b>outdoor</b> <b>pens</b> with prairie dog burrows. These animals were compared to animals reared in standard cages (n 72), {{some of which were}} given experience killing prairie dogs (n 32). Ferrets were released onto white-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys leucurus) colonies in Wyoming, USA, in fall, 1992. Radio-tagged cage-reared ferrets made longer nightly moves and dispersed further from release sites than their pen-reared counterparts. The band return rate was 4 -fold higher for pen-reared ani-mals than for cage-reared animals during surveys conducted about 1 month after release.

40|$|Conservation {{strategies}} {{should work}} to mmnruse {{the occurrence of}} stressful situations, which are {{likely to result in}} chronic elevations of corticosterone. Consequently, identification of such situations would yield important information for conservation management. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the basal levels of corticosterone and the corticosterone response of kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) in different management systems. Repeated blood sampling enabled us to describe the magnitude and duration of the corticosterone response, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HP A) axis to stress. All kiwi responded to capture and handling with a rise in plasma levels of corticosterone, which peaked 30 min after capture. Corticosterone levels immediately after capture in wild kiwi were significantly higher than those of captive kiwi. This was most likely due to the method of capture, as wild kiwi took considerably longer to catch than captive kiwi. The plasma level of corticosterone 30 min after capture in nocturnal house kiwi was significantly lower than wild kiwi, but similar to those in outdoor penned kiwi. The cause of these differences is unclear. Nocturnal house kiwi may have become habituated to the presence of humans. Alternatively, it may be due to nocturnal house kiwi being held on a different light cycle to <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> and wild kiwi. In addition, corticosterone levels in nocturnal house kiwi returned to basal levels 2 h after capture and handling. There was no significant difference in the binding affinity (I(I) and binding capacity (Bmax) of corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) between nocturnal house, <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> and wild kiwi. Furthermore, at no stage did maximum plasma levels of corticosterone exceed Bmax· Therefore, the Bmax of kiwi CBG was not a major factor when interpreting corticosterone responses of kiwi. Regularly handled kiwi do not respond to public display and handling with an increase in plasma levels of corticosterone. Therefore, these kiwi appear to have become habituated to this procedure. Elevated corticosterone levels in wild kiwi immediately after capture indicate that determining the precise location of wild kiwi is sufficient to induce a stress response. Therefore this practice should be kept to a minimum. Low basal levels of corticosterone indicate that captive kiwi have acclimatised to captivity. Furthermore, these results indicate that captive kiwi are not exposed to chronic elevations in corticosterone...|$|E

40|$|A 3 month old Holstein heifer housed {{on a large}} dairy in Northeast China was {{examined}} on October 17 th, 2011 for reported intermittent bloat, hernia, and failure to thrive. At approximately 10 days of age the heifer was operated on by farm veterinarians for correction of an umbilical hernia, however the procedure was apparently ineffective and a larger hernia developed subsequently. At 3 months of age the heifer {{was examined}} and {{was found to be}} moderately bloated with a large ventral hernia. Different options for management and potential interventions for umbilical hernias and free gas bloat were discussed. A brief economic analysis was conducted, and it was decided that the heifer would undergo an open herniorrhaphy to correct the hernia the following day. During surgery, multiple body wall defects were identified and encompassed into one new elliptical incision, and this large defect was closed. The heifer recovered uneventfully from surgery and was found the next day with a moderately distended rumen extending into the left paralumbar fossa. A plastic bloat whistle was placed through the skin, body wall and into the rumen. One month later, the heifer was thriving in an <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> with other weaned heifers.

40|$|Underwater {{sound from}} human {{activities}} may affect fish behaviour negatively and threaten {{the stability of}} fish stocks. However, some fundamental understanding is still lacking for adequate impact assessments and potential mitigation strategies. For example, {{little is known about}} the potential contribution of the temporal features of sound, the efficacy of ramp-up procedures, and the generalisability of results from indoor studies to the outdoors. Using a semi-natural set-up, we exposed European seabass in an <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen</b> to four treatments: 1) continuous sound, 2) intermittent sound with a regular repetition interval, 3) irregular repetition intervals and 4) a regular repetition interval with amplitude ‘ramp-up’. Upon sound exposure, the fish increased swimming speed and depth, and swam away from the sound source. The behavioural readouts were generally consistent with earlier indoor experiments, but the changes and recovery were more variable and were not significantly influenced by sound intermittency and interval regularity. In addition, the ‘ramp-up’ procedure elicited immediate diving response, similar to the onset of treatment without a ‘ramp-up’, but the fish did not swim away from the sound source as expected. Our findings suggest that while sound impact studies outdoors increase ecological and behavioural validity, the inherently higher variability also reduces resolution that may be counteracted by increasing sample size or looking into different individual coping styles. Our results also question the efficacy of ‘ramp-up’ in deterring marine animals, which warrants more investigation...|$|E
40|$|The predatory {{behaviour}} of four owl species, tawny owl (Strix aluco), long-eared owl (Asio otus), little owl (Athene noctua) and barn owl (Tyto alba), was compared. The birds were wild individ- uals temporarily in captivity for rehabilitation and were tested be- fore release into an <b>outdoor</b> <b>pen.</b> Between four and ten birds per species were individually tested {{by offering a}} laboratory mouse used as prey. The resulting sequence of the {{predatory behaviour}} patterns was homogeneous among the species. The latency to at- tack was similar {{and there was a}} tendency to prefer direct attacks, i. e. landing onto the prey directly, instead of indirect ones, i. e. landing a few centimetres from the mouse. However, tawny owls used the former attack only. The various degrees of specialisation to hunt small mammals is reflected by the grip location: the barn owls strongly preferred to seize the mouse on the head, while the little owls preferred the trunk and the other species preferred ei- ther location. Similarly, after grasping the mouse tawny and long- -eared owls struck it with the beak, while the little owls per- formed strikes similar to bites. In contrast, barn owls performed a peculiar torsion of the neck region, instead of a beak strike. We interpret this pattern difference within a basically homogeneous behaviour sequence as evolutionary radiation due to species-spe- cific specialisation of feeding and hunting behaviour. KE...|$|E
