The observed freshwater mound appears to have pushed the DH oil slick seaward from the Delta coastline. We provide a physical mechanism for this novel effect of the MR, using a two-layer pressure-driven flow model. Results show how SSL variations can drive a cross-slope <b>migration</b> of surface <b>oil</b> slicks that may reach velocities of order km/day, and confirm a lag time of order 5 - 10 days between mound formation and slick migration, as observed form the satellite analysis. Incorporating these effects into more complex ocean models will improve forecasts of slick migration for future spills.

40|$|Fat bloom {{is one of}} {{the main}} quality {{problems}} in the chocolate industry. A bloomed chocolate product is characterized by the loss of its initial gloss and the formation of a gray-whitish haze, which makes the product unappealing from a consumer point of view. In the industry, most of the fat bloom related problems arise in filled chocolate products, like pralines and chocolate-coated biscuits. In these products, <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> is considered the main cause of fat bloom development. It leads to the dissolution of solid cocoa butter crystals in the chocolate shell which may recrystallize with the formation of undesired crystals. These give rise, upon growth, to visual fat bloom. When looking at the available literature, most of the studies elucidate the possible mechanisms of <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> and the subsequent fat bloom formation using model systems. These model systems are sometimes too distant from the real industrial applications and the important role of the microstructure of the products are often neglected, although it plays a crucial role in migration-induced fat bloom development. The main objective of this review is to describe the relationships between chocolate microstructure, <b>oil</b> <b>migration,</b> and fat bloom. Practical applications: This review can be used as a base for the development of microstructural strategies to retard <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> and fat bloom development in filled chocolates. An important strategy to retard <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> and migration-induced fat bloom is the creation of more dense structures. By creating denser structures, the overall mobility is reduced leading to a decrease in the rate and extent of <b>oil</b> <b>migration.</b> Also, more dense structures hinder recrystallization and Ostwald ripening, thereby delaying the migration-induced fat bloom development. As fillings are less standardized and not bound by legislation, modification of the filling composition and microstructure offers more opportunities in delaying fat bloom.

Results show that samples crystallized in the presence of sonication and stored at 5 °C for <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> measurements had a significantly lower <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> compared to the non-sonicated ones.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chocolate}} shell particle size were investigated {{by means of}} its influence on rate of <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> and fat bloom development. The particle size of the non-fat particles in the chocolate, i. e. sugar and cocoa particles was varied between 15, 22 and 40 mu m. A novel set of analytical techniques was used and by combining migration results with surface topology results clear differences could be observed between the samples. At 23 degrees C storage the samples with a particle size of 15 mu m showed higher rate of <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> and, further, the earliest development of fat bloom at the surface. This could be observed both macroscopically and microscopically. Thus, it appears as a larger specific surface area of the nonfat particles facilitates migration of filling oil, possibly due to a more heterogeneous and coarser crystal network with higher permeability. Molecular diffusion cannot explain the level of <b>oil</b> <b>migration</b> observed and, thus, convective flow {{is assumed to be}} an important contribution in addition to the molecular diffusion.

As mentioned above, the N 1 s 1 section in profile III displays strong heterogeneity, {{and although the}} evaluation results of large scale are “poor,” the fault sealing properties exist at small scales. Secondly, this method can only explain the sealing properties of the faults in profile. When oil and gas migrate in multiple directions, the evaluation results will not be consistent with drilling results.
