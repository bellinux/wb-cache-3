To address this challenge four experimental tank designs are described {{that have been used}} successfully in developing research methodologies for the larval rearing of marine ornamental species. The four designs increase sequentially in scale and include a 3 -L and 9 -L rounded tank design, a 5 -L modified 'planktonkreisel' design and a 100 -L cylindricoconical design, all of which can be operated as either static or flow-through systems.

Furthermore, it is observed that the filtration efficiency measuredby two Coulter counters reaches a minimum value for a diameter close to 30 µm.

This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on support vector machines (SVMs) in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, for predicting the main filtration operation parameters from data corresponding to 769 experimental filtration cycles in a sand filter operating with effluent. This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. To this end, the most important physical-chemical parameters of this process are monitored and analyzed: effective sand media size, head loss across the filter and filter inlet values of dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, electrical conductivity (Ec), pH and water temperature.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{technologies}} {{in the production of}} tissue is the creping process, where the wet paper is adhered to a large drying cylinder and then peeled off the cylinder, when dried, with a doctor blade. The doctoring process changes the structure of the tissue, breaking bonds between the fibres, greatly increasing the thickness while reducing the length of the sheet and creating the soft feel of the tissue. This paper describes a laboratory scale rig that we have built to investigate the creping process. The creping rig is fed by a continuous web from an unwind stand. The web is processed by spraying the desired level of adhesive, type, concentration and volume onto an internally heated cylinder, adhering the web to the heated rotating cylinder using a presser roll, and then doctoring the web from the cylinder and rewinding. Controllable parameters include spray rate, adhesive concentration and type, cylinder temperature, rewind tension and dryer speed. Creping effectiveness is measured on-line from the reduction in web length and from the force required to doctor the sample off the cylinder. Effectiveness is also measured off-line from the change in thickness, strength and stretch of the samples. To obtain stable operation it is necessary to control the rewind tension. The solution finally chosen was to drive the rewind roll with a variable speed motor controlled from the tension from a measuring roll. It was necessary to stringently filter the adhesive to avoid full and partial plugging of the feed lines and spray nozzles. A two stage filter system was necessary, with one filter on the tank <b>outlet</b> and individual <b>filters</b> protecting each of the spray nozzles. Initial results show that crepe ratio, tensile strength, thickness and stretch all fall with increasing web tension and temperature...|$|R
40|$|In {{the three}} {{waterworks}} Wienrode (Rappbode reservoir), Torgau-Ost (infiltration of Elbe river) and Mockritz (groundwater and infiltration of Elbe river) {{the problem was}} investigated, whether {{it is possible to}} optimize the flocculation and minimize the trihalomethane formation by using H_ 2 O_ 2 and O_ 3. The effect of OH-radicals from H_ 2 O_ 2 /Fe 2 + before the flocculation and from H_ 2 O_ 2 /O_ 3 before the chlorine disinfection did not to come up to expectations. The flocculation inhibiting substances contained in the iron rich groundwater could not be eliminated with H_ 2 O_ 2 (pH about 6. 5). The flocculation remained very chemical expensive by using a high amount of chemicals. The reduction of the THM-formation in the waterworks Torgau-Ost and Mockritz was not obtained with ozone and H_ 2 O_ 2 /O_ 3 because of increased formation of bromine containing THM's. In the waterworks Wienrode the THM-formation could be reduced essentially with ozone (optimum dose 2 mg/l). With H_ 2 O_ 2 /O_ 3 the THM-formation could also be reduced a little, indeed the effect was always lower than with ozone alone. The formation of bromine containing THM's was increased by high bromide concentration, low pH-value, high ozone dose, the H_ 2 O_ 2 /O_ 3 -treatment and an activated carbon filter before the disinfection, partly decreased by low ozone dose. The bromate formation by ozonation of the <b>filter</b> <b>outlet</b> was essentially lower in the waterworks Wienrode (reservoir) than in the waterworks Mockritz (groundwater and infiltration water), even after rising the bromide concentration in the reservoir water to the same level.

40|$|In {{recent years}} rising costs {{of fossil fuels}} and, on the other hand, the {{availability}} of economic incentives {{and the development of}} advanced equipment solutions has made biomass combustion an attractive and efficient alternative for the production of heat and electricity at different scales of the plant. In fact, biomass is a renewable energy source widely used for energy production but, unfavourably, it is an important source of inhalable fine PM in ambient air as well. Among the different technologies for the abatement of these pollutants, wall flow catalytic filters may represent an efficient solution, since they combine physical filtration processes with catalytic oxidative reactions. The analysed filters, made of Silicon Carbide and loaded with 20 %wt of Copper Ferrite (CuFe 2 O 4), were properly shaped to be tested in the sampling line at the exhaust of a 30 kW pellet boiler located at ENEA research facilities. The paper presents the main experimental results related to the filter regeneration, the critical operative phase in order to provide adequate performance and service life of the filters. In the tests, regeneration, obtained by means of a high-temperature electrical heater wrapped around the filter housing, started when the pressure drop in the filter exceeded 600 Pa (the transition value from depth filtration to cake filtration) and the heater temperature was gradually increased from 180 °C to 500 °C. Tests showed high efficiency in PM reduction of wall-flow catalytic filters, moreover a relation between the beginning of the regeneration and the temperature of the flue gas at the <b>filter</b> <b>outlet,</b> in the range 220 - 280 °C, was found. The results provided useful information for the future researches, which will be focused on a microwave-based regeneration system, since both the matrix and the catalyst have good dielectric properties...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results on}} experiments {{carried out at}} a 20 kW combustion rig simulating different extents of oxy-fuel recycle gas cleaning by impurities injection to the oxidant gas of the once-through combustion reactor. A comprehensive set of total (Hg tot), elemental (Hg 0) and oxidized (Hg) mercury as well as SO 3 concentrations was obtained {{before and after the}} combustion rig's baghouse filter for in total 14 air and oxy-fuel experiments with 3 Australian coals. Based on this data, an assessment in respect to Hg oxidation, SO 2 /SO 3 conversion and Hg and SO 3 capture on the test rig's filter was performed. The air and the oxy-fuel experiments with different extents of recycle gas cleaning, revealed differences in the Hg and SO 3 formation and capture behavior: the Hg /Hg tot ratios in the flue gas are higher during oxy-fuel combustion compared to air-firing. This effect is even more pronounced at the <b>filter</b> <b>outlet,</b> after flue gas has passed through the filter ash. In some experiments, even a net oxidation of Hg 0 entering the filter to Hg was observed. The Hg capture by ash in the baghouse filter has been found to reduce the Hg emissions considerably. However, the Hg capture was altered by the different oxy-fuel recycle configurations, leading to decreased Hg capture efficiencies on the filter for one of the coals. A coal-specific trend of increased SO 2 /SO 3 conversion ratios with increased flue gas SO 2 levels was observed that could be related to the ash composition of the three different coals. This and the higher SO 2 concentrations in the flue gas lead to considerably higher SO 3 levels in oxy-fuel combustion with SO 2 recycling. During the experiments, also a considerable capture of SO 3 in the baghouse filter was observed (up to 80 % under air- and up to 66 % under oxy-fired conditions). A reduction of the SO 3 capture on the filter under oxy-fuel conditions {{may be related to the}} higher SO 3 levels in this process...|$|R
