5|$|While {{the term}} Holocaust {{generally}} {{refers to the}} systematic mass murder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people</b> in Nazi-occupied Europe, the Nazis also murdered {{a large number of}} non-Jewish people who were considered subhuman (Untermenschen) or undesirable.

5|$|During Levy's tenure, {{the synagogue}} had several congregants who were famous, or would become so. Ray Frank, the first Jewish woman to preach {{formally}} from a pulpit in the United States, settled in Oakland around 1885, and taught Hebrew Bible studies and Jewish history at First Hebrew Congregation's Sabbath school, {{where she was}} superintendent. Her students there in the 1880s included Gertrude Stein, later to become a famous writer, and Judah Leon Magnes, who would become a prominent Reform rabbi. Magnes's views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people</b> were strongly influenced by First Hebrew's Rabbi Levy, {{and it was at}} the building on 13th and Clay that Magnes first began preaching—his bar mitzvah speech of 1890 was quoted at length in The Oakland Tribune.|$|E

Esther loves Judah, but is committed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and the freedom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people.</b> This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah delivers potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people.</b> They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
