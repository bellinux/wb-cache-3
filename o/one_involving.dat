5|$|It was {{the first}} time the court had {{considered}} an entrapment case from outside the realm of controlled-substance enforcement, or <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> conduct that had only recently been criminalized. By relying exclusively on whether the defendant had a predisposition to commit the crime, the court appeared to have finally resolved a lingering issue in its previous decisions on the subject.|$|E
5|$|At the start, Hamilton {{assumed the}} lead while a three-car wide tussle at turn <b>one,</b> <b>involving</b> Kimi Räikkönen, Felipe Nasr and Pastor Maldonado, {{resulted}} in Maldonado crashing out at turn two and race officials deploying the safety car. The next lap, Romain Grosjean's car failed thus taking both Lotus cars {{out of the}} race. Normal racing resumed on lap four, with Carlos Sainz Jr. falling back from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by Nasr and Daniel Ricciardo. Nasr also lost track position after being ordered by his team to relinquish a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E

5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol functional group, generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier for writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E
5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E

5|$|Traffic {{lights were}} downed by high winds, causing {{numerous}} traffic delays. Landslides along major roadways caused several accidents, <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> a bus that was damaged by rocks. One business was significantly damaged, {{with at least}} one main wall collapsing. To speed up the removal of debris, members of the Mexican army were deployed throughout Sinaloa. According to officials in Mexico, Tropical Depression One-E was the first known tropical cyclone to impact the state of Sinaloa during the month of June on record. With the system impacting land on June19, it marked the earliest date that a tropical cyclone had impacted the state, with the average date of first impact being August15.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot and}} {{gameplay}} of Pokémon Crystal is largely {{the same as}} in Gold and Silver, although it holds new features. It is the first game to allow players to choose the sex of their character, while previously the character was always male. Pokémon have animated sprites; for example, when a Cyndaquil enters battle, the flames on its back flicker. This feature was absent in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire and Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, but has appeared in all subsequent games. In addition, a couple of subplots were added, <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> the legendary Pokémon Suicune, featured on the front cover of the game, and the other involving the Unown. The game's biggest addition was the Battle Tower, a new building which allows players to participate in Pokémon Stadium-like fights. The Japanese edition of the game was exclusively bundled with the , a device that allowed for connecting with other players via mobile phone.|$|E

25|$|At the convention, a {{republic}} gained majority support (89 votes to 52 with 11 abstentions), {{but the question}} of what model for {{a republic}} should be put to the people at a referendum produced deep divisions among republicans. Four republican models were debated: two involving direct election of the head of state; <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> appointment on the advice of the prime minister (the McGarvie Model); and <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> appointment by a two-thirds majority of parliament (the bi-partisan appointment model).|$|E

25|$|Romney instead offered two {{possible}} replacement systems, <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> individual unemployment savings accounts that employees would withdraw from {{when they lose}} their jobs, the other keyed on instituting financial incentives for businesses and other employers to hire and train {{those who had been}} unemployed for a long time.|$|E

25|$|The 1996 {{parliamentary}} election {{was held on}} 20 October with the run-off on 10 November.

The election was won by the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Conservative Party, which gained 70 seats and 31% of the vote. Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party were distant second with 16 seats, followed by Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania with 12.|$|E
25|$|Mathematicians have {{discovered}} {{that it is possible}} in principle to have multiple bodies in non-elliptical orbits that repeat periodically, although most such orbits are not stable regarding small perturbations in mass, position, or velocity. However, some special stable cases have been identified, including a planar figure-eight orbit occupied by three moving bodies. Further studies {{have discovered}} that nonplanar orbits are also possible, including <b>one</b> <b>involving</b> 12 masses moving in 4 roughly circular, interlocking orbits topologically equivalent to the edges of a cuboctahedron.|$|E
