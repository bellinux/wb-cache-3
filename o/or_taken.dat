5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical erythromycin. Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (<b>or</b> <b>taken)</b> when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century Fort al-Jalali was {{the main}} prison in Oman, holding about 200 prisoners.

5|$|Most historians thus concur that chattel {{slaves were}} indeed {{used in the}} Greek {{city-state}} of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only among the upper classes.

5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> by mouth.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th century, the priory was in decline, but its closure came as {{a result}} of the {{dissolution}} of the monasteries in England and Wales under Henry VIII. To help speed the process of closing the institution, Ralf Hartley was appointed as the prior of Wetheral by Henry's minister, Thomas Cromwell; royal commissioners visited in 1536, and the priory was finally surrendered to the Crown in 1538. The priory's belongings were sold off <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> by Henry, depending on their value, but the lands were given to Carlisle Cathedral. Although the rest of the priory soon fell into disrepair, the gatehouse became the local vicarage; it was still intact and in use by the minister in 1687.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the special}} effects in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E

5|$|Mercury in {{the form}} of one of its common ores, cinnabar, is used in various {{traditional}} medicines, especially in traditional Chinese medicine. Review of its safety has found that cinnabar can lead to significant mercury intoxication when heated, consumed in overdose, <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> long term, and can have adverse effects at therapeutic doses, though effects from therapeutic doses are typically reversible. Although this form of mercury appears to be less toxic than other forms, its use in traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been justified, as the therapeutic basis for the use of cinnabar is not clear.|$|E

Companies could apply for OT work or could be conscripted. Companies failing to complete their work on time, which was always possible as the OT controlled the material and manpower of each firm, could find themselves closed down, or more likely fined, <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> over or merged with another firm to make a more efficient larger unit, successful firms however could make attractive profits.|$|E
5|$|The laurels for the day’s action {{went to the}} defenders. The aim of the Luftwaffe was to {{wear down}} the Fighter Command without {{suffering}} excessive losses in the process, and in this it had failed. It cost the attackers five aircrew killed, wounded, <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner, for each British pilot casualty. In terms of aircraft, it had cost the Luftwaffe five bombers and fighters for every three Spitfires and Hurricanes destroyed in the air or on the ground. If the battle continued at this rate the Luftwaffe would wreck Fighter Command, but it would come close to wrecking itself in the process.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary role}} of a king was {{to act as a}} war leader, {{reflected}} in the very small number of minorities or female reigning monarchs in the period. Kings organised the defence of their people's lands, property and persons and negotiated with other kings to secure these things. If they failed to do so, the settlements might be raided, destroyed or annexed and the populations killed <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> into slavery. Kings also engaged in the low-level warfare of raiding and the more ambitious full-scale warfare that led to conflicts of large armies and alliances and which could be undertaken over relatively large distances, like the expedition to Orkney by Dál Riata in 581 or the Northumbrian attack on Ireland in 684.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} fielded {{at least}} 49 battalions during the First World War, from a pre-war establishment of two regular, two militia, and six territorial. Of those battalions, 26 served abroad, receiving 58 battle honours and six Victoria Crosses for {{service on the}} Western Front, the Balkans, India, and Russia. Some 13,795 Kingsmen died {{during the course of}} the war, the battalions suffering an average of 615 deaths. Thousands more would be wounded, sick, <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner. Of specific formations, the four Liverpool Pals battalions had nearly 2,800 casualties, while the 55th (West Lancashire) Division's 165th (Liverpool) Brigade, composed entirely of battalions from the King's, incurred 1,672 dead, 6,056 wounded, and 953 missing during the period of 3 January 1916 and 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Counter-attacks by the 4th Guards Division, {{reinforced}} by {{a battalion of}} the 220th Division, forced the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade back to the start line. On the right flank, one unit of the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade suffered {{a large number of}} shellfire casualties, while assembling for the attack and was met with massed artillery and machine-gun fire as it neared its objective. Only three small parties, the largest of not more than twenty men, reached their goal. The other two attacking units captured their objectives late in the evening and a salient was created in the 4th Canadian Division line. On the evening of 21 August, three parties went forward to bomb the German position from the flanks but were only moderately successful. An additional attack planned for 22 August failed to materialize, due to battalion-level misunderstandings. A brigade reserve unit was ordered to remedy the situation by attacking a slagheap called Green Crassier and the mine complex at Fosse St. Louis. The attack was repulsed, with the majority of the attackers being killed, wounded <b>or</b> <b>taken</b> prisoner. The Germans held on to the area until the beginning of the final German retreat in 1918.|$|E
