Some home demos and group sessions at Kinfauns were later released on the 1996 compilation Anthology 3.|$|E

5|$|A large monsoon trough was {{anchored}} {{south of}} Guam {{towards the end}} of July. By July21, three areas of disturbed weather had formed. Although the westernmost disturbance dissipated, the easternmost two continued to develop, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>would</b> later become Typhoon Andy. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued for the easternmost system at 1900UTC on July21 as sea level pressures fell and convection increased within the vicinity of the disturbance. After becoming better organized, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Later on July22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started monitoring the same system as it developed rainbands and a further increase in thunderstorm activity. Initially, the JTWC correctly predicted the low to move northwest. Hurricane Hunters indicated that the low and mid-level centers were not vertically aligned. On July23, both the JMA and JTWC upped the depression into a tropical storm. Bess then began to intensify. At 0600UTC on July24, Bess was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the JMA. After the formation of an eye, both agencies classified Bess as a typhoon.|$|E

After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville.

5|$|Barbara McLaren engaged Lutyens {{to design}} a {{memorial}} for the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which Spalding Urban District Council had purchased in 1897 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Lutyens proposed a U-shaped cloister sheltering a Stone of Remembrance {{standing in front of}} a circular lily pool, in the centre <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>would</b> be a cross. McLaren hoped to include space for the families of those commemorated to add their own epitaphs but this proved impractical due to the amount of space that would have been required; she insisted that her husband not receive any special commemoration beyond that afforded to the other casualties.|$|E
5|$|Beardsley's former club Mansfield {{spoke to}} him about re-signing for them in May 2005, {{although}} Kidderminster demanded a £5,000 fee for him, half <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>would</b> go his former club Doncaster. He eventually joined Mansfield, now playing in League Two, on 5 August 2005 for a nominal fee. He debuted as an 82nd-minute substitute in their 3–0 home win over Torquay United on 13 August 2005. However, his 2005–06 season {{came to an end}} during a 3–2 home defeat to local rivals Notts County on 29 August 2005, when he collided with goalkeeper Kevin Pilkington and broke his leg. Beardsley had made four appearances that season, which Mansfield finished in 16th-place in League Two. He returned to the team almost a year later, on 12 August 2006, as an 88th-minute substitute in a 1–1 home draw with Stockport County. His first two goals of 2006–07 came in Mansfield's 3–0 Football League Trophy home victory against Grimsby Town on 31 October 2006.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>would</b> become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from {{contact with the outside}} world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.|$|E

The other two divisions, the 5th and the 63rd Divisions, were held in reserve before being deployed later in the battle. Of all these divisions, only the New Zealand Division was at full strength. Facing the Third Army was the German 17th Army, commanded by General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) Otto von Below, made up of eight divisions which, apart from the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division, were all second class formations.
