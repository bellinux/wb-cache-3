5|$|Intelligent, passionate, and {{the moral}} center of the family, Lisa Simpson, at eight years <b>old,</b> <b>is</b> the second child of Homer and Marge, younger sister of Bart, and older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and liberal {{political}} stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age, therefore she {{is a bit of}} a loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa enjoys many hobbies, including reading and playing the baritone saxophone. Lisa's character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes and stands with the Tibetan independence movement. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and inspired a line of merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Radical Dreamers {{features}} three protagonists—Serge, Kid, and Magil—who {{seek out}} treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance {{three years ago}} in a remote town. Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude. Kid, only sixteen years <b>old,</b> <b>is</b> a renowned professional thief with a reputation for boisterous behavior. Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of Robin Hood. Magil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can fade into shadow at will. Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Magil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group. They seek the Frozen Flame, a mythic artifact capable of granting any wish. It is hidden in Viper Manor—the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named Lynx, who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} fossils of the closely related Mapusaurus {{were found in}} a bonebed {{consisting}} of several individuals at different growth stages. In their 2006 description of the genus, Coria and Currie suggested that though this {{could be due to}} a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses, the presence of different growth stages of the same taxon indicated the aggregation was not coincidental. In a 2006 National Geographic article, Coria stated that the bonebed was probably the result of a catastrophic event, and that the presence of mainly medium-sized individuals, with very few young or <b>old,</b> <b>is</b> normal for animals that form packs. Therefore, Coria said, large theropods may have hunted in groups, which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods.|$|E
5|$|Herd numbers {{grew from}} 28 to over 165 between 1968 and 1997 and {{overgrazing}} negatively impacted their living environment. To manage population numbers, long-term, non-hormonal contraceptives have been employed, proving 95 percent effective over a seven-year field trial. The contraceptive, which {{began to be}} used at a management level in 1995 although it was used in smaller amounts as early as 1989, has also proven effective at improving the health and increasing the life expectancy of older mares through the removal of pregnancy and lactation-related stress. Since 1990, general herd health has improved, early mortality has decreased and older ponies are now found, with many {{over the age of}} 20 and some even over 25. No horse has ever been injured during the dart-administered treatments, although there is a 0.2 percent rate of abscess at the injection site, which normally heals within two weeks. Each mare between two and four years <b>old</b> <b>is</b> given contraceptives, and treatment is then withdrawn until she produces a foal. Once she has produced enough foals to be well represented genetically within the herd, she is placed on a yearly treatment plan until her death. After the introduction of the contraceptive, herd numbers continued to rise to a high of 175 in 2001 to 2005, but then dropped significantly to around 130 in 2009. In 2009, a study determined that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the herd was quite low, most likely due to their isolation, but that their nuclear genetic diversity remained at a level similar to that of breeds from the mainland.|$|E
