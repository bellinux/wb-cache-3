50|$|<b>Occupy</b> {{does not}} label itself as anarchist. However, John L.

He also notes that <b>Occupy’s</b> emphasis {{on the experience of}} occupation aligns with the principles of libertarian anarchists. Horizontalism, meaning an equal distribution of power, is demonstrated in the <b>Occupy</b> movement through the creation of a direct democracy that eliminates hierarchy and representative structures. <b>Occupy</b> operates using mutualism and self-organization as its principles. The General Assemblies practice direct democracy using consensus to the extent of practicality. Outside of the General Assemblies, <b>Occupy</b> protestors have organized into decentralized groups. <b>Occupy’s</b> practice of horizontal organization rejects the legitimacy of the existing hierarchical political structure in the United States. By questioning institutions like the existing state <b>Occupy</b> is demonstrating both autonomy and defiance. <b>Occupy</b> demonstrates some of the values of anarchism, but <b>Occupy</b> does not identify as anarchist because of differences in ideology and motivations to act.|$|R
