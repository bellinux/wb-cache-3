5|$|In February 1998, the Norwegian Ministry of Justice {{stated that}} the {{relatives}} {{did not have a}} right to <b>occupational</b> <b>injury</b> compensation from the Norwegian National Insurance. Because of the Svalbard Treaty, the archipelago is an economic free zone and Arktikugol is exempt from paying social insurance, so its employees did not have a right to Norwegian benefits. Had this been the case, widows would have received about NOK600,000 per worker. By 1998, a few of the relatives had accepted the US$20,000 compensation, while the rest of them were planning to sue both the airline's insurance company and Arktikugol. Among the issues in the case, which took place at Nord-Troms District Court, was whether the accident was to be considered a working accident, and thus result in injury compensation from the mining company. In November, it was decided that the Ukrainians needed to make a guarantee for NOK2.5 million to run the case, which they could not afford. They therefore had no alternative than to accept the proposal from the insurance company. In June 1999, the parties agreed on a settlement, where the compensation was not disclosed to the public. It was later disclosed that the settlement was about three times the initial offer from the insurance company. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs established a scholarship to help children who lost a parent in the accident to take senior secondary and tertiary education.|$|E

Methods: Ten years of <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries,</b> from 2001 to 2010, were {{analyzed}} in order to investigate the changing profiles according to the various characteristics of injuries; economic sectors, age of the injured, and type of injuries. The changing profile of <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> was investigated by comparison with an index-created relative value {{based on the number}} of cases of reference category.

Women's higher rates of job-related stress {{may be due to}} the fact that women are often caregivers at home and do contingent work and contract work at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is homicide, which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the frequency of <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> and health status of workers.

Both groups were similar in terms of many factors that could contribute to the occurrence of <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries.</b> The injury rates were calculated in both groups. Results Workers with psychomotor and sensorimotor disorders, neuroses, obstructive sleep apnea, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hearing, vascular and sight impairments have been frequently injured compared to workers with other diseases.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> {{are among}} factors that cause death and {{disability}} of thousands {{individuals in the}} workplace. Thus, identifying the influential factors of <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> is of paramount importance. Previous researches have indicated that transformational leadership style has {{an essential role in}} <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries.</b> Consequently, the aim of the current study is to investigate the role of transformational leadership style in predicting <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> among Esfahan Steel’s employees.. Material and Method: The current descriptive-correlation study was conducted among 189 Esfahan Steel’s employees in 2012. They were randomly selected through Stratified sampling. Data were collected using transformational leadership style questionnaire (Bass and Avolio, 1990), safety consciousness inventory (Barling, et al., 2002) and safety-related events and <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> questionnaire (Barling, et al., 2002). The obtained data were analyzed thorough descriptive Statistics methods, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, and regression analysis by SPSS 18.. Result: The findings of the study showed that transformational leadership style had a significant correlation with safety consciousness and safety-related events (P< 0. 05). The Results of regression analysis showed that transformational leadership style reduced the <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> through increasing safety consciousness and reducing safety-related events.. Conclusion: The present study emphasizes the importance of transformational leadership style and its instruction to mangers and supervisor. The consequences as well as the suggestion for the further study are discussed in this article...|$|R
2500|$|Stress-related {{disorders}} encompass a {{broad array}} of conditions, including psychological disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder) and other types of emotional strain (e.g., dissatisfaction, fatigue, tension, etc.), maladaptive behaviors (e.g., aggression, substance abuse), and cognitive impairment (e.g., concentration and memory problems). In turn, these conditions may lead to poor work performance, higher absenteeism, less work productivity or even injury. [...] "If untreated, consistently high stress can become a chronic condition, which can exacerbate existing mental health conditions and chronic physical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, weak immune system). These conditions not only diminish the well-being of workers and increase the employer's health benefits expenses, they contribute to increased injury incidence. Consistently high levels of stress increase the risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>injury.</b> A study of light/short haul truckers, a group that experiences high rates of injury and mental health issues, found that frequent stress increased the odds of <b>occupational</b> <b>injury</b> by 350%." ...|$|E

2500|$|Construction {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union. In 2009, the fatal <b>occupational</b> <b>injury</b> rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers. Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry. Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure health and safety of workers and compliance with HSE construction requirements. Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations.

Starting Novembre 2007, we implemented periodical controls of alcohol and drug abuse among workers of four hauling firms of the Cagliari province, using a rapid multi-test colorimetric method, serum levels of the γ-glutamil transferase enzyme (γGT), the mean red cell volume (MCV), and alcohol detection in the exhaled breath, accompanying such controls with an educational program on the causes, consequences, and prevention of <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries.</b> We measured the rate of <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> per 105 working hours in 2005 - 2009; the severity rate was expressed by the number of lost working days due to <b>occupational</b> <b>injuries</b> over 103 working hours.
