An {{important feature}} of an instructional program is the alignment of curricular objectives with instructional practices, materials, assessment practices, professional development opportunities, {{and the role of}} good leadership.

A qualitative study was designed to examine coherence of aspects of the science instructional program at the fourth and fifth elementary grade levels of a Lebanese school. The results of the analysis show that the degree of alignment between the curricular <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> the various aspects varied. There was good alignment between the curricular <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> instructional practices, good alignment between curricular <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> assessment practices, good alignment between curricular <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> professional development activities, but partial alignment between curricular <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> instructional materials.

40|$|The best {{available}} technologies identified in previous project tasks were scored and ranked. The evaluation {{was based on}} the <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> criteria for the technology evaluation developed in Task 1. 4. The goal of the Dairy BAT project, defined in the original Statement of Work, is clear <b>and</b> unchanging. The <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> criteria were the first products of the project, and were developed prior to the information and knowledge the project team ultimately gained. They are, therefore, reconsidered and clarified in that light. Specifically, certain objectives have become more important than others have; and certain criteria within those objectives have gained priority. In particular, a deeper understanding of stakeholder issues and concerns alongside technical consideration has affected the importance of specific <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> criteria. The <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> criteria (SWET 2001 a) have been reordered to recognize two levels of priority, and to interpret the overlap between some of the <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> criteria in defining a precedence of one over another (Table ES- 1).

5|$|After judicious self-experiments, Shulgin enlisted a {{small group}} of friends with whom he {{regularly}} tested his creations, starting in 1960. They developed a systematic way of ranking the effects of the various drugs, known as the Shulgin Rating Scale, with a vocabulary to describe the visual, auditory and physical sensations. He personally tested hundreds of drugs, mainly analogues of various phenethylamines (family containing MDMA, mescaline, and the 2C* family), and tryptamines (family containing DMT and psilocin). There are a seemingly infinite number of slight chemical variations, which can produce variations in effect — some pleasant and some unpleasant, depending on the person, substance, and situation — all of which are meticulously recorded in Shulgin's lab notebooks. Shulgin published many of these <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> subjective reports in his books and papers.|$|E

5|$|Believing it {{was useless}} to {{continue}} arguing with Cao, Vann climbed back into his L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and left Tan Hiep. Throughout the afternoon, he continued to press Cao to quickly deploy the South Vietnamese paratroopers. He was fearful that the battle {{would turn out to}} be the largest defeat of South Vietnamese forces up to that point of the war. Cao promised to deploy the second Civil Guard battalion which had just arrived at the southwest flank of Ap Bac, and to drop the ARVN 8th Airborne Battalion at around 16:00 behind Ba's armored personnel carriers. Late in the afternoon, a flight of C-123 Providers, with about 300 South Vietnamese paratroopers aboard, closed in on their <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> quickly drew machine gun fire from the hamlet. The C-123 pilots changed course to avoid the ground fire, but either the South Vietnamese jump master or the American flight leader did not compensate for the change. As a result, the paratroopers landed right in front of the entrenched Viet Cong positions, instead of behind the 4th Mechanized Rifle Squadron and the Civil Guards.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, it was {{apparent}} that the failure of the New Zealanders to advance their section of the front exposed the left flank of the neighbouring 3rd Australian Division, which had secured its first <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> was pushing on to its second. Likewise, on the New Zealand Division's left, the 9th (Scottish) Division had managed to reach its final objective. Godley issued new instructions to the New Zealand Division; abandoning any hope of getting to the Green Line, it was to push on to the Blue Line in an attack timed for 3:00pm. However, by the early afternoon the flanking Scots had been pushed back while the Australians had failed to make further gains and were withdrawing due to enfilade gunfire on the flanks. Braithwaite, warned by his battalion commanders that capturing the Blue Line was impossible, twice pushed Russell for a cancellation of the attack. Russell's initial response was to instruct the Rifle Brigade to continue, but shortly before the attack was to begin, it was abandoned.|$|E

Grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts, each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support.|$|E

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this work}} is the correct {{establishment}} and follow-up of quality <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> indicators as the cornerstones of a quality assurance system, in this case focused on ISO 9001. Materials and methods: In this work, the authors present the criteria that, in their view, an organization must follow for a better selection and adaptation of the ISO 9001 : 2008 quality system <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> indicators applied to a university pharmaceutical pilot plant. The evolution of errors in setting <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> indicators is assessed. Results: Based {{on the experience of}} several years at the SDM (Service of Development of Medicines) at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Barcelona, the results show that the establishing of appropriate <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> indicators is not an easy task. A careful selection of both <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> indicators must be a compulsory step prior to the establishment of a robust, reliable quality assurance system through years. Conclusions: Experience over time proves to be a powerful tool to end up selecting the right quality <b>objectives</b> <b>and</b> indicators for such quality system. Since this task is not always easy to carry out, is necessary to set a selection of criteria in order to obtain useful information that contributes to the continuous improvement of the quality system...|$|R

5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|From the Japanese perspective, {{the battle}} was not going too well either. The Japanese had {{expected}} a landing on Seeadler Harbour, this being the logical American <b>objective,</b> <b>and</b> had concentrated their forces around the Lorengau airfield. The defence of the Momote airstrip and Hyane harbour was the responsibility of Baba Force, built around Captain Baba's 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment. Colonel Ezaki ordered Baba to attack the beachhead but a suspicion the Hyane Harbour landing was a diversion, coupled with false reports of enemy activity at Salami had him retain the 2nd (Iwakami) Battalion of the 1st Independent Infantry Regiment there instead of sending it to assist Baba Force. By 2March, Ezaki had resolved to attack the Hyane beachhead with his whole force. The difficulties imposed by the terrain, and disruption by American artillery and Allied naval gunfire, forced a postponement of the attack to the night of 3March.|$|E
