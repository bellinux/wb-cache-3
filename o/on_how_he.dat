5|$|Chico {{pledged to}} hire 2,000 police {{officers}} {{but did not}} offer specifics <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would raise the funds. He opposed making the school board an elected body, and he favored extending the school day and school year. Chico picked up endorsements from unions that represented, among others, police officers, firefighters, laborers, painters, operating engineers, iron workers, roofers, and sheet metal workers.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{the first}} {{recorded}} use {{of toilet paper}} was made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591), and in 851 an Arab Muslim traveler commented <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> believed the Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness {{because they did not}} wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.|$|E

As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Taylor pitched for the Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees, {{where the}} Yankees {{planned to have}} Taylor work on his curveball, as they already felt that his fastball {{was good enough for}} the major leagues. Entering the season, he was named baseball's second-best {{prospect}} behind Chipper Jones. That year, Taylor had a 137 record, a 3.48 ERA, and 150 strikeouts in 163 innings, and also led the Eastern League with 102 walks. In 1994, he was expected to pitch for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League, and start for the Yankees to begin the 1995 season at the latest, dependent <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would have performed in spring training. After the season ended, the Yankees wanted Taylor to take part in an instructional league to work on his fundamentals. Taylor declined to attend the camp, and instead chose to return to his home in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the laughter of Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E
5|$|Sensing growing {{frustration}} among Bolshevik supporters, Lenin {{suggested an}} armed political demonstration in Petrograd {{to test the}} government's response. Amid deteriorating health, he left the city to recuperate in the Finnish village of Neivola. The Bolsheviks' armed demonstration, the July Days, took place while Lenin was away, but upon learning that demonstrators had violently clashed with government forces, he returned to Petrograd and called for calm. Responding to the violence, the government ordered the arrest of Lenin and other prominent Bolsheviks, raiding their offices, and publicly alleging {{that he was a}} German agent provocateur. Evading arrest, Lenin hid in a series of Petrograd safe houses. Fearing that he would be killed, Lenin and fellow senior Bolshevik Grigory Zinoviev escaped Petrograd in disguise, relocating to Razliv. There, Lenin began work on the book that became The State and Revolution, an exposition <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> believed the socialist state would develop after the proletariat revolution, and how from then on the state would gradually wither away, leaving a pure communist society. He began arguing for a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection to topple the government, but at a clandestine meeting of the party's central committee this idea was rejected. Lenin then headed by train and by foot to Finland, arriving at Helsinki on 10 August, where he hid away in safe houses belonging to Bolshevik sympathisers.|$|E

25|$|Hawkeye {{returns to}} the Avengers {{just prior to the}} battle with the entity Onslaught, in which the Avengers (including Hawkeye) are {{apparently}} killed. Franklin Richards, however, transported them all to a pocket universe where the heroes led altered lives. The heroes eventually learned the truth and they were returned to their own universe. Hawkeye's hearing was fully restored because, when Franklin Richards recreated the heroes in the new universe, he based them <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> remembered them.|$|E

25|$|In a 2017 {{interview}} on French Canadian television, {{he opened up}} about his time being drafted by the Nordiques.

He stated that the real reason was he did not respect Marcel Aubut and criticized <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would never play for him. At the end of the interview, he was given the Nordiques igloo and fleur-de-lys jersey at last, 26 years after the saga began.|$|E
25|$|Sir Michael Somare {{was called}} up to give an {{explanation}} <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> obtained a A$349,000 three-bedroom executive-style apartment with private plunge pool in inner-city Cairns in April 2007, brokered through a Gold Coast lawyer. Along with his son Arthur Somare who was PNG's State Enterprise Minister and a political heavyweight, he was questioned about a A$685,000 four-bedroom home he had bought two months prior at Trinity Beach. Ombudsman Commission, Opposition Leader Sir Mekere Morauta, and former finance minister Bart Philemon requested an explanation over the provided documents evident of the purchased property.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary mortals {{could not}} go to heaven {{because it was the}} abode of the gods alone. Instead, after a person died, his or her soul went to Kur (later known as Irkalla), a dark shadowy underworld, located deep {{below the surface of the}} earth. All souls went to the same afterlife, and a person's actions during life had no impact <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would be treated in the world to come. Nonetheless, funerary {{evidence}} indicates that some people believed that Inanna had the power to bestow special favors upon her devotees in the afterlife.|$|E

25|$|Harris {{had noted}} on his site {{that he had}} made pipe bombs, in {{addition}} to a hit list of individuals (he did not post any plan <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> intended to attack targets). As Harris had posted on his website that he possessed explosives, Guerra wrote a draft affidavit, requesting a search warrant of the Harris household. The affidavit also mentioned a suspicion of Harris being involved in an unsolved pipe bomb case in February 1998. The affidavit was never filed. It was concealed by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and not revealed until September 2001, resulting from an investigation by the TV show 60 Minutes.|$|E
25|$|Alalia and Fratt, {{with the}} {{guidance}} of Ayn, finally reach their destination and prepare for the live broadcast. They contact Pjölk, who happily commands them to begin the transmission, then he turns off his tele-o-visor and sits {{down in front of}} his typewriter to create the headline article for tomorrow's issue of his tabloid. He fabricates an entire story based <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> is distressed for being responsible for killing the nerd viewers, and where he makes a statement saying {{that there should be a}} law banning tele-o-vision forever. Not yet aware of the danger they are putting themselves in, Alalia and Fratt start broadcasting and begin their quest through the lair, following Ayn of Raiká.|$|E
25|$|Darden {{would use}} a number of terms that he himself devised to {{describe}} how a quote, image, sketch, et cetera might influence a project. He would use the term pre-texts to describe passages that in-form the initial portion of the design process, but simultaneously cloaks and conceals the real intention. Con-texts are the writings by Darden or the inspirational elements that condition the design {{and give it a}} sense of believability. Sub-text was the underlining story behind the project—in a sense, Darden's own personal life found in the project (e.g. Darden's letter to The Southern Quarterly <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> related Oxygen House with his leukemia). Finally, there are archi-texts, which are writings, thoughts, or ideas by Darden himself that color the project and give it sustenance.|$|E
