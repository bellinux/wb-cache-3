5|$|That the {{metallurgy}} <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> {{was completely}} unknown {{came as no}} surprise at all, for it had only recently been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} a pound <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> dust spread {{into the atmosphere}} {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|Care must {{be taken}} to avoid the {{accumulation}} of amounts <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> which approach critical mass, particularly because plutonium's critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235. A critical mass <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays. Plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water.|$|E

40|$|In September, 1997, {{nine of the}} world`s plutonium-using {{countries}} {{agreed to}} a set of guidelines for international plutonium management, with acceptances to be submitted to the International Atomic Energy Agency on December 1.

5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive compression <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> {{to obtain}} significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency.

5|$|The usual {{transportation}} <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> {{is through}} the more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package.

5|$|In 1943, {{development}} efforts {{were directed to}} a gun-type fission weapon with plutonium called Thin Man. Initial research on the properties <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium. Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 {{that some of the}} plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median lethal dose (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds <b>of</b> <b>plutonium</b> absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E

The Dhruva project cost 950 million rupees. The reactor uses heavy water (deuterium) as a moderator and coolant. Aluminum clad fuel rods containing natural uranium are used to obtain a maximum power output of 100MW. According to conservative estimates, the reactor produces an average of 16-26 kg <b>of</b> weapons-grade <b>plutonium</b> per year in its spent fuel, while former Indian Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman P.K.
