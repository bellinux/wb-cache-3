He was later {{signed as a free}} agent to the Kansas City Chiefs, who released him prior to the start of the 2001 regular season. After being waived by the Chiefs, Allen intended to leave football behind, but he accepted a spot on the practice squad of the Atlanta Falcons in January 2002. Later that month, the Chiefs signed Allen to a three-year contract. During the offseason, Allen was sent to play for the Scottish Claymores <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> Europe to gain experience. After his father had a stroke, Allen was forced to leave the Claymores and return to the United States. He participated in training camp and the preseason with the Chiefs but was waived shortly before the start of the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Bennett was {{selected}} by the New York Giants in the fourth round of the 1999 National Football League Draft. As a rookie in 1999, Bennett missed seven games due to a knee injury. After undergoing surgery on the knee, he missed all of the 2000 season. In 2001, New York expected Bennett to work in tandem with Tiki Barber but after suffering a hamstring injury, he was released on September 3, 2001. After multiple injuries to their running backs, the Giants became interested in re-signing Bennett but because <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> rules {{they were unable to}} do so until January 2002. During this time period, he was offered contracts by the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins but rejected both hoping to return to the Giants. He re-signed with the Giants on January 16, 2002. During the season, Bennett was returned to the wide receiver position he played in high school, due to multiple injuries suffered by the Giants players in that position. He was waived on December 4, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year. Both concussions and catastrophic injuries can be caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions as well as impact against the ground or other players' knees; in other cases, they can be caused by players who have sustained a head injury returning to play, which can place the player at risk of sustaining a severe injury. Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E

5|$|In February 2007, {{he signed}} with the Chicago Bears. He was {{assigned}} to the Frankfurt Galaxy <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> Europa on February 24, 2007. In 2007, he completed 174 of 254 passes for 2,201 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions with a 104.8 passer rating. He led the league in passer rating and passing yards while also tying Casey Bramlet for the league lead in touchdown passes. O'Sullivan recorded the league's only two 300 passing yards games of the 2007 season and threw for 374 yards in Week 9 against the Hamburg Sea Devils. On June 21, 2007, O'Sullivan and Cologne Centurions running back Derrick Ross were named the 2007 NFL Europa Co-Offensive MVPs. They both earned All-NFL Europa honors as well. O'Sullivan started all ten of the team's games, leading them to a 7–3 record and a berth in World Bowl XV, which the Galaxy lost to the Hamburg Sea Devils by a score of 37–28. He completed 23 of 39 passes for 299 yards and two touchdowns with one interception in World Bowl XV.|$|E
5|$|In winning all {{of their}} regular season games and the AAFC championship, the Browns {{recorded}} the first perfect season in professional football since the advent <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> championships in 1933. The feat has been duplicated only once since, by the Miami Dolphins in 1972. When the AAFC faltered and dissolved after the 1949 season and the NFL absorbed the Browns, their new league did not recognize AAFC statistics, including the perfect season. The Pro Football Hall of Fame, however, recognizes it as a perfect season. In 2008, United States Senator Sherrod Brown, who represents Ohio in the United States Congress, {{sent a letter to}} NFL commissioner Roger Goodell asking the league to recognize AAFC championships and team records including the perfect season. At the time, the New England Patriots were undefeated as they prepared for the Super Bowl against the New York Giants, a game they went on to lose. Dante Lavelli also advocated for the NFL to adopt AAFC records.|$|E
5|$|Individual owners took {{advantage}} of the AmeriKing failure; one of the BK regional owners, Miami-based Al Cabrera, purchased 130 stores located primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed company for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88 percent of their original value. The new company, which started out as Core Value Partners and eventually became Heartland Foods, also purchased 120 additional stores from distressed owners and completely revamped them. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra BKB's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of Burger King's top franchises. By 2006, the company was valued at over $150million, and was sold to New York-based GSO Capital Partners. Other purchasers included a three-way group <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> athletes Kevin Faulk, Marcus Allen and Michael Strahan who collectively purchased 17 stores in the cities of Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; and Cincinnati-based franchisee Dave Devoy, who purchased 32 AmeriKing stores. After investing in new decor, equipment and staff retraining, many of the formerly failing stores have shown growth upwards of 20 percent.|$|E

He also played for the Frankfurt Galaxy <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> Europe in 2004 and 2007, leading the Galaxy to the World Bowl each year. He earned All-NFL Europa and NFL Europa Co-Offensive MVP honors in 2007. O'Sullivan spent the final season of his professional career as a backup for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the CFL.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee {{offense was}} led by {{freshman}} quarterback Peyton Manning, son <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> great Archie Manning, who had played against the Hokies in the 1968 Liberty Bowl. During the regular season, Peyton played in seven games, winning six of them and completing 86 of his 139 pass attempts for 1,114 yards, 11 touchdowns, and six interceptions. Manning's passer rating of 145.2 was the third-highest among starting quarterbacks in the SEC. In recognition of his achievements, Manning was named the Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year. One of Manning's more prominent passing targets was Billy Williams, who, despite suffering a stress fracture {{in the first game}} of the season, recovered to catch 20 passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns. He also returned 17 kickoffs for an average of 20.8 yards per return. Manning's favorite target was Joey Kent, who caught 36 passes for 470 yards during the regular season, but slightly injured his ankle in a pre-Gator Bowl practice.|$|E
5|$|Villa {{were one}} of the {{founding}} members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season. For the rest of the Nineties however Villa went through three different managers and their league positions were inconsistent, although they did win two League Cups and regularly achieved UEFA Cup qualification. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost 1–0 to Chelsea in the last game to be played at the old Wembley Stadium. Again Villa's league position continued to fluctuate under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when David O'Leary left in acrimony. After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Doug Ellis finally decided to sell his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health. After much speculation it was announced the club was to be bought by American businessman Randy Lerner, owner <b>of</b> <b>NFL</b> franchise the Cleveland Browns.|$|E
