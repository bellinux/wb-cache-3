40|$|Background and Objectives: A {{method was}} {{developed}} and validated for determining 15 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in refined <b>olive</b> and refined <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oils using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector. Materials and Methods: The sample preparation involved liquid–liquid extraction with organic solvent and low temperature clean-up. The low temperature allowed most of the lipids in the extract to be removed. Then alumina-N and NH 2 solid phase extraction cartridges were used for further clean-up. Results: The {{results showed that the}} obtained chromatogram of extract was free of significant interferences. The PAH recoveries ranged from 81 % to 114 %. Limit of detection and limit of quantitation for individual PAHs were 0. 09 - 1. 97 µgkg- 1 and 0. 29 - 5. 99 µgkg- 1, respectively. Conclusions: The performance of the present method was evaluated for determining PAHs in various types of real refined <b>olive</b> and refined <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil samples, and suitable results were obtained.

40|$|SUMMARY. Existing laws in Italy propose <b>olive</b> mill <b>pomaces</b> (OMP), {{produced}} by the two phase system, as a soil amendant. The direct supply of such a raw material poses sorne problems due to the rainy season and its phytotoxicity. The bioremediation of <b>olive</b> mill <b>pomaces</b> can be an useful and economic technology to overcome those backdowns. Composting has been performed in a forced aerated static pile, mixing OMP with chopped wheat straw. During the process moisture content, pH, EC, organic carbon, nitro gen and phytotoxicity were determined. The thermophilic phase lasted 60 days. The phytotoxicity disappeared {{at the end of}} the thermophilic phase. The final product has been examined to determine its physical, chemical and biological characteristics. At the end of the process a C/N = 31 was determined. This high value depends on the presence ofthe grinded stones, hardly to be microbiologically degraded.

50|$|The {{different}} categories of olive oils and <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> oils are named and {{defined in the}} International Agreement and the IOC trade standard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>pomace</b> oil {{is refined}} pomace olive oil often blended with some virgin oil. It is fit for consumption, {{but may not}} be {{described}} simply as olive oil. It has a more neutral flavor than pure or virgin olive oil, making it unfashionable among connoisseurs; however, {{it has the same}} fat composition as regular olive oil, giving it the same health benefits. It also has a high smoke point, and thus is widely used in restaurants as well as home cooking in some countries.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, many efforts {{were focused on}} the {{thermochemical}} transformation of agricultural and industrial residues to generate energy, chemicals or activated carbons. The present study concerns <b>olive</b> <b>pomaces</b> (O. P) materials coming from the Region of Meknès – Tafilalet. These residues result from the olive oil extraction process (pulp and stones). The studied samples are raw and pressed O-P, dried at various temperatures (40 °C- 60 °C- 80 °C) in using thermal solar energy. The physico-chemical characteristics of these samples and of hemicellulose (H.), cellulose (C.) and lignin (L.) compounds are compared, before and after their carbonization. The thermal treatments of such materials lead to chars {{which can be used}} as precursors for the synthesis of activated carbons...|$|R
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) and fluorescence spectroscopy, {{combined with}} chemometric approaches {{have been developed}} to analysis of extra virgin olive oil adulterated with <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil. The measurements were made on pure vegetable oils: extra virgin oil, <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil and that adulterated with varying concentration of <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil. Today, the application of FTIR spectroscopy has increased in food studied, and particularly has become a powerful analytical tool in the study of edible oils and fats. The spectral regions where the variations were observed chosen for developing models and cross validation was used. The synchronous fluorescence spectrometry takes advantage of the hardware capability to vary both the excitation and emission wavelengths during the analysis with constant wavelength difference is maintained between the two. The region between 300 and 400 nm is attributed to the tocopherols and phenols, the derivatives of vitamin E are associated with the region 400 – 600 nm and the bands in the region of 600 – 700 nm are attributed to the chlorophyll and peophytin pigments. The results presented in this study suggest that FTIR and fluorescence may be a useful tool for analysis and detecting adulteration of extra virgin <b>olive</b> oil with <b>pomace</b> oil...|$|R
50|$|Polyphenols, {{especially}} tannins, {{were used}} traditionally for tanning leather and today also as precursors in green chemistry notably to produce plastics or resins by polymerisation {{with or without}} the use of formaldehyde or adhesives for particleboards. The aims are generally to make use of plant residues from grape, <b>olive</b> (called <b>pomaces)</b> or pecan shells left after processing.|$|R
50|$|One very {{important}} aspect of the remit of the IOC is to draw up and update methods of analysis and standards for olive products with a view to promoting international trade and preventing fraud. To do so, it works very closely with leading chemists from its member countries who contribute their knowledge and expertise. It also cooperates with other international organisations such as the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) or the Codex Alimentarius Commission in order to bring their testing methods and standards into line with IOC texts. The IOC has two trade standards, one for olive oils and <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> oils and the other for table olives. The olive oil standard fixes the names and definitions of the different categories of olive oils and <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> oils as well the quality and purity criteria for each grade of product; it specifies testing methods and covers other aspects, such as food additives, contaminants, hygiene, packing, pack fill tolerances and labelling. IOC Members are committed to prohibiting the use of any product names other than those specified in the standard. The table olive standard fixes the names, definitions and requirements for all the different types, styles and trade preparations of table olives.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>pomace</b> oil is {{olive oil}} that is {{extracted}} from olive pulp {{after the first}} press. Once the mechanical oil extraction of olive oil is complete, approximately 5-8% of the oil remains in the pulp, which then needs to be extracted {{with the help of}} solvents, an industrial technique used in the production of most other edible oils including canola, peanut, sunflower, etc. Although the oil extracted in this manner is still olive oil, at retail it may not simply be called “olive oil”. This is because the International Olive Council defines olive oil as “the oil obtained solely from the fruit of the olive tree, to the exclusion of oils obtained using solvents or re-esterification processes” ...|$|E

40|$|With {{starting}} healthy consumption {{awareness in}} people throughout world, olive oil demand has increased {{and it is}} expected that this demand will increase day by day.

Air–steam mixtures are the most commonly used gasification agents. The gasification performances of several biomass samples and their mixtures were compared. One softwood (pine) and one hardwood (chestnut), their torrefied counterparts, and other Spanish-based biomass wastes such as almond shell, olive stone, grape and <b>olive</b> <b>pomaces</b> or cocoa shell were tested, and their behaviors at several different stoichiometric ratios (SR) and steam/air ratios (S/A) were compared.

40|$|<b>Pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil is a {{by-product}} of olive oil extraction that is traditionally produced and consumed in Spain. The nonglyceride matter of this oil is {{a good source of}} interesting minor compounds, like long-chain fatty alcohols, which are present free or as part of waxes. In the present study, long-chain fatty alcohols were isolated from the nonglyceride fraction of <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil, and the composition was identified and quantified. The major components of long-chain fatty alcohols were tetracosanol, hexacosanol and octacosanol. We investigated the ability of long-chain fatty alcohols from <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil to inhibit the release of different proinflammatory mediators in vitro by cells involved in inflammatory processes. Long-chain fatty alcohols significantly and dose-dependently decreased nitric oxide production by RAW 264. 7 murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Western blot analysis showed that nitric oxide reduction was a consequence of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Long-chain fatty alcohols also reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and prostaglandin E 2 production, although the potency of inhibition for the latter was lower. On the other hand, long-chain fatty alcohols significantly reduced thromboxane A 2 production in rat peritoneal neutrophils stimulated with the calcium ionophore A- 23187. The reduction of eicosanoid release was related to the inhibition of phospholipase A 2 enzyme activity by long-chain fatty alcohols, reaching an inhibitory concentration 50 % value of 6. 2 μg/ml. These results showed that long-chain fatty alcohols may have a protective effect on some mediators involved in the inflammatory damage development, suggesting its potential value as a putative functional component of <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil.

Objectives: Actinobacteria isolates were separated from an Algerian soil under <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> cultivation and were evaluated for their lignocellulolytic enzymes production. Materials and Methods: Isolates of Actinobacteria were separated from soils around oil mills using four isolation media, among them three were enriched by <b>olive</b> <b>pomace.</b> The isolates were screened for their cellulolytic, xylanolytic and ligninolytic activities. Isolates with potential of producing lignocellulose-degrading enzymes were selected under submerged fermentation based <b>olive</b> <b>pomace.</b> Results: Ninety isolates of Actinobacteria were separated from soil samples. M 3 medium (raw pomace autoclaved alone) was the best isolation medium (68 strains), whereas, the soil from oil mill with continuous system (S 1) led to separation of 52 strains.

40|$|<b>Olive</b> <b>pomace</b> wastes {{were used}} as {{precursors}} {{for the development of}} new biosorbents for heavy metals. Thermal and/or chemical treatments were addressed in terms of their effects on functional group properties and copper removal. Product development was guided by experimental characterization (potentiometric titrations, IR spectra, copper biosorption, total surface area) and theoretical modeling of acid-base properties. <b>Olive</b> <b>pomace</b> was characterized by negative charge due to dissociation of two weakly acidic sites (carboxylic and phenolic). After thermal treatment, a char-like material was obtained characterized by basic sites with positive charge in the acidic pH range. Copper biosorption properties of this material were improved with respect to <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> due to the binding ability of pyrone-like sites. Both native and carbonized <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> samples were chemically treated by HNO(3). Experimental tests were performed according to factorial designs and analysis of variance was used to evaluate significant effects on copper removal of both oxidant concentration and temperature. Chemical treatment by HNO(3) Of carbonized material developed negatively charged groups in the acidic pH range (carboxylic groups), but presented a decreased copper removal. Chemical treatment by HNO(3) of <b>olive</b> <b>pomace</b> without carbonization gave biosorbents with acid-base properties similar to those of native <b>olive</b> <b>pomace,</b> but with a significant increase of copper biosorption.

40|$|<b>Pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil (POM), {{an olive}} oil subproduct {{traditionally}} used in Spain, {{is a good}} source of minor components from the unsaponifiable fraction such as triterpenoids, mainly in the form of oleanolic acid, which induces vascular protection and vasodilatation. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of long-term intake of diets enriched in POM with high concentration in oleanolic acid on endothelial dysfunction associated to hypertension in small mesenteric arteries (SMA) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). During 12 weeks, rats (six rats per group) were fed either a control 2 % maize oil diet (BD), or high-fat diets containing 15 % refined <b>olive</b> oil (OL), <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil (POM), or <b>pomace</b> <b>olive</b> oil supplemented in oleanolic acid (POMO; up to 800 parts per million). Endothelial and vascular functions were assessed by relaxing or contracting responses to acetylcholine (ACh) or phenylephrine, respectively. The involvement of endothelium-derived relaxing factors in these responses was evaluated. In contrast to BD, SHR fed high-fat diets showed a biphasic response to ACh related to changes in eicosanoid metabolism. POM enhanced the endothelial function in SMA from SHR by increasing the endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF) -type component, whereas administration of POMO resulted in a similar contribution of NO/EDHF in the endothelial response to ACh. The present study shows that despite the lack of changes in blood pressure, consumption of POM improves endothelial function in SMA from SHR by improving the agonist-mediated EDHF/NO response. Thus, triterpenoids confer a protective role to POM against endothelial dysfunction in hypertension.
