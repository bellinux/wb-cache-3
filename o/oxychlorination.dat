40|$|International audienceOne of the {{criteria}} to define {{the market value of}} chromite concentrate is its chromium to iron ratio.

This study investigated the possibility of increasing this ratio through the carbochlorination and the <b>oxychlorination</b> of chromite concentrates. Experiments are carried out up to 1000 °C. The characteristics of samples and reaction products are determined by SEM, XRD and chemical analysis. The carbochlorination of a chromite concentrate at about 600 °C leads to the selective partial elimination of iron allowing a higher Cr/Fe ratio of the treated concentrate. Selective extraction of iron could also be achieved at about 950 °C by <b>oxychlorination.</b> In this case, a part of chromium contained in the concentrate is recovered as chromium oxychloride.

The trichloroethene for this process is produced via the <b>oxychlorination</b> of 1, 2 -dichl~roethane over a supported copper catalyst. Unfortunately, this process currently exhibits relatively poor selectivity towards trichloroethene and results {{in the formation of}} toxic, oligomeric by-products. The current process also produces significant. quantities of CO 2 through combustion ofits chlorocarbon feedstock. In order to understand the ongms of the selectivity of the <b>oxychlorination</b> of 1, 2 dichloroethane, this study has examined the chlorination and <b>oxychlorination</b> of higher chlorocarbons via thermodynamic calculations, eql;lilibrium measurements, and a continuous flow micro-reactor {{in order to understand the}} delicate balance. between the. surface and gas-phase chemistry within the system. It was found that the presence of the catalyst is not necessary to affect the desired chemistry. However, it was found that the presence of the catalyst favoured the formation of pentachloroethane and tetrachloroethene, as well as supplying chlorine via the Deacon process (conversion ofHCl and oxygen to chlorine). Tetrachloroethene was found to be the thermodynamic minimum of the system, with trichloroethene an intermediate in the formation oftetrachloroethene. At low temperatures Ã‚Â« 473 K) and long reaction times (2 h, batch reactor), radical chlorination to form pentachloroethane was the dominant reaction. Increasing the reaction temperature to > 573 K and moving from a batch to continuous system resulted in the loss ofradical chlorination activity for the system, with radical dehydrochlorination to form trichloroethene becoming the dominant reaction. Heterogeneous chlorination was be performed under flow conditions, and was found to provide a route to pentachloroethane and tetrachloroethene from. High conversions were found favour the formation of oligomeric products, and results suggest that trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene may themselves be major sources ofoligomer formation. <b>Oxychlorination</b> reactions using the continuous flow micro-reactor have shown that, for this system, it is possible to explain the observed chemistry by a series of chlorination and dehydrochlorination processes alone, without the need to invoke additional surface processes. Results have shown that the selectivity of the reaction can be manipulated by parameter control, and that, on a laboratory scale at least; the system can be operated with minimal oligimer and CO 2 formation.

The desire {{to move toward}} a sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical industry has lead to interest {{in the use of}} bio-derived feedstocks such as alcohols which are currently being produced on an increasingly large scale by fermentation or from synthesis gas. The research investigated the direct catalytic production of ethylene, acetaldehyde, ethylene dichloride (EDC), and ethylene oxide (EO) from ethanol. Two approaches were considered: a) the use of a bi-functional catalyst that combines the dehydration capability with ethylene conversion and b) the use of a double catalytic bed system where ethanol was dehydrated over the 1 st bed and the product ethylene was converted over the 2 nd bed to yield the desired petrochemical product. The dehydration of ethanol was carried out over several zeolites at different operating temperatures, producing mainly ethylene and diethyl ether. The catalytic selective oxidation of ethanol was tested over silver and/or copper compounds supported on several zeolites. The effects of operating conditions, metal loading, and zeolite acidity were determined. High selectivity to acetaldehyde was achieved. Unfortunately, the direct production of EO from ethanol could not be achieved. The catalytic <b>oxychlorination</b> of ethanol was investigated using CuCl 2 as the active compound and zeolites were used as either a support or as a pre-bed.
