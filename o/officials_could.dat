5|$|Not all slaves had {{the same}} social status. Some slaves of wealthy {{families}} lived better than commoners since {{they were allowed to}} wear luxurious clothes and consume quality food and wine. Slaves of high <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> even be feared and respected. The slaves of regent Huo Guang (d. 68 BCE) sometimes came armed to the marketplace and fought commoners, forced the Imperial Secretary to kowtow and apologize (after a scuffle with his slaves over the right-of-way on the street), and were provided services by some officials who sought a promotion through Huo Guang's influence.|$|E

At that time, $3.8million {{in state}} funding was {{set aside for}} the project, but the Ohio Department of Transportation(ODOT) did not receive the money until2005. By2007, most of the earmarked money was spent on preliminary engineering and planning. Without the money, Morgan Township <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> not afford to upgrade the road, andODOT was barred from spending money on local roads. In2011, deputy director Steve Williams devised a new plan that made the township road a state route, and Morgan Township officials transferred the road to ODOT.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by {{a small minority of}} Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E

5|$|Merit system: The {{earliest}} {{example of}} a merit system {{dates back to the}} Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established during the Three Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The new {{grandstand}} {{was completed}} for $3.6 million in 1993. Since Rosecroft had expanded its simulcasting rights, the new grandstand incorporated large-screen televisions and betting windows. For the 1993 season, Rosecroft's officials {{decided to stop}} hosting the five stake races—The Potomac, the Lady Baltimore, The Terrapan, The Turtle Dove, and The North American—inherited when Freestate Raceway closed. The handle was decreasing, and the <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> not afford the purses for the races. To help increase the handle, Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter-track simulcasting between all Maryland tracks and authorized off-track betting parlors throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|The tea ship Dartmouth {{arrived in}} the Boston Harbor in late November, and Adams wrote a {{circular}} letter calling for a mass meeting {{to be held at}} Faneuil Hall on November 29.

5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined {{together to make a}} map of the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make a map of the hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts). If there was any trouble about the collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or if the question of chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> readily carry out their duties by the aid of the maps.|$|E
5|$|A project {{board was}} {{established}} in January 2009, {{with the objective of}} ensuring the stadium be built by 2012. City councillors approved the outline business case for the stadium in June 2009, meaning <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> start searching for sites. Four sites were put forward to the council in June 2010, and York City favoured the option of building a 6,000 all-seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, to the north of York, on the site of Huntington Stadium, which would be ready by 2014 at the earliest. Mark Stead of The Press noted the advantages of this site, including the potential for land value to include, the opportunity to build health and fitness facilities and commercial interest, and the disadvantages, including a scheduled ancient monument being located on adjacent land and traffic concerns. In July 2010, this location was chosen by the council executive as their preferred option.|$|E
5|$|Although Jinnah {{initially}} opposed separate electorates for Muslims, he {{used this}} means to gain his first elective office in 1909, as Bombay's Muslim representative on the Imperial Legislative Council. He was a compromise candidate when two older, better-known Muslims who were seeking the post deadlocked. The council, {{which had been}} expanded to 60 members as part of reforms enacted by Minto, recommended legislation to the Viceroy. Only <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> vote in the council; non-official members, such as Jinnah, had no vote. Throughout his legal career, Jinnah practised probate law (with many clients from India's nobility), and in 1911 introduced the Wakf Validation Act to place Muslim religious trusts on a sound legal footing under British Indian law. Two years later, the measure passed, the first act sponsored by non-officials to pass the council and be enacted by the Viceroy. Jinnah was also appointed to a committee which helped to establish the Indian Military Academy in Dehra Dun.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an {{outbreak}} of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident. After New Orleans police chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890. After the alleged murderers were found not guilty on March 14, 1891, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven of them. Since many of those killed were Italian citizens the Italian minister, Saverio Fava, protested to Blaine. Blaine explained that federal <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> not control how state officials deal with criminal matters, and Fava announced that he would withdraw the legation back to Italy. Blaine and Harrison believed the Italians' response to be an overreaction, and did nothing. Tensions slowly cooled, and after nearly a year, the Italian minister returned to the United States to negotiate an indemnity. After some internal dispute—Blaine wanted conciliation with Italy, Harrison was reluctant to admit fault—the United States agreed to pay an indemnity of $25,000, and normal diplomatic relations resumed.|$|E
5|$|Bo {{presided over}} a {{continued}} rise in foreign investment in China as Minister of Commerce. His daily schedule was dominated by receiving foreign guests and dignitaries. By {{the time that he}} became Minister, he spoke relatively fluent and colloquial English. During a meeting with American officials, Bo reputedly told a struggling interpreter to stop translating because the Chinese <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> understand English and it was wasting time. In May 2004 Bo {{was one of the few}} ministers hand-picked to accompany Premier Wen Jiabao on a five-country trip to Europe. The trade policy of the United States toward China also sparked significant controversy. Bo maintained a conciliatory but assertive attitude as he attended talks in Washington. On his trips to the United States, he conducted substantive discussions with his American counterparts and signed agreements on intellectual property, the services sector, agricultural products, food safety, and consumer protection.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> not be hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people {{to public service}} careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds and abuse of power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school board members from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.|$|E

5|$|Each {{successive}} rank {{gave its}} holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full marquess, {{came with a}} state pension and a territorial fiefdom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged to the wider commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> be enfeoffed as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves {{as members of a}} larger, nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{few times}} a federal court was asked to {{invalidate}} a law or action on Third Amendment grounds was in Engblom v. Carey (1982). In 1979, prison officials in New York organized a strike; they were evicted from their prison facility residences, which were reassigned to members of the National Guard who had temporarily taken their place as prison guards. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled: (1) that the term owner in the Third Amendment includes tenants (paralleling similar cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, governing search and seizure), (2) National Guard troops count as soldiers {{for the purposes of the}} Third Amendment, and (3) that the Third Amendment is incorporated (that is, that it applies to the states) by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was remanded to the district court, which dismissed the case on the grounds that state <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> not have been aware of this interpretation.|$|E

The fifth was issued against Acting Secretary Nighbert for retaliation against a whistleblower. Only the additional charge against Nighbert was alleged to have occurred after Fletcher issued the pardon. On October 24, 2005, Fletcher filed a motion asking Franklin Circuit Court Judge William Graham to order the grand jury to stop issuing indictments for offenses that occurred prior to the blanket pardon; only the names of indicted <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> {{be included in the}} jury's final report. On November 16, Graham ruled that the grand jury could continue issuing indictments, but in a separate ruling, dismissed the indictments against Fletcher's staff and volunteer advisors on grounds that they were covered by the pardon. Graham did not rule on the latest indictment against Nighbert. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed Graham's ruling on December 16. Immediately after the Court of Appeals' ruling, Fletcher announced his intent to appeal the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1892, as the {{aftershock}} of the stand-off was still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Nate Champion's brother, Dudley Champion, came to Wyoming looking for work before he {{was shot and killed}} in cold blood. Fifteen miles from town, Dudley had come across the ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing the young man, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner's inquiry ruled Shonsey's actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the <b>officials</b> <b>could</b> continue with the investigation. A year before, Shonsey actually met Nate Champion near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Nate suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names {{of the rest of the}} assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Nate and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed who was associated with the Johnson County War.|$|E
