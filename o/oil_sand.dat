25|$|Thermonuclear thinking: The most {{dramatic}} proposal for in situ production from deep <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> deposits came from Richfield Oil Company. In 1959 Richfield suggested an experimental plan to release liquid hydrocarbons from the sand through the expedient of an underground nuclear explosion. The company proposed detonating a 9-kiloton explosive device below the oil sands {{at a site}} 100 kilometres south of Fort McMurray. Thermonuclear heat would create a large underground cavern and simultaneously liquefy the oil. The cavern {{could serve as a}} collection point for the now-fluid oil, enabling the company to produce it.|$|E
25|$|After excavation, {{hot water}} and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) {{is added to the}} sand, and the {{resulting}} slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top. Provided that the water chemistry is appropriate to allow bitumen to separate from sand and clay, the combination of {{hot water and}} agitation releases bitumen from the <b>oil</b> <b>sand,</b> and allows small air bubbles to attach to the bitumen droplets. The bitumen froth floats to the top of separation vessels, and is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids.|$|E

25|$|Coal (by {{liquefaction}} technology) {{is one of}} the backstop {{resources that}} could limit escalation of oil prices and mitigate the effects of transportation energy shortage that will occur under peak oil. This is contingent on liquefaction production capacity becoming large enough to satiate the very large and growing demand for petroleum. Estimates of the cost of producing liquid fuels from coal suggest that domestic U.S. production of fuel from coal becomes cost-competitive with oil priced at around $35 per barrel, with the $35 being the break-even cost. With oil prices as low as around $40 per barrel in the U.S. as of December 2008, liquid coal lost some of its economic allure in the U.S., but will probably be re-vitalized, similar to <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> projects, with an oil price around $70 per barrel.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s Great Canadian Oil Sands, Ltd., a small, {{indigenous}} Canadian firm, {{relied on}} {{new technology and}} heavy capital investment to pioneer <b>oil</b> <b>sand</b> extraction in the Athabascan region. Unfavorable leasing terms from the provincial government and the strong financial risk inherent in the project forced the firm to seek an investment partner. The large American oil company Sun Oil Company took the risk, but as the investment burden on Sun increased, the company became compelled to assume both financial and managerial control of the operation. Thus, the native Canadian firm had to yield its autonomy {{as the price of}} pursuing a pioneering but complicated industrial project. In 1995 Sun sold its interest to Suncor Energy, based in Calgary. Suncor is second to Syncrude in the oil sands, but Syncrude is controlled by a consortium of international oil companies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>sands,</b> as {{unconventional}} <b>oil,</b> are so {{essential to}} both Canada {{and the world}} that special attention should be paid to their extraction status, especially their energy efficiency.
