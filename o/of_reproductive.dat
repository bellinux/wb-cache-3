5|$|Eusociality is {{the highest}} level of social organization. These {{societies}} have an overlap of adult generations, the division <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> labor and cooperative caring of young. Usually insects, such as bees, ants and termites, have eusocial behavior, but it is demonstrated in two rodent species: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat.|$|E
50|$|The {{resource}} allocation of F. truncorum ants {{to the formation}} <b>of</b> new <b>reproductives</b> was compared between monogynous and polygynous colonies by measuring the colony’s productivity and mating structure. Monogynous colonies with a high productivity would have excess resources, and they invested these excess resources into the formation <b>of</b> more <b>reproductives.</b> Monogynous colonies typically had a higher ratio of sexuals per adult worker. When they had excess resources, polygynous colonies did not invest in the formation <b>of</b> more <b>reproductives,</b> indicating that the allocation of resources to the formation <b>of</b> <b>reproductives</b> {{is controlled by the}} workers.|$|R

5|$|Speciation {{requires}} a degree <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> isolation—that is, {{a reduction in}} gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the heterozygote would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-throated blue warbler}} uses social cues in its {{evaluation}} and choice of nesting sites. In particular, it listens to the post-breeding songs given out by other males. These songs have strong temporal dependencies. Males sing {{at the beginning and}} the peak of breeding season, but songs are not indicative <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> success. Near the end of a breeding season, a male that has successfully mated continues to sing while a male that has failed to reproduce abandons the habitat. Therefore, post-breeding songs are reliable indicators <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> success within the particular habitat and convey essential information to the natal and breeding dispersers. In comparison to the traditional idea of direct assessment of the vegetation structure, the vocal cue is much more efficient and easier to obtain, hence revealing the advantage of social communication in survival and reproduction. A female, however, does not respond to post-breeding songs directly. Instead, she is likely to rely on the presence of males in deciding nesting sites.|$|E
40|$|Soldier caste is {{the oldest}} altruistic caste in termites, highly {{specialized}} for defensive tasks. Therefore, a number of adaptations in anatomy and behaviour {{can be observed in}} soldier, lacking in other termite castes. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the hypothesis that in disturbed groups the soldiers will prefer to stand by and defend the reproductives, the most valuable individuals. Therefore, I studied in two species of the genus Prorhinotermes (P. simplex and P. canalifrons) the ability of soldiers to discriminate neotenic reproductives and provide them with defence. In agreement with the initial hypothesis, the soldiers of both species prooved to be able of an instantaneous recognition <b>of</b> <b>reproductives</b> and remained close to them. In P. simplex, the neotenic female was the most attractive individual, while in P. canalifrons, neotenics of both sexes were equally attractive. The observed preference <b>of</b> <b>reproductives</b> appears to occur only with a certain age <b>of</b> the <b>reproductives</b> in incipient colonies, along with their sexual maturation. Caste specificity of cuticular lipids supports the presumption that the caste recognition is based on olphactoric cues in the cuticle <b>of</b> <b>reproductives...</b>|$|R

40|$|The sex-specific effects <b>of</b> <b>reproductives</b> and <b>of</b> {{soldiers}} on the reproductivity (i. e., tendency to develop into replacement <b>reproductives)</b> <b>of</b> pseudergates of Zootermopsis nevadensis were studied. Reproductives inhibit reproductivity in pseudergates of their own sex only. Reproductives neither inhibit nor stimulate reproductivity in pseudergates of the opposite sex. Reproductives do not require the presence <b>of</b> a <b>reproductive</b> <b>of</b> the opposite sex to stimulate them to inhibit reproductivity in pseudergates. Soldiers {{had no effect on}} the reproductivity of pseudergates. The effects of group size and of the presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>reproductives</b> on the development of last-stage nymphs of Z. nevadensis were studied. The size of experimental groups had no effect on the rates of stationary molts or alate molts, suggesting that the correlation between colony size and the onset of alate production in nature may be spurious. The presence or absence <b>of</b> <b>reproductives</b> had no effect on the rate of stationary molts or alate molts, suggesting that in Z. nevadensis neither group size nor the presence <b>of</b> <b>reproductives</b> has any direct effect on alate determination. It is suggested that in Z. nevadensis a form of nutritional castration can delay the onset of alate development; that is to say, that the onset of alate development is determined by the ratio of nutrient-gathering castes to nutrient-receiving castes in the colony. I have found what I believe to be an extraordinary example of deception in Z. nevadensis and Zootermopsis angusticollis. This is the first reported example of caste mimicry in a social insect, and may explain why supernumerary replacement reproductives are common in Z. nevadensis and Z. angusticollis but not in Zootermopsis laticeps. The compositions of 41 field-collected colonies of Zootermopsis were given and the data were analyzed for trends. Most notably, supernumerary replacement reproductives were common in Z. nevadensis and in Z. angusticollis but have never been found in Z. laticeps, by us or by anybody else. These findings are in accordance with our hypothesis of "caste mimicry" in Z. nevadensis and Z. angusticollis...|$|R

5|$|Stony corals {{have a great}} range <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> {{strategies}} and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having {{both male and female}} gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, sexual reproduction results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> strategies. Most use {{external}} fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A small percentage of teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} found in several microhabitats, but most often on rocks. Although {{predominantly}} ground-dwelling, {{it is a good}} climber. Nothing is known about its reproduction except that skinks studied in late October and early November, during the dry season, showed little evidence <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> activity. The Noronha skink is oviparous (egg-laying), like many Trachylepis, but unlike Mabuya, which are all viviparous (giving live birth).|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws become {{sexually mature}} {{in their second}} year. Genetic {{analysis}} of pairs and offspring shows no evidence of extra-pair copulation {{and there is little}} evidence for couple separation even after multiple instances <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> failure. Some pairs do separate in the first few months, but almost all pairings of over six months' duration are lifelong, ending only when a partner dies. Widowed or separated birds fare badly, often being ousted from nests or territories and unable to rear broods alone.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with {{multiple}} females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that {{are unable to}} claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E

5|$|In The American Species of Crepis, Babcock and Stebbins {{described}} {{the concept of}} the polyploid complex, and its role in plant evolution. Some genera, such as Crepis, have a complex <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> forms that center on sexually diploid populations that have also given rise to polyploid ones. Babcock and Stebbins also observed that allopolyploid types formed from the hybridization of two different species always have a wider distribution than diploid or autotetraploid species, and proposed that polyploids formed through hybridization have a greater potential to exploit varied environments, because they inherit all traits from both parents. They also showed that hybridization in the polyploid complex could provide a mechanism for genetic exchange between diploid species that were otherwise unable to breed. Their observations offered insight into species formation and knowledge of how all these complex processes could provide information on the history of a genus. This monograph was described by Swedish botanist Åke Gustafsson as the most important work on the formation of species during that period.|$|E
5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> success, especially in harems where one or a few males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of}} them would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} <b>of</b> the <b>reproductive</b> {{system is}} strictly hermaphroditic.

5|$|Like Bakerian mimicry, Dodsonian mimicry {{is a form}} <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> floral mimicry, but {{the model}} belongs to a {{different}} species than the mimic. The name refers to Calaway H. Dodson. By providing similar sensory signals as the model flower, it can lure its pollinators. Like Bakerian mimics, no nectar is provided. Epidendrum ibaguense (Orchidaceae) resembles flowers of Lantana camara and Asclepias curassavica, and is pollinated by monarch butterflies and perhaps hummingbirds. Similar cases are seen in some other species of the same family. The mimetic species may still have pollinators of its own though. For example, a lamellicorn beetle, which usually pollinates correspondingly colored Cistus flowers, is also known to aid in pollination of Ophrys species that are normally pollinated by bees.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the milk}} shark is viviparous; females {{usually have a}} single {{functional}} ovary (on the left) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo. The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range. Females generally produce young every year, though some give birth every other year or even every third year. Mating and parturition take place in spring or early summer (April to July) off western and southern Africa, and in winter off India, Alternately, off Oman parturition occurs year-round with a peak in spring. Parturition also occurs continuously in Australian waters; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay, the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July. One proposed explanation for the lack <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and/or more complex reproductive cycle than has been detected (such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development, though there is presently no evidence of this occurring). Females do not store sperm internally.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause <b>of</b> <b>reproductive</b> isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
