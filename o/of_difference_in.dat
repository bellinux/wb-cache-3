25|$|Advise and Consent is a 1959 {{political}} {{novel by}} Allen Drury that explores the United States Senate confirmation of controversial Secretary of State nominee Robert Leffingwell, {{who was a}} member of the Communist Party. The novel spent 102 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1960 and was adapted into a successful 1962 film starring Henry Fonda. It was followed by Drury's A Shade <b>of</b> <b>Difference</b> <b>in</b> 1962, and four additional sequels.|$|E
25|$|Aparoksha Anubuti and Atmabodha {{are also}} {{attributed}} to Shankara, as his original philosophical treatises, {{but this is}} doubtful. Paul Hacker has also expressed some reservations that the compendium Sarva-darsana-siddhanta Sangraha was completely authored by Shankara, because <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> style and thematic inconsistencies in parts. Similarly, Gayatri-bhasya is doubtful to be Shankara's work. Other commentaries that are highly unlikely to be Shankara's work include those on Uttaragita, Siva-gita, Brahma-gita, Lalita-shasranama, Suta-samhita and Sandhya-bhasya. The commentary on the Tantric work Lalita-trisati-bhasya attributed to Adi Shankara is also unauthentic.|$|E

25|$|The Italian cuisine has {{developed}} through centuries {{of social and}} political changes, with roots {{as far back as the}} 4th century BC. Italian cuisine in itself takes heavy influences, including Etruscan, ancient Greek, ancient Roman, Byzantine, and Jewish. Significant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World with the introduction of items such as potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers and maize, now central to the cuisine but not introduced in quantity until the 18th century.

25|$|One of {{the lines}} <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> {{interpretation}} is whether to treat the regressors as random variables, or as predefined constants. In the first case (random design) the regressors xi are random and sampled together with the yis from some population, as in an observational study. This approach allows for more natural study of the asymptotic properties of the estimators. In the other interpretation (fixed design), the regressors X are treated as known constants set by a design, and y is sampled conditionally on the values of X as in an experiment. For practical purposes, this distinction is often unimportant, since estimation and inference is carried out while conditioning on X. All results stated {{in this article are}} within the random design framework.|$|E
25|$|Because most if not {{all stars}} form clustered, star {{clusters}} are to be viewed the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The violent gas-expulsion events that shape and destroy many star clusters at birth leave their imprint in the morphological and kinematical structures of galaxies. Most open clusters form with at least 100 stars and a mass of 50 or more solar masses. The largest clusters can have 104 solar masses, with the massive cluster Westerlund 1 being estimated at 5 × 104 solar masses; close to that of a globular cluster. While open clusters and globular clusters form two fairly distinct groups, there may not be a great deal <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> appearance between a very sparse globular cluster and a very rich open cluster. Some astronomers believe the two types of star clusters form via the same basic mechanism, with the difference being that the conditions that allowed the formation of the very rich globular clusters containing hundreds of thousands of stars no longer prevail in the Milky Way.|$|E

500|$|Parsons and Parsons {{have shown}} that {{juvenile}} and sub-adult specimens of Deinonychus display some morphological differences with the adults. For instance, {{the arms of the}} younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of the adults, a possible indication <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> behavior between young and adults. Another example of this could be the function of the pedal claws. Parsons and Parsons have suggested that the claw curvature (which Ostrom [...] had already shown was different between specimens) maybe was greater for juvenile Deinonychus, as this could help it climb in trees, and that the claws became straighter as the animal became older and started to live solely on the ground. This was based on the hypothesis that some small dromaeosaurids used their pedal claws for climbing. In a 2015 paper, they reported after further analysis of immature fossils that the open and mobile nature of the shoulder joint might have meant that young Deinonychus were capable of some form of flight.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{chosen a}} club and stroke {{to produce the}} desired distance, the player {{addresses}} the ball by taking their stance {{to the side of}} it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club behind the ball. The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single [...] "plane" [...] of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.|$|E
2500|$|According to Comfort, 49 and 65 {{came from}} the same manuscript. Both manuscripts have the same measurements, and the same number of lines per page. Both were written by a {{documentary}} hand, both manifest the same formation of certain letters, such as titled lambda, titled sigma, extended iota, and toiled ypsilon. The nomina sacra and abbreviations are written in the same rather unusual way. Bradford Welles remarks that [...] "there is not a single case <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the letter shapes in the two papyri". Neither use ligatures. The only difference is in the number of letters per line: 65 has more letters per line (42). The same situation exists in Papyrus 75. The scribe of 75 appears to have realized that he was running out of room in his codex and added three letters in each line and even added extra lines. The manuscript {{may be one of the}} earliest manuscripts to display a complete Pauline codex, along with Papyrus 13, Papyrus 15/Papyrus 16, Papyrus 30, Papyrus 46, and Papyrus 92.|$|E
2500|$|Those {{familiar}} with Japanese writing may notice {{that most of}} the differences apply to words which are usually written in Kanji anyway, and so would require no changes to switch from one Kana system to another (unless furigana are employed). [...] In particular, yōon sounds occur almost exclusively in the Chinese-derived readings that are usually only seen in Kanji compounds (although not entirely; [...] kyō [...] "today," [...] written [...] kefu in the old system, is a native Japanese word), and therefore do not look any different (without furigana). [...] The relative lack <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> appearance in practice between the two systems was a major reason the spelling reform succeeded, and also why the three grammatical particles o, e, wa continue to be written as [...] wo, [...] he, and [...] ha instead of [...] o, [...] e, and [...] wa; [...] many felt that changing these exceedingly common spellings would unnecessarily confuse readers. [...] It is also for this reason that many character dictionaries continue to include the historical spellings, since they are relevant there.|$|E

2500|$|... “Bakhtin’s life {{work can}} be {{understood}} as a critique of the monologization of the human experience that he perceived in the dominant linguistic, literary, philosophical, and political theories of his time." [...] True to his roots of social constructionism and post-modernism Bakhtin “was critical of efforts to reduce the unfinalizable, open, and multivocal process of meaning-making in determinate, closed, totalizing ways." [...] According to Bakhtin, the meaning found in any dialogue is unique to the sender and recipient based upon their personal understanding of the world as influenced by the socio-cultural background. “Bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space for communication scholars to conceive <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> new ways” meaning they must take the background of a subject into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text as “a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience." [...] Kim argues that “his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of Clifford Geertz’s theories on culture." [...] Culture and communication become inextricably linked to one another as one’s understanding, according to Bakhtin, of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon their culture background and experience.|$|E
2500|$|The {{political}} change {{did not immediately}} change social circumstances. With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed. With limited franchise, the UK National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) pivoted into a new organization, the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), which still advocated for equality in franchise, but extended its scope to examine equality in social and economic areas. Legislative reform was sought for discriminatory laws (e.g., family law and prostitution) and over the differences between equality and equity, the accommodations that would allow women to overcome barriers to fulfillment (known in later years as the [...] "equality vs. difference conundrum"). Eleanor Rathbone, who became a British Member of Parliament in 1929, succeeded Millicent Garrett as president of NUSEC in 1919. She expressed the critical need for consideration <b>of</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> gender relationships as [...] "what women need to fulfill the potentialities of their own natures". The 1924 Labour government's social reforms created a formal split, as a splinter group of strict egalitarians formed the Open Door Council in May 1926. This eventually became an international movement, and continued until 1965. Other important social legislation of this period included the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 (which opened professions to women), and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1923. In 1932, NUSEC separated advocacy from education, and continued the former activities as the National Council for Equal Citizenship and the latter as the Townswomen's Guild. The council continued {{until the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E
