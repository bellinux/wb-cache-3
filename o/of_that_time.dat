5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and the Count was leading military engagements for most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> He played a decisive role in saving {{the provincial capital}} from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key foothold. In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E
5|$|After he {{declined}} offers {{to pursue a}} professional playing career, Ward coached the game for 22years. Most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> was spent as an assistant coach, and he served in that capacity at Maryland from 1952 to 1957, Oklahoma from 1957 to 1958, Iowa State from 1958 to 1965, and Army in 1966. At the United States Military Academy, Ward enjoyed the strictly regimented environment, and the players appreciated his aggressiveness.|$|E

The winner was a black and tan terrier named Trimmer, with a line-up of notable dogs {{in the history of the}} Fox Terrier including Mr. Murchison's Old Trap; Mr. W.J. Harrison's Jocko; Mr. F Sale's Tyrant, Hornet and Tartar; the Marquis of Huntly's Bounce; Mr. Bewley and Mr. Carson's Quiz; and Mr. W. Gammon's Chance.

5|$|Boniface {{clashed with}} Henry's half-brothers, the Lusignans, {{who arrived in}} England in 1247 and competed for lands and {{promotions}} with the queens' Savoy relatives. Boniface's quarrel with Aymer de Valence over a hospital in Southwark led to the archbishop's palace at Lambeth being plundered and one of Boniface's functionaries being kidnapped. The dispute with Aymer was only settled in early 1253. Boniface was once more absent from England from October 1254 to November 1256, and spent most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> in Savoy where he attempted to help his brothers rescue their eldest brother Thomas who was being held captive at Turin.|$|E

In 1982, future manager David Jeffrey joined the club following {{a stint in}} the Manchester United youth team and played for Coyle under many of his trophy successes, captaining the side for much <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> One of Coyle's biggest achievements as manager was leading the club to six consecutive league titles between 1981–82 and 1986–87, equalling the record for the most consecutive titles which was set by Belfast Celtic in 1947–48. 1986 was the year that Noel Bailie began what {{would turn out to be}} a 25-year career at the club. Although a defender for most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> Bailie began as a left midfielder.|$|E

5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E

5|$|George Mason {{began to}} build his home, Gunston Hall, likely {{beginning}} in 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America {{for the use of}} local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason was proud of the gardens which still surround the house.
