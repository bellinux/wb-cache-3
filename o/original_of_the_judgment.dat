International Review of Law and Economics, 6, 45 - 58] <b>original</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> proof problem treats {{costs of}} care to prevent {{accidents}} as non-monetary. Noting {{that this is}} unrealistic when injurers are firms, several authors have found that with monetary care costs, some judgment-proof firms perversely take excess rather than insufficient care. In this paper, we make explicit the quite specific assumptions required for the excess-care result to arise even in theory, and demonstrate that, even under these assumptions, the result {{is likely to be}} quantitatively unimportant. We also suggest an alternative model that, while treating care costs as monetary, avoids <b>the</b> excess-care result. <b>Judgment</b> proof problem Strict liability Industrial accidents Bankruptcy...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} <b>the</b> present status <b>of</b> weblogs {{and examines}} whether legal standards applicable to traditional press and media {{should be applied}} to that specific forum. The analysis is based on two key documents: the Draft Report on the concentration and pluralism in the media in European Union (2007 / 2253 (INI)) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Parliament Committee on Culture and Education presented in March 2008 and a landmark decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish Supreme Court from July 26, 2007 (IV KK 174 / 07) in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> present judicial tendency in other European countries.  The first <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mentioned documents calls for <b>the</b> “clarification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal status <b>of</b> different categories of weblog authors and publishers as well as disclosure of interests and voluntary labelling of weblogs”. It emphasizes that the “undetermined and unindicated status of authors and publishers of weblogs causes uncertainties regarding impartiality, reliability, source protection, applicability of ethical codes and <b>the</b> assignment <b>of</b> liability in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> lawsuits”. <b>The</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Parliament, expressed in the document, raises serious questions on <b>the</b> limits <b>of</b> freedom of thought and speech on the Internet and on <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> acceptable state control. A recent Polish Supreme Court decision, which caused quite a stir in the Polish Internet community, seems to head in the very direction recommended by the EP Culture Committee. In a case of two editors of a web journal (“czasopismo internetowe”) called “Szyciepoprzemysku”, available on-line, accused of publishing a journal without the proper registration, the Polish Supreme Court stated that “journals and periodicals do not lose <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> a press release due solely {{to the fact that}} they appear in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> an  Internet transmission”, and that ‘’the publishing of press in an electronic form, available on the Internet, requires  registration”. The decision was most surprising, as prior lower courts decisions declined the possibility to register Internet periodicals.  The accused were acquitted in <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitutional principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rule <b>of</b> law (art. 7 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish Constitution) and the ensuing obligation to protect <b>the</b> trust <b>of</b> a citizen to the state (a conviction in this case would break the collateral estoppel rule), however the decision quickly awoke media frenzy and raised <b>the</b> fear <b>of</b> a need to register all websites that were regularly updated. <b>The</b> spokesman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish Supreme Court later explained that <b>the</b> sentence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court was not intended to cause a mass registration of all Internet “periodicals” and that neither weblogs nor Internet sites, that were regularly updated, needed registration. Such an interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish press law did not appear clear based only on <b>the</b> <b>original</b> text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> and <b>the</b> decision as such still raises serious practical questions.  The article aims to examine <b>the</b> status <b>of</b> Internet logs as press and seeks the compromise between the concerns expressed by European authorities and <b>the</b> freedom <b>of</b> thought and speech exercised on the Internet...|$|R
