40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{approach}} to implement the 3 D visualization of oil spill based on tidal hydrodynamic model. It simulates tidal current of M 2 component tide in Jiaozhou Bay. The simulation results conform to the tidal theory and probablyconform to the flow measurement report of crude <b>oil</b> <b>pier</b> PhaseIII at Qingdao Harbor. Based on tidal current and eye-pointrelated adaptive ocean surface mesh model, by analyzing thedrift and diffusion mathematical models of oil spill on the sea, thedynamic visualization of drift and diffusion course of oil on thesea were implemented, the visualization result is satisfactory...|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} three liquid {{cargo-handling}} berths (<b>oil</b> <b>piers),</b> two ship repair jetties and a shipyard and engineering facility. The shipyard carries out shipbuilding and repair for both commercial and military customers on a 29-hectare (70 acres) site at the West Wharf. The facilities include a large shipbuilding hall, three shipbuilding berths, two dry-docks and three foundries.|$|R

50|$|Just {{before the}} turn of the 20th century, oil was {{discovered}} at the Summerland Oil Field, and the region along the beach east of Santa Barbara sprouted numerous <b>oil</b> derricks and <b>piers</b> for drilling offshore. This was the first offshore oil development in the world; oil drilling offshore would become a contentious practice in the Santa Barbara area, which continues to the present day.|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the feasibility of}} a special floating pier {{at the port of}} Caripito. This port, located along the Rio San Juan, is the port of embarkment for many oil fields in north-east Venezuela. A few years ago some dolphins at the port collapsed. These problems are mainly caused by river bank slidings. As a result one pier has not been used since. In this situation a floating pier might offer some interesting advantages: - the pier itself it not affected by river bank slidings; - meander processes can change the course of a river. If the pier can not be used at it's original place anymore, it can be moved to another; - the pier and the tanker follow the tide together. Loading operations are influenced less; - the pier can be build off site, at a place where work conditions are optimized. It is finally floated and transported to the right location. Until today floating piers have served at many cargo ports. Generally these cargo piers are very large. On the other hand conventional oil piers always have a small loading platform. It is mainly used to support the oil pipes which lead to the tanker. A floating <b>oil</b> <b>pier</b> can only be economically competitive if it is small too. A small floating platform can be displaced easily. This study will evaluate a new type of floating pier, which utilizes this ability: When the tanker has arrived, then it's head and stern mooring lines are fastened to buoys. Next the spring lines are fastened to the small floating platform. The tanker's winches pull the platform to it's hull. Now the oil loading process can be executed. Finally the platform is withdrawn towards the river bank and the tanker leaves the pier. Different aspects of the platform are investigated. The construction itself, it's stability, the wind and current forces on the tanker and on the platform, the resulting displacements of the tanker and the magnitude of the breasting energy. Unfortunately it must be concluded that the piers at the port of Caripito do not provide enough space. Nevertheless the movable platform will offer an interesting alternative when it is used in an area which provides more space than the Rib San Juan. It's main advantages are: - the tanker berths at some distance of the platform. This can be done in relatively bad weather conditions (e. g. with hardly any sight, strong winds). Tugs can be needed less or not at all; - tankers of any size can be served. The dimensions of the platform construct i on are not related {{to the size of the}} tanker nor to any forces on it. The platform can be used at a port where the size of the tankers might increase in the future; - the platform can be installed quickly (this might also be interesting for military operations).

50|$|A {{cofferdam}} (also {{called a}} coffer) is an enclosure built within, or in pairs across, {{a body of}} water and constructed to allow the enclosed area to be pumped out. This pumping creates a dry work environment for the major work to proceed. Enclosed coffers are commonly used for construction and repair of <b>oil</b> platforms, bridge <b>piers</b> and other support structures built within or over water. These cofferdams are usually welded steel structures, with components consisting of sheet piles, wales, and cross braces. Such structures are typically dismantled after the ultimate work is completed.|$|R

500|$|HMS Warrior {{joined the}} Channel Fleet in July 1862 and {{was placed in}} {{ordinary}} from 1864 to 1867, during which time she was refitted. The ship rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1867 and towed a floating drydock to Bermuda in 1869 with her sister Black Prince. Warrior was placed in ordinary again from 1872 to 1875 and was modified with a poop deck. She was recommissioned into the 1st Class Reserve in 1875 and made periodic training cruises until 1883. The ship was formally reclassified as an armoured frigate in 1884, but was disarmed and mastless. Warrior was hulked as a depot ship in Portsmouth Harbor in 1902 and renamed Vernon III in 1904 when she became part of , the Royal Navy's Torpedo School. The ship regained her original name in 1923 and was converted once more into an <b>oil</b> pipeline <b>pier</b> in 1927. Warrior was towed to Pembroke Dock in 1929 and was renamed C77 in 1942 to release her name for the new aircraft carrier [...] In 1979 C77 was moved to Hartlepool and was restored as HMS Warrior (1860) as the Fleet Headquarters in Northwood, London had assumed the name of HMS Warrior in the early 1960s. The ironclad can now be seen near [...] at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard.|$|R
5000|$|Naka Ward {{is located}} in eastern Kanagawa Prefecture, and east of the {{geographic}} {{center of the city}} of Yokohama. Its name means [...] "central ward." [...] In the low-lying Northern district, commonly referred to as Kannai, it hosts the Yokohama city hall and the headquarters of the Kanagawa prefectural government. The central part of the ward includes elevated ground; this area, known as Yamate, and has long been a residential area. Along the shore lies reclaimed land upon which port facilities, part of the Minato Mirai 21 complex, and Yamashita Park were built. To the south are the <b>piers,</b> <b>oil</b> refineries and the central port of Yokohama. The Nakamura River, a branch of the Ōoka River, cuts across {{the northern part of the}} ward. The northernmost and southernmost points are upland.|$|R
500|$|Most of the city's {{landmarks}} {{and tourist}} attractions {{are related to}} its naval history. Among the attractions are the D-Day Museum and the adjacent Overlord embroidery in Southsea, which was awarded a grant of £4 million by the Heritage Lottery Fund to expand it in time for 2019. The museum's embroidery is [...] long, making it the longest {{of its kind in}} the world. The city is home to some famous ships: in the dry dock of Portsmouth Historic Dockyard lies Horatio Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory, the world's oldest naval ship still in commission. HMS Victory was preserved for the nation and placed in permanent dry dock in 1922, when the Society for Nautical Research led a national appeal to restore her. 22million people have visited her since. In 1971, the remains of Henry VIII's flagship, the Mary Rose, was rediscovered on the seabed. She was raised and brought into a purpose-built structure in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard in 1982. Britain's first iron-hulled warship, HMS Warrior, was restored and moved to Portsmouth in June 1987 after serving as an <b>oil</b> fuel <b>pier</b> at Pembroke Dock in Pembrokeshire for fifty years. The National Museum of the Royal Navy is also in the historic dockyard, and is sponsored by an independent charity which aims to promote research into the history and archaeology of the Royal Dockyard. Every November the Historic Dockyard hosts the Victorian Festival of Christmas, which features a traditional green-coloured Father Christmas.|$|R
40|$|The United States Coast Guard is {{developing}} AIREYE, an all weather, day/night airborne surveillance system, for installation aboard future medium range surveillance aircraft. As {{part of this}} program, a series of controlled tests were conducted off southern California to evaluate the oil slick detection capabilities of two Motorola developed, side looking radars. The systems, a real aperture AN/APS- 94 D and a synthetic aperture coherent on receive (COR) were flown over the Santa Barbara Channel on May 19, 1976. Targets imaged during the coincident overflights included natural oil seepage, simulated oil spills, <b>oil</b> production platforms, <b>piers,</b> mooring buoys, commercial boats and barges at other targets. Based on an analysis of imagery from the coincident radar runs, COR provides better detection of natural and man made oil slicks, whereas the AN/APS- 94 D consistently exhibited higher surface target detection results. This and other tests have shown that active microwave systems have considerable potential for aiding in the detection and analysis of surface oil accumulations...|$|R
