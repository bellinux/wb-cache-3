5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been {{familiar}} with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in Southern Europe, although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

5|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> for the 60 Minutes reports plus further {{investigation}} on his own, Thompson wrote A Glimpse of Hell. The {{book was published}} by W. W. Norton & Company. Thompson's book was extremely critical {{of most of the}} Navy personnel involved in the investigation, concluding that the Navy had orchestrated a cover-up to conceal the true cause of the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Between April and May 1996, Hoffman {{appeared}} at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in a Mark Wing-Davey production of Caryl Churchill's The Skriker. Following this, based <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> in Scent of a Woman, he was cast by writer–director Paul Thomas Anderson to appear in his debut feature Hard Eight (1996). Hoffman had only a brief role in the crime thriller, playing a cocksure young craps player, but it began the most important collaboration of his career.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the 150th {{anniversary of}} his birth was celebrated with events and {{exhibitions}} at the Universities of Dundee and St Andrews; the main lecture theatre in the University of Dundee's Tower Building was renamed in his honour, a publication exploring his work in Dundee {{and the history of}} his Zoology Museum was published by University of Dundee Museum Services, and an exhibition <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> was held in the city.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, audiences {{had a very}} {{different}} take <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b> Many perceived it as a subversive and Marxist satire on American capitalism. If not subversive, {{it was at least}} considered a Marxist critique of pop culture. Given Warhol's apolitical outlook in general this is not likely the intended message. It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E

5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate a bishop to carry <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> after his death.

5|$|The illustration—humorously {{depicting}} New Yorkers' self-image {{of their}} place in the world, or perhaps outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright Steinberg held <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

He scored 105 in his first innings for his country, in a victory over Auckland. Booth scored 184 runs at 30.66 and took three wickets at 25.00 in the four international matches against New Zealand. Booth considered retiring after the season, feeling that the time needed for first-class cricket was impinging <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> as a lay preacher and a Christian youth worker.|$|E
5|$|Case Closed was {{conceived}} in 1994, during {{the rise of}} mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the Kindaichi Case Files series; the first chapter appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday on January 19. Aoyama cites the stories of Arsène Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b> When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones. Each case spans several chapters (except {{for a handful of}} shorter cases that only span one), and is resolved at the end where characters explain the details of their solutions in simple terms; a database consisting of all the cases from the manga was launched in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} very fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b> After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{constitutional}} convention, {{it appeared that}} Garrard's political career was drawing to a close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> in the Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county {{in the state legislature}} in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Graysmith {{first met}} Fischer and Vanderbilt at {{the premiere of}} Paul Schrader's film, Auto Focus, {{which was based on}} Graysmith's 1991 book about {{the life and death of}} actor Bob Crane. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked when they became {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project and moved on to Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's book {{sales were}} higher than ever, and {{translations}} were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> appearing in France-Observateur, The Listener, and Times Literary Supplement. Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, Le Monde de Tintin ("The World of Tintin"), published by Gallimard; Hergé vetoed {{the inclusion of a}} proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of The Adventures of Tintin were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin. Two live-action films were also produced, Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.|$|E

5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. Darwinism was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, an {{important}} {{year of his}} life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting Florence, San Gimignano, Volterra, Siena, and Ravello. In the same year he traveled through Spain, visiting Madrid, Toledo, and Granada. He {{was impressed by the}} Italian countryside, and in Granada by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra. The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation, and became a powerful influence <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{ordered a}} hearing for 22 January 1772. Following an adjournment, {{the case was}} not heard until 7 February 1772. In the meantime, the case had {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention in the press, and members of the public were forthcoming with donations to fund lawyers for both sides of the argument. An activist layman, Granville Sharp, who continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, was Somersett's real backer. When the case was heard, no fewer than five advocates appeared for the slave, speaking at three separate hearings between February and May. These lawyers included William Davy SL, John Glynn SL, James Mansfield and Francis Hargrave, who was later to become a noted barrister based <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> in this case. Charles Stewart was represented by John Dunning and James Wallace.|$|E
