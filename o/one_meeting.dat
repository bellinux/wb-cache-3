5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During <b>one</b> <b>meeting,</b> a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter.|$|E
5|$|At <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> in October 1853, {{he shared}} the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E

5|$|Josephine toured Britain in 1870, {{travelling}} 3,700 {{miles to}} attend 99 {{meetings in the}} course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Josephine gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> pimps threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{is based}} in three {{different}} cities with numerous buildings. A protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam requires that 12 plenary sessions be held in Strasbourg (none in August but two in September), which is the Parliament's official seat, while extra part sessions as well as committee meetings are held in Brussels. Luxembourg hosts the Secretariat of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only assembly {{in the world with}} more than <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> place {{and one of the few}} that does not have the power to decide its own location.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{introduction}} of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the route's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by way of the turntable at Quainton Road. The 3rd Duke of Buckingham chaired the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway but its management regarded the Tramway as a nuisance. In the 1870s it charged disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. Relations deteriorated between Jones and J.G. Rowe, Secretary and Traffic Manager of the A The A's trains at Quainton Road would miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped to Quainton to become unsellable, to the extent that Jones began unloading milk at Waddesdon and shipping it to Aylesbury by road. Although Jones asked the Duke to intervene relations remained poor; in 1888 Rowe blocked the telegraph along the Tramway, and in <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> Jones and Rowe threatened violence.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{establishment}} of the boards of commissioners in Hanley and Burslem, no further changes occurred until the 1830s when passing of the Reform Act 1832 (2 & 3 Will. IV. c.45) sparked renewed interest in incorporation. The act created the parliamentary borough of Stoke-upon-Trent, which would elect two members to Parliament. Together with Stoke-upon-Trent itself, the parliamentary borough also comprised Hanley, Shelton, Lane End, Fenton, Burslem, Tunstall, Rushton Grange, and the hamlet of Sneyd. The significance of the act was {{that for the first time}} and for one important reason only, through the election of Members of Parliament, the townships of the Potteries effectively became one. Shortly after the Reform Act came into effect, a Municipal Corporations Bill was introduced which proposed that the new parliamentary boroughs should be granted charters of incorporation. The bill failed with the prorogation of that Parliament, while the Potteries were excluded from the reforms of the later Municipal Corporations Act 1835 (5 & 6 Wm. IV. c.76). Interest in incorporation was sufficient for several meetings on the subject to take place; the Staffordshire Advertiser reported after <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> in Burslem that incorporation would lead to one town having undue influence over the others, a theme that was to recur for many years. The same meeting revisited a topic raised pre–1820, the promotion of law and order in the Potteries, and called for the appointment of a stipendiary magistrate.|$|E

Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital, Stoke Newington, in 1938, and remained there until she died.

25|$|The Reformation in Switzerland {{began in}} 1523, led by Huldrych Zwingli, priest of the Great Minster church in Zürich since 1518. Zürich adopted the Protestant religion, joined by Berne, Basel, and Schaffhausen, while Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Nidwalden, Zug, Fribourg and Solothurn {{remained}} Catholic. Glarus and Appenzell were split. This led to multiple inter-cantonal religious wars (Kappeler Kriege) in 1529 and 1531, because each canton usually made the opposing religion illegal, {{and to the}} formation of two diets, the Protestant <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> in Aarau and the Catholic one in Lucerne (as well as the formal full diet still meeting usually in Baden) but the Confederation survived.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Boys had <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> with Napoleon {{though there is}} no {{documentary}} evidence of it having taken place. When Cipriani, Napoleon's major-domo died, Boys and his junior chaplain buried the man, a Catholic, according to the rites of the Protestant Church. Napoleon was astonished when he heard of it, and said a priest would not have done so much for a Protestant. As a token of appreciation of their conduct Napoleon desired to give the two chaplains a present. A snuffbox was purchased in Jamestown and offered to Boys, but was refused owing to the severe penalties attached to any acceptance of gifts from the exile.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Club {{immediately}} opposed {{efforts to}} reduce Yosemite National Park by half, and began holding educational and scientific meetings. At <b>one</b> <b>meeting</b> {{in the fall of}} 1895 that included Muir, Joseph LeConte, and William R.

The Sierra Club was active in the successful campaign to transfer Yosemite National Park from state to federal control in 1906. The fight to preserve Hetch Hetchy Valley was also taken up by the Sierra Club, with some prominent San Francisco members opposing the fight. Eventually a vote was held that overwhelmingly put the Sierra Club behind the opposition to Hetch Hetchy Dam.|$|E
