5|$|A {{prevalent}} {{tradition in}} Florence was the small altarpiece of the Virgin and Child. Many {{of these were}} created in tempera or glazed terracotta by the workshops of Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and the prolific della Robbia family. Leonardo's early Madonnas such as The Madonna with a carnation and the Benois Madonna followed this tradition while showing idiosyncratic departures, {{particularly in the case}} of the Benois Madonna in which the Virgin is set at an oblique angle to the picture space with the Christ Child at the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle.</b> This compositional theme was to emerge in Leonardo's later paintings such as The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.|$|E

2500|$|A pair of <b>angles</b> <b>opposite</b> each other, {{formed by}} two {{intersecting}} straight lines that form an [...] "X"-like shape, are called vertical <b>angles</b> or <b>opposite</b> <b>angles</b> or vertically <b>opposite</b> <b>angles.</b> They are abbreviated as vert. opp. ∠s.|$|R

25|$|Addition of {{the angles}} {{corresponds}} to multiplication {{of the elements}} of SO(2, R), and taking the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle</b> corresponds to inversion. Thus both multiplication and inversion are differentiable maps.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. {{are used}} to denote segments, lines, rays, etc. A capital A is also {{typically}} used {{as one of the}} letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side <b>opposite</b> <b>angle</b> A.|$|E
25|$|Thales' theorem {{implies that}} if the {{circumcenter}} is located {{on one side of}} the triangle, then the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle</b> is a right one. If the circumcenter is located inside the triangle, then the triangle is acute; if the circumcenter is located outside the triangle, then the triangle is obtuse.|$|E

25|$|The angles {{which the}} {{circumscribed}} circle forms with {{the sides of}} the triangle coincide with angles at which sides meet each other. The side <b>opposite</b> <b>angle</b> α meets the circle twice: once at each end; in each case at angle α (similarly for the other two angles). This is due to the alternate segment theorem, which states that the angle between the tangent and chord equals the angle in the alternate segment.|$|E
500|$|Christ and {{the disciples}} {{are placed in}} a semicircle, {{reflecting}} {{the shape of the}} chapel's apse. The tax collector, on the other hand, stands outside the holy space. While the group of holy men are dressed almost entirely in robes of pastel pink and blue, the official wears a shorter tunic of a striking vermilion. The colour adds to the impertinence expressed through his gestures. Another way contrast is achieved is in the way [...] both in the central scene and on the right [...] the tax collector's postures are copying almost exactly those of Peter, only seen from the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle.</b> This gives a three-dimensional quality to the figures, allowing the spectator to view them from all sides.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternate}} {{method to}} determine the circumcenter is to draw any two lines each one departing {{from one of the}} vertices at an angle with the common side, the common angle of departure being 90° minus the angle of the opposite vertex.

2500|$|The first interceptions were {{calculated}} using trigonometry and mechanical calculators but eventually Grenfell {{had enough of}} the [...] "confounded machines" [...] and directed a perfect interception by eye. Tizard introduced the equal angles method of rapidly estimating an interception point, by imagining the fighters and bombers at the opposite corners on the base of a triangle. The bombers were flying at a particular angle to the base and the controller sent the fighters along the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle,</b> to converge with the target at the apex of the triangle. With this Tizzy Angle, interception rates shot up {{and by the end of}} 1936 they were consistently above 90 percent when the altitude was known and did not change. If the bombers changed their altitude, or the fighters arrived below them, manoeuvring for the attack reduced the success rate to about 60 percent.|$|E

2500|$|From the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle,</b> Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, {{has argued that}} Malthus was too optimistic, as he failed to recognize any upper limit {{to the growth of}} population — only, the geometric increase in human numbers is occasionally slowed down (checked) by the arithmetic increase in agricultural produce, according to Malthus' simple growth model; but some upper limit to population is bound to exist, as the total amount of agricultural land — actual as well as potential — on Earth is finite, Georgescu-Roegen points out. Georgescu-Roegen further argues that the industrialised world's increase in agricultural productivity since Malthus' day has been brought about by a mechanisation that has substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation: Machinery, chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation, rendering modern agriculture — and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it — almost as dependent on Earth's mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been. Georgescu-Roegen cautions that this situation is a major reason why the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Political advisor Jeremy Rifkin and ecological economist Herman Daly, two students of Georgescu-Roegen, have raised similar neo-Malthusian concerns about the long run drawbacks of modern mechanised agriculture.|$|E
60|$|This arranged, {{the captain}} prudently passed {{away from the}} spot, turning to note the {{proceedings}} of his companion, the moment {{he was at the}} <b>opposite</b> <b>angle</b> of the gallery. Blodget was in no haste. He waited until his aim was certain; then the stillness of the valley was rudely broken by the sharp report of a rifle, and a flash illumined its obscurity. The figure fell outward, like a bird shot from its perch, lying in a ball {{at the foot of the}} stockade. Still, no cry or groan gave evidence of nature surprised by keen and unexpected anguish. At the next instant Blodget was by captain Willoughby's side. His conduct was a pledge of fidelity that could not be mistaken, and a warm squeeze of the hand assured the youth of his superior's approbation.|$|E
60|$|The {{inspector}} fell in {{with the}} procession, and proceeded, as they walked up the hill, to bargain in his official capacity for a front seat, where he could safeguard {{the interests of the}} law, and in his private capacity to lay out thirty shillings at seven to one with Mr. Armitage. Through the door they passed, down a narrow lane walled with a dense bank of humanity, up a wooden ladder to a platform, over a rope which was slung waist-high from four corner-stakes, and then Montgomery realised that he was in that ring in which his immediate destiny was to be worked out. On the stake at one corner there hung a blue-and-white streamer. Barton led him across, the overcoat dangling loosely from his shoulders, and he sat down on a wooden stool. Barton and another man, both wearing white sweaters, stood beside him. The so-called ring was a square, twenty feet each way. At the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle</b> was the sinister figure of the Master, with his red-headed woman and a rough-faced friend to look after him. At each corner were metal basins, pitchers of water, and sponges.|$|E

60|$|The {{interior}} of the inn was answerable to the outside: indeed, I never saw any room much more to be admired than the low wainscoted parlour in which I spent {{the remainder of the}} evening. It was a short oblong in shape, save that the fireplace was built across one of the angles so as to cut it partially off, and the <b>opposite</b> <b>angle</b> was similarly truncated by a corner cupboard. The wainscot was white, and there was a Turkey carpet on the floor, so old that it might have been imported by Walter Shandy before he retired, worn almost through in some places, but in others making a good show of blues and oranges, none the less harmonious for being somewhat faded. The corner cupboard was agreeable in design; and there were just the right things upon the shelves--decanters and tumblers, and blue plates, and one red rose in a glass of water. The furniture was old-fashioned and stiff. Everything was in keeping, down to the ponderous leaden inkstand on the round table. And you may fancy how pleasant it looked all flushed and flickered over by the light of a brisk companionable fire, and seen, in a strange, tilted sort of perspective, in the three compartments of the old mirror above the chimney. As I sat reading in the great arm-chair, I kept looking round with the tail of my eye at the quaint, bright picture that was about me, and could not help some pleasure and a certain childish pride in forming part of it. The book I read was about Italy in the early Renaissance, the pageantries and the light loves of princes, the passion of men for learning, and poetry, and art; but it was written, by good luck, after a solid, prosaic fashion, that suited the room infinitely more nearly than the matter; and the result was that I thought less, perhaps, of Lippo Lippi, or Lorenzo, or Politian, than of the good Englishman who had written in that volume what he knew of them, and taken so much pleasure in his solemn polysyllables.|$|E
