Weisman explains, [...] "We knew Rhino would require a voice with strength and menace, but Rhino also isn't the brightest bulb on the marquee, so we knew whoever we cast would also have to have the acting chops and comic timing to take the character beyond the usual dumb goon." [...] They each had worked with Brown previously and knew {{he would be able to}} [...] "nail it", as he is able to give a [...] "tough, low voice" [...] and [...] "turn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> between dangerous and comedic characterizations." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{negative}} reception of David Letterman's stint as host from the preceding year's ceremony, veteran film and television director Gil Cates declined to helm the upcoming festivities. In November 1995, AMPAS recruited music producer and Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award recipient Quincy Jones as producer of the 1996 ceremony. Jones immediately selected actress and comedian Whoopi Goldberg to host the ceremony. In an interview with Los Angeles Times writer Susan King, Jones explained the decision to hire Goldberg saying, [...] "She has all the qualifications to move <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime,</b> to carry the elegance and the dignity of the show and is very funny. She understands the street. She has everything." ...|$|E

500|$|Kristen Cloke, Morgan's wife, {{was cast}} as teacher Valerie Lewton. [...] "I have {{incredible}} respect for them," [...] said Cloke. [...] "Jim's {{the kind of}} director who knows exactly what he wants. As an actor, I {{can find a way}} to get there if I know specifically what I'm going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won't move on until he's got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things". [...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> like that".|$|E
500|$|God Hates us All {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] On Metacritic, the album has {{a score of}} 80 out of 100 based on 12 reviews. Kerrang! Jason Arnopp described the album as [...] "easily Slayer's most convincing collection since Seasons in the Abyss," [...] awarding the album five out of five. Rolling Stone Rob Kemp wrote the record was [...] "Slayer's most brutal record since 1986's immortal (or undead) Reign in Blood," [...] describing the music as [...] "galloping double-bass-drum salvos" [...] which [...] "switch <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> to furious double-time pummeling, as ominous power chords and jagged shred solos slice and dice with Formula One precision." [...] Kemp awarded the album {{three and a half}} out of five. AllMusic reviewer Jason Birchmeier commented that [...] "nearly 20 years into their evolution, Slayer have abandoned the extravagancies and accessibility of their late-'80s/early-'90s work and returned to perfect the raw approach of their early years. A near flawless album," [...] and that Araya's performance possibly makes [...] "the most exhausting Slayer album yet." ...|$|E

[...] He {{was a relatively}} small player, standing [...] tall, and weighing [...] [...] He was {{sometimes referred to as}} Michigan's [...] "mighty mite tailback." [...] In addition to his speed, what set him apart from other backs was his ability to cut and find the smallest of holes. [...] Bo Schembechler called Bell [...] "the greatest cutback runner I've ever coached." [...] In 1975, the Associated Press noted: [...] "Bell is noted for his ability to cut <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime,</b> spurt through miniscule [...] holes and hurdle tacklers. [...] He's got fine speed and he's durable. [...] Bell seems to get -- pardon the expression -- his bell rung on many tackles, only to bounce up as if nothing happened." [...] Noted Michigan radio broadcaster Bob Ufer often referred to Bell as [...] "little Gordie Bell." [...] Ufer once humorously said, referring to Bell's ability to shift directions quickly, that Bell [...] "could run fifteen minutes in a phone booth and never touch the sides." ...|$|E
5000|$|Though Coca-Cola {{had been}} invented in 1886 in Atlanta, Georgia by the {{pharmacist}} John S. Pemberton, {{it was not}} sold in bottles until Joseph Biedenharn developed the new procedure. He delivered the bottled drink to rural areas outside of Vicksburg, increasing the base of customers. He {{was not only the}} first bottler of the drinks but he established the new marketing technique of an independent network of franchise bottlers who distribute the drink. This has since grown to be worldwide in scope. Biedenharn had been advised by his father to [...] "go into the nickel business", meaning to offer soft drinks for five cents each. Prior to 1900, many people would hold <b>on</b> to <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> but spend <b>a</b> nickel for pleasure.|$|R

Barnum for specimens of savage races to be put into a display in his traveling circus act. He died the following year in Ohio. His mummified remains were first put <b>on</b> exhibition in <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> museum and then stored {{in the basement of a}} Cleveland funeral parlour and were only discovered a century later when the business closed down. The Manbarra community appealed for the repatriation of his remains and they were duly restored to the people in 1994. His reburial there according to traditional funeral rites that had fallen into abeyance for decades played an important role in the cultural renewal and reconsolidation of Manbarra identiy, and also that of the Bwgaman.|$|R

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{good reviews}} from critics. [...] Brian Zoromski, of IGN, stated that [...] "'Business School' was {{an exercise in}} what works best in an Office episode." [...] Zoromski also praised Joss Whedon's directorial debut for the show, stating that [...] "Whedon's direction and sense of humor was both excellently put to use and alluded to in the scenes in which Jim hilariously pretended to become a vampire." [...] Zoromski {{went on to say}} that the acting of John Krasinski and Rashida Jones, who portrays Karen Filippelli, helped to make the vampire scenes the funniest parts of the episode. He gave the episode a 9.1 out of 10. [...] Abby West, of Entertainment Weekly, stated that [...] "This show has always been able to turn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> and take the comedy to a soul-stirring dramatic climax with just the lightest of touches, and last night was no different." [...] West went on to praise Michael and Pam's scene at the art show as one of these moments.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} The High End of Low {{appear on the}} album in {{the order in which}} they were written. The album {{contains}} material which spans across a wide variety of genres, such as industrial metal, glam rock, garage rock, blues, country, and synthpop. Its first track, [...] "Devour", is a mid-tempo rock song which begins with an acoustic guitar, with heavy drums and distorted, screamed vocals becoming more prominent as it progresses. It was written in response to the [...] "Shakespearean ideal of romance" [...] presented on Eat Me, Drink Me. Lana Cooper of PopMatters said the song [...] "runs an emotional gauntlet", and could [...] "very well be the most depressing break-up song of all time. The lonely plink of guitar strings being tuned give way to Manson's soul-wrenching eruption of [...] "And I'll love you / If you'll let me". [...] he turns <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime,</b> and a few lines later is vowing revenge, spitting [...] "I will blow your heart to pieces." [...] Metal Hammer later included it on their list of the 10 most underrated Marilyn Manson songs.|$|E
500|$|In Major League Baseball, {{the pitcher}} {{is unable to}} move around the pitcher's mound and many are also able to perform the feat of [...] pitches. The ball's physics have been called into question, with the ball {{stopping}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> after three or less bounces. The game's camera system does not function properly and, when a ball is hit, the outfield camera follows the ball looking upwards, {{making it impossible for}} the game player to see where their fielders are. The ball can also be thrown and get stuck in the well between the stands and the field on an overthrow of a baseman and cause inside the park home runs, which would not happen within a real game (in that case a ground rule double and/or error would be scored instead). Another bug allows players to go into the stands past the wall with the ball if they enter at certain points in foul territory. Each baseman is also controlled individually, allowing for user error in certain situations where a running baseman will be called out if the baseman ahead of them remains at their last base if the player fails to advance them.|$|E

500|$|Marino {{was cast}} in November 2015, on which Fazekas said, [...] "He’s {{obviously}} very funny, but he also is a great dramatic actor. We had talked about him for a different role, {{but it was too}} small of a role. Then we knew we wanted him in [...] Manfredi role. So that role became so much bigger because it was Ken." [...] About the character, Fazekas added, [...] "What I love about Manfredi is he’s funny, he can flip <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> and be a total psycho, and he is madly in love with Whitney and genuinely so—even when she’s cuckoo. Their scenes together, there’s such a tenderness to them". Since the character differs from its comic counterpart, Marino said [...] "the two things [...] " [...] were defining that Manfredi [...] "definitely was the muscle for Whitney, and that he did have a true love for her." [...] Marino wanted to make sure Manfredi [...] "felt like he was an old-school tough guy" [...] and felt that Frost was [...] "the one true love for him", comparing their relationship to Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe's.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Newman {{composed}} the film's original score. In regards to incorporating his own musical style to the film's period setting, Newman stated that [...] "there was {{room for a}} real tune-based score here that could reflect the basic joy {{in that kind of}} writing that the Sherman Brothers brought to Mary Poppins. Newman, however, refrained from creating an [...] "adaptation score" [...] of the Shermans' music from the original film. Newman's process of scoring the film included playing themes to filmed scenes, so that he could [...] "listen to what the music does to an image", and not wanting to [...] "clutter the proceedings with music." [...] The flashback sequences to Travers' childhood provided the most work for Newman. He explains that, [...] "You had to turn <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime</b> to make the transition back to the 'present,' when Travers and the Sherman brothers are working on the script for Mary Poppins. And that was fun, but also musically challenging.” For the score's instrumentation, Newman primarily employed a string orchestra with some woodwinds and brass, as well as including piano and hammered instruments that were [...] "appropriate to the time period", such as dulcimers. The film's score was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles, while the cast recorded several of the Shermans' songs at Capitol Studios for use as playback during the film's diegetic music scenes, including [...] "Chim Chim Cher-ee", [...] "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious", [...] "A Spoonful of Sugar", [...] "Fidelity Fiduciary Bank", [...] "Feed the Birds", and [...] "Let's Go Fly a Kite". Walt Disney Records released two editions of the soundtrack on December 10, 2013: a single-disc and a two-disc digipak deluxe edition, containing original demo recordings by the Shermans and selected songs from Mary Poppins.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary." [...] Rothkopf described Jackson as [...] "obviously" [...] having been [...] "shooting for the moon right before his death" [...] {{based on what he}} could tell from the [...] "stunning bits of concert spectacle" [...] of [...] "phalanxes of computer-generated dancers, tempo changes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>dime,</b> a bombshell of a blond guitarist who plays Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Beat It" [...] solo flawlessly". Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E
