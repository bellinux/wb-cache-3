500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with his hands together and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John <b>Overal.</b> When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] The only thing he thought he might be condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.|$|E

[...] Forbes went on [...] "I learned from other officials that all the men who had been with the company for any time felt that they were working, not for some monster corporation, but for Harry Bassett, and that it was up to them to do their best by him and for him." ...|$|R
500|$|Garnet {{highlighted}} {{the date of}} his execution, 3 May, the Feast of the Cross, and reaffirmed his innocence. He defended Anne Vaux against claims that their relationship had been inappropriate. He then prayed {{at the base of}} the ladder, disrobed down to his long, sewn-up shirt, [...] "that the wind might not blow it up", and mounted the ladder. He ignored a Protestant minister who came forward, replying to an objectionable member of the audience that he [...] "ever meant to die a true but perfect Catholic". Bishop <b>Overal</b> protested that [...] "we are all Catholics", although Garnet disagreed with this. He once again said his prayers, and was then thrown off the ladder. [...] Before the executioner could cut him down alive, many in the crowd pulled on his legs, and as a result, Garnet did not suffer the remainder of his grim sentence. There was no applause when the executioner held Garnet's heart aloft and said the traditional words, [...] "Behold the heart of a traitor". His head was set on a pole on London Bridge, but crowds of onlookers fascinated by its pallid appearance eventually forced the government to turn the head upwards, so its face was no longer visible.|$|E

2500|$|Further success {{came with}} the {{definite}} advent of the 18th century. In 1699, {{on the recommendation of}} the Papacy, then ruler of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Leopold I (r. 1658–1705) granted to them titles of Counts in Hungary. In the same year, a report sent to the [...] "Propaganda Fide" [...] located in Rome, shows that the Scerimans had in the royal capital of Isfahan alone some 50 servants and up to a 100 agents. Around the same time, {{as a result of the}} loan given several years earlier (720,000 Ducats), the Scerimans were given numerous [...] "privileges" [...] by the Senate of the Republic of Venice. A climactic point was soon reached in the mid-18th century, as members of the family were raised to the class of nobility in numerous of the Italian city-states. Even though their [...] "efforts" [...] to join the Venetian Patriciate, which they started in the early 18th century, did not succeed, they were well integrated in the ruling class of the Venetian Republic. This by numerous marriage alliances with several noble Venetian families. Another aspect that increased their <b>overal</b> prestige as foreigners in the Venetian state was that they were well integrated into the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Basilio, son of Gaspar Sceriman for example, according to D. Maxwell White, was given the position of a monsignor and later even became governor of several administrative regions. Another family member, Domenico Sceriman, became a bishop, after being elected. Around that time, a member of the family named David Sceriman was [...] "likely" [...] the richest Armenian in Livorno. Past the mid-18th century, in the 1760s, another Sceriman in Venice, Zaccaria di Sceriman (whose mother was a Venetian noblewoman), would become a renowned writer and satirist.|$|E

Studenter gillar att utsmycka sina <b>overaller</b> med olika tygmärken och andra accessoarer, men tillgängligheten av dessa är i dagsläget begränsad.  Denna rapport presenterar utvecklingsprocessen samt resultatet av webbapplikationen ”PimpaOvven” – en e-shop med syfte att öka tillgängligheten av tygmärken och overallstillbehör. Utvecklingen har skett iterativt och fokuserats till att bygga en säker webbapplikation som genererar en användbar miljö i avseende till handlingsbarhet, navigerbarhet, säkerhet och inger ett säkert intryck. De metoder som använts och genererat den resulterande webbapplikationen utgör tillsammans med den teoretiska referensramen grunden för rapportens diskussion. Under projektets gång genomfördes även användbarhets- samt säkerhetstester, och utifrån dessa tillsammans med diskussionen drogs slutsatsen att en säker och användbar webbapplikation utvecklats.

40|$|Despite its {{quiet and}} broad landscape, Kansas has endured {{a history that}} runs from antebellum violence, through buffalo {{slaughter}} and dust bowl despair, to wartime boom. Perhaps no time in Kansas history has seen more flux than the depression 1930 s and the wartime 1940 s; and doubtless no time has been better documented by able photographers. Thanks to Kansas-born Roy Stryker and the three documentary photography projects he headed during the period (for the Farm Security Administration, the Office of War Information, and Standard Oil of New Jersey), Kansans and the world have a sharper idea of {{what life was like}} in the Sunflower State during that strange time when dust storms and foreclosures began to give way to war production and bond drives. Under Stryker 2 ̆ 7 s guidance nine photographers sampled the people, events, and places of Kansas between 1936 and 1949, and in Bust to Boom the reader is treated to 103 carefully selected and sequenced photographs, complete with original captions and negative numbers. Here are Kansas icons of the era: topsoil-buried fences, a county fair, <b>overalled</b> men working the soil, print-dressed women with their home canning, barefoot kids fishing, drovers, soldiers, railroad workers. Here are oil field roughnecks, street scenes, rural landscapes, grain elevators, aerial views of corn and wheat. Of course the photographs are not representative, and the editor and commentator address that fact. Bust to Boom renders a small selection of images from a state of 82, 000 square miles over a span of thirteen years. Readers will find no pictures of universities, of the leisure class, and few of urban places. But the images fulfill their intentions: they give readers-and viewers-some concrete idea of a past existence, some feeling for what life was like in a world that grows more distant with each new netsite or cellphone in our own. Donald Worster 2 ̆ 7 s commentary, though once in a while straying a bit far from the photographs, provides an accurate and valuable context for understanding Kansas in this era. Constance Schulz 2 ̆ 7 s concise text about the photographs 2 ̆ 7 creation could well serve as a primer to viewing the documentary projects of the 1930 s and 40 s. Indeed, their presentation is so engaging that at times one wishes for more information than the useful caption material which each photograph provides: the authors might have exploited their Kansas knowledge to elaborate on what has become of the Santa Fe locomotive shops in Topeka and ditch irrigation in western Kansas. Carefully researched and written, beautifully designed, and well printed, Bust to Boom takes its place among the finest in a growing list of books that have brought to us, state by state, the best work of the FSA and other documentary photography projects...|$|R
