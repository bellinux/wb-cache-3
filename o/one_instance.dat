Homosexual acts are punishable by flogging, imprisonment or death. Lashings are a common form of punishment and are often imposed for offences against religion and public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations.|$|E
5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN. The eastern green mamba is, however, a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in <b>one</b> <b>instance</b> a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, habitat destruction and deforestation may pose a possible threat to this species.|$|E

The stacked graphical learning is efficient, especially during inference, capable of capturing dependencies easily, and can be constructed based on any kind of base learner. In experiments on two classification problems, stacked graphical learning generally achieved comparable accuracy to other graphical models via much faster inference. ...|$|R

5|$|In May and June 1945, {{following}} {{the end of}} the European war, McGovern flew food relief flights to northern Italy, then flew back to the United States with his crew. McGovern was discharged from the Army Air Forces in July 1945, with the rank of First Lieutenant. He was also awarded the Air Medal with three oak leaf clusters, <b>one</b> <b>instance</b> of which was for the safe landing on his final mission.|$|E
5|$|On the Potomac River, where tides ran {{well above}} normal, ships broke free from their {{moorings}} and drifted downstream. In <b>one</b> <b>instance,</b> a large steamship called the George Leary struck and damaged six other ships. Numerous vessels capsized in the river, including the steamer Mary Washington and the schooner John W. Linnell. At the Washington Navy Yard, multiple buildings sustained damage. Overall losses in Washington, D.C. were approximately $400,000, {{and at least}} two dozen individuals in the city suffered injuries from falling debris.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, a {{slightly}} more dramatic lowering of pitch (a downstep) may occur between certain syllables. In Sesotho, the downstep (indicated with a !) naturally occurs between words (being less noticeable if the first word has no low tones) though {{there is at least}} <b>one</b> <b>instances</b> (in rule 1 of the plain copulative) where the lack of downstep (as well as other tonal factors) changes the utterance's meaning. In the following example, a grave accent (à) indicates a low tone and an acute accent (á) indicates a high tone.|$|R
5|$|Simultaneously, {{public opinion}} polls during {{the second week of}} May showed that 50 percent of the American public {{approved}} of President Nixon's actions. Fifty-eight percent blamed the students for what had occurred at Kent State. On both sides, emotions ran high. In <b>one</b> <b>instance,</b> in New York City on 8 May, pro-administration construction workers rioted and attacked demonstrating students. Such violence, however, was an aberration. Most demonstrations, both pro- and anti-war, were peaceful. On 20 May 100,000 construction workers, tradesmen, and office workers marched peacefully through New York City in support of the president's policies.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} was, however, highly controversial. Before publication Muslim {{groups had}} expressed opposition. After publication began the Playboy Indonesia offices were attacked, as were various printers. In <b>one</b> <b>instance</b> the Islamic Defenders Front attacked the Playboy Indonesia offices in South Jakarta, {{leading to the}} building being evacuated. By May 2006 the continuous protests had left the magazine without an office. The bad publicity led advertisers to abandon the magazine. Ultimately the magazine was shut down after releasing ten issues, having moved to the predominantly Hindu island Bali since its second issue, in June 2006.|$|E

5|$|Al-Azhar {{also served}} as a focal point for protests against the Ottoman {{occupation}} of Egypt, both from within the ulema and from among the general public. Student protests at al-Azhar were common, and shops {{in the vicinity of the}} mosque would often close out of solidarity with the students. The ulema was also on occasion able to defy the government. In <b>one</b> <b>instance,</b> in 1730–31, Ottoman aghas harassed the residents living near al-Azhar while pursuing three fugitives. The gates at al-Azhar were closed in protest and the Ottoman governor, fearing a larger uprising, ordered the aghas to refrain from going near al-Azhar. Another disturbance occurred in 1791 in which the wāli harassed the people near the al-Hussein Mosque, who then went to al-Azhar to demonstrate. The wāli was subsequently dismissed from his post.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{accident}} investigation found that procedures and policies were supposedly {{already in place}} to prevent such a crash from occurring again, {{the fact that this}} crash occurred showed that in at least <b>one</b> <b>instance,</b> the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of {{the accident}} investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a C-17 transport aircraft crashed shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.|$|E
5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin <b>one</b> <b>instance</b> appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which it hits the character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E

5|$|By June 30, air {{assets were}} being rallied against ground targets {{as well as}} aircraft. That day the 19th Bombardment Group was being used to bomb targets along the Han River. Meanwhile, the 3rd Bombardment Group bombed targets around Seoul, seeking to slow the North Korean advance southward from the newly {{captured}} city. These assets also attacked North Korean convoys and troop movements along the roads to great effect. During these attacks North Korean aircraft rarely opposed the US aircraft, but in a few occasions Yak-9 flights appeared, and in <b>one</b> <b>instance</b> engaged a flight of F-80s from the 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, allowing Lieutenants Charles A. Wurster and John B. Thomas to score a victory each. In spite of 25 bombing missions in Seoul, however, the North Korean troops were continuing their advance, forcing the US forces to abandon Suwon Airfield.|$|E
5|$|In June the {{battalion}} {{was placed in}} reserve as a ready-reinforcement unit and consequently saw little combat. From July to September, 3rd Battalion operated all throughout the I Corps area of operations, moving its command post to ten different locations. Hundreds of Marines were also affected by cellulitis. Following President Johnson's halt of the US bombing campaign on 1 November, 3rd Battalion Marines had to watch as the PAVN brazenly pushed large convoys of men and munitions south along the Ben Hai River. In <b>one</b> <b>instance</b> it took three days for {{the battalion}} to get approval for a single airstrike on a North Vietnamese convoy.|$|E
5|$|In {{laboratory}} conditions, {{the interactions}} of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and Penning trap allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in <b>one</b> <b>instance</b> a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron {{for a period of}} 10 months. The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.|$|E
