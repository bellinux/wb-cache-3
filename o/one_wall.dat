5|$|The {{original}} hotel tower had 680 rooms, {{and each}} featured {{a room with}} <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> which was fully mirrored from floor to ceiling. The hotel featured an 800-seat theatre restaurant and three public dining areas, two health clubs, an epicurean room, a convention hall of up to 2000 people and 20 separate halls and committee rooms, accommodating up to 5000 people in total. Marble was imported from Italy, rosewood from Brazil, with gold leafing throughout the place.|$|E
5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence over and over again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E
5|$|Mario's {{abilities}} in Super Mario 64 {{are far more}} diverse than those of previous Mario games. The player can make Mario walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, swim, climb, kick, or punch using the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Special jumps can be executed by combining a regular jump with other actions, including the double and triple jumps (jumping two and {{three times in a}} row, respectively), long jump and backflip. There are also special maneuvers, such as wall jumping—jumping from <b>one</b> <b>wall</b> to another in rapid succession to reach areas that would otherwise be too high. The player can pick up and carry certain items, an ability which is used to solve various puzzles, and swim underwater at various speeds. Mario's life energy slowly diminishes while underwater, representing how long he can hold his breath.|$|E

5|$|The First English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642. During its early campaigns, Kenilworth formed a useful {{counterbalance}} to the Parliamentary stronghold of Warwick. Kenilworth was used by Charles on his advance to Edgehill in October 1642 {{as a base for}} raids on Parliamentary strongholds in the Midlands. After the battle, however, the royalist garrison was withdrawn on the approach of Lord Brooke, and the castle was then garrisoned by parliamentary forces. In April 1643 the new governor of the castle, Hastings Ingram, was arrested as a suspected Royalist double agent. By January 1645 the Parliamentary forces in Coventry had strengthened their hold on the castle, and attempts by Royalist forces to dislodge them from Warwickshire failed. Security concerns continued {{after the end of the}} First Civil War in 1646, and in 1649 Parliament ordered the slighting of Kenilworth. <b>One</b> <b>wall</b> of the great tower, various parts of the outer bailey and the battlements were destroyed, but not before the building was surveyed by the antiquarian William Dugdale, who published his results in 1656.|$|E
