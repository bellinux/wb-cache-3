During the implementation <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs,</b> the administration buildings of the College of Agriculture and the College of Development Communication as well as staff houses and roads were built.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Some {{majors and}} minors offer special {{academic}} programs. Completion <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> does {{not result in}} any minor or other recognition. If a student wishes to enter a professional school after graduation, {{he or she may}} undertake one of the pre-professional programs offered. Internships are required for some majors, where students can experience life outside of the classroom, however any student can enroll in an internship for elective credit. Saint Anselm participates in an archaeological excavation program allowing students to travel to Italy and unearth ancient Roman treasures. For prospective engineers, the college has agreements with other schools through the cooperative engineering program.|$|E

Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> {{take place in}} the wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. These programs have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E
5|$|The {{center is}} {{utilized}} {{to connect the}} College of Law and Willamette as a whole to the larger Salem community. In this capacity, the center houses several law school programs with community outreach aspects. These include the Oregon Law Commission, the Center for Democracy, the Center for Religion and Law, the Center for Dispute Resolution, Willamette's Clinical Law Program, the Center for Law and Government, and the school's law journal, the Willamette Law Review. Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> were chosen to be housed in the center due to having community outreach programs, {{with the goal of}} the center being to create a community atmosphere between students, faculty, and the community at large.|$|E
5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Seacology {{launched}} its largest-ever project, a $3.4 million initiative to protect all of Sri Lanka's remaining mangrove forests and restore many degraded ones. Through Sri Lanka-based NGO Sudeesa (also {{known as the}} Small Fishers Federation of Lanka), Seacology is funding a significant expansion of that organization's existing microloan and job-training programs. In exchange, the beneficiaries <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> must agree to assist in protecting their local mangrove habitats. The training is designed in part to give low-income women in these communities alternatives to harvesting mangroves, a subsistence activity that {{has contributed to the}} forests' degradation. The project also established three large nursery facilities to grow several species of mangroves, to be replanted in areas previously cleared for aquaculture and other unsustainable development, as well as several areas destroyed during the Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E
