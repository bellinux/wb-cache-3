5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is a town}} in Somerset, England, at {{the mouth}} of the River Parrett and Bridgwater Bay. Burnham was a small fishing village until the late 18th century, when it began to grow because of its {{popularity}} as a seaside resort. It forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parish</b> of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge and shares a town council with its neighbouring market town of Highbridge. According to the 2011 census the population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parish</b> (i.e. including Highbridge) was 19,576, of which the populations of the wards of Burnham Central and Burnham North, which made up most of the town, totalled 13,601.|$|E

The 2005 survey identified that residents in the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parish</b> (Falcon Fields and Ravenswing/Pinelands) travel towards Tadley and Basingstoke whereas those further north in the parish tend to find work in Reading, Newbury and London.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{because it}} was {{impossible}} for parishioners to travel to Llanbadarn Fawr from the more distant parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parish,</b> the church eventually had many chapels of ease, as the population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parish</b> grew. One example of the latter is All Saints Church, Llangorwen, which was built in the early 1840s. In the course of the nineteenth century the original parish of Llanbadarn Fawr was finally divided into some 17 new parishes, comprising 20 churches.|$|E
