5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive multi-tracking of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The multi-tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals.

Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|E
