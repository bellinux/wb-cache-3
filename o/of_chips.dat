5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators. Clive Sinclair wanted to design a calculator to compete with the HP-35 using this series <b>of</b> <b>chips.</b> Despite scepticism about the feasibility of the project from Texas Instruments engineers, Nigel Searle was able to design algorithms that sacrificed some speed and accuracy in order to implement scientific functions on the TMS0805 variation.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough engineers to handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list <b>of</b> <b>chips</b> and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E

40|$|In {{traditional}} diamond cutting, {{the cutting}} force is usually large {{and it will}} affect tool life and machining quality. Elliptical vibration cutting (EVC) {{as one of the}} ultra-precision machining technologies has a lot of advantages, such as reduces cutting force, extend tool life and so on. It’s difficult to predict the transient cutting force of EVC due to its unique elliptical motion trajectory. Study on chip formation will helpfully to predict cutting force. The geometric feature <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> has important effects on cutting force, however, few scholars have studied the chip formation. In order to investigate the time-varying cutting force of EVC, the geometric feature model <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> is established based on analysis <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> formation, and the effects of cutting parameters on the geometric feature <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> are analyzed. To predict transient force quickly and effectively, the geometric feature <b>of</b> <b>chip</b> is introduced into the cutting force model. The calculated results show that the error between the predicted cutting force in this paper and that in the literature is less than 2 %, which proves its feasibility...|$|R

25|$|Total module {{capacity}} {{is a product}} of one chip's capacity by the number <b>of</b> <b>chips.</b> ECC modules multiply it by 8/9 because they use one bit per byte for error correction.

25|$|To {{increase}} memory capacity and bandwidth, chips are combined on a module. For instance, the 64-bit data bus for DIMM requires eight 8-bit chips, addressed in parallel. Multiple chips {{with the common}} address lines are called a memory rank. The term was introduced to avoid confusion with chip internal rows and banks. A memory module may bear more than one rank. The term sides would also be confusing because it incorrectly suggests the physical placement <b>of</b> <b>chips</b> on the module.|$|E
