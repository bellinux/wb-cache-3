5|$|Leonardo's dissections and {{documentation}} of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped {{to describe the}} physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He {{found it difficult to}} incorporate the prevailing system and theories <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass seed to watch flow patterns. Vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in De humani corporis fabrica in 1543.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{security}} system at a scrap metal yard, {{which had been}} repeatedly burglarized, went off. The yard's owner {{was at the time}} on a hunt close to the yard and drove directly to it. A group of burglars jumped into their car and attempted to drive away. The owner used his shotgun and attempted to shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for intentional infliction <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> harm, a sentence that was confirmed on appeal. The owner received full presidential pardon.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on imaging and chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 {{a private}} {{security}} guard {{with a pistol}} pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding {{one of them in}} the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a sentence of five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting that defense must be clearly more intensive than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E

Any sexual exchange <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> fluids with a person infected with HIV, {{the virus that causes}} AIDS, poses a risk of infection. Risk of STI infection, however, is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex, with HIV transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex.|$|E

25|$|Entomological {{evidence}} is legal {{evidence in the}} form of insects or related artifacts and is a field of study in forensic entomology. Such {{evidence is}} used particularly in medicolegal and medicocriminal applications. Insect evidence is customarily used to determine post mortem interval (PMI), but can also be used as evidence of neglect or abuse. It can indicate how long a person was abused/neglected as well as provide important insights into the amount <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> care given to the neglected or abused person.|$|E

In general, cerebral palsy is a physical impairment that affects posture {{and the development of}} movement. Ataxic cerebral palsy in particular, is manifested in the performance of movements with abnormal force, rhythm, and accuracy. Patients have hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), signs of ataxia (loss of full control <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> movement), impaired balance and coordination, intention tremors, and a wide-based gait (in walking patients).|$|E

25|$|In August 2007 Blanke's lab {{published}} research in Science demonstrating that conflicting visual-somatosensory input in virtual reality could disrupt the spatial unity between {{the self and}} the body. During multisensory conflict, participants felt as if a virtual body seen in front of them was their own body and mislocalized themselves toward the virtual body, to a position outside their bodily borders. This indicates that spatial unity and bodily self-consciousness can be studied experimentally and is based on multisensory and cognitive processing <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> information.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause some people to feel as though {{are out of control}} which may lead to feelings of panic. This misconception <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity and studies suggest that the people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys than other people, are fives {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed with panic disorder.|$|E
25|$|As to {{subsequent}} developments, {{important issues}} in Schele's iconographic work have been elaborated by Karl Taube. New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops, the representation <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> {{experience and the}} senses in Maya art, and of hieroglyphs considered as iconographic units. Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing. A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).|$|E

25|$|In general, hormone {{replacement}} therapy is somewhat controversial due to the known carcinogenic and thrombogenic properties of estrogen; however, many physicians and patients feel the benefits outweigh the risks in women who may face serious health and quality-of-life issues {{as a consequence of}} early surgical menopause. The ovarian hormones estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are involved in the regulation of hundreds <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> functions; it is believed by some doctors that hormone therapy programs mitigate surgical menopause side effects such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and female sexual dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|According to Shusterman our culture’s growing {{preoccupation with}} the body has not yet found an {{appropriate}} response {{in the realm of}} philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the negative aspects of the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich our experience of the varieties <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> charms”).|$|E
25|$|Agelaia pallipes will {{normally}} feed {{on other}} insects (flies, moths, butterflies), however, {{it has been}} recently discovered that A. pallipes will also feed on carrion. Though the collection <b>of</b> <b>bodily</b> fluids is preferred, the wasp will also settle to take carrion morsels to their larvae; furthermore, {{it has been documented}} in recent studies that they will chew tissues of cavities in order to find liquids. Interestingly, A. pallipes was observed to feed on carrion primarily during the fresh stage (98% of occurrences) which can lead to significant forensic importance when determining the post-mortem interval.|$|E
