50|$|In November 2006, {{the debt}} {{obligations}} {{of the company}} were subject to extreme price volatility as speculation mounted about the depth of commitment to the business by GHSL. Pramod Mittal, the company's owner, issued a statement to reassure investors of his ongoing interest in Kremikovtzi's success; {{but this was not}} sufficient to dampen the ongoing volatility of the debt price. At the beginning of December 2006, GSHL issued another statement, this time committing to inject cash into the business on an <b>ongoing,</b> quarterly <b>basis.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} Community Source Model {{is that many of}} the investments of developers' time, design, and project governance come from institutional contributions by colleges, universities, and some commercial firms rather than from individuals. These contributions may be tendered as the first phase of a project, and then additional work may be contributed on an <b>ongoing,</b> voluntary <b>basis</b> by those institutions with a continuing interest in the project. The project often establishes a software framework and baseline functionality, and then the community develops additional features as needed over time.|$|R

50|$|On June 6, 2013, The Washington Post and The Guardian {{published}} a classified FISC order leaked by Edward Snowden. The leaked order compelled Verizon to produce telephony metadata records on an <b>ongoing</b> daily <b>basis</b> to the NSA. This {{disclosure of the}} bulk telephony metadata collection initiated public debate about the constitutionality of NSA's surveillance program and brought forth {{the question of whether}} the FISC court had exceeded its statutory authority in granting the Verizon order. EPIC, the petitioner in this action, is a public interest research center focused on First Amendment and other constitutional issues of privacy, open government, free speech, and other civil liberties.|$|R
2500|$|Ideal {{claimed that}} National {{engaged in a}} [...] "pattern of {{racketeering}} activity" [...] because the fraudulent returns were submitted on an <b>ongoing</b> and regular <b>basis.</b> Ideal also filed a claim against the Anzas and National, alleging that they violated section 1962(a) by using funds generated by their fraudulent tax scheme to open their Bronx location, causing Ideal to lose business and market share.|$|R
25|$|Preventing {{recurrence}} of hyperkalemia typically involves reduction of dietary potassium, removal of an offending medication, and/or {{the addition of}} a diuretic (such as furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide).

25|$|Detectors can {{be divided}} into two major categories: imaging {{detectors}} (such as photographic plates and X-ray film (photographic film), now mostly replaced by various digitizing devices like image plates or flat panel detectors) and dose measurement devices (such as ionization chambers, Geiger counters, and dosimeters used to measure the local radiation exposure, dose, and/or dose rate, for example, for verifying that radiation protection equipment and procedures are effective on an <b>ongoing</b> <b>basis).</b>|$|E
25|$|However, an EMT-CC's {{education}} {{never truly}} ends as {{continuing medical education}} requirements are required to maintain certification. Most agencies have a CME (Continuing Medical Education) programs where required core subjects are taught on an <b>ongoing,</b> usually once-a-month, <b>basis</b> to keep providers current. Other ways of earning required CME credits for maintaining certification include state EMS conferences, such as Vital Signs, where classes are given over the duration of a weekend.|$|R
40|$|Lead (Pb), {{commonly}} used in plating of electronic components, is required to be phased out due to the hazards it poses. Possible alternative technologies and materials are discussed. Whisker formation, avoidance of which was an important reason {{for the use of}} lead as an alloying element, is examined. Whisker formation is dependent on stress in the electrodeposit, and strategies for its avoidance are discussed. Alloys of tin with bismuth, copper or silver may be difficult to control on an <b>ongoing</b> production <b>basis</b> and are also known to be liable for whisker formation. Pure matte tin, when plated appropriately with respect to substrate, current density and other operating conditions, has fewer problems and can be used profitably in existing plating installations...|$|R
40|$|In Portugal, we {{have not}} yet seen {{widespread}} theoretical and empirical examination of gender from a performative perspective, interrogating the ways in which gendered differences, similarities and inequalities are produced and negotiated on an <b>ongoing,</b> daily <b>basis</b> in a range of contexts of interaction. With this article, I aim to {{contribute to the development of}} such research through a discussion of an ethnography carried out with young people in a school in Lisbon. Drawing on two case-studies (management of access to playground space and the role of heteronormativity and homophobia in the regulation of masculinities), I argue that a performative approach is a useful and pertinent tool for analysis of gender issues and for critical examination of the analytical models most often used to study gender in current mainstream Portuguese sociological research...|$|R

25|$|The U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) is {{a program}} {{administered}} by the U.S. Navy which studies the military use of marine mammals - principally bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions - and trains animals to perform tasks such as ship and harbor protection, mine detection and clearance, and equipment recovery. The program is based in San Diego, California, where animals are housed and trained on an <b>ongoing</b> <b>basis.</b> NMMP animal teams have been deployed for use in combat zones, such as during the Vietnam War and the Iraq War.|$|E
30|$|In summary, marrying {{advances}} in ultrasound technology with simple and available informatics technologies permits experienced ultrasonographers to direct remote ultrasound examinations wherever Internet connectivity is available. Thus, with organization and commitment, a broadly experienced clinically orientated ultrasound mentor could support multiple clinical providers in multiple locations {{even if they}} were geographically dispersed on a worldwide <b>basis.</b> <b>Ongoing</b> study will now be required to assess the impact and guide the integration of this approach into contemporary practice.|$|R
50|$|Like many others, {{the company}} was {{effectively}} on hold during World War II, with a skeleton staff supplying only parts and sundries. They were asked to supply small flat-bed presses for the Resistance movement in Europe but little else happened until 1945 when production began again on a very limited <b>basis.</b> <b>Ongoing</b> rationing meant raw materials were in short supply and it wasn't until around 1950 that {{the company was}} able to trade at full capacity again.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{economic}} benefits of the Cook Inlet Ferry to the [...] Municipality of Anchorage.
