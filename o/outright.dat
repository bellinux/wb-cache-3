5|$|After {{a period}} of {{extensive}} training, the airborne force took off in two aircraft–glider combinations {{on the night of}} 19 November 1942. Both managed to reach the Norwegian coast, but neither was able to reach their objective. The first pair suffered from navigational difficulties and severe weather, which resulted in the tow rope snapping and the first glider crash–landing, with its towing aircraft returning to base; three airborne troops were killed <b>outright,</b> with the survivors captured shortly after the crash. The second pair fared even worse, with both aircraft and glider crashing into a mountain for unknown reasons; the aircrew and some airborne troops were killed <b>outright,</b> and those who survived were taken prisoner. None survived for very long, being executed as a result of Adolf Hitler's Commando Order, which stated all Commando personnel were to be immediately executed upon capture. At the end of the war, Wehrmacht personnel were tried and condemned to death for their part in the executions.|$|E

5|$|As of November 2014, 28 {{states have}} enacted medical {{marijuana}} laws, removed jail time {{for possession of}} small amounts of marijuana, and/or have legalized the possession, distribution, and sale of marijuana <b>outright.</b> The factors which have led to this change are many, {{but some of them}} could include increased support from the medical community for legalization, viable regulatory systems modeled off of alcohol regulation, and the potential for state financial gains from decreased criminal justice costs and increased tax revenues. Although <b>outright</b> legalization for non-medical use of marijuana has only occurred in four states in the Union, in view of the movements in many states, it is possible that those states will not be alone for long.|$|E
5|$|Cowes Castle {{was bought}} <b>outright</b> from the Crown by the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1917. Further {{development}} work {{was carried out}} on the property in the 1920s, and a ballroom in an adjacent hotel was purchased for use as an annexe for female members.|$|E

5|$|Later events, {{such as the}} Boston Tea Party, further {{illustrated}} the crumbling relationship between Britain and its colonies.
