5|$|Despite {{the prior}} belief that {{schizophrenia}} occurs at similar rates worldwide, its frequency varies across the world, within countries, {{and at the}} local and neighborhood level. This variation has been estimated to be fivefold. It causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20,000 deaths in 2010. The rate of schizophrenia varies up to threefold depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is defined.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{difference}} in tone between the {{two versions of the}} elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is natural for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the video}} games, Pikachu is a {{low-level}} Pokémon, which {{has appeared in}} all of the games except Black and White naturally without having to trade. The game Pokémon Yellow features a Pikachu as the only available Starter Pokémon. Based on the Pikachu from the Pokémon anime, it refuses to stay in its Poké Ball, and instead follows the main character around on screen. The trainer can speak to it and it displays different reactions depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is treated. Pokémon Yellow followed the anime series closely, with Pikachu as a central character.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of R.palmatus {{have made it}} difficult for taxonomists to agree <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> should be classified, resulting in an elaborate taxonomical history and an extensive synonymy. First named Agaricus palmatus by Bulliard in 1785, it was reclassified into several different genera before becoming Rhodotus in 1926. The familial placement of the genus Rhodotus within the order Agaricales has also been subject to dispute, and the taxon has been transferred variously to the families Amanitaceae, Entolomataceae, and Tricholomataceae. More recently, molecular phylogenetics analysis has helped determine that Rhodotus is most closely related to genera in the Physalacriaceae.|$|E
5|$|To {{recreate}} the art style {{used in the}} manga, Capcom developed a graphics technique called Artistoon, with which the game renders cel-shaded graphics; additionally, Araki's art was featured in the game. Capcom planned to release the game in North America and Europe, but after delays, it ended up not getting released outside Japan. Critics praised the game's visuals and presentation, commenting <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> recreated {{the look of the}} manga well, while the gameplay was met by mixed opinions.|$|E
5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone {{with the}} Wind {{set a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. Gone with the Wind also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is interpreted. The running time for Gone with the Wind is just under 221minutes, while Lawrence of Arabia (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, Gone with the Wind lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while Lawrence of Arabia comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus <b>on</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw symphysis, which he found best compared to that of the two-toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E
