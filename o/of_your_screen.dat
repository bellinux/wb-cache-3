Actually firing one's weapon is a bit tough; you have no crosshairs or a weapon on screen. You must get enemies to center <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> and fire.

5000|$|Most {{skills have}} cool down times, which are {{noted by the}} skill symbol being shaded. Once all the shading has disappeared, the skill is able to be used again. A new {{addition}} to the game has been implemented in which the skills show the seconds or minutes left until the skill can be used again. Also, some Weapon and Magic skills can be chained into combos. They are noted by the flashing word [...] "Combo" [...] {{on the right side}} <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen.</b> Chaining these skills together allows the player to use them quicker, ensuring the combo will continue. However, only skills of the same tree and of the same vertical branch can be used in combos. Sometimes, it just requires the player to learn how to play their class and discover their own play style. A few classes are flexible in skills you can chain such as Sefirot and Hero.|$|E

50|$|The storyline {{begins with}} you, a {{recently}} fired news station meteorologist arguing with your former boss about getting fired for predicting bad weather all the time. You swear to get revenge on her, your replacement, {{and all of}} the town with your new invention, a weather changing device. The game takes place in the town with an aerial view. You can summon storms such as Tornadoes, Lightning Storms, Hail, Meteors, and Earthquakes. You tap the tab on the side <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> with your stylus to reveal the types of storms you can summon. Tap the storm and you need to slide your stylus in the direction you want the storm to go. To change the direction of your storm again put your stylus on the storm and slide it in another direction. Every day for six weeks on the game you will need to do another task with your device. The first day of the week you cause a certain amount of damage. The second day you need to destroy certain buildings to advance another day. After three weeks you are arrested by General Bradley Steele.|$|E

As long as you hold the Space Bar down, the region’s size is locked and it can be dragged about. • Shift: Press and hold the Shift key, and one side of the region will be locked, based on which way you then move the mouse. For instance, if you press and hold Shift, and then move your mouse down, you’ll only be able to resize the region vertically; the horizontal size will be fixed. Move the mouse left or right, and you can resize the region horizontally while holding the vertical size fixed. • Option: Press and hold Option while dragging your region, and you’ll change the way the region grows as you drag. By default, your region is anchored at the upper left corner; when you press Option, the anchor point is moved to the center of the current region, and it expands in all directions from that point.

40|$|Many {{students}} {{consider themselves}} to be proficient searchers and yet are disappointed or frustrated {{when faced with the}} task of locating relevant scholarly articles for a literature review. This bleak experience is common among higher education students, even for those in library and information science programs who have heightened appreciation for information resources and yet may settle for “good enough Googling” (Plosker, 2004, p. 34). This is in large part due to reliance on web search engines that have evolved relevance ranking into a vastly intelligent business, one in which we are both its customers and product (Vaidhyanathan, 2011). Google’s Hummingbird nest of search algorithms (Sullivan, 2013) provides quick and targeted hits, yet it can trigger blinders-on trust in first-page results. Concern for student search practices ranges from this permissive trust all the way to lost ability to recall facts and formulate questions (Abilock, 2015), lack of confidence in one’s own knowledge (Carr, 2010), and increased dependence on single search boxes that encourage stream-of-consciousness user input (Tucker, 2013); indeed, students may be high in tech savvy but lacking the critical thinking skills needed for information research tasks (Katz, 2007). Students have come to rely on web search engine intelligence—and it is inarguably colossal—to such an extent that they may fail to formulate a question before charging forward to search for its answer. “Google is known as a search engine, yet there is barely any searching involved anymore. The gap between a question crystallizing in your mind and an answer appearing at the top <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> is shrinking all the time. As a consequence, our ability to ask questions is atrophying” (Leslie, 2015, para. 4). Highly accomplished students often lament their lack of skills for higher-level searching that calls for formulating pointed questions when struggling to develop a solid literature review. In addition, many are unaware that search results are filtered based on previous searches, location, and other factors extracted from personal search patterns by the search engine. Two students working side by side and entering the same search terms may receive quite different results on Google, yet the extent to which this ‘filter bubble’ (Pariser, 2011) is personalizing their search results is difficult to assess and to overcome. Just as important, it can be impossible to know what a search might be missing: how to know what’s not there? This portrayal of the information landscape may appear gloomy but, in fact, it could not be a more inspiring environment in which to do research, to find connections in ideas, and to benefit from and generate new ideas. A few lessons from expert searchers, focused on critical concepts and search practices, can sharpen a student’s search saw and move the proficient student-researcher, desiring more relevant and comprehensive search results, into a trajectory toward search expertise. For the lessons involved in this journey, the focus is on two areas: first, the critical concepts— called threshold concepts (Meyer & Land, 2003) — found to be necessary for developing search expertise (Tucker et al., 2014); and, second, four strategic areas within search that can have significant and immediate impact on improving search results for research literature. The latter are grounded in the threshold concepts and positioned for application to literature reviews for graduate student studies...|$|E
