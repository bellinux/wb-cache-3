In the brain, regions like the piriform cortex, olfactory bulbs, hippocampal formation, vestibular nuclei, and the wulst, are among the brain regions often discussed as involved in avian navigation. However, despite large literature showing a prominent role of some anterior and dorsal thalamic nuclei in mammalian spatial navigation, {{little is known about the}} role of the thalamus in avian navigation. Here, we analyzed a possible role of the dorsal anterior thalamic nuclei in avian navigation by combining olfactory manipulations during the transport of young homing pigeons to a release site and c-Fos immunohistochemistry for the mapping brain activity. The results reveal that odor modulated neurons in the avian dorsolateral lateral (DLL) subdivision of the anterior thalamic nuclei are actively involved in <b>processing</b> <b>outward</b> journey, navigational information. Outward journey information is used by pigeons to correctly determine the homeward direction.

40|$|The US and the EU use <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> {{arrangements}} to shift labor intensive apparel operations to neighboring countries who have significantly lower labor costs, to promote demand for their capital-intensive textiles, {{and to provide}} economic assistance to the developing countries. They stimulate foreign investment, which, in turn, determines trade flows. The investment response to preferences is gradual because there are costs associated with capital stock adjustment. ^ This study focuses mostly on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade in apparel and textiles with the Caribbean. Preferential treatment of US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade has been expanded recently by the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (TDA 2000). Tariffs were previously exempted only {{on the value of}} imported intermediates, and became zero afterwards. ^ To study <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade and the effects of trade policies in the long and short runs, a dynamic model with adjustment costs of investment is specified. The hypothesis of capital stock being the key determinant of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade flows in the short run and tariff changes having limited short-run effect on <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade is tested, using US data. Statistical tests support that hypothesis. The model is then used to simulate long-run outcomes of the introduction of TDA 2000 and the elimination of Multi-Fiber Agreement on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade in the Caribbean Basin since the latter has the potential to have significant impact on the US demand for <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> apparel. The costs and benefits of these trade policy changes are evaluated. ^ Simulations of the effects of TDA 2000 for Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica showed that most of the adjustment of capital and trade would occur over 5 years, increasing trade by 12 % to 24 %. The elimination of MFA quotas, depending on the magnitude of its impact on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> (OP) demand, has the potential to eliminate the gains resulting from the adoption of TDA 2000.

40|$|The {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe have displayed widely disparate trade performance {{since the beginning}} of the transition. The Czech Republic and Hungary have had some success moving into the production and export of more technologically-sophisticated, higher value-added goods, while Bulgaria and Slovakia have continued to specialize, sometimes increasingly, in low-skill, low-value-added goods. Poland and Romania are intermediate cases. In Poland, different parts of the economy show each of these tendencies. In Romania, performance is very different in different periods – significantly better after 1994 than before. In accounting for these patterns, our analysis points to the importance of direct foreign investment (DFI) and <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade. DFI has been an engine of technological and organization learning, but it has been significant only in the Czech Republic, Hungary and, most recently, Poland. Outward-processing trade (OPT) is widely spread and helps to explain the strong export performance of the region. The technological and organizational implications of OPT are, however, less obviously favourable: in particular, it does not encourage the development of differentiated, price-insensitive export products that offer countries insulation from foreign competition.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s the European apparel sector has {{witnessed}} a dramatic transformation. Driven by increasing costs in Western Europe, major Western apparel retailers and buyers have expanded their contracting of production into lower cost regions of `postcommunist' Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. One consequence {{of these changes}} is a burgeoning of apparel producers in peripheral European and North African regions, locked into supply relations with Western buyers. Equally apparent is a dramatic growth in apparel trade between the European Union (EU) and the countries of East - Central Europe (ECE). For much of the 1990 s these processes were driven by <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade arrangements between EU countries and applicant states in ECE, along with the EU customs union with Turkey.

A special case is represented by the SMEs operating on the basis of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade type of subcontracting, a business form characteristic for a large number of foreign investments operating on the Romanian market in the clothing industry, their competitive advantage being represented by the low cost production; it implies, also, a low cost of the workforce. In these conditions, one raises the question of the existence of ISR and of its forms of manifestations, the main hypothesis being that if the ISR exists, it is limited by the pursued advantage of the lowest costs possible and it is not formally practiced. This hypothesis was partially confirmed by the results of our case study, the most important finding being that of the necessity for the enterprise to practice some forms of ISR, as a result of contextual factors (cultural and socio-economical) influence, in order to efficiently function, it couldn't be possible only through the pursuit of low costs competitive advantage. internal social responsibility; competitive advantage; SMEs; lohn (<b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade); clothing industry; case study. ...|$|E

The analysis is set {{against the background of}} the process of regional integration between the EU and its neighbouring developing countries. The underlying question is whether trade integration fosters or dampens learning and technological upgrading. We find that unit values of exports from these countries to the EU rose steadily between 1988 and 1996, relative to the unit values of world exports to Europe. If increases in unit values satisfactorily proxy increases in product quality, then trade integration has fostered product upgrading and technological learning in the sample countries. We find that imported technologies and other sources of knowledge have a strong bearing on this pattern. Technological inflows are captured by the degree of involvement of European companies in export flows from our sample countries (<b>Outward</b> <b>Processing</b> Trade) and by the skill content of the machines imported. export performance, regional integration, technology imports, textile industry...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of globalisation of production in some footwear Italian districts. The aim is to investigate and compare the position of those districts in the process of fragmentation of production that affected the Italian footwear sector in the last few years. The following questions are tackled: Are Italian footwear districts specialising in some particular phases of the production cycle? Is there any common trend towards a reduction of activities carried out within the districts? Or, instead, are different patterns emerging according to districts’ main segment of market and according to the value chains (top brand, low brand, mass market) they belong to? This study explores these issues by analysing the pattern of fragmentation of production in the footwear sector at provincia level, with data on <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade (OPT) collected by Associazione Nazionale Calzaturieri Italiani (ANCI). Furthermore, it focuses on two case studies, Brenta and Barletta, in order to compare two districts characterised by a specialisation in different segments of the market. In the footwear districts investigated, we find evidence of differences in international delocalisation strategies and argue that these different patterns of specialisation are closely related with clusters’ market position. We suggest that the diverse patterns of specialisation condition the potential for industrial upgrading. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{some aspects of}} trade and {{investment}} relations between the EU and the countries {{of central and eastern}} Europe (CEEC). The approach used is based on a model of trade with, and development of, a frontier by a metropolitan economy developed by Ronald Findlay. Findlay’s model posits the existence of a monopolised supply of an input to the metropolitan economy. Development of the frontier enables the metropolitan economy to break the monopoly. The expansion of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade between the EU and the CEEC, a form of intra-industry trade, is a notable feature of economic relations in Europe since the fall of the Soviet empire. This is modelled in the paper as a device whereby a supply side constraint (labour market restrictions) within the EU is relaxed by vertical disintegration of production and relocation outside the EU. This in turn has implications for the incorporation of the CEEC in the EU. While they remain outside the EU they provide regime competition, particularly in the area of labour market policy.

40|$|The {{work offers}} a new {{treatment}} of the labour market effects of international trade building on recent developments {{in the literature on}} intra-industry trade (IIT) stressing the importance of vertical IIT. The central idea is that heterogeneity of traded goods plays a crucial role both in terms of quality differentiation and vertical fragmentation of production. The basic concepts are presented in the introductory chapter. The second chapter presents an econometric study which shows that the role of factor intensity in IIT requires that different forms of IIT are properly distinguished. In the third chapter the evaluation of the impact of trade on labour markets is studied in a model in which IIT is explained on Heckscher-Ohlin principles. Applying the model to trade between Italy and less advanced countries and inferring the factor content of intra-industry trade from the inter-sectoral relationship between factor intensity and average unit values of exports, I find that the labour market effects f intra-industry trade add significantly to the estimated factor market impact of trade.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Europe Agreements, implicit trade preferences {{given to the}} Central and East European countries (CEECs) {{and their impact on}} European Community (EC) members. As expected, South European countries compete in the same range of products and in a more similar quality market with the CEECs than do other EC countries. A significant part of this trade is explained by outward-processing trade (OPT) of clothing, however. EC firms increasingly move the labour-intensive stages of production to the CEECs. OPT competes in a different quality market than `direct' trade. Up to 1993, trade policy favoured <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> and was against `direct' trade and foreign direct investment. We draw some lessons from a similar experience in Portugal regarding OPT movements, foreign direct investment and effects of trade policy changes. During the CEECs' transition period, the policy bias will be eliminated. EC firms may go on processing products in the CEECs or may move elsewhere. The competitive pressures on South European countries will not change with further trade liberalization towards the CEECs because those pressures are unlikely to depend on OPT location. New OPT legislation designed to keep employment in the EC may have distributive effects among EC countries, however. The CEECs are the most likely to suffer from the proposed legislation if it is strictly applied. Textiles and Clothing; Trade Integration; Trade Policy...|$|E
40|$|The Pearl River Delta {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} cases of economic re-integration after a long period of separation. Hong Kong's traditional policy of non-interventionism and China's open-door policy have induced a rapid increase in cross-border trade, <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> and outward investment. The paper focuses on the different modes of integration as well as on the driving forces behind. It argues that small- and medium- sized enterprises have played the pivotal role in the Delta's economic development. Their cross-border operations have been mainly facilitated through two channels: through subcontracting networks among manufacturers and through links with trading houses which are frequently small in size. The paper underlines three main keys to the Delta's economic success: a non-interventionist policy favourable for growth, a pronounced outward orientation in business which consequently exploits complementaries in comparative advantages and, last but not least, the so-called Chinese factor - the special attitudes adopted by local entrepreneurs, their adaptability and flexibility, their work ethics and their common cultural heritage. In some respects, the Pearl River Delta can serve as a model for developing border regions in Central Europe along the former Iron Curtain. Despite their great potential, these regions are integrating only slowly. The paper suggests that border regions after a long period of political and economic division are predestined to become an economic power-house. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth in}} exports from Central and Eastern Europe to Western markets {{suggests}} that entrepreneurs {{have responded to}} changed incentives by restructuring their production to capture new markets. The absence {{of change in the}} structure of exports, however, suggests that these restructuring efforts have not been significant. This article analyzes the magnitude of the change in export structure across the Central and Eastern European countries in 1990 – 95, focusing in particular on trade with the European Union. It finds that imports of intermediate inputs and machinery are an important determinant of the changes in export structure. Sourcing of inputs from abroad is a major factor underlying the expansion of exports to the European Union. <b>Outward</b> <b>processing</b> (subcontracting) arrangements and foreign direct investment have a smaller impact. Except for Poland, inflows of foreign direct investment are statistically insignificant or negatively associated with measures of revealed comparative advantage. This suggests that foreign investors have chosen sectors in which the Central and Eastern European countries were not relatively specialized under central planning. Following the demise of central planning, Central and Eastern European countries experienced severe economic shocks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{examines}} {{the development and}} causes of territorial inequalities in the postcommunist economies of East - Central Europe (ECE), with a specific focus on the Slovak Republic (Slovakia). He begins by examining the extent of regional economic differentiation in ECE, {{within the context of}} the European Union (EU) enlargement process, and argues that an EU of twenty-five or twenty-seven states will face enormous territorial inequality. Through a specific examination of the experience of Slovakia he then goes on to examine some of the determinants and trajectories of these territorial inequalities. Specifically, he focuses on the contribution of relative regional industrial productivity trends in the second half of the 1990 s to the endurance of territorial disparities. A decomposition of regional productivity and employment across industrial sectors is provided to examine some of the reasons for the comparative performance of Slovakia's regional economies. Attention is paid to the role of key strategic inward investment projects in the upgrading of particular regional industrial sectors. In contrast, other forms of global integration through, for example, <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> of clothing for the EU market have, in other regions, been unable to stimulate a positive upgrading of regional productivity. Indeed, it is argued that the challenge for transitional economies such as Slovakia in the early part of the 21 st century is how to manage the process of increasing, yet geographically uneven, global and European economic integration at the same time as ensuring that territorial and social inequalities are reduced. ...|$|E

And {{at the same time it}} is a crucial part for the completion of the course. This paper contains data collected from JBL Bogra Branch where their operations and banking system is mentioned in details. In addition, this report contains the company’s background, front desk task, account’s department, clearing section, SWOT analysis, critical observation and findings, suggestions, management structure and control system and lastly recommendation. Here we learnt the real life experience of working in corporate world. In front desk I learn the account opening task and the needed documents for it. In accounts department it has taught me transferring balance, statement of accounts, PO order, EFTN e. t. c I also got a very little chance to know about the LC and Remittance. In clearing section I learnt the inward and <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> and about latest technology that the bank use is called EFTN. The role of Bangladesh Bank in guiding the commercial banks like JBL. It was a great opportunity for me to have a such a wonder experience. Jarin SubhaB. Business Administratio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{countries}} of the southern Mediterranean should move beyond free trade towards deeper forms of integration with the EU through a selective harmonization of their regulatory frameworks with those of the European Single Market. In the transport sector, such deeper integration would amount {{to the creation of a}} ‘common transport space ’ in which a wide range of bottlenecks, frictions, and inefficiencies in the region’s multimodal system would be removed in order to facilitate the flow of goods, people, and investments. The paper discusses the various national and cross-border reforms that would have to be implemented to achieve that objective. It analyses sector performance and sector policies in the Mediterranean Partners (MPs) and benchmarks them against international best practice. It reviews the policy framework and reform trends in the European Union. It analyses the linkages between transport sector policies and regional integration in North America, Eastern European, and the Baltic Sea region. It reviews the implications of business trends such as supply-chain management and <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade for the participation of the southern Mediterranean countries in European production networks. And it discusses issues such as the relevance of the thirdparty logistics industry, the policy implications of multimodal transport, or the concept of transport corridors. With the majority of cross-border transport flows in the region carried by sea or air, the reform needs and reform options for these two modes receive particular attention 1. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and Deeper Integration The main economic pillar of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) is the creation of a free-trade area (FTA) between the 15 countries of the European Union (EU) and their 1...|$|E
40|$|The Slovak {{clothing}} sector {{seems to}} have a number of relative competitive strengths and limitations within this broader context of EU?ECE trade liberalisation and growth of clothing exports. In terms of strengths, three issues are key. First, like other ECE countries, Slovakia is achieving increasing access to EU markets for its relatively high-value products. These are more competitive in the EU market in terms of value than those from lower cost neighbouring states, such as Ukraine. Second, part of the competitive strength of the clothing production system in Slovakia (as elsewhere) is derived from the distinct regional agglomerations of textiles and clothing producers in two main regions, Trenlin and Prestov (see Smith, 2003). Much recent attention in economic geography has been focused on regional agglomeration and the competitive underpinnings of regional economic success (Scott, 1988, 1998; Storper, 1995, 1997). Together, the two main regional agglomerations of clothing producers in Slovakia embody many of the features of such industrial districts found in Western Europe and North America, including dense forms of local co-operation between firms. Co-operation and contracting between firms has enabled export oriented firms to respond flexibly to the uncertain and unpredictable demands from EU buyers. In addition, there is some evidence of firm upgrading in which managers have been able to develop more independent market access of their own brand clothing thus reducing their reliance on western buyers. However, as Smith (2003) has argued elsewhere, such agglomerations are also characterised by unequal power relations between Slovak manufacturers and EU buyers, between core contracting firms in such regions and other local producers who play a more marginal role, and between firms and their workers given that wage levels remain low in the clothing sector. There are also a number of strategic limits to the continued growth of the Slovak clothing export system. First, it is clear that producers face continuous costs pressures. Pressure for wage increases in a very low pay sector is apparent. Many firms have suggested that worker retention has become an issue because of low wages. Firms have sought out ways of coping with such pressures through other mechanisms such as subsidised transportation (Smith, 2003). Elsewhere, in Bulgaria, Pickles (2002) has found that firms have also been forced to respond to the temporal flexibility required by workers also engaged in supplementing household income through seasonal agricultural employment and work. Cost pressures are also experienced in the emergence of new competitors in lower cost areas, such as Ukrainian firms, although, as we have seen, this is counterbalanced by the quality differences of clothing production between Slovakia and Ukraine. Nevertheless, if Ukrainian producers are able to upgrade quality to match (if not surpass) Slovak levels then competitive pressures will intensify. Furthermore, EU membership may increase costs for Slovak producers, through the costs of implementing otherwise desirable employment and environmental legislative requirements. The effect may be to stimulate a further off-shoring of production to newer producing regions, such as those in the former Soviet Union. Second, it is clear that reliance on <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> strategies has failed to develop significant design capability in Slovakia. While there are cases of design intensity in production in some firms, it is clear that being locked into <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> forms of production has not enabled the transfer of technology and knowledge to enable many Slovak firms to develop design capability. Rather, reliance on western designs, brands and trademarks remains predominant in the Slovak clothing sector. However, the development of design capability is seen as necessary in order to upgrade production and move out of low-cost production. Third, and finally, there is a general absence of specific regional policies to promote upgrading in the clothing sector and those policies that do exist are limited in scope. However, there is evidence from western Europe – notably from Italy – that a dense tissue of regional institutions involved in providing credit, technological support and employment training can be important in the sustenance and potential upgrading of clothing sectors. Whether, however, such policy foci would help to overcome the continual pressure for cost reduction and low wages in what, after all, is an increasingly globalised manufacturing sector remains an open question, and the experience of higher cost locations in the EU and USA suggest that cost imperatives may determine the fate of even relatively high quality production in central Europe...|$|E
