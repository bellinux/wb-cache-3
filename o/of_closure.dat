50|$|If a {{collection}} of sets is locally finite, the collection <b>of</b> all <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> these sets is also locally finite. The {{reason for this is}} that if an open set containing a point intersects the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> a set, it necessarily intersects the set itself, hence a neighborhood can intersect at most the same number <b>of</b> <b>closures</b> (it may intersect fewer, since two distinct, indeed disjoint, sets can have the same closure). The converse, however, can fail if the <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> the sets are not distinct. For example, in the finite complement topology on R the collection of all open sets is not locally finite, but the collection <b>of</b> all <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> these sets is locally finite (since the only closures are R and the empty set).|$|R

Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased to generate electricity on 26 October 1981.

For Dynkin quivers of type $A$, we describe explicit minimal generators of the defining ideals <b>of</b> orbit <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> 1 -step representations.

5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat <b>of</b> <b>closure.</b> In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have been taken over by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E

5|$|During {{the casino}} {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just {{a small fraction of the}} state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat <b>of</b> <b>closure</b> as it did in 2006.|$|E

In order to replace these, the central cab road was removed, and two new platforms numbered 2 and 3 were created in its place. The run-down lines into Marylebone were modernised with new signalling and higher line speeds. In 1991, the fleet of Class 115 trains on local services was replaced by Class 165 Turbo trains, and service frequencies were increased. Services to Banbury were extended to the reopened Birmingham Snow Hill station in 1993, creating the first long-distance service into Marylebone since 1966. Initially this service ran at two-hourly intervals, but it proved popular and was increased to an hourly frequency in 1994.|$|E
