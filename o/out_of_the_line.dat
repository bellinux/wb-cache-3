5|$|The {{engagement}} at Montbrehain was the Australian Corps' last {{contribution to}} the war and they were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> training when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. Total Australian casualties on the Western Front numbered 181,000, including 46,000 of whom died. Another 114,000 men were wounded, 16,000 gassed, and approximately 3,850 were taken prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} from the line for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order {{to make up for the}} losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its objectives and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon {{had managed to}} cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> {{operations}} on <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> nine <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line's</b> 13 stations are staffed {{and operated by}} sub-contracted employees from the security company Alsok. Operations at Omachi Nishi-koen Station will also be sub-contracted to Alsok from fiscal 2018, leaving only the two termini and Sendai Station staffed by Sendai City Transportation Bureau employees.|$|R
50|$|A pinned piece {{can usually}} {{no longer be}} counted on as a defender of another {{friendly}} piece (that is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pinning <b>line</b> <b>of</b> attack) or as an attacker of an opposing piece (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pinning <b>line).</b> However, a pinned piece can still check the opposing king - and therefore still can defend friendly pieces against captures made by the enemy king.|$|R
50|$|The L-Line is a {{rail line}} {{that runs from}} Winston Salem, North Carolina to Mooresville, North Carolina and it is owned and {{operated}} by the Norfolk Southern Railway; <b>the</b> <b>line</b> is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Piedmont Division. <b>The</b> <b>line</b> crosses <b>the</b> S-Line at Barber, North Carolina, where most trains are based <b>out</b> <b>of.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line's</b> end point at Mooresville is joined with the O-Line which runs from Mooresville to Charlotte, North Carolina.|$|R
5|$|On 2 October the {{majority}} of the 3rd Division was removed from the line for rest and reorganisation, although a number of its artillery batteries would continue to support the operations of the II American Corps until they were withdrawn. Following this they continued to participate in the fighting in support of the British 6th Division. The 27th Battery fired the division's last shot of the war on 4 November at Wassigny. Nevertheless, the division was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> when news of the Armistice came on 11 November 1918. Following the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began and as men were repatriated back to Australia, the division was eventually disbanded on 28 May 1919.|$|E
5|$|The damage Vertu {{had taken}} {{early in the}} combat {{rendered}} Lhermitte unable to continue the action, and his ship gradually fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to the south. Captain Pierre Julien Tréhouart turned Cybèle away too, using sweeps to reach Vertu and take the ship under tow. With Vertu secured and Arrogant slowly coming back into range, Sercey ordered his squadron to turn away to the north at 10:55, the last shots fired at long range from Victorious at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} throughout 1918 had heavily depleted the Australian units, {{which had}} been unable to make good their losses, and on 5 October, the entire Australian Corps was withdrawn for rest and reorganisation. The battalion remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> until the war ended in November, after which they began to demobilise. The process was slow as personnel were repatriated back to Australia in drafts and consequently the battalion was not disbanded until March 1919. Throughout the war, casualties amongst the 28th totalled 787 killed and 2,241 wounded. The battalion received 17 battle honours for its war service, which were bestowed in 1927.|$|E
50|$|The Lincolns {{suffered}} {{heavy losses}} during <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Jarama. On February 27, 1937, the unit lost {{two-thirds of its}} strength, including their commander, Robert Hale Merriman (who was badly wounded), in a futile assault on Nationalist positions. The battalion remained in combat and was slowly rebuilt while maintaining its front-line positions. The unit was finally pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> for a brief rest before the offensive at Brunete.|$|R
5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment were driven <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 52nd (Lowland) Division, in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> being relieved, {{returned to the}} front, closed the gap, and pushed the Ottoman soldiers back <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> communication.|$|R
50|$|At the {{component}} level, boost pressure {{can either be}} bled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control <b>lines</b> or blocked outright. Either can achieve <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> reducing pressure pushing against the wastegate. In a bleed-type system air is allowed to pass <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control <b>lines,</b> reducing <b>the</b> load on the wastegate actuator. On a blocking configuration, air traveling from the charge air supply to the wastegate actuator is blocked while simultaneously bleeding any pressure that has previously built up at the wastegate actuator.|$|R
5|$|After a {{few days}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, {{a few days}} later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips to move <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold {{on the underside of the}} weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound {{were able}} to {{establish}} that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours {{in an effort to}} confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, bringing up the rear of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.|$|E
50|$|In March 1945 the {{division}} was pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>lines,</b> but remained under <b>the</b> operational control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Ukrainian Front until August 15, 1945.|$|R
50|$|Pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>line,</b> <b>the</b> 503 {{officers}} {{and men were}} hurried by lorry to Vieux-Berquin in the Lys area where a German offensive had broken through.|$|R
50|$|Technically, Fremont and Dublin/Pleasanton {{passengers}} coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Millbrae/SFO <b>line</b> {{can transfer}} for trains at Daly City because Platforms 1 and 2 are for East Bay passengers.|$|R
5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford responded in HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{classified}} as a BY Draconis variable because it has regions of higher magnetic activity that move into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of sight as it rotates. Measurement of this rotational modulation suggests that its equatorial region rotates with an average period of 11.2days, which {{is less than half}} of the rotation period of the Sun. Observations have shown that Epsilon Eridani varies as much as 0.050 in V magnitude due to starspots and other short-term magnetic activity. Photometry has also shown that the surface of Epsilon Eridani, like the Sun, is undergoing differential rotation i.e. the rotation period at equator differs from that at high latitude. The measured periods range from 10.8 to 12.3 days. The axial tilt of Epsilon Eridani toward the line of sight from Earth is highly uncertain: estimates range from 24° to 72°.|$|E
5|$|In August, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery {{took over}} {{command of the}} British Eighth Army and he succeeded in {{preventing}} the Axis advance during the Battle of Alam el Halfa. Montgomery then began preparing for an Allied offensive against the Axis forces that were now entrenching themselves. The Second Battle of El Alamein started on 23 October and finished on 7 November with Axis forces withdrawing westwards towards Fuka to avoid encirclement. The 2/48th Battalion was engaged around Tel el Eisa, {{on the right of}} the Allied line near the coast, during this period, as the 20th and 26th Brigades pushed westwards and then endured numerous counterattacks as the Germans sought to regain control of the strategically important coast road. By the end of the month, the battalion had been heavily depleted. Having started with nearly 700 men in the line, after a week of fighting, the battalion could field only 41 fit men. As a result, the 26th Brigade was rotated <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> just before the final German counterattack was repulsed, allowing the Allies to launch the final breakout phase of the operation.|$|E

5|$|In March 1916, the {{infantry}} {{units of the}} AIF were transferred from Egypt to Europe for service on the Western Front. Initially they were organised into I Anzac Corps and II Anzac Corps alongside the New Zealand Division. The 2nd Division {{was the first to}} arrive in France, followed by the 1st Division, while the 4th and 5th left Egypt later in June 1916. The 3rd Division was the last to arrive, having been formed in Australia in March 1916, and moving to England for training in July 1916, before being sent to France in December 1916. For the next {{two and a half years}} the constant rotations in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> were punctuated by a number of major battles, during which the Australians earned for themselves a formidable reputation. On 1 November 1917 the Australian divisions were re-grouped together to form the Australian Corps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening, at around 5pm, Malone {{was killed in}} his {{headquarters}} trench by friendly fire, either from supporting artillery or possibly naval gunfire. Reinforcements, {{in the form of}} the Otago Battalion and two squadrons of the Wellington Mounted Rifles arrived later that evening, and the remnants of Malone's battalion withdrew, having suffered 690 men killed or wounded of its original complement of 760. Malone, along with 300 of his men, has no known grave. Two days later, Chunuk Bair, now held by British units, was lost to the Turks. With the battalion <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> a memorial service for Malone was held on 21 August. The service was attended by nearly all of the surviving men of the battalion. Malone was also mentioned in despatches for his leadership during the August offensive.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E
50|$|Hamburger refuses {{an offer}} by General Leonard Wood {{to have her}} brother, David Hamburger, {{transferred}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>line</b> because her Socialist principles forbid her from accepting special favors; later, David loses a leg in battle.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, he {{was limited}} to only five games and two solo tackles due to a right knee injury, {{eventually}} falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defensive <b>line</b> rotation. He was left unprotected in the 1999 NFL Expansion Draft.|$|R
50|$|On May 13, 2013, <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Transport and Communications (MTC) {{said that}} the {{government}} had also awarded concessions for <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> 3 and 4 by July 2016, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>lines</b> that constitute <b>the</b> system.|$|R
5|$|Russell had {{not broken}} the French line and her {{opponent}} Témeraire {{got the better}} of her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with Trajan and Eole. Russell then fired on several passing French ships before joining Leviathan in attacking the centre of the French line. Russell's boats also took the surrender of America, her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from Royal Sovereign). Royal Sovereign lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as Terrible fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line {{on the far side of}} the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship Montagne, which had escaped from Queen Charlotte, and it was Montagne which Royal Sovereign engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by Valiant, and beginning a long-range action.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 15 July 1798 {{was a minor}} naval {{battle of}} the French Revolutionary Wars, fought off the Spanish Mediterranean coast by the Royal Navy ship of the line HMS Lion under Captain Manley Dixon and a {{squadron}} of four Spanish Navy frigates under Commodore Don Felix O'Neil. Lion {{was one of several}} ships sent into the Western Mediterranean by Vice-Admiral Earl St Vincent, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet based at the Tagus in Portugal during the late spring of 1798. The Spanish squadron was a raiding force that had sailed from Cartagena in Murcia seven days earlier, and was intercepted while returning to its base after an unsuccessful cruise. Although together the Spanish vessels outweighed the British ship, individually they were weaker and Commodore O'Neil failed to ensure that his manoeuvrees were co-ordinated. As a result, one of the frigates, Santa Dorotea, fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of battle and was attacked by Lion.|$|E
5|$|To divert German {{troops from}} the Anzio {{landings}} (Operation Shingle), the Fifth Army was ordered to advance towards Cassino and Frosinone before 22 January, D-Day for the operation. To provide a reserve for the army group, the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to the Naples area. The division {{became part of the}} ad hoc New Zealand Corps after its reinforcement by the 4th Indian Division and the regiment was posted above the Volturno River around the village of Raviscanina. Arriving on 22 January, it moved forward to an assembly area at Stazione di Toro on 6 February. The Fifth Army advance had stalled and the 2nd New Zealand Division moved into the line. Three days later the regiment replaced the 21st Battalion on the Gari river, opposite Sant'Angelo. On 15 February, the Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino was bombed and two days later the Maori Battalion attacked the Cassino railway station. There was only enough space for a two-company advance, so Divisional Cavalry and 24th Battalion machine-gunned and mortared the area to their front to create the impression of a larger attack. The regiment laid down a mortar barrage on its front to screen the Maoris with smoke. The Maori Battalion advanced to the railway station but was forced back over the Rapido in the late afternoon. Div Cav moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to Monte Trocchio on 23 February and was relieved by the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment from the British 78th Division. On 15 March, the Monte Cassino assault resumed, and C Squadron kept the Route 6 bridge over the Gari-Rapido shrouded from German observation with smoke. The regiment pulled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> on 20 March, taking up the new left flank of New Zealand Division along the Gari River and was relieved on 9 April by the 22nd Battalion.|$|E
2500|$|By 1987, the MTA's {{contractors}} {{had concluded}} that the tunnel was structurally sound, although federal funding {{had not yet been}} released. On February 6, 1987, the MTA approved a new plan to have the tunnel open by October 1989. The agency also proposed a $550 million, 1,500-foot connector to both the express and local tracks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IND Queens Boulevard <b>Line.</b> Under <b>the</b> plan, <b>the</b> Queens Boulevard <b>Line</b> would be [...] "reverse-signaled", which would accommodate Manhattan-bound trains on three <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line's</b> four tracks in the morning rush, and the opposite for the evening rush.

25|$|Planners {{argued that}} if Kesselring (in charge of German forces in Italy) pulled troops <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gustav <b>Line</b> {{to defend against}} the Allied assault, then Allied forces {{would be able to}} break through the line; if Kesselring didn't pull troops <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gustav <b>Line,</b> then Operation Shingle would {{threaten}} to capture Rome and cut off the German units defending <b>the</b> Gustav <b>Line.</b> Should Germany have adequate reinforcements available to defend both Rome and <b>the</b> Gustav <b>Line,</b> <b>the</b> Allies felt that the operation would nevertheless be useful in engaging forces which could otherwise be committed on another front. The operation was officially canceled on December 18, 1943. However, it was later reselected.|$|R
50|$|Mandl took a {{liking to}} Irma Grese, whom she {{promoted}} to head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian women's camp at Birkenau.

At Auschwitz, Mandl was known as The Beast, {{and for the next}} two years she participated in selections for death and other documented abuses. She signed inmate lists, sending an estimated half a million women and children to their deaths in the gas chambers at Auschwitz I and II.|$|R
