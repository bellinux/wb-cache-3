40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{three classes}} of real-valued functions on intervals, <b>operator</b> monotone functions, <b>operator</b> convex functions, and strongly <b>operator</b> convex functions. Strongly <b>operator</b> convex functions were previously treated in [3] and [4], where <b>operator</b> algebraic semicontinuity theory or <b>operator</b> theory were substantially used. In this paper we provide an alternate treatment that uses only <b>operator</b> inequalities (or even just matrix inequalities).

Using this and previously known results, we provide some methods for constructing new functions in one of the three classes from old ones.
