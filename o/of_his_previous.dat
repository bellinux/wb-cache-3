5|$|After {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> film The Life of Oharu, Mizoguchi was offered {{to make a}} film by his old friend Masaichi Nagata at Daiei Film studios. The deal promised Mizoguchi {{complete}} artistic control and a large budget. Despite this, Mizoguchi was eventually pressured to make a less pessimistic ending for the film. Mizoguchi's sceenwriter and long-time collaborator Yoshikata Yoda said that originally, Mizoguchi did not envision making an anti-war film, instead wishing to capture the sensations and lucidity of Ueda's book Ugetsu Monogatari.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{internal}} references {{that they often}} make to earlier passages within them, Schubert's last sonatas contain distinct allusions and resemblances to some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> works, mostly earlier piano works, {{as well as many}} of his songs. Important similarities also exist between certain passages in the sonatas and works from other genres that were composed in parallel, during the same months in 1828.|$|E
5|$|David Villa {{ended the}} season with a large amount of his {{appearances}} coming from the bench, partly due to the recovery time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> injury.

The film script that Basu wrote alternated between two time periods, and he retained the nonlinear narrative structure. He {{said that the}} script required a 30-year time span for the characters' love to grow and thus set {{the backdrop of the}} film in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Florida State placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, who {{was born}} in Poland, also was a key {{component}} of the Seminoles' scoring offense.

5|$|In December 1933, Marquis {{began his}} last book, Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand. Marquis {{considered}} this {{his most important}} work– the subject was his central interest and he regarded much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> work as mere preparation for it. The book was completed in March 1934. However, his publisher, the Midwest Company, {{went out of business}} shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira's {{previous}} births {{are discussed}} in Jain texts such as the Mahapurana and Tri-shashti-shalaka-purusha-charitra. While a soul undergoes countless reincarnations in the transmigratory cycle of saṃsāra (world), the births of a Tirthankara are reckoned {{from the time he}} determined the causes of karma and developed the Ratnatraya. Jain texts discuss 26 births of Mahavira before his incarnation as a Tirthankara. According to the texts, Mahavira was born as Marichi, the son of Bharata Chakravartin, in one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> births.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{concepts}} had become U.S. policy, Kennan began {{to criticize the}} foreign policies that he had seemingly helped begin. Subsequently, prior {{to the end of}} 1948, Kennan became confident that positive dialogue could commence with the Soviet government. His proposals were discounted by the Truman administration and Kennan's influence was marginalized, particularly after Dean Acheson was appointed Secretary of State in 1949. Soon thereafter, U.S. Cold War strategy assumed a more assertive and militaristic quality, causing Kennan to lament about what he believed was an abrogation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> assessments.|$|E
5|$|The album {{features}} a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes {{inspiration from the}} apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson. Stevens' use of electronics marked {{a radical departure from}} much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan. Unlike Illinois, the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level.|$|E

5|$|To {{cope with}} this {{additional}} workload, Hergé approached a friend whom he had met through Van Melkebeke, Edgar P. Jacobs, to aid him as a cartoonist and colourist. Jacobs could only work on the project part time, and so in March 1942 Hergé also employed a woman named Alice Devos to aid him. In July 1942, Hergé then procured an agent, Bernard Thièry, who took 40% of his commissions; their working relationship would be strained. With their assistance, from 1942 to 1947, Hergé adapted most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> Adventures of Tintin into 62-page colour versions.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{expiration}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>previous</b> contract, Niedermayer was again a restricted free agent, and he again endured a difficult negotiation with the Devils, {{even after he}} changed agents. Initially demanding a five-year, $45 million contract, Niedermayer chose to go to arbitration. He was awarded a one-year contract for the 2004–05 season, and the $7 million salary he was given tied John LeClair's award in 2000 as the highest ever given in arbitration. However, the contract was wiped out when the entire season was cancelled {{as a result of}} the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E

In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His relative lack of seniority did not afford him much influence.|$|E
