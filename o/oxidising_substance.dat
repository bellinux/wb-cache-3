The enzyme NADPH oxidase generates superoxide within the phagosome, which is converted via hydrogen peroxide to other <b>oxidising</b> <b>substances</b> like hypochlorous acid which kill phagocytosed pathogens. In individuals with {{chronic granulomatous disease}} (CGD) there is a defect in producing peroxide via mutations in phagocyte oxidases such as myeloperoxidase. Normal cellular metabolism will still produce {{a small amount of}} peroxide and this peroxide can be used to produce hypochlorous acid to eradicate the bacterial infection. However, if individuals with CGD are infected with catalase-positive bacteria, the bacterial catalase can destroy the excess peroxide before {{it can be used to}} produce other <b>oxidising</b> <b>substances.</b> In these individuals the pathogen survives and becomes a chronic infection. This chronic infection is typically surrounded by macrophages in an attempt to isolate the infection. This wall of macrophages surrounding a pathogen is called a granuloma. Many bacteria are catalase positive, but some are better catalase-producers than others. The mnemonic [...] "cats Need PLACESS to Belch their Hairballs" [...] can be used to memorise the catalase-positive bacteria: nocardia, pseudomonas, listeria, aspergillus, candida, E. coli, staphylococcus, serratia, B. cepacia and H. pylori.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a numerical study of the kinetics of electrochemical oxidation of different organic substances at boron doped diamond (BDD). It is well established that oxidation of organics at BDD anodes takes place in the potential region of oxygen evolution, through reaction steps in which OH radicals are involved: these radicals can react with organic compounds to give more <b>oxidised</b> <b>substances,</b> or with water to give oxygen. Because of the high reactivity of OH radicals these reactions are confined to a thin film adjacent to the electrode surface. A mathematical model was implemented, which accounts for chemical and electrochemical reactions, {{as well as for the}} transport phenomena involved in the process: the parameters of the model were derived from experimental data. The model allowed calculation of the trend with time of reactant concentration, reaction intermediates and oxidisable agents: their space profiles in the reactor were also obtained. The numerical predictions of the model were compared with experimental results obtained from galvanostatic electrolyses of different organic compounds: (a) 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxy- 1, 3, 5 triazine also known as cyanuric acid (CA), which is well known to be refractory to oxidation with OH; (b) atrazine (ATR) the most oxidisable precursor of CA, and (c) phenol which is considered as an OH scavenger because of its high reactivity. The agreement between experimental and model predicted data was good in all the examined conditions...|$|R
30|$|Disinfectants are {{chemicals}} that {{are able to}} reduce the amount of germs on objects to be disinfected. They are regulated mainly in the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) 528 / 2012 [1]. They are used in several sectors by professional and non-professional users. The BPR separates disinfectants in five product types (Annex V): human hygiene, disinfectants and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals, veterinary hygiene, food and feed area and drinking water [1]. In the professional sector, the use of disinfectants is very important to avoid infections, e.g. in hospitals or the food industry. The use of disinfectants in private homes by non-professional users however is intensely debated amongst scientists: In Germany, it is widely accepted that disinfectants should only be used by private persons if there are medical indications [2]. These might be infectious diseases of family members or if people in need of care are living in the household. The limitation of uses is due to the fact that disinfectants do not only inherit benefits but also might pose risks to humans and the environment [2]. Studies show that the use of disinfectants is only significantly reducing bacterial contamination in households if users follow a strict cleaning protocol [3, 4]. In a setting where households were not informed how to use a disinfectant, the prevalence of bacterial contamination was not reduced [3]. A study on the effects of antibacterial products on infectious disease symptoms showed that using antibacterial products did not result in a reduction of the primarily viral infectious disease symptoms [5]. Reports of resistances are often accompanied by reports of wrong uses or insufficient cleaning [6]. This may also cause cross-resistances to antibiotics [7]. For example, it is under discussion whether a resistance to benzalkonium chloride, a disinfectant, might lead to a resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin [8]. For many disinfecting substances, data on possible cross-resistances is not available; and for this reason, it is unclear which active substances pose the highest risks of these cross-resistances [7]. However, quaternary ammonium compounds, biguanides (i.e. surface active agents) and phenolics are considered as high-risk biocides concerning resistance problems [7]. For several substances (isothiazolones, anilides, diamidines, inorganic acids and their esters, alcohols), little information is available on resistance or tolerance [7]. Due to ‘the nature of their interaction with the bacterial cell and their antimicrobial efficacy’ [7], the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) considers them as medium-risk biocides. Several disinfectants have irritating or sensitising properties. A study showed that concentrations of the sensitising substances CMI/MI, glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde and chloroacetamide in disinfectants are in the same order of magnitude that leads to sensitising effects in laboratory tests [9]. Risks for the human health were especially high for spray applications or the use of concentrates for the cleaning of surfaces [9]. Some disinfectants or their metabolites can reach the environment. For example, the metabolite of triclosan, methyl-triclosan, was detected in surface waters [10] and biota [11]. Triclosan is also used in cosmetic products and in these cases does not fall under the BPR. Especially disinfection-by-products (DBP) which result from the reaction of halogenated <b>oxidising</b> <b>substances</b> with organic matter might pose risks that we are not aware of at the moment [12].|$|R
40|$|Low-grade coal, a poor {{source of}} energy, {{has long been}} {{regarded}} as waste material by the coal mining industry. Biological degradation of this coal material by ligninolytic fungal strains presents a viable strategy towards eliminating this unusable fossil fuel. To this end, a novel and patented bioprocess termed Fungcoal was developed. Fungcoal is a biological process utilised in the in situ treatment of waste coal {{and is based on}} the mutualistic relationship between the fungus Neosartorya fischeri and the graminaceous species Cynodon dactylon. The process facilitates the rapid conversion of waste coal into soil-like material that stimulates establishment of vegetation for eventual coal dump rehabilitation. While a number of in vitro studies have identified various fungal strains as efficient coal degraders, the mechanisms involved in the Fungcoal-stimulated degradation process have not been fully elucidated. Furthermore, implementation of Fungcoal at both pilot and commercial scale has not been achieved. Thus the objective of this work was to investigate Fungcoal as a bioprocess via examining the role of coal degrading fungi (CDF) and grasses as biocatalysts in coal biodegradation and for the self-cladding of waste coal dumps. Initially, waste coal degradation by N. fischeri, strain ECCN 84, was investigated, specifically focusing on the mechanisms underpinning the process. In vitro studies showed the addition of waste coal induced active fungal colonisation resulting in increased fungal biomass. Increased extracellular laccase (LAC) activity, occuring concomitantly with an increase in hyphal peroxisome proliferation, was also observed in the coal supplied fungal cultures. Analysis of the colonised waste coal revealed a time dependent reduction in the percentage weight of elemental carbon coupled with an increase in elemental oxygen. The results supported metabolism and degradation of waste coal by N. fischeri strain ECCN 84 and involvement of fungal extracellular laccase. The contribution of C. dactylon, a C 4 grass species to in situ biodegradation of waste coal in the presence of coal degrading and mycorrhizal fungi (MF) was also investigated. Enhanced degradation of the waste coal into a humic soil-like material was observed within the rhizosphere. Analysis of the resultant substrate revealed an increased concentration of highly <b>oxidised</b> humic-like <b>substances</b> (HS). Fungi remained viable in the rhizosphere up to 47 weeks post-inoculation and cultivation of C. dactylon, indicating the resultant humic substance-rich rhizosphere provided an environment conducive for microbial proliferation and activity. Furthermore, humic substance enrichment of waste coal substrates supported germination and seedling emergence of several agronomic species including Zea mays (corn), Phaseolus vulgaris (bean), Pisum sativum (pea), and Spinacia oleracea (spinach). Use of various cladding materials to support coal biodegradation, by fungus-grass mutualism and rehabilitation of waste dumps was evaluated at commercial scale. While substantial physico-chemical changes were not evident in the absence of cladding or where waste coal was used as cladding material, successful establishment of grass cover and diversity was achieved within three hydrological cycles on dumps cladded with weathered coal. Work presented in this thesis successfully demonstrates the degradation of waste coal by N. fischeri. The biodegradation process included enhanced extracellular LAC activity coupled with increased 3 waste coal oxidation. Increased HS concentration of waste coal substrate supported germination and early seedling establishment of several agronomic species. At commercial scale a co-substrate in the form of carbon-rich weathered coal was essential to support fungus-grass mutualism and Fungcoal-induced rehabilitation. These findings support the developed Fungcoal concept and the underpinning rationale that the phyto-biodegradation of waste coal indeed depends on the mutualistic interactions between grass root exudates and the ligninolytic and mycorrhizal fungi. Taken together, these findings provide practical evidence of the contribution of fungi and grasses as mutualists in the biodegradation of waste coal and sustainable rehabilitation of waste coal dump...|$|R
40|$|According to {{previous}} research, students show difficulties in learning redox reactions. By the historical development different redox models exist to explain redox reactions, the oxygen model, the hydrogen model, the electron {{model and the}} oxidation number model. This thesis reports about three studies concerning conceptions held by secondary school students of redox reactions. A textbook analysis is {{also included in the}} thesis. The first study was an investigation of the students’ use of redox models in inorganic contexts, their use of the activity series of metals, and the students’ ability to transfer redox knowledge. Then the students’ work with an open-ended biochemical task, where the students had access of the textbook was studied. The students talk about redox reactions, the questions raised by the students, what resources used to answer the questions and what kind of talk developed were investigated. A textbook analysis based on chemistry books from Sweden and one book from England was performed. The redox models used as well as the dealing with redox related learning difficulties was studied. Finally, the students’ conceptions about redox in inorganic, organic and biochemistry after completed chemistry courses were studied. The results show that the students were able to use the electron model as a tool to explain inorganic redox reactions and the mutuality of oxidation and reduction was fundamental. The activity series of metals became a tool for the prediction of reducing agent in some reactions. Most of the students rejected that oxygen is a prerequisite for a redox reaction. In the biochemical task the resource most used to answer the raised questions were the students’ consultation of the textbook – together or individually. Most questions resulted in short answers and the majority of these questions were answered. Questions concerning redox were analysed by the students and integrated into a chemical context but they could neither identify the <b>substances</b> <b>oxidised</b> or reduced nor couple the concepts to transfer of hydrogen atoms. The majority of these redox questions became unanswered. The textbook helped the students to structure a poster as well as to answer basic chemistry questions. For questions about organic and biochemical redox, the book was of no help. The textbook analysis showed that all historical redox models are used. Different models are used in inorganic, organic and biochemistry. The mutuality of oxidation and reduction is treated differently in subject areas. The textbooks did not help the reader linking the different redox models that were used. Few redox-related learning difficulties are addressed in the books. After completed chemistry courses the students had major problems to justify a redox reaction explained by transfer of hydrogen atoms both in the organic and biochemistry examples...|$|R
