2500|$|A Vermont civil {{union is}} nearly {{identical}} to a legal marriage, {{as far as the}} rights and responsibilities for which state law, not federal law, is responsible are concerned. It grants partners next-of-kin rights and other protections that heterosexual married couples also receive. [...] However, despite the [...] "full faith and credit" [...] clause of the United States Constitution, civil unions are generally not recognized outside Vermont in the absence of specific legislation. [...] Opponents of the law have supported the Defense of Marriage Act and the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment in order to prevent <b>obligatory</b> <b>recognition</b> of same-sex couples in other jurisdictions. [...] This means that many of the advantages of marriage, which fall in the federal jurisdiction (over 1,100 federal laws, such as joint federal income tax returns, visas and work permits for the foreign partner of a U.S. citizen, etc.), are not extended to the partners of a Vermont civil union.|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of various nucleotide substitutions in a Drosophila tRNAArg gene on in vitro transcription and stable transcription complex formation in Drosophila KcO and HeLa cell extracts. Substitutions in positions encoding the invariant G 18 and G 19 residues resulted in decreased transcription, however, the moderate decreases indicate that these nucleotides are not <b>obligatory</b> promoter <b>recognition</b> sites. An A 21 to C 21 mutation had no effect on transcription levels using homologous extract however, this mutant displayed decreased transcriptional abilities in HeLa cell extract. Nucleotide substitutions within the sequence encoding the anticodon led to a decrease in the transcription activity but not in the ability to form a stable transcription complex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCaspase- 1, a {{mediator}} of the posttranslational processing of IL- 1 Î² and IL- 18, requires an aspartic acid in the P 1 position of its substrates. The mechanisms of caspase- 1 activation remain poorly understood despite numerous {{structures of the}} enzyme complexed with aspartate-based inhibitors. Here we report a crystal structure of ligand-free caspase- 1 that displays dramatic rearrangements of loops defining the active site to generate a closed conformation that is incompatible with substrate binding. A structure of the enzyme complexed with malonate shows the protein in its open (active-site ligand-bound) conformation in which malonate reproduces the hydrogen bonding network observed in structures with covalent inhibitors. These results illustrate the essential function of the <b>obligatory</b> aspartate <b>recognition</b> element that opens the active site of caspase- 1 to substrates and may be the determinant responsible for the conformational changes between ligand-free and -bound forms of the enzyme, and suggest a new approach for identifying novel aspartic acid mimetics...|$|R
