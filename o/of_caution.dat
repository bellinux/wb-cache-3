5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} worried about exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee for the most part utilised less important agents and added words <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E

Supplemental practice was offered on 19 February 2010 to both the two-woman and four-man events out <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> and further preparation for both events that took place the following week.|$|E
5|$|With {{communism}} {{no longer}} the threat it once was, once hostile relations in the 1950s between the Philippines and China have improved greatly. Issues involving Taiwan, the Spratly Islands, and concerns of expanding Chinese influence, however, still encourage a degree <b>of</b> <b>caution.</b> Recent foreign policy has been mostly about economic relations with its Southeast Asian and Asia-Pacific neighbors.|$|E

50|$|In 1959 the Street Offences Act made a {{provision}} for removing cautions from criminal records. In 1962 Royal Commission on the Police noted {{concerns about the}} uneven enforcement <b>of</b> <b>cautions.</b> In 1978 the Home Office issued its first circular to bring about consistency in the use <b>of</b> <b>cautions</b> for juveniles, and in 1985 for adults.|$|R
5|$|Although many {{messages}} were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic {{and as a}} result was cautious about promoting it too heavily. Most of the information was sent with words <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. One of the most critical Bodyguard agents, Garbo, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional sub-agent who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|The Union's V Corps, {{commanded}} by Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, took up {{positions on the}} hill on June30. McClellan was not present for the initial exchanges of the battle, having boarded the ironclad USS Galena and sailed down the James River to inspect Harrison's Landing, where he intended to locate the base for his army. Confederate preparations were hindered by several mishaps. Bad maps and faulty guides caused Confederate Maj. Gen. John Magruder {{to be late for}} the battle, an excess <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> delayed Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger, and Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson had problems collecting the Confederate artillery.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{arranged}} for Lindwall {{to see his}} Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman’s leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman emphasized the importance <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests {{and told him that}} his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 campaign, destroying his confidence {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
50|$|Many {{football}} {{leagues and}} federations impose off-field penalties for players who accumulate {{a certain number}} <b>of</b> <b>cautions</b> in a season, tournament or phase of a tournament.

50|$|It {{is likely}} the {{practice}} <b>of</b> using police <b>cautions</b> began {{early in the}} nineteenth century. In the 1920s written warnings started being given for motoring offences. In 1928 the Home Office published statistics on cautions, and by 1931 was giving advice on the wording <b>of</b> <b>cautions.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Union {{military}} command in the West {{suffered from a}} lack of unified command, and were organized into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter; the Department of Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck; and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. By January 1862, the disunity was apparent because they could not agree on a strategy for operations in the Western Theater. Buell, under political pressure to invade and hold pro-Union eastern Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville. In Halleck's department, Grant moved up the Tennessee River to divert attention from Buell's intended advance, which did not occur. Halleck and the other generals in the West were coming under political pressure from President Abraham Lincoln to participate in a general offensive by Washington's birthday (February 22). Despite his tradition <b>of</b> <b>caution,</b> Halleck eventually reacted positively to Grant's proposal to move against Fort Henry. Halleck hoped that this would improve his standing in relation to his rival, Buell. Halleck and Grant were also concerned about rumors that Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard would soon arrive with 15 Confederate regiments. On January 30, 1862, Halleck authorized Grant to take Fort Henry.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Lindwall was {{selected}} as part of Sir Donald Bradman's Invincibles that toured England without defeat in 1948. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up {{to the start of}} the tour. Lindwall was carrying an injured leg tendon and his foot drag in the delivery stride led to murmurings in the media and among umpires as to its legality. Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who had Lindwall's leg back to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front. Bradman stated his firm belief that Lindwall's delivery was fair. During the lengthy boat journey to England, Bradman emphasized to Lindwall the importance <b>of</b> <b>caution</b> with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to keep his dragging rear right foot even further than usual, to avoid being no-balled, and to avoid bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his action. Bradman assured Lindwall that he was an automatic selection for the Tests even if he did not take a wicket in the lead-in tour matches, telling him that being passed by the umpires was the first priority. Bradman recalled how Ernie McCormick had been no-balled 35 times in traditional tour opener against Worcester during the 1938 tour, destroying his confidence. Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and so it remained for the rest of the tour.|$|E
5|$|On lap 272, Martin {{reclaimed}} {{the lead}} {{as the previous}} leaders had made their pit stops. Four laps later, the eighth caution was given because of debris on the track in turns three and four. Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution, although Martin stayed out and remained the leader on the restart. After the restart, the ninth caution was given after Reutimann and Earnhardt made contact, causing Earnhardt to collide with the turn two wall. At the lap 287 restart, Martin remained the leader ahead of Kurt Busch. One lap later, Montoya moved up into third after passing Hamlin and Johnson. On lap 289, Montoya passed Kurt Busch at the first turn for the second position. One lap later, Kurt Busch lost a further position when he was passed by Hamlin. On lap 292, Martin had a 1.1-second lead. Two laps later, the tenth caution came out after Allmendinger spun in turn two after he made contact with Marcos Ambrose. Martin led on the restart, followed by Montoya and Hamlin. On the final lap, Allmendinger spun sideways, bringing out the eleventh and final caution, and the field was frozen, with the finishing order determined by where the drivers were running at the moment <b>of</b> <b>caution.</b> The result gave Martin the victory, which was his fifth win of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Montoya in third, Johnson in fourth, and Kyle Busch in fifth. Kurt Busch, Newman, Sadler, Biffle and Bowyer rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E

25|$|The police may, {{as well as}} issuing {{the normal}} {{cautions}} (which are unconditional), issue conditional cautions.
