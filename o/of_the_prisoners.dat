5|$|Captives {{taken by}} American Indians during the American Revolution might be ransomed by the British in Detroit, adopted into the tribe, enslaved, or simply killed. However, after the Gnadenhütten massacre, the Ohio Indians had {{resolved}} to kill all American prisoners who fell into their hands. The number of Americans executed after the Sandusky expedition is unknown, since their fate was usually recorded only if one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> survived to tell.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, a reform school was created on the island, {{operating}} until 1953, {{when it was}} replaced by another in Nianing. A report submitted in 1938 by an educational advisor to Marcel de Coppet, Governor General of French West Africa, detailed the daily life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> in the school which housed up to 22 boys, mostly convicted for theft but also occasionally for murder.|$|E

5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{prisoner}}s</b> were {{marched to}} the city of Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were {{marched to the}} river Scheldt and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. The prisoners were then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The British and Hessians {{suffered}} 84 {{killed and}} 374 wounded. The Americans lost 59 killed, had 96 wounded casualties, and 2,838 men captured. Under the usual treatment of {{prisoners of war}} in the American Revolutionary War, only 800 survived their captivity to be released 18 months later in a prisoner exchange; nearly three-quarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> died.|$|E
5|$|The film {{portrays a}} {{struggle}} between inmates and the warden of a military prison, based on the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth. A highly decorated U.S. Army Lieutenant General, court martialed and sentenced for insubordination, challenges the prison commandant, a colonel, over his treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> After mobilizing the inmates, the former general leads an uprising aiming to seize control of the prison.|$|E

5|$|After initial {{organizational}} problems, the weakened detachment {{reached an}} {{area near the}} village of Košute where they were engaged by Ustaše Militia backed by Italian reinforcements. After a day of fighting and the death of one of their commanders, members of the detachment began to retreat. In the end, the Partisans suffered four killed in action and 25 taken prisoner, while 13 managed to escape. All but three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were later executed by firing squad. A Split Detachment was reformed, but most of its fighters were part of the 3rd Dalmatian Assault Brigade.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party {{was seen by}} a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk blow to the head. According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> The dead were scalped and left unburied.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{it was by}} far {{the largest}} battle ever fought in North America. If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe {{reported}} his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded. The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured. As few as half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> survived. Kept on prison ships, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.|$|E

5|$|Each {{section of}} the process was overseen by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> and the day-to-day {{operations}} were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E
5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given a high {{priority}} for repatriation back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of whom had been held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.|$|E

The charges also pertained to the abuse of 18 prisoners of war captured in the Battle of Kupres. In 2013, Croatian authorities in Šibenik charged 21 former members of the JNA with the abuse of 23 HVO prisoners of war. The charges specify that the prisoners were detained and abused in Knin prison between 24 April and 14 May.

5|$|Initially {{there was}} no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk {{and the number of}} inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E
5|$|Out of options, Buchner opened negotiations, {{using those}} interned {{in the castle}} as hostages. Presenting them at the keep's door, he made clear {{that they would be}} killed unless Ferdinand promised to spare his, his wife's and Sudermann's lives. Ferdinand acceded to Buchner's demand; some sources {{maintain}} that the Abbot of Heisterbach, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> had been treated decently by Buchner throughout his imprisonment in the castle and himself asked for Buchner's life to be spared. The prisoners were released. With much difficulty, given the state of mind of the besiegers, Ferdinand and Arenberg brought the Buchners and Sudermann out of the castle alive. Once the Buchners, Sudermann, and the hostages were clear of the fortress, Ferdinand released his troops, who were in an ugly mood and hungry for blood and plunder. All those who remained in the keep—soldiers, men, women and children—were killed, some inside the keep, some in the courtyard below; the slaughter lasted well into the night. The castle's 178 dead were buried in two mass graves whose locations remain unknown. Among those who perished in the destruction and storming of the castle was also one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> a vicar from Hildesheim. The Hildesheim suffragan, too, was not among the rescued prisoners; he had died during his incarceration, a short while before the castle was stormed.|$|E
