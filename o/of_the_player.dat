50|$|The Mehter bands {{were divided}} {{structurally}} into squadrons having a commander called bölükbaşı. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> these squadrons was equal to <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musical instrument; squadrons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zurna <b>players,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horn <b>players,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nakkare <b>players,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cymbalists, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> davul <b>players,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kös <b>players</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> çoğan <b>players.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the January {{transfer}} window came, Eriksson had decided to sell Samaras, amongst others, to try and raise funds for the club. Birmingham City had chased him for several weeks and had a £2.5million offer accepted, meeting Manchester City's valuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> but they {{pulled out of the}} deal with a week of the transfer window remaining. Several teams including Rangers, Middlesbrough, Espanyol, Bolton Wanderers and Charlton Athletic had expressed an interest in signing him, but it was Celtic to whom he eventually moved.|$|E
5|$|Capturing Pokémon {{is another}} {{essential}} element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player.</b> Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon {{and the type of}} Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.|$|E
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
50|$|With a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> not {{accepting}} full-time terms under Southport's {{new manager}} Paul Cook <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> followed Watson to Burscough signing on part-time.|$|R

5|$|Fans gained {{national}} attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham {{in his first}} away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, had hung an effigy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.|$|E
5|$|First-person {{shooters}} are {{a type of}} three-dimensional shooter game, {{featuring a}} first-person point of view with which the player sees the action through the eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> character. They are unlike third-person shooters, in which the player can see (usually from behind) the character they are controlling. The primary design element is combat, mainly involving firearms.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} {{headquarters}} of First Person Shooterss developers in Inland Empire, California, where they meet the Lone Gunmen, who work as consultants for the game. They look at the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> which clearly displays a gunshot wound. Ivan claims {{there is no way}} a real gun could have been brought into the highly-secured building. The agents are shown a video from the game, featuring the female character who killed the player. Mulder takes the printout of the character and shows it to a detective, as he believes she is the killer.|$|E
50|$|Jhapa XI is {{participating}} in Nepal National League {{for the first}} time in the season 2015. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> <b>of</b> Jhapa XI are home based, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> are foreign based.|$|R
50|$|Over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, {{the mother}} ship can be {{equipped}} with up to four add-ons: freight rings representing <b>the</b> trading ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> ships, boosters representing <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> ships, cannons representing combat ability, and fame rings representing <b>the</b> overall fame <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player's</b> ships. At <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game, each <b>player</b> begins with only a single fame ring, and, in a 5-6 player game, a booster and either a freight ring or a cannon.|$|R
50|$|Beman {{could not}} refuse this one dollar deal for <b>the</b> future home <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Players</b> Championship and <b>the</b> {{headquarters}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PGA Tour.

5|$|Haunting Ground {{has been}} a subject of game studies {{regarding}} the relationship between players and their avatars. It {{was found that the}} altering states of Fiona's subjectivity change the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> in the game. The player is never a spectator, nor do they take on the embodiment of Fiona, but float between these states of involvement.|$|E
5|$|Instead {{of playing}} {{as one of}} the {{standard}} civilizations, the player takes command of a special civilization that is linked to the character or period that each Act portrays. Most units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> civilizations speak in English language, with the exception of unique units such as Spanish Rodeleros, Spanish Lancers, German Ulhans and German War Wagons.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2015, Robben scored {{twice in}} a 6–0 win against SC Paderborn, giving him the record of having scored against every Bundesliga team he had faced. He ended 2014–15 {{alongside}} teammate Robert Lewandowski as joint second-top goalscorer in the Bundesliga with 17 goals. This was in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> missing {{the last two months}} of the season through injury.|$|E
50|$|The Tibetan Buddhist {{background}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> {{is notable}} in <b>the</b> game mentality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> who don't show any aggression. This invokes scenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trainer. He believes in discipline, hard working {{and a strong}} winners mentality.|$|R
30|$|There {{exists a}} pure {{strategy}} NE {{in a game}} if the following two conditions are satisfied [23]. First, <b>the</b> strategy spaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> should be nonempty compact convex subsets of an Euclidean space. Second, <b>the</b> utility functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> should be continuous in <b>the</b> strategies <b>of</b> all <b>players</b> and quasiconcave in <b>the</b> strategy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding <b>player.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> {{were making}} their {{professional}} debuts, having been {{selected from the}} amateur ice hockey ranks in Ontario by Livingstone. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> {{would go on to}} minor league careers and several played in the NHL.|$|R
5|$|Players {{assume the}} role of an {{apprentice}} Shaper, a sect of mages who can create living creatures through force of will. The apprentice is cast away on Sucia, an island abandoned by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers' creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding their creators in the intervening years. The primary motivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> is to escape the island and, in the process, deal with the forces working to steal the Shaper secrets abandoned on Sucia Isle.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} {{from the}} Star Wars films have been recreated as maps for multiplayer gaming. These include Luke's home on Tatooine from A New Hope, the carbon-freezing chamber on Bespin from The Empire Strikes Back and the Emperor's throne {{room on the}} Death Star from Return of the Jedi. The capture the flag multiplayer mode has been altered since Dark Forces II. The player must now steal a ysalamir from the other team {{and return it to}} his or her own base. The ysalamir has the added effect of reducing the Force powers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> who is carrying it.|$|E
5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> (White) {{who makes the}} first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games between humans and games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E
50|$|Murder: <b>The</b> points/maal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player(s)</b> who {{are still}} on pure rounds/primary rounds are not counted. <b>The</b> maal/points <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> on <b>the</b> {{secondary}} rounds only count, other points are murdered. It {{is very similar to}} Maal Pachaunu/Tunnel Pachaunu.|$|R
30|$|Finally, a game {{is called}} zero-sum if <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{objective}} functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> {{can be made}} zero after appropriate positive scaling and/or translation that do not depend on <b>the</b> decision variables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> (i.e., their actions or controls) [1].|$|R
50|$|A match ends {{when one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> has won <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set number <b>of</b> frames and <b>the</b> other <b>player</b> can therefore not equal this. For example, when a match consists <b>of</b> 19 frames, <b>the</b> match ends when one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> has reached 10 frames.|$|R
5|$|The {{story of}} Riven is set {{immediately}} after the events of Myst. Having been rescued from the efforts of his sons, the main non-player protagonist Atrus enlists the help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> character to free his wife from his power-hungry father, Gehn. Unlike Myst, which took place on several worlds known as Ages linked together by special books, Riven takes place almost entirely on the Age of Riven, a world slowly falling apart due to Gehn's destructive rule.|$|E
5|$|The third arc is the {{complicated}} love story of four childhood friends: Matilda, Irwin, Daena and Escad. Irwin is a half-demon who is angry that society prevents {{him from a}} relationship with the holy leader Matilda, and seeks to destroy the world in retribution. Escad seeks to destroy Irwin, and Daena tries to act as a mediator between all parties while keeping Matilda away from Irwin. The conflict eventually escalates into a war between humans and faeries. Depending on the choices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player,</b> either Daena or Escad will die, while the player helps {{bring an end to the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Tony Smith {{worked on}} some of the game's {{backgrounds}} and graphics, while Jones designed the levels. Jones decided for Menace to be a side-scrolling game after playing arcade games such as Nemesis (1985) and R-Type (1987). Psygnosis could not decide a preference for the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>player</b> ship; as a result, Smith often re-designed the ship with many variations.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> number <b>of</b> ships {{a player}} begins with depends upon <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>players,</b> <b>the</b> scenario, and <b>the</b> {{preferences}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players.</b>|$|R
50|$|In June 1978, the National Hockey League {{allowed the}} Cleveland Barons and Minnesota North Stars to merge. The North Stars {{were allowed to}} keep some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> from each team and <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>players</b> went into <b>the</b> 1978 NHL Dispersal Draft.|$|R
