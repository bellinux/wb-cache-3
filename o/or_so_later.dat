By 7March, the first French forces arrived there, and the Austrians arrived a day <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>later.</b> Over the following week, additional forces for both sides arrived, and the two armies faced each other across this valley.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} reception accorded to L'Arianna at its premiere, the duke did not request a second showing, {{as he had}} with L'Orfeo the previous year". The next hint of a performance of L'Arianna is in 1614, when the Medici court in Florence requested {{a copy of the}} score, presumably with the intention of staging it. There is, however, no record of any such performance there. Early in 1620 Striggio asked Monteverdi to send him the music for a projected performance in Mantua as part of the celebration for the Duchess Caterina's birthday. Monteverdi went to the trouble and expense of preparing a new manuscript with revisions; had he had more time, he informed Striggio, he would have revised the work more thoroughly. Hearing nothing further from the Mantuan court, Monteverdi wrote to Striggio on 18 April 1620, offering to help with the staging. A month <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>later,</b> however, he learned that the duchess's celebrations had been scaled back, and that there had been no performance of L'Arianna.|$|E
5|$|The other game Ahl {{originally}} ported to BASIC, Lunar Lander, {{appeared in}} the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim Storer while {{a high school student}} in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC. Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. A year <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>later,</b> all three BASIC versions of the game appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to the textual summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of BASIC Computer Games.|$|E

50|$|Millions of borrowers found {{themselves}} in a difficult predicament after the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2008. As inventories soared nationwide, home prices plummeted. Many new homeowners saw the value of their homes drop below the balance of their mortgages, <b>or</b> nearly <b>so.</b> <b>Later,</b> these same homeowners were prevented from taking advantage of lower interest rates through refinancing, since banks traditionally require a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 80% or less to qualify for refinancing without private mortgage insurance (PMI).|$|R

To frighten them away, the occupying forces started a strategy of planned massacres, which were carried out in Eilabun, Faradiyya, Safsaf, Sa'sa', and other villages. In places where this was not to their advantage for one reason or another, the army would resort to forceful expulsion.

Afterwards he invited her to lunch, and shortly after this he gave her some teachings. A month <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>later</b> he accepted her offer to serve as his attendant in retreat after the empowerments.

Just 12 Ju 87s were lost, anti-aircraft fire accounted for six I./StG 76 machines. His support operations were usually 65 kilometres (40mi) ahead of the forward edge of the battlefield, with even reconnaissance aircraft pressed into service as bombers. Army units carried flares and Swastika flags to prevent friendly fire incidents. In the Battle of Hannut Richthofen's forces proved effective against French armour during the battle.

Two of the captured vessels, Santa Buena Ventura and San Antonio were both armed with two guns and carried cargoes of flax and steel. The third vessel was San Real, which was in ballast. Ussher, with six men, was in the lead British boat. When {{he and his men}} arrived at the first of the three Spanish vessels their crews and some soldiers stationed on board them jumped off. Still, the British took 13 men prisoners. Apparently, he sent two men to the commander of the battery protecting the port to inform him that if the Spanish fired on British as they withdrew Ussher would hang his prisoners. Colpoys had two men wounded in the attack, one of them seriously. Ussher left his eleven remaining prisoners on San Real, which he left behind. The two luggers arrived at Penzance on 31 March, and San Antonio arrived at Plymouth in mid-April. Bon Aventura arrived there on 17 April. The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded Ussher an honour sword valued at £50 for his feat.|$|E

In Canada, the shorts aired on MuchMusic and the third season aired a year <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>later</b> on the youth-oriented network YTV in a late-night timeslot during a period when the network was trying to appeal to an older audience. In Australia and New Zealand, during the early- to mid-1990s, the Liquid Television shorts and the first series were shown on the program Eat Carpet on SBS television. In South East Asia the third season was broadcast in 1996 via the MTV South East Asia channel, {{which at the time}} was free to anyone with a satellite dish. In the UK, MTV first showed the shorts and the 30-minute episodes from 1992. In the mid-1990s, the BBC showed the Liquid Television shorts, which included all of the Æon Flux shorts. Locomotion played the third season repeatedly, between 1998–1999 and 2002–2003, in Spanish and Portuguese for Latin America. The series was also aired on Norwegian channel NRK2, a sister channel to state channel NRK, alongside The Maxx, Phantom 2040, and The Head in the late 1990s.

25|$|Reproductively mature male {{sea lions}} {{aggregate}} in May on traditional, well-defined reproductive rookeries, usually on beaches on isolated islands. The larger, older males establish and defend distinct territories on the rookery. A week <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>later,</b> adult females arrive, accompanied occasionally by sexually immature offspring, and form fluid aggregations throughout the rookery. Like all other otariids, Steller sea lions are polygynous. However, unlike some other species, {{they do not}} coerce individual females into harems, but control spatial territories among which females freely move about. Steller sea lions have used aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial territories. Males with semiaquatic territories have the most success in defending them. The boundaries are defined by natural features, such as rocks, faults, or ridges in rocks, and territories can remain stable for 60 days. Though Steller sea lion males are generally tolerant of pups, one male filmed on Medny Island in Russia was documented killing and eating several pups in a first ever recorded incident of cannibalism. Though researchers are uncertain as to the motives or reasons behind said attacks, {{it is suggested that}} the bull involved may have an abnormal personality akin to being psychotic.|$|E
