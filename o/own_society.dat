25|$|On the one hand, a materialist view of {{landscape}} tends to stress how {{it may be}} seen in terms of a set of resources, for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups. This leads one to turn, for example, to optimal foraging theory and other economic models for an understanding of how people exploited the landscape 'rationally'. Postprocessualists like to argue that landscapes are always viewed in different ways by different peoples. They reject the 'rational' view of 'landscape-as-a-set-of-resources' as that of our <b>own</b> <b>society</b> and one that is ideologically loaded in its own way, loaded towards ideas of commodity and exploitation found in our <b>own</b> <b>society.</b> They suggest that ancient peoples would have had different views of what was 'real' in that landscape. On the other hand, an exclusively idealist view {{of landscape}} does not work either. Postprocessualists like to stress that such an understanding of landscape was not formed in the abstract—that the way people moved around and used that landscape affected their understanding of it.|$|E

They are part of the eastern Cushitic people {{stemming}} from a branch of the Caucasoid race (which includes Western Asians, Arabs and Europeans), and are distributed from Wello in Ethiopia’s north, to Mombasa in Kenya to the south. Some 3,000 years ago, they passed on practices such as the initiation ceremony of circumcision and habit of not eating fish to Nilotic peoples in the West. Furthermore, they incorporated the ideas of the Gadaa system and cattle husbandry into their <b>own</b> <b>society.</b> The Gadaa system is based on the principles of classifying a society into 11 functional grades, each of which has its special roles and statuses.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{constitutional}} turmoil of the 1680s, Massachusetts government had been dominated by conservative Puritan secular leaders. Influenced by Calvinism, Puritans had opposed many of {{the traditions of the}} Anglo-Catholic (Anglican) Church of England, including use of the Book of Common Prayer, the use of priestly vestments (cap and gown) during services, the use of the Holy Cross during baptism, and kneeling during the sacrament, all of which they believed constituted popery. King Charles I was hostile to this viewpoint, and Anglican church officials tried to repress these dissenting views during the 1620s and 1630s. Some Puritans and other religious minorities had sought refuge in the Netherlands, but ultimately many made a major migration to colonial North America to establish their <b>own</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|As one of {{the largest}} growing {{concerns}} American adults have of current Internet privacy policies, identity and credit theft remain a constant figure in the debate surrounding privacy online. A 1997 study by the Boston Consulting Group showed that participants of the study were most concerned about their privacy on the Internet compared to any other media. However, it is important to recall that these issues are not the only prevalent concerns our society has.

25|$|After Freetown, Sierra Leone, {{was founded}} in the late 18th century by the British as a colony for poor blacks from London and black Loyalists from Nova Scotia, resettled after the American Revolutionary War, they did not allow slaves to be taken from Sierra Leone. They tried {{to protect the people}} from kidnappers. In 1808 both Great Britain and the United States {{prohibited}} the African slave trade. After that date, the British, whose navy patrolled to intercept slave ships off Africa, sometimes resettled Africans liberated from slave trader ships in Sierra Leone. Similarly, Americans sometimes settled freed slaves at Liberia, a similar colony established in the early 19th century by the American Colonization Society. As it was a place for freed slaves and free blacks from the United States, some free blacks emigrated there voluntarily, for the chance to create their <b>own</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Lithuanian Literary Society was {{established}} in Tilsit in 1879, but it took more academic interest in Lithuanian language and culture. The society considered that the Lithuanian culture was dying due to Germanization and sought to record and study it but took no steps in keeping the language and culture alive. Thus Lithuanian activists began preparations for their <b>own</b> <b>society.</b> The issue was first raised by Georg Sauerwein in Lietuwißka Ceitunga in 1882. The idea was supported and further crystallized by Jonas Basanavičius, Jonas Šliūpas, and others. They decided to establish a society that would study Lithuanian culture and heritage and that would actively promote it among the Lithuanians both in Lithuania Minor and Lithuania Major. They {{went as far as}} collecting membership applications and dues and scheduling the organizational meeting for 11 January 1894, but due to various difficulties, including financial hardship faced by Aušra newspaper, such society was not established. Basanavičius established the Lithuanian Scientific Society only in 1907.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is set on}} Yamatai, {{a fictional}} lost island in the Dragon's Triangle {{off the coast of}} Japan. The island—and the kingdom that once existed there—is {{shrouded}} in mystery, given its reputation for fearsome storms and shipwrecks that litter its coastline. Yamatai was once ruled by a queen named Himiko, known by her honorific title of [...] "Sun Queen", who according to legend was blessed with shamanistic powers that enabled her to control the weather. Very little is known about Yamatai's history in the time since Himiko's death, other than that the island's infamy was established shortly thereafter. In exploring the island, the player may find evidence that—among others—Portuguese traders, United States Marines and a Japanese military project were all stranded on Yamatai at various points throughout history. At the start of the game, the island is populated exclusively by the Solarii Brotherhood, a violent cult of criminals, mercenaries and shipwreck survivors. The Solarii Brotherhood has established its <b>own</b> <b>society</b> based on the worship of Himiko, complete with a social structure and laws, with their exact purpose and intentions being explored {{over the course of the}} story.|$|E
500|$|Paolini {{chose to}} have Eragon mature {{throughout}} the book because, [...] "for one thing, it's one of the archetypal fantasy elements". He thought Eragon's growth and maturation {{throughout the book}} [...] "sort of mirrored my own growing abilities {{as a writer and}} as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book." [...] Eragon's dragon, Saphira, was imagined as [...] "the perfect friend" [...] by Paolini. He decided to go in a more [...] "human direction" [...] with her because she is raised away from her own species, in [...] "close mental contact" [...] with a human. [...] "I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its <b>own</b> <b>society,</b> but I haven't had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race." [...] Paolini made Saphira the [...] "best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud." [...] Saphira's blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini's own color-blindness.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University {{believed}} that The Broken Ear established a [...] "tintinian" [...] anthropology that would remain {{throughout the rest}} of the series. As part of this, Apostolidès argued, Hergé distances himself from western values and looks at his <b>own</b> <b>society</b> as an outsider, accomplishing what Roger Caillois called [...] "sociological revolution". He felt that the comic was [...] "more contrived" [...] and [...] "more superficial" [...] than the previous Adventures, and that here Tintin loses his position as [...] "the sole point of identification" [...] for the reader, with the other characters becoming more identifiable. Opining that there was a constant theme of twos throughout the story (i.e. the real and the fake fetish, Alonso and Ramón), he thought that the character of Ridgewell was [...] "a kind of Tintin, grown old among the natives, solitary and ill humored", noting that Ridgewell's position among the Arumbayas was akin to Tintin's position among the Ba Baorom in Congo. Apostolidès also argued that in the comic, Alcazar was a religious figure, who attained a [...] "sacred" [...] quality through the spilling of blood in his revolt against General Tapioca's government. As part of this, he argued that the threats of assassination would make him a martyr, or a [...] "holy king." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first part}} of the series {{explains}} the origins of Islamism and neoconservatism. It shows Egyptian civil servant Sayyid Qutb, depicted as the founder of modern Islamist thinking, visiting the U.S. to learn about its education system, then becoming disgusted at what he judged as the corruption of morals and virtues in western society through individualism. When he returns to Egypt, he is disturbed by westernisation under Gamal Abdel Nasser and becomes convinced that in order to save his <b>own</b> <b>society,</b> it must be completely restructured along the lines of Islamic law while still using western technology. He then becomes convinced that his vision can only be accomplished through use of an elite [...] "vanguard" [...] to lead a revolution against the established order. Qutb becomes a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and, after being tortured in one of Nasser's jails, comes to believe that western-influenced leaders can be justifiably killed to remove their corruption. Qutb is executed in 1966, but he influences Ayman al-Zawahiri, the future mentor of Osama bin Laden, to start his own secret Islamist group. Inspired by the 1979 Iranian revolution, Zawahiri and his allies assassinate Egyptian president Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981 in the hopes of starting their own revolution. However, the revolution does not materialise, and Zawahiri comes to believe that a majority of Muslims have been corrupted, not only by their western-inspired leaders, but Muslims themselves have been affected by jahilliyah and thus may be legitimate targets of violence if they refuse to join his cause. They continued to believe that a vanguard was necessary to rise up and overthrow the corrupt regime {{and replace it with a}} 'pure' Islamist state.|$|E
