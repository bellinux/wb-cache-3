25|$|On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) {{decided that}} the Commonwealth could not deny {{marriage}} rights to gay couples under the state constitution. On February 4, 2004, the SJC followed that ruling with {{a statement saying that}} allegedly separate but equal civil unions, implemented as of late in Vermont, would not pass constitutional muster and that only full gay marriage rights met constitutional guarantees. On May 17, 2004, the ruling took effect and thousands of gay and lesbian couples across the Commonwealth entered into marriage. Opponents <b>of</b> <b>gay</b> <b>marriage</b> subsequently pushed for an amendment to the state constitution that would allow the state to deny marriage rights to gay couples. It was necessary for the amendment to be approved by at least 1/4 of the members present in two consecutive legislative sessions of the Massachusetts legislature, and to receive majority support in a popular referendum. It passed the first legislative session, but was defeated in the second session, receiving less than 1/4 of the votes of the legislators present. As public opinion polls currently indicate majority support for gay marriage among the people of the Commonwealth, {{it is likely that the}} issue is settled in Massachusetts.|$|E
