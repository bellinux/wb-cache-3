40|$|In this paper, a {{learning}} based robotic replanning framework {{that can handle}} unexpected events in dynamic worlds is presented. Existing robotic architectures use artificial intelligence planning methods, reactive approaches or hybrid approaches to increase robustness and unexpected event handling capabilities of robotic agents in dynamic environments. This study presents a new hybrid task planning architecture that equips robotic agents with higher level of intelligence with an original replanning method. The replanning method uses an alternative based action selection mechanism to select the most efficient <b>action</b> <b>path</b> among possible alternative <b>action</b> <b>paths.</b> The method stores the costs of <b>actions</b> <b>paths</b> from previous executions as an experience and uses it for improving its future action selection decisions.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of searching action {{proposals}} in unconstrained video clips. Our approach starts from actionness estimation on frame-level bounding boxes, and then aggregates the bounding boxes belonging to the same actor across frames via linking, associating, tracking to generate spatial-temporal continuous <b>action</b> <b>paths.</b> To achieve the target, a novel actionness estimation method is firstly proposed by utilizing both human appearance and motion cues. Then, the association of the <b>action</b> <b>paths</b> is formulated as a maximum set coverage problem with the results of actionness estimation as a priori. To further promote the performance, we design an improved optimization objective for the problem and provide a greedy search algorithm to solve it. Finally, a tracking-by-detection scheme is designed to further refine the searched <b>action</b> <b>paths.</b> Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets, UCF-Sports and UCF- 101, show that the proposed approach advances state-of-the-art proposal generation performance in terms of both accuracy and proposal quantity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Evaluation is an {{important}} and basic issue for software dependability. However, traditional researches mostly focused on the conceptions and properties of dependability, which resulted in lots of different views about software dependability. Based upon Pi Calculus, dependable <b>action</b> <b>path</b> of software and real <b>action</b> <b>path</b> are set up through series of actions, which is decomposed by running software behaviors. In addition, three kinds of relationships between behaviors are defined. Consequently, the dependability is calculated by comparing the real running software actions to the decomposed ones based on the defined relationships. Experimental result conducted by MWB shows that the proposed method in one behavior is reasonable. At last, a real experiment proves the proposed measure method is more valid than traditional one...|$|R

The simplicity of the break open design, especially external hammer types, also reduces the cost of manufacture.

40|$|Many {{platforms}} {{for civic}} engagement, whether online or offline, require that citizens leave {{the places they}} normally inhabit physically or virtually and commit to a separate space and set of processes. Examples include town hall meetings, occurring during specific times and in specific places, and online forums, where deliberation occurs within profile-based websites for which you need to sign up and to regularly return. This thesis responds to the design challenge and research question: How do you address barriers to minimum effective engagement in community projects, and ensure that all citizens can contribute their input {{on how to improve}} their local communities? In order to raise levels of participation in community projects and expand the range of voices heard in governmental decision-making, {{there is a need for}} a civic engagement platform that is lightweight and compelling enough to enjoy continued use. To this end, I have developed a theoretical basis for effective citizenship through monitorial actions aided by mobile computing, finding connections between various theories of citizenship and learning to fill a gap in the literature and in terms of civic technology design. My argument and design goals for such a system are reinforced by findings from a needs assessment of Boston-area municipalities that confirmed a desire to use new technologies to elicit feedback on community issues from a more diverse demographic than those who currently attend public meetings. Based my analysis of the literature and the distilled design goals, I built and completed early-stage user testing of a prototype smartphone app-based civic engagement platform called <b>Action</b> <b>Path,</b> which uses location-awareness in the form of geo-fences along with push notifications to prompt users to respond to one-item surveys dotting their urban landscape. Interviews with users suggest <b>Action</b> <b>Path</b> might help people see their communities as filled with opportunities for civic intervention, and might increase their sense of efficacy. Additionally, workshops about geo-fence design and curricular design with potential stakeholders showed how <b>Action</b> <b>Path</b> might be effectively deployed through civic technologists and in schools. by Erhardt Graeff.
