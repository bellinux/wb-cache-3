500|$|Colonial-era Indologists, {{for a long}} time, {{considered}} Jainism and Mahavira's {{followers to}} be a sect of Buddhism because of the superficial similarities in their iconography, meditative and ascetic practices. However, as studies and understanding progressed, {{the differences between the}} teachings of the Mahavira and the Buddha were found to be so markedly divergent that the two gained recognition as separate religions. Mahavira, states Moriz Winternitz, taught a [...] "very elaborate belief in the soul" [...] unlike the Buddhists who denied it, the ascetic practices in his teachings have been <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> of magnitude than those found in either Buddhism or Hinduism, and his emphasis on Ahimsa (non-violence) against all life forms is far greater than in all other Indian religions.|$|E

Carte announced his ambitions {{on the front of}} the programme for the latter: [...] "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera."

500|$|By 1874, Richard D'Oyly Carte, a {{musician}} and ambitious young impresario, had begun producing operettas in London. [...] He announced his ambitions {{on the front}} of the programme for one of his productions that year: [...] "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light opera." [...] The Observer reported, [...] "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order,</b> such as {{a musician}} might produce with satisfaction".

500|$|In 1965, the {{influence}} of artists such as Bob Dylan, who moved beyond political protest by experimenting with abstract and surreal lyrical imagery, then switched to electric guitar, became increasingly pervasive across the musical landscape, affecting a number of genres, including garage rock. [...] The members of garage bands, like so many musicians of the 1960s, {{were part of a}} generation that was largely born into the paradigm and customs of an older time, but grew up confronting a new set of issues facing a more advanced and technological age. [...] Postwar prosperity brought the advantages of better education, was well as more spare time for recreation, which along with the new technology, made it possible for an increasing number of young people to play music. [...] With the advent of television, nuclear weapons, civil rights, the Cold War, and space exploration, the new generation was more global in its mindset and began to conceive <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> of human relations, attempting to reach for a set of transcendent ideals, often expressed through rock music. [...] Though set to a backdrop of tragic events that ultimately proved disillusioning, the various forms of personal and musical experimentation held promise, at least for a time, in the minds of many. [...] While testing the frontiers of what the new world had to offer, 1960s youth ultimately had to accept the limitations of the new reality, yet often did so while experiencing the ecstasy of a moment when the range of possibilities seemed boundless and within reach.|$|E
500|$|Hayes and his brigade {{moved to}} the Shenandoah Valley for the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Crook's corps was {{attached}} to Major General David Hunter's Army of the Shenandoah and soon back in contact with Confederate forces, capturing Lexington, Virginia on June 11. They continued south toward Lynchburg, tearing up railroad track as they advanced. Hunter believed the troops at Lynchburg were too powerful, however, and Hayes and his brigade returned to West Virginia. Hayes thought that Hunter lacked aggression, writing in a letter home that [...] "General Crook would have taken Lynchburg." [...] Before the army could make another attempt, Confederate General Jubal Early's raid into Maryland forced their recall to the north. Early's army surprised them at Kernstown on July 24, where Hayes was slightly wounded by a bullet to the shoulder. Hayes also had a horse shot out from under him, and the army was defeated. Retreating into Maryland, the army was reorganized again, with Major General Philip Sheridan replacing Hunter. By August, Early was retreating up the valley, with Sheridan in pursuit. Hayes's troops fended off a Confederate assault at Berryville and advanced to Opequon Creek, where they broke the enemy lines and pursued them farther south. They followed up the victory with another at Fisher's Hill on September 22, and one more at Cedar Creek on October 19. At Cedar Creek, Hayes sprained his ankle after being thrown from a horse and was struck {{in the head by}} a spent round, which did not cause serious damage. Hayes's leadership and bravery drew the attention of his superiors, with Ulysses S. Grant later writing of Hayes that [...] "is conduct on the field was marked by conspicuous gallantry as well as the display of qualities <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> than that of mere personal daring." ...|$|E
