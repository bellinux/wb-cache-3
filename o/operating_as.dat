5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was <b>operating</b> <b>as</b> a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary.

However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks <b>operating</b> <b>as</b> branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming").
