50|$|In March 2011 Robin Rigg {{became the}} first {{offshore}} wind farm to enter the OFTO regime with the two offshore and onshore export cables and the <b>onshore</b> 132kV <b>substation</b> being bought by Transmission Capital and Amber Infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|Each {{of the two}} 320 kV cables linking DolWin Alpha to the <b>onshore</b> <b>substation</b> has a {{total length}} of 165 km, of which 75 km is sea cable and 90 km is {{underground}} land cable. The cables were supplied by ABB and use extruded Cross-linked polyethylene insulation.|$|E
5000|$|From each {{developer}} berth, the subsea cables follow {{back along}} the seabed and then pass under the beach and into an <b>onshore</b> <b>substation.</b> An adjacent laydown area then provides an optional area for developers to use conditioning equipment for converting from {{the level at which}} they generate to grid compliant electricity.|$|E
50|$|In 2003 EON {{submitted}} {{a bid to}} the Crown Estate to develop a wind farm in the 'Greater Wash Strategic Area'; a planning application was submitted in 2008 for a 300 MW, £700 million, wind farm. Additional planning applications for <b>onshore</b> <b>substation,</b> and onshore underground cable were submitted in 2009/2008, and approved in 2010.|$|E
30|$|As {{with other}} {{renewable}} ocean energy technology systems, the major components of CAPEX in TCE are the turbine arrays and the electrical systems (generators, power cables, submarine connectors, and <b>onshore</b> <b>substations),</b> whereby in general the electrical system cost is typically 25 % of {{the total cost of}} the tidal farm [13]. In [14], it is pointed out that the substantial share of electrical systems, and particularly power cables, in total cost may, if not appropriately determined, play an adverse role in delaying the deployment of TCE. In [14], it is also shown that there are two major types of cable collector placements in a tidal farm: a single collector hub placement and a multiple hub placement.|$|R

Turbines are installed by the Danish offshore wind farm services provider A2SEA. The TIV MPI Resolution carried and installed the turbines.|$|E
5000|$|Preparatory {{construction}} {{work for the}} development included {{the extension of the}} national-grid electricity substation at Walpole, Norfolk, which began in April 2009. In June 2010 Siemens obtained the contract for the offshore electrical substation (£101 million). [...] Transmission cables from offshore to <b>onshore</b> electrical <b>substations</b> were installed in 2010-2011. Construction of the offshore facilities of the wind farm began in 2011, with the installation of the offshore electricity substation foundations. The Port of Hull was selected as one of the logistics bases for the wind farm turbine installation, supplying wind tower transition pieces. Jack-up barge JB114 arriving at the port in March 2012. Great Yarmouth was also used as a base for the wind farm installation.|$|R

50|$|EMEC’s wave test {{facility}} is {{situated on the}} western edge of the Orkney mainland, in an area with one of the highest wave energy potentials in Europe. The exposed North Sea location means the island group is subjected to the powerful dynamic forces of the North Atlantic Ocean, with the highest wave recorded by EMEC reaching over 18 metres. Construction of the wave {{test facility}} was completed in October 2003, and operational activities commenced shortly thereafter. The centre's facilities consist of five cabled test berths, ranging from 50-70m water depth off Billia Croo, Stromness on the Orkney mainland (some 2 km offshore) and two shallow water berths situated close to EMEC's <b>onshore</b> <b>substation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A scoping {{report for}} [...] "Project Two" [...] was {{published}} in October 2012. The subzone {{was expected to be}} developed in a number of phases, with a potential wind turbine capacity of 1.8 GW, in an area of around 400 km2 located in the centre of the Hornsea wind farm zone. Project 2 was use the same route for its electrical export cable as Project One, and to use either HVAC or HVDC with a separate <b>onshore</b> <b>substation.</b> Suitable areas for the Project 2 development were identified as being adjacent to the north, east or west of the Zone 1, which was located in the shallowest area of the whole Hornsea zone. The design considered piled, suction pile, monopile or gravity base foundations for wind turbines of 5 to 15 MW rated power.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} constant Volt/Hz operation of offshore wind power plants. The deployment of offshore WPPs requires power transmission from the plant to the load center inland. Since this power transmission requires submarine cables, {{there is a need}} to use High-Voltage Direct Current transmission, which is economical for transmission distances longer than 50 kilometers. In the concept presented here, the <b>onshore</b> <b>substation</b> is operated at 60 Hz synced with the grid, and the offshore substation is operated at variable frequency and voltage, thus allowing the WPP to be operated at constant Volt/Hz...|$|E
40|$|At Van Oord Offshore Wind Projects I made a model which calculates the Levelized Cost Of Electricity (LCOE) of {{offshore}} wind farms for different scenarios and configurations. In this model the user can define different configurations by selecting and specifying parameters {{such as the}} amount {{of offshore}} wind power installed and its’ distance to shore. The model will then calculate the LCOE for 2 scenarios, i. e. the ‘TenneT Scenario and the ‘Radial Scenario’. The TenneT Scenario represents te vision that TenneT TSO BV has proclaimed. When TenneT will be appointed as offshore grid operator in January 2016 they are planning to develop an offshore integrated grid through the use of standardized 700 MW offshore high voltage substations (OHVS). The Radial Scenario represents the current approach to offshore wind parks, where every park is responsible for their own connection to the onshore high-voltage network. Not only does the model calculate the LCOE for both scenarios, but it also gives an insight in which part of the SDE+ subsidy can be attributed to TenneT for the supply, installation and decommissioning of the OHVS, export cables, onshore connection and <b>onshore</b> <b>substation</b> in the scenario that TenneT will become the offshore grid operator...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{has been}} produced {{to provide the}} definition and rationale for the Baseline Offshore Wind farm established within IEA Wind Task 26 – Cost of Wind Energy. The Baseline has been developed {{in order to provide}} a common starting point for country comparisons and sensitivity analysis on key offshore wind cost and value drivers. The baseline project reflects an approximate average of the characteristics of projects installed between 2012 and 2014, with the project life assumed to be 20 years. The baseline wind farm is located 40 km from construction and O&M ports and from export cable landfall. The wind farm consists of 100 4 MW wind turbines mounted on monopile foundations in average water depth 25 metres, connected by 33 kV inter-array cables. The arrays are connected to a single offshore substation (33 kV/ 220 kV) mounted on a jacket foundation, with the substation connected via a single 220 kV export cable to an <b>onshore</b> <b>substation,</b> 10 km from landfall. The wind farm employs a port-based O&M strategy using crew-transfer vessels. The baseline wind farm applies a 70 / 30 debt/equity ratio with resulting pre-tax WACC of 8. 00 % (7. 10 % post-tax). A generic tax rate of 25 % has been applied, intended to be representative of the range of tax rates in Task 26 member countries. The site properties and technology choices have been used to estimate CapEx, OpEx and net energy production. These assumptions, together with the project life and financing inputs have been used to generate a baseline LCOE. JRC. C. 7 -Knowledge for the Energy Unio...|$|E
