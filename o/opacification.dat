2500|$|Posterior capsular <b>opacification,</b> {{also known}} as after-cataract, is a {{condition}} in which months or years after successful cataract surgery, vision deteriorates or problems with glare and light scattering recur, usually due to thickening of the back or posterior capsule surrounding the implanted lens, so-called 'posterior lens capsule opacification'. [...] Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring. [...] Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called [...] capsulotomy, after the type of laser used. [...] The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly {{to the bottom of the}} inside of the eye. [...] This procedure leaves sufficient capsule to hold the lens in place, but removes enough to allow light to pass directly through to the retina. [...] Serious side effects are rare. Posterior capsular <b>opacification</b> is common and occurs following up to one in four operations, but these rates are decreasing following the introduction of modern intraocular lenses together with a better understanding of the causes.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{report a}} case of {{bilateral}} central crystalline keratopathy in the anterior stroma occurring 4 years after Intacs implantation. METHODS: A 45 -year-old woman underwent bilateral uncomplicated Intacs implantation for myopia. The postoperative course was uneventful. However, between 3 and 4 years after surgery, the patient developed central <b>opacifications</b> of the anterior stroma in both eyes, reducing best spectacle-corrected visual acuity. RESULTS: Intacs were explanted. Confocal microscopy, electron microscopy of the explanted ring segments, and microbiology studies were performed. Opacities were still detectable at the slit-lamp microscope up to 8 months after explantation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on central corneal <b>opacifications</b> after Intacs implantation for myopia.

2500|$|Although {{glass as}} a {{material}} {{is known for}} its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7). [...] Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the corrosion rate of chemically unstable glass. [...] Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] This <b>opacification</b> occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously translucent glass (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4). [...] Glass plates can also darken or cloud {{as the result of the}} oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).|$|E

40|$|Recurrent corneal erosions are {{a common}} {{complication}} of superficial corneal wounds. They most commonly arise following a trauma, in association with various corneal dystrophies, or are idiopathic. The main aim of this thesis was to investigate two hereditary corneal diseases with recurrent erosions {{in order to find}} out if they had been described before, and more specifically to describe the clinical picture and the morphological changes, differentiate them from other known autosomal dominant corneal dystrophies with a clinical resemblance, and to exclude genetic linkage to known corneal dystrophies with autosomal-dominant inheritance and a clinical resemblance. The thesis is based on two families of subjects belonging to different phenotypes. The subjects from Småland (Dystrophia Smolandiensis) belonged to a six-generation family, which included 171 individuals of whom 44 were affected individuals, and the family from Hälsingland (Dystrophia Helsinglandica) included sevengenerations of 342 individuals, of whom 84 were affected. The individuals in both families were investigated by collection of medical history through medical records and questionnaires assessing different aspects of the diseases, pedigree analysis, and from clinical examination. Haplotype analysis was used to exclude genetic linkage of both diseases to known autosomal-dominant corneal dystrophies with a clinical resemblance. The morphological changes in Dystrophia Smolandiensis were investigated by examining affected individuals with in-vivo confocal microscopy and/or slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and examining corneal tissue samples using histopathology and immunohistochemistry. In Dystrophia Helsinglandica, the morphological changes were described using in-vivo confocal microscopy and/or slit-lamp biomicroscopy, but also using videokeratography and corneal sensitivity measurement. The main results were the findings of two new corneal disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance, characterized by recurrent corneal erosions. In Dystrophia Smolandiensis the symptoms often started within the first year of life. The number of recurrences per year was highest from the onset and for about 30 - 40 years, and the duration of recurrence could stretch up to 21 days. The frequency of recurrences was variable in the disease from continuous symptoms to once a year and tended to decrease later in life. The risk of having recurrences did not disappear completely with age. Typical precipitating factors of recurrence were draught and a common cold. About two thirds of the affected individuals responded well to oral vitamin B treatment, but no other therapy has so far been successful. In Dystrophia Smolandiensis development of corneal <b>opacifications</b> or secondary scarring of varying type and degree was seen in about half of the subjects. <b>Opacifications</b> were first noted at the age of about 7 years, but usually first seen at the age of 20 - 40 years. Corneal grafting was performed in nine individuals, and recurrences were seen in all grafts. The corneal buttons showed epithelial hyperplasia, partial or total loss of Bowman’s layer, and subepithelial fibrosis in the light microscope. The deeper stroma, Descement’s membrane, and endothelium were normal. Confocal microscopy confirmed loss of Bowman’s layer and revealed that the corneal nerves either were normal in their sub-basal plexa or showed signs of regeneration. None of the morphological findings were specific. We believe that the <b>opacifications</b> are reactive corneal changes to repeated erosive events. The onset in Dystrophia Helsinglandica was usually at the age of 4 - 7 years and late-developing subepithelial fibrosis not significantly affecting visual acuity was seen in all affected individuals over the age of 37 years. The number of recurrences per year was highest from the onset and for about 20 - 30 years, and the duration of recurrence was usually up to about a week. The frequency of recurrences tended to decrease in the disease with increasing age, but did not cease completely. The precipitating factor of recurrence was typically a minor trauma. No therapy has so far been successful in the family. The corneal changes of affected individuals were classified into different stages from a nearly normal cornea to progressive fairly discrete subepithelial fibrosis of the central cornea. Discrete localized Subepithelial fibrosis in the periphery or mid-periphery (stage I) was the sole finding in 12 % of the individuals. A more widespread subepithelial fibrosis, mainly in the mid-periphery, was found in 31 % of the individuals (stage II). In stage III, the subepithelial fibrosis engaged the central cornea but did not affect the vision to a significant degree. In late phases of stage III small jellylike corneal irregularities could be seen. We believe that the <b>opacifications</b> are reactive changes to repeated erosive events. In conclusion this thesis describes two new corneal disorders – Dystrophia Smolandiensis and Dystrophia Helsinglandica...|$|R

40|$|Two {{siblings}} {{with high}} density lipoprotein (HDL) deficiency and no plasma apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) {{were found to}} be homozygous for a cytosine deletion in exon 3 of Apo A-I gene (c. 85 del C, Q 5 FsX 11). This mutation causes a frameshift leading to a premature stop codon and abolishes the synthesis of Apo A-I. Although both siblings had corneal <b>opacifications</b> and planar xanthomas, only one of them had premature coronary artery disease, probably as the result of mildly elevated LDL levels. In two other unrelated subjects HDL deficiency was due to heterozygosity for a nucleotide substitution in exon 4 of Apo A-I gene (c. 494 T > G, L 141 R). Both Apo A-I mutations were reported previously in an Italian kindred which included compound heterozygotes and simple heterozygotes. We investigated all carriers of these mutations in the three kindreds and in the one previously reported. Plasma Apo A-I and HDL-C levels were lower in the mutation carriers than in non-carrier family members. These levels, however, were lower in L 141 R carriers than in carriers of c. 85 del C. Haplotype analysis performed using several polymorphisms suggested that both the c. 85 del C and L 141 R are likely to be recurrent mutations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} new affected {{individuals of}} Franceschetti's original pedigree of hereditary recurrent erosion and to classify a unique entity called Franceschetti corneal dystrophy. DESIGN: Observational case series. METHODS: Slit-lamp examination of 10 affected individuals was conducted. Biomicroscopic examinations were supplemented by peripheral corneal biopsy in 1 affected patient with corneal haze. Tissue was processed for light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry was performed. DNA analysis {{was carried out}} in 12 affected and 3 nonaffected family members. RESULTS: All affected individuals suffered from severe ocular pain {{in the first decade of}} life, attributable to recurrent corneal erosions. Six adult patients developed bilateral diffuse subepithelial <b>opacifications</b> in the central and paracentral cornea. The remaining 4 affected individuals had clear corneas in the pain-free stage of the disorder. Histologic and immunohistochemical examination of the peripheral cornea in a single patient showed a subepithelial, avascular pannus. There was negative staining with Congo red. DNA analysis excluded mutations in the transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) gene and in the tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD 2) gene. CONCLUSION: We have extended the pedigree of Franceschetti corneal dystrophy and elaborated its natural history on the basis of clinical examinations. A distinctive feature is the appearance of subepithelial opacities in adult life, accompanied by a decreased frequency of recurrent erosion attacks. Its clinical features appear to distinguish it from most other forms of dominantly inherited recurrent corneal erosion reported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Alveolar proteinosis is a {{rare disease}} of unknown {{etiology}} in which the alveoli are filled with lipid-proteinaceous material. The diagnosis is usually made on an open lung biopsy. The main symptoms are chest pain, tiredness, persistent pyrexia and a productive cough with purulent, bloodstained sputum. Exertion dyspnoea, however, {{is regarded as the}} most important symptom. Chest X-rays demonstrate a picture similar to severe pulmonary oedema. The lung functions and the blood gases are indicators of the severity of the disease and there is usually a reduction in the vital capacity, SaO 2 and PaO 2. A case study of a patient with this diagnosis treated at Tygerberg Hospital is reported. He was admitted complaining of the above mentioned symptoms, his lung functions and blood gases were extremely poor and the chest X-rays showed bilateral diffuse <b>opacifications.</b> He had to be ventilated with high percentages of oxygen and a high PEEP to maintain an adequate SaO 2 and PaO 2. The infection was treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids. Because of the presence of a tremendous amount of bronchial secretions, chest physiotherapy was very important. General techniques used were bagging, percussion and shaking in alternative side-lying and were combined with Mistabron:Saline inhalations to help dissolve the proteinaceous material in the alveoli. Over a period of 3 weeks he recovered remarkably, but two months after admission his condition unexpectedly deteriorated and he died three days later. Articl...|$|R

Findings were compared with survey radiographs and necropsy findings. A multicentric bronchoalveolar pattern more pronounced at the lung periphery was present radiographically. On CT, the predominant abnormality underlying this alveolar pattern was multiple large nodules merging to areas of consolidation, and containing air bronchograms of varying extent. These nodular changes corresponded to histopathologic granulomata, consisting mainly of macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes that had accumulated around larvae and eggs. Morphologically, no bronchial changes were observed on CT or histologically. Quantitatively, however, on CT there was evidence of bronchial thickening at 13 weeks postinoculation and mild very peripheral bronchiectasia 9 weeks postchemotherapy. Regional lymph nodes were enlarged after infection, and smaller after treatment. On postcontrast CT, several suspicious intraluminal filling defects suggestive of thrombosis were found; however, the tortuosity of some pulmonary arteries seen radiographically was not present in CT images. After treatment, the consolidations and large nodules had almost completely disappeared. A remaining radiographic interstitial pattern was characterized on CT as ground-glass <b>opacifications,</b> subpleural interstitial thickening, subpleural lines, and interface signs. These interstitial changes reflected fibrosis as documented histopathologically.
