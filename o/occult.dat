5|$|Dion Fortune (born Violet Mary Firth, 6 December 1890– 6 January 1946) was a British occultist, Christian Qabalist, {{ceremonial}} magician, {{novelist and}} author. She was {{a co-founder of}} the Fraternity of the Inner Light, an <b>occult</b> organisation that promoted philosophies which she claimed had been taught to her by spiritual entities known as the Ascended Masters. A prolific writer, she produced {{a large number of}} articles and books on her <b>occult</b> ideas and also authored seven novels, several of which expound <b>occult</b> themes.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Fortune's {{articles}} from The <b>Occult</b> Review were also collected {{to produce the}} book Sane Occultism.|$|E
50|$|Stars {{may also}} be <b>occulted</b> by planets. In 1959, Venus <b>occulted</b> Regulus. Uranus's rings were first {{discovered}} when that planet <b>occulted</b> a star in 1977. On 3 July 1989, Saturn passed {{in front of the}} 5th magnitude star 28 Sagittarii. Pluto <b>occulted</b> stars in 1988, 2002, and 2006, allowing its tenuous atmosphere to be studied via atmospheric limb sounding.|$|R
50|$|Electra is {{periodically}} <b>occulted</b> by the Moon {{and occasionally}} by other planets in the Solar System. The last planetary occultation {{took place on}} May 9, 1841, when it was <b>occulted</b> by Venus.|$|R
50|$|Because it {{is close}} to the ecliptic, it can be <b>occulted</b> by the Moon and very rarely by planets. The last {{occultation}} by a planet took place on November 17, 1981, when it was <b>occulted</b> by Venus. Furthermore, this is the brightest star that can be principally <b>occulted</b> by an exterior planet between 5000 BC and 5000 AD. However, only Mars can do this, and only rarely; the last time was on September 3, 423.|$|R
5|$|For a {{short time}} in 1901 Olivia held a {{position}} as a book reviewer for The Kensington Review, a small literary magazine, until it succumbed to poor sales. After, she dabbled in the <b>occult</b> and became friendly with prominent London occultists. In 1902 she co-wrote with Florence Farr — who for a time led the Order of Golden Dawn — two plays on the <b>occult,</b> The Beloved of Hathor and The Shrine of the Golden Hawk, which were subsequently published as a pair.|$|E
5|$|Fortune saw her <b>occult</b> novels as an {{important}} part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into the realms of occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects <b>occult</b> teachings. She thus perceived them as a means of disseminating her teachings to a wider audience. Each was related to one of the Sephirah on the Qabalic Tree of Life: The Winged Bull was associated with Tiphareth, The Goat-Foot God with Malkuth, and The Sea Priestess with Yesod.|$|E

50|$|Davida <b>occulted</b> a {{magnitude}}-13.3 star on July 14, 2011. Davida <b>occulted</b> {{the star}} TYC 0079-00234-1 on August 5, 2013. The event was visible over Argentina and Chile, with Davida at magnitude 11.7 {{and the star}} at mag 9.4.|$|R
50|$|On August 24, 2008, Cybele <b>occulted</b> 2UCAC 24389317, a 12.7-magnitude {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Ophiuchus which showed a long axis of at least 294 km. On 11 October 2009, Cybele <b>occulted</b> a 13.4-magnitude star in {{the constellation}} Aquarius.|$|R
5000|$|Because it {{is close}} to the ecliptic, ο Sagittarii can be <b>occulted</b> by the Moon and very rarely by planets. The last {{occultation}} of ο Sagittarii by a planet took place on 24 December 1937, when it was <b>occulted</b> by Mercury.|$|R
5|$|In 1927 Fortune {{published}} {{her first}} <b>occult</b> novel, The Demon Lover, which received {{a brief but}} positive review in The Times Literary Supplement.|$|E
5|$|Krishna worship or reverence {{has been}} adopted by several new {{religious}} movements since the 19thcentury, and he is sometimes {{a member of an}} eclectic pantheon in <b>occult</b> texts, along with Greek, Buddhist, biblical, and even historical figures. For instance, Édouard Schuré, an influential figure in perennial philosophy and <b>occult</b> movements, considered Krishna a Great Initiate, while Theosophists regard Krishna as an incarnation of Maitreya (one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom), the most important spiritual teacher for humanity along with Buddha.|$|E

50|$|Located on the harbour breakwaters of Büsum are {{two other}} lights. On the west mole is a 9 metre high red tower which {{displays}} an <b>occulting</b> red light. The east mole has a similar tower, painted green that displays an <b>occulting</b> green light.|$|R
50|$|This {{table is}} another {{compilation}} of occultations and transits of bright {{stars and planets}} by solar planets. These events are not visible everywhere the <b>occulting</b> body and the <b>occulted</b> body are above the skyline. Some events are barely visible, because they take place {{in close proximity to}} the Sun.|$|R
50|$|Antares {{is one of}} {{the four}} first {{magnitude}} stars that lies within 6.5° of the ecliptic (the others are Spica, Regulus and Aldebaran) and therefore can be <b>occulted</b> by the Moon. It can also, rarely, be <b>occulted</b> by Venus. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will take place on November 17, 2400. Other planets have not <b>occulted</b> Antares in the last millennium nor will they do so in the next millennium, as they pass {{as a result of their}} actual node position and inclination always northward of Antares. On 31 July 2009, Antares was <b>occulted</b> by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East. Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares.|$|R
5|$|That year, {{the couple}} decided {{to open up}} an <b>occult</b> store, named The Warlock Shop, at 300 Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights, New York City; {{alongside}} this venture, they also founded a company, Earth Religion Supplies, Inc, which would later go into publishing. Officially opening on June 21, 1972, {{the back room of}} the shop would also be used for weekly lectures and would be rented to various <b>occult</b> groups who wanted to assemble there.|$|E
5|$|Fortune {{was born}} in Llandudno, North Wales, to a wealthy upper middle-class English family, {{although}} little is known of her early life. By her teenage years {{she was living in}} England's West Country, where she wrote two books of poetry. After time spent at a horticultural college she began studying psychology and psychoanalysis at the University of London before working as a counsellor in a psychotherapy clinic. During the First World War she joined the Women's Land Army and established a company selling soy milk products. She became interested in esotericism through the teachings of the Theosophical Society, before joining an <b>occult</b> lodge led by Theodore Moriarty and then the Alpha et Omega <b>occult</b> organisation.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry has {{attracted}} criticism from theocratic states and organised religions for supposed competition with religion, or supposed heterodoxy within the fraternity itself, and {{has long been}} the target of conspiracy theories, which assert Freemasonry to be an <b>occult</b> and evil power.|$|E

5|$|In 1935 she {{published}} {{her second}} <b>occult</b> novel, The Winged Bull—which was again reviewed in The Times Literary Review—and in 1936 her third, The Goat-Foot God. In 1938 Fortune wrote a fourth <b>occult</b> novel, The Sea Priestess, which was eventually self-published through the Fraternity after being declined by Williams and Norgate, who had published the previous two. Her final novel, Moon Magic, was apparently left unfinished {{prior to the}} outbreak of the Second World War; a protégé later completed it, claiming to have done so through channeling Blavatsky's disembodied spirit, and it was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|The pilot Spectre, Roddenberry's 1977 {{attempt to}} create an <b>occult</b> detective duo similar to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, was {{released}} as a television movie within the United States and received a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|At the DAP, Hitler met Dietrich Eckart, {{one of the}} party's founders and {{a member}} of the <b>occult</b> Thule Society. Eckart became Hitler's mentor, exchanging ideas with him and {{introducing}} him to a wide range of Munich society. To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers Party; NSDAP). Hitler designed the party's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the Order {{stated that it}} was {{entering}} {{the second stage of}} its development, in which it would leave behind its prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within the <b>occult</b> community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings; its resulting quietness led some occultists to erroneously speculate that the ONA had become defunct.|$|E
5|$|Fortune is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} significant occultists and ceremonial magicians of the early 20th century. The Fraternity she founded survived her and in later decades spawned a variety of related groups based upon her teachings. Her novels in particular proved an influence on later <b>occult</b> and modern Pagan groups such as Wicca.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic concept}} is that Besselian {{elements}} describe {{the movement of}} the shadow cast by the <b>occulting</b> body - for solar eclipses this is the shadow of the Moon - on a specifically chosen plane, called the fundamental plane. This is the geocentric, normal plane of the shadow axis. In other words, it is the plane through the Earth's center that is perpendicular to the line through the centers of the <b>occulting</b> and the <b>occulted</b> bodies. One advantage, among others, of choosing this plane is that the outline of the shadow on it is always a circle, and there is no perspective distortion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distance}} to this star {{can be determined}} directly using parallax measurements, yielding a value of , although this result has a relatively large margin of error of [...] Because Epsilon Geminorum is located near the ecliptic it can be <b>occulted</b> by the Moon or a planet. Just such an occultation took place on April 8, 1976 by Mars, which allowed the oblateness of the planet's outer atmosphere to be measured. Prior to that, the star was <b>occulted</b> by Mercury on June 10, 1940. On September 3, 2015, Epsilon Geminorum {{is expected to be}} <b>occulted</b> by the asteroid Iphigenia.|$|R
