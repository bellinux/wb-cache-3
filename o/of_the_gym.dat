Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable to be {{separated}} for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei is able to break the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine's arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens with}} Mangte Chungeijang Kom (Priyanka Chopra) in labour, walking towards the {{hospital}} with her husband, Onler Kom (Darshan Kumaar). Due to a curfew, they have difficulty finding a public transport and Onler is mistaken for an insurgent and beaten {{when he tries to}} find a vehicle. The film then shifts to a flashback in which Kom found boxing gloves in the remains of an air crash in 1991, which prompted her interest in boxing despite her father's disapproval. During an early fight, she chases a boy and ends up in a boxing gym. After realising that the coach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym,</b> Narjit Singh (Sunil Thapa), was also the coach of the Asian champion Dingko Singh, Kom tells him about her boxing aspirations. He asks her to visit the gym for the next thirty days and says that he will only teach her if she is deserving enough. She starts visiting the gym, informing her mother but not her father. Days pass but her coach does not enquire about her. Due to Kom's dedication and stubbornness, Singh starts training her. Later, he suggests changing her name to Mary Kom.|$|E

Æbleskiver are traditional Danish pancakes in a distinctive spherical shape. Æbleskiver Days {{is one of}} the town's top attractions, and has been held annually by Danish descendants for more than a hundred years. During this two-day festival held on the 4th weekend of every July, Danebod celebrates its Danish heritage and community. During this festival, there is a parade inspired by Danish traditions and culture that goes down Main Street with floats made by the various neighborhoods.

30|$|In <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> 2015, a {{questionnaire}} was distributed to gym-goers at 54 <b>gyms</b> in Sweden. <b>The</b> <b>gyms</b> were recruited either through Prevention of Doping in Sweden (PRODIS; {{a national network}} comprising governmental agencies, universities, county administrative boards, municipal prevention coordinators, representatives from the police force and <b>gyms,</b> <b>the</b> Swedish Sports Confederation, and the Swedish Anti-Doping Hotline) or through the research centre STAD (Stockholm Prevents Alcohol and Drug Problems). The questionnaire was distributed prior to implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doping prevention programme 100 % PHT at <b>the</b> <b>gyms.</b> During data collection, research staff stood by <b>the</b> entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gyms</b> on a weekday afternoon or evening and asked arriving gym-goers above 16  years of age whether {{they were going to}} do weight training (i.e., work with free weights or machines). Those who replied in the affirmative were invited to participate in the study. Gym-goers who agreed to participate were asked to complete {{a questionnaire}}. To guarantee anonymity, participants completed the questionnaire anonymously and then placed it in an envelope and sealed it, before returning it to the research staff. For the study, 2631 gym-goers were asked to participate, and 1969 of them agreed (74.8 % response rate). All gyms were located in urban areas; 39 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gyms</b> were located in a major city (i.e., more than 200, 000 inhabitants), 37 % in a large town (i.e., more than 50, 000 inhabitants), and 13 % in a small town (i.e., more than 15, 000 inhabitants) [27].

25|$|Initially {{only part}} of the {{building}} was given to the school; in other parts there remained tenants, a separate music school, kindergarten, and a wind band. On 1 August 1935, the entirety of the building was given over to the secondary school. Year by year, the building was improved. During the 1937/38 school year the school received a gym, which was expanded to include dressing rooms and work-out rooms. When the gym was built {{at the back of the}} school's property, it abutted another outlying building belonging to the school. This small house, formerly used as teachers' quarters, and now home to the P.E. offices and a classroom, is also under historical preservation due to it being the birthplace of Dr. Kálmán Balogh, a famous Hungarian pharmaceutical scientist. The roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> was renovated in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, the {{university}} has undertaken a proposal to substantially expand the campus north of Ellesmere Road, starting {{with the construction of}} the Instructional Centre, funded by Canada's Economic Action Plan, completed in 2011. The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre (built 2014) {{was one of the main}} venues of the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games. The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre brought pool facility to campus and significantly expanded the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym.</b> The Parapan American Games also brought an addition of seven accessible tennis courts to the Highland Creek valley. The Environmental Science and Chemistry Building, completed in summer 2015, was the third building to open in the north grounds. In 2016, the construction of Highland Hall began on the south grounds of the campus, where the former recreation centre was situated. After completion, Highland Hall will house lecture halls, the registrar office, accessibility services and some social science departments.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Coach Wood {{followed}} Roscoe's superintendent {{to become}} Seminole, Texas High School's head coach. Seminole offered better pay, a larger high school, and a less stressful job. Coach Wood {{was no longer}} a principal, had no math courses to teach, and was helped by three assistants. It was at Seminole that Coach Wood first hired Morris Southall to be his assistant coach. The two became lifelong friends and coached together for thirty-one years. In 1947, Seminole won the district championship with nine wins and one loss but lost {{the first game of the}} state playoffs. The next season the football team went 6-3-1, followed by a 4-4-2 season in 1949. After the 1949 season, Coach Wood resigned as head coach, leaving Seminole with nineteen wins, nine losses, and three ties. Coach Southall took over as head coach at Seminole, while Coach Wood moved on to Winters High School. At Winters, Coach Wood's football team went 6-4 in 1950, but the poor condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> and neglect from the school board caused him to resign after only one season.|$|E
25|$|Most {{evidence}} points {{towards a}} theory presented in August 2006 by State Duma member Yuri Savelyev, a weapons and explosives expert. Savelyev {{claimed that the}} exchange of gunfire was not begun by explosions within the school building but by two shots fired from outside the school and {{that most of the}} home-made explosive devices installed by the rebels did not explode at all. He says the first shot was fired most likely from an RPO-A Shmel infantry rocket located at the roof of nearby five-story House No. 37 in School Lane and aimed at the gymnasium's attic, while the second one fired from an RPG-27 grenade launcher located at the House No. 41 on the same street, destroying a fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> wall (empty shells and launchers supporting this theory were found at roofs of these houses and alternative weapons mentioned in the report were RPG-26 or RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenades). Savelyev, a dissenting member of the federal Torshin commission (see below for the findings of Torshin), claims these explosions killed many of the hostages and that dozens more died in the resulting fire. Yuri Ivanov, another parliamentary investigator, further contended that the grenades were fired on the direct orders of President Putin. Several witnesses during the trial of Kulayev previously testified that the initial explosions were caused by projectiles fired from outside.|$|E

500|$|In Pokémon Red and Blue, {{the player}} learns of Mewtwo's {{existence}} by reading research notes {{left in the}} ruined Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island. The notes say that the island's scientists discovered a new Pokémon in a Guyana jungle, that they named it Mew, and that it later {{gave birth to a}} creature they called Mewtwo; the game's Pokédex entry states that Mewtwo was [...] "created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments". Mewtwo proved too mighty to control, destroying the laboratory and escaping. The player is later given an opportunity to capture Mewtwo in the Cerulean Cave, which is accessible only after defeating the game's final bosses, the Elite Four and Blue; in the remakes Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen this prerequisite was expanded, requiring the player to explore more thoroughly and record information on sixty Pokémon species before access to the cave would be granted. Mewtwo is catchable in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver in the same location as before after defeating all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> leaders in Kanto. The character was also the focus of a promotion and downloadable content giveaway for Pokémon Black and White.

At approximately 8:10a.m. Dahmer was discovered {{on the floor of}} the bathrooms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> suffering from extreme head and facial wounds; he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a 20-inch (51cm) metal bar. His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault. Although Dahmer was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later. Anderson had also been beaten with the same instrument, and died two days later from his wounds. Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked Dahmer with the metal bar as he (Dahmer) was cleaning a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as he (Anderson) cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, Dahmer did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: [...] "God told me to do it. Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer are dead."
