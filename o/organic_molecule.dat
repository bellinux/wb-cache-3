5|$|The {{second stage}} of {{catalysis}} is {{the resolution of the}} acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.|$|E

Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{interactions}} between GSH and other molecules with higher relative electrophilicity deplete GSH levels within the cell. An {{exception to this}} case involves the sensitivity of GSH to the electrophilic compound's relative concentration.

Recent spacecraft encounters and ground-based observations of carbon-rich volatile and dust components of comet comae provide a broad database for the investigation of these <b>organic</b> <b>molecules.</b> New laboratory data for some potential cometary organics are presented. Probable icy organic constituents of the nucleus and CHON particles as likely candidates for the distributed sources of gas-phase organic species in the coma are discussed. There is broad agreement that many <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> observed in the coma originate from the dust that must have existed in the solar nebula at the time and place of comet formation.

25|$|Being a {{powerful}} oxidizing acid, nitric acid reacts violently with many organic {{materials and the}} reactions may be explosive. The hydroxyl group will typically strip a hydrogen from the <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> to form water, and the remaining nitro group takes the hydrogen's place. Nitration of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives, such as nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene (TNT). As very many less stable byproducts are possible, these reactions must be carefully thermally controlled, and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired product.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Woodward, {{along with the}} British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, {{postulated}} a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting {{of a combination of}} an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> with iron.

Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer. Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.|$|E
25|$|MOFs are {{composed}} of two major components: a metal ion or cluster of metal ions and an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> called a linker. For this reason, the materials are {{often referred to as}} hybrid organic–inorganic materials; however, this terminology has recently been explicitly discouraged. The organic units are typically mono-, di-, tri-, or tetravalent ligands. The choice of metal and linker dictates the structure and hence properties of the MOF. For example, the metal's coordination preference influences {{the size and shape of}} pores by dictating how many ligands can bind to the metal and in which orientation.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol, {{from the}} Ancient Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid) {{followed}} by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule.</b> It is a sterol (or modified steroid), a type of lipid molecule, and is biosynthesized by all animal cells, {{because it is an}} essential structural component of all animal cell membranes; essential to maintain both membrane structural integrity and fluidity. Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall (to protect membrane integrity and cell viability), thereby allowing animal cells to change shape rapidly and animals to move (unlike bacteria and plant cells, which are restricted by their cell walls).|$|E

25|$|Alkylation {{occurs when}} a {{molecule}} replaces a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group that generally comes from an <b>organic</b> <b>molecule.</b> Alkyl groups that are found naturally occurring in the environment are organometallic compounds. Organometallic compounds generally contain a methyl, ethyl, or butyl derivative which is the alkyl group that replaces the hydrogen. Other organic compounds, such as methanol, can provide alkyl groups for alkylation. Methanol is found naturally in the environment in small concentrations, and {{has been linked to}} the release from biological decomposition of waste and even a byproduct of vegetation. The following reactions are alkylations of soluble compounds found in creosote preservatives with methanol.|$|E
25|$|Conventionally, mass spectrometry, such as Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry(GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography -Time Of Flight(GC-TOF), is {{a common}} {{technique}} for analyzing isotopically labeled molecules. This method involves ionizing and analyzing isotopologues of an intact <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> of interest rather than its products of pyrolysis or conversion. However, {{it does not work}} for natural abundance hydrogen isotopes because conventional mass spectrometers do not have enough mass-resolving power to measure the 13C/D isotopologues of intact organic molecules or molecular fragments at natural abundance. For example, to resolve the single D substituted isotopologue peak of any hydrocarbons you will at {{have to be able to}} at least exclude single 13C substituted isotopologue peak, which sits at the same cardinal mass yet 0.0029 AMU lighter and is of orders of magnitude more abundant.|$|E
25|$|A {{problem in}} most {{scenarios}} of abiogenesis {{is that the}} thermodynamic equilibrium of amino acid versus peptides is {{in the direction of}} separate amino acids. What has been missing is some force that drives polymerization. The resolution of this problem may well be in the properties of polyphosphates. Polyphosphates are formed by polymerization of ordinary monophosphate ions PO4−3. Several mechanisms of <b>organic</b> <b>molecule</b> synthesis have been investigated. Polyphosphates cause polymerization of amino acids into peptides. They are also logical precursors in the synthesis of such key biochemical compounds as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A key issue seems to be that calcium reacts with soluble phosphate to form insoluble calcium phosphate (apatite), so some plausible mechanism must be found to keep calcium ions from causing precipitation of phosphate. There has been much work on this topic over the years, but an interesting new idea is that meteorites may have introduced reactive phosphorus species on the early Earth.|$|E

500|$|Justus von Liebig {{is another}} {{important}} figure {{in the development of}} the new thinking, although his position is ambiguous.

[...] But even the materialistic Liebig continued to invoke the vital force for processes inside living animal bodies. [...] This seems to have been based on a belief that the entire living animal is required for these chemical processes to take place. [...] Bird helped to dispel this kind of thinking by showing that specific chemistry is related to specific organs in the body rather than to the whole animal. [...] He challenged some of Liebig's conclusions concerning animal chemistry. For example, Liebig had predicted that the ratio of uric acid to urea would depend on the level of activity of a species or individual; Bird showed this to be false. [...] Bird also felt that it was not enough simply to count atoms as Liebig did, but that an explanation was also required as to why the atoms recombined in one particular way rather than any other. [...] He made some attempts to provide this explanation by invoking the electric force, rather than the vital force, based on his own experiments in electrolysis.Brock, p. 310Rosenfeld, 2003, p. 1701Wermuth, p. 5Rosenfeld, 1999, p. 50 ...|$|E

50|$|Protein {{skimming}} removes certain organic compounds, including {{proteins and}} amino acids found in food particles, {{by using the}} polarity of the protein itself. Due to their intrinsic charge, water-borne proteins are either repelled or attracted by the air/water interface and these molecules {{can be described as}} hydrophobic (such as fats or oils) or hydrophilic (such as salt, sugar, ammonia, most amino acids, and most inorganic compounds). However, some larger <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> can have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions. These molecules are called amphipathic or amphiphilic. Commercial protein skimmers work by generating a large air/water interface, specifically by injecting large numbers of bubbles into the water column. In general, the smaller the bubbles the more effective the protein skimming is because the surface area of small bubbles occupying the same volume is much greater than the same volume of larger bubbles. Large numbers of small bubbles present an enormous air/water interface for hydrophobic <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> and amphipathic <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> to collect on the bubble surface (the air/water interface). Water movement hastens diffusion of <b>organic</b> <b>molecules,</b> which effectively brings more <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> to the air/water interface and lets the <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> accumulate {{on the surface of the}} air bubbles. This process continues until the interface is saturated, unless the bubble is removed from the water or it bursts, in which case the accumulated molecules release back into the water column. However, it is important to note that further exposure of a saturated air bubble to <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> may continue to result in changes as compounds that bind more strongly may replace those molecules with a weaker binding that have already accumulated on the interface. Although some aquarists believe that increasing the contact time (or dwell time as it is sometimes called) is always good, it is incorrect to claim that it is always better to increase the contact time between bubbles and the aquarium water. As the bubbles increase near the top of the protein skimmer water column, they become denser and the water begins to drain and create the foam that will carry the <b>organic</b> <b>molecules</b> to the skimmate collection cup or to a separate skimmate waste collector and the <b>organic</b> <b>molecules,</b> and any inorganic molecules that may have become bound to the <b>organic</b> <b>molecules,</b> will be exported from the water system.|$|R
