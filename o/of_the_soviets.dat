5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Forging {{banknotes}} was {{a topical}} crime at the time, while {{the idea of}} villains using superstition to hide their lair was a common trope, one that Hergé had used previously in Tintin in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's integration in the strategic system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Following on from Tintin in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit {{money in the}} story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and the fake bunker in Tintin in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of the Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E
5|$|With Poland being {{a member}} of the Soviet Bloc, the party's pursuits of power and reform were {{permanently}} hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, acutely conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction). Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> and the Polish communists.|$|E

5|$|Although Hergé {{wanted to}} send Tintin to the United States, Wallez ordered him to set his {{adventure}} in the Soviet Union, acting as anti-socialist propaganda for children. The result, Tintin in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> was serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from January 1929 to May 1930. Popular in Francophone Belgium, Wallez organised a publicity stunt at the Gare du Nord station, following which he organised {{the publication of the}} story in book form. The story's popularity led to an increase in sales, so Wallez granted Hergé two assistants. At Wallez's direction, in June he began serialisation of the second story, Tintin in the Congo, designed to encourage colonial sentiment towards the Belgian Congo. Authored in a paternalistic style that depicted the Congolese as childlike idiots, in later decades it was accused of racism, however at the time was un-controversial and popular, and further publicity stunts were held to increase sales.|$|E
5|$|Before {{an attack}} on Moscow could begin, {{operations}} in Kiev needed to be finished. Half of Army Group Center had swung to {{the south in the}} back of the Kiev position, while Army Group South moved to the north from its Dniepr bridgehead. The encirclement of Soviet forces in Kiev was achieved on 16 September. A battle ensued in which the Soviets were hammered with tanks, artillery, and aerial bombardment. After ten days of vicious fighting, the Germans claimed 665,000 Soviet soldiers captured, although the real figure is probably around 220,000 prisoners. Soviet losses were 452,720 men, 3,867 artillery pieces and mortars from 43 divisions of the 5th, 21st, 26th, and 37th Soviet Armies. Despite the exhaustion and losses facing some German units (upwards of 75 percent of their men) from the intense fighting, the massive defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> at Kiev and the Red Army losses during the first three months of the assault contributed to the German assumption that Operation Typhoon (the attack on Moscow) could still succeed.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered by {{publicity}} stunts, Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> was {{a commercial}} success in Belgium, and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland. Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in the Congo, and the series became a defining {{part of the}} Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades, while Hergé later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work. As he began to redraw his earlier Adventures in second, colour versions from 1942 onward, he decided against doing so for Land of the Soviets; {{it was the only}} completed Tintin story that Hergé did not reproduce in colour. Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s, with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969, after which it was translated into several other languages, including English. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on The Adventures of Tintin describing it as one of Hergé's weakest works.|$|E
50|$|Kazakhstan {{had been}} a {{constituent}} Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.

50|$|<b>The</b> Republics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union or <b>the</b> Union Republics (союзные республики, soyuznye respubliki) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union were ethnically based proto-states {{that were}} subordinated {{directly}} to <b>the</b> Government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. For most <b>of</b> its history, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{was a highly}} centralized state; the decentralization reforms during <b>the</b> era <b>of</b> Perestroika ("Restructuring") and Glasnost ("Openness") conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev led to <b>the</b> dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in 1991.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Communist Party <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union (Коммунистическая Партия Советского Союза, Kommunisticheskaya Partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza; short: КПСС, KPSS) is a {{political}} party led by Sergei Skvortsov, operating in <b>the</b> countries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former <b>Soviet</b> Union. <b>The</b> party was founded in 1992 at the so-called 29th Congress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist Party <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, which, among other actions, excluded former President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union Mikhail Gorbachev from the newly formed party. The party claims to be <b>the</b> inheritors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Communist Party <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and among its goals states <b>the</b> restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union.|$|R
5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia, which stated that non-Russian ethnic groups living inside the Republic {{had the right}} to cede from Russian {{authority}} and establish their own independent nation-states. Many nations declared independence: Finland and Lithuania in December 1917, Latvia and Ukraine in January 1918, Estonia in February 1918, Transcaucasia in April 1918, and Poland in November 1918. Soon, the Bolsheviks actively promoted communist parties in these independent nation-states, while in July 1918, at the Fifth All-Russian Congress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> a constitution was approved that reformed the Russian Republic into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Seeking to modernise the country, the government officially converted Russia from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar used in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to have the last word in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E
5|$|The {{involvement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> {{split the}} Congolese government {{and led to}} impasse between Lumumba and the President, Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Mobutu, {{in command of the}} army, broke this deadlock with a coup d'état, expelled the Soviet advisors and established a new government effectively under his control. Lumumba was placed in captivity and subsequently executed in 1961. A rival government, the Free Republic of the Congo, was founded in the eastern city of Stanleyville by Lumumba supporters led by Antoine Gizenga. It gained Soviet support but was crushed in early 1962. Meanwhile, the UN took a more aggressive stance towards the secessionists after Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash in late 1961. Supported by UN troops, Léopoldville defeated the secessionist movements in Katanga and South Kasai by the start of 1963.|$|E

5|$|Born {{to a lower}} middle-class {{family in}} Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by {{contributing}} illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 {{on the advice of}} its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions of boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early instalments – Tintin in the Land <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets,</b> Tintin in the Congo, and Tintin in America – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo, Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingtième Siècle. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from The Blue Lotus onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, Le Vingtième Siècle was closed but Hergé continued his series in Le Soir, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.|$|E
5|$|Jones and Mutt are {{captured}} by Mac and the Soviets {{and taken to}} their camp in the Amazon jungle, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, Marion Ravenwood, who reveals that Mutt is Jones' son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes the crystal skull belongs to an alien life form and holds great psychic power, and that finding more skulls in Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Spalko uses the skull on Jones to enable him to understand Oxley and identify a route to Akator. Jones and his four allies escape with the skull, but Marion and Jones get caught into a dry sandpit, to be recaptured by the Soviets after Oxley accidentally brings them as assistance. On their way to Akator, Mac tells Jones he is a CIA double-agent to regain Jones' trust, and Jones' team fights {{its way out of}} the Soviets' clutches, while Dovchenko is devoured by siafu ants. Jones and his allies cause many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> to fall from a cliff, and they survive three waterfalls in an amphibious vehicle. Jones and Oxley identify a skull-like rock formation that leads them to Akator, unaware that Mac lied about being a CIA agent, is still loyal to Spalko and has been dropping transceivers to allow the surviving Soviets to track them.|$|E
