As every living being had been created in a fixed form, as accepted by the science of his time, they could only change their appearance by a perfect adaptation to their way of life, but would still be the same species.

This leads researchers {{to suggest that the}} differences in mating call in the <b>overlap</b> <b>zone</b> of M. olivacea and M. carolinensis act as an isolating mechanism between the two species.

40|$|The {{confinement}} {{of concrete}} columns using bonded FRP wraps {{has become a}} popular retrofit technique. Through extensive research {{in the last two}} decades, many stress-strain models have been developed for concrete in FRP-wrapped circular columns. All these models assume that the stress state is axisymmetric in an FRP-wrapped circular concrete column under concentric axial compression. This implies that the FRP wrap is assumed to be axisymmetric in geometry, but in reality such axisymmetry is not realised due to the existence of an <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone.</b> This paper presents a finite element investigation into the stress state in FRP-wrapped circular concrete columns considering the actual FRP wrap geometry used in laboratory tests and practice. The results show that common FRP wraps with an <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone</b> can lead to significant non-axisymmetric confinement to the concrete and hence a significantly non-uniform stress distribution in the concrete, even when the concrete is under uniform axial shortening.

40|$|Suffusion {{occurs when}} soil {{particles}} are loosened, detached, and transported away by seepage flow {{through a series}} of pores and pore constrictions. While traditional suffusion assessment methods are often based on particle size distribution analysis only, modern assessment methods are focused on constriction size distributions, which are derived from particle size distributions based on certain assumptions. This paper provides a new assessment method, which employs the probability of loose particles being transported to the next pore. The new approach can introduce the influence of an <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone</b> between the two fractions of loose particles and soil primary fabric. This <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone</b> was often overlooked in prior studies. The constriction size distribution of the primary fabric can be calculated approximately by two-dimensional or three-dimensional methods. The three-dimensional method used in the presented study even offers the opportunity to study the influence of particle arrangements on suffusion.

30|$|Closing a {{small size}} hernia of about 2  cm in {{diameter}} {{with a small}} patch (4.3  cm diameter) permits a maximum overlap of 1.15  cm. Similarly, a maximum overlap of 1.2  cm {{is to be expected}} after closing a 4  cm defect using a medium patch (6.4  cm diameter). It is therefore questionable if this limited overlap provides sufficient closure to prevent recurrence. In fact, the recurrence seen in this series must be blamed on a rather insufficient overlap. Using a larger patch, i.e. closing small defects with medium patches, could increase the <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone.</b> Digital dissection of the preperitoneal space was possible via the hernia defect. However, introducing a larger patch via a small defect was challenging. Surgically increasing the size of the defect would have enabled the placement of a larger patch.

Unfortunately, data on long-term outcome of patients managed with this technique with regard to recurrence is lacking.|$|E

40|$|Neurogenesis in {{the adult}} rat hippocampal subgranular zone and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles has been well documented. Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that neurogenesis also occurs {{in the adult}} hypothalamus. We report that, after intracerebroventricular treatment with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), cell proliferation significantly increased in both the periventricular and the parenchymal zones of the whole hypothalamus. Proliferation was particularly abundant in a distinct periventricular zone of the caudal hypothalamus. This is an <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone</b> of transition, between the cubic ciliated ependymal, dorsally located, and the tanycytic ependyma, ventrally located, where three cell layers can be found: ciliated ependyma, subependyma and underlying tanycytes. After IGF-I treatment, proliferating cells were seen in the subependyma and in the layer of tanycytes. Neurons, astrocytes, tanycytes, microglia and endothelial cells of the local vessels were stained with the proliferative marker 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in response to IGF-I. However, we never observed BrdU-positive ciliated cubic ependymal cells. In the subependyma, proliferating glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes contacted the ventricle by an apical process bearing a single cilium {{and there were many}} labyrinthine extensions of the periventricular basement membranes. Both features are typical of neurogenic niches in other brain zones, suggesting that the central <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone</b> of the rat hypothalamic wall could be considered a neurogenic niche in response to IGF-I. These effects will be compared with those obtained for other factors. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} {{application of}} fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is as a confining material for concrete in the retrofit of existing concrete columns by {{the provision of}} FRP jackets. Such jackets are commonly formed in a wet layup process, with the fibers being only or predominantly in the hoop direction. It has been well established in recent studies that the rupture strains/strengths of FRP measured in tests on such FRP-confined concrete cylinders fall substantially below those from flat coupon tensile tests, but the causes are unclear. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study that is aimed at clarifying these causes. To this end, the paper reports and compares the ultimate tensile strains of two types of FRP (carbon FRP and glass FRP) obtained from three types of tests-flat coupon tensile tests, ring splitting tests, and FRP-confined concrete cylinder tests. Based on comparisons of these test results, it can be concluded that the FRP hoop rupture strains in FRP-confined concrete cylinders are reduced below the ultimate tensile strains from flat coupon tests by at least three factors - (1) the curvature of the FRP jacket; (2) the deformation localization of the cracked concrete; and (3) the existence of an <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone.</b> While the first factor that reduces the in situ strain capacity of FRP on confined concrete is material dependent, the last two factors that result in a nonuniform strain distribution in the jacket are independent of the FRP material properties. The third effect reduces the average hoop rupture but does not affect the distribution of the confining pressure, as the FRP jacket is thicker in the <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Background: Retrosigmoid {{vestibular}} neurectomy {{is considered}} to be the most effective and safe procedure to control intractable vertigo associated with Ménière's disease while preserving hearing. The surgical procedure of retrosigmoid vestibular neurectomy at the cerebellopontine angle has been well established. Here, we provide for otologic surgeons additional details about the procedure, with special attention to the anatomic features to emphasize our technique, which enables an adequate sectioning of the vestibular fibers on the cochlear nerve close to the <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone</b> containing large-caliber vestibular fibers and small-caliber cochlear fibers. Methods: We used the lateral decubitus position to enter the cerebellopontine angle. The cerebellum was gently retracted to expose the cerebellomedullary cistern, which was then opened to drain the cerebrospinal fluid for slacking of the cerebellum. The underlying lower cranial nerves IX, X, and XI were identified. The retractor was then moved upward to locate the internal acoustic meatus and the complexes VIII–VII. Adjacent to the internal auditory canal, a longitudinal incision, about 3  mm long and 0. 5  mm away from the landmarks of arteriole or cochleovestibular cleavage plane, was made on the cochlear nerve. A surgical separation plane was bluntly created using a microdissector between the two components, and the vestibular nerve was sharply sectioned with microscissors. Results: We re-examined the patients' hearing status, word recognition (speech discrimination) skill, functional levels, and frequency of vertiginous episodes 1 month and at all 6 -month intervals after the surgery. At 2 years after surgery, vertigo was completely controlled, indicating a 100 % cure rate. Conclusion: Sectioning of vestibular fibers was performed along the cochleovestibular cleavage landmark on the cochlear nerve where the <b>overlapping</b> <b>zone</b> was located, allowing for a safe and adequate vestibular neurectomy, while most of the cochlear fibers were spared...|$|E
