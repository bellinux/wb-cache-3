5|$|On November 24, 1922, Cather {{wrote to}} a friend, Edwin H. Anderson, {{director}} of the New York Public Library, {{that she was the}} author of the entire book except for the first chapter. Burton J. Hendrick had written the first installment, but it had been based largely on rumor. McClure asked her to complete the series because she was regarded as impartial. For the rest of the installments, she told Anderson, no expense had been spared in verifying Milmine's material. McClure had promoted her to managing editor {{on the basis of the}} work. She ended the letter by asking Anderson to keep the information confidential; she added that had not told the truth about it to anyone before this, but felt that someone <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E

500|$|Mack Brown, {{the head}} coach of the University of Texas at Austin Longhorn {{football}} team, plays a cameo in the episodes. He appears in the pep rally scene, where {{he is a member of}} the local community questioning coach Taylor. Brown played without a script because, according to Berg, [...] "you've heard fathers for 33 years, so you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what to say." [...] Kyle Chandler, as coach Taylor, was reportedly surprised by Brown's intensity.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was an}} uneven yet highly enjoyable mythology episode, far better than the episode {{that appears to have}} spawned it ('Trustno1') [...] I look forward to whatever directorial/writing work David Duchovny might do in the future. And if this is indeed the last we see of William, well, I’m not going to complain!

500|$|In 1996 Tharoor was {{appointed}} {{director of communications}} and special projects and executive assistant to the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In January 2001 he {{was appointed}} Under-Secretary General for Communications and Public Information, and as Head of the Department of Public Information (UNDPI). In this capacity, {{he was responsible for}} the United Nations' communications strategy, enhancing the image and effectiveness of the organisation. In 2003 the Secretary-General gave him the additional responsibility of United Nations Coordinator for Multilingualism. During his tenure at the UNDPI, Tharoor reformed the department and undertook a number of initiatives, ranging from organising and conducting the first-ever UN seminar on anti-Semitism, the first-ever UN seminar on Islamophobia after the 11 September attacks, and launching an annual list of [...] "Ten Under-Reported Stories the World <b>Ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> about", which was last produced in 2008 by his successor.|$|E
500|$|Zotov {{became one}} of Peter's first friends, and the two {{remained}} close throughout Zotov's life. Lindsey Hughes, a 20th-century historian, has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future tsar <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Her contemporary, Robert K. Massie, {{has argued that the}} education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter, because it was unlikely that he would ever become tsar, as his half-brother, Ivan V, was before him in the line of succession. According to Massie, although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level, he delivered [...] "the best education for a mind like Peter's", as it [...] "stimulated [...] curiosity" [...] and allowed him to become [...] "in large part, a self-taught man". Zotov's closeness to the Tsar later became a source of worry to others in government, many of whom—including even the powerful Menshikov—feared his influence.|$|E
500|$|The Diamondback, the university's student newspaper, had criticized Ward {{for moving}} the team into one dormitory, which forced some other {{students}} out. Ward {{stated that the}} move was done {{on the advice of}} Kehoe—which Kehoe denied—and with the intent of focusing the players on their studies and building camaraderie. Ward and his assistants monitored the players' academic performance, enforced class attendance, and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers. Ward stated that, in his first year, only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics. He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe. In fact, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward's resignation and {{sent a letter to the}} American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation. Paterno said:"I don't know who's right or wrong, but...I don't think it's a good thing for a squad to fire a coach. As an association, we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what happened. If a university fired an English professor because his class didn't like the way he was doing things, I know darn well that the American Association of University Professors would want to know what happened." ...|$|E

500|$|Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, {{and worked}} {{on a number of}} BBC radio programmes, such as Workers' Playtime, Melody Magazine and Forces' All-Star Bill. In 1951 he {{provided}} the musical interludes for a new BBC series Crazy People, a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine. Crazy People changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing [...] "Crazy Rhythm" [...] for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as [...] "Conk", on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: [...] "That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica. We thought you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what it was, anyhow." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming they are aware of the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|E

2500|$|Claudia Rosett, a {{journalist}} with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a weekly columnist for Forbes, questioned {{the source of}} the funding for the project. Some U.S. politicians such as Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, who is an Independent Democrat, and Republicans Peter King and Rick Lazio (N.Y.-2), asked for an investigation of the group's finances, especially its foreign funding, despite the fact that fundraising for the project had not yet begun. King said: [...] "The people who are involved {{in the construction of the}} mosque are refusing to say where their [...] funding is going to come from."

2500|$|Before the {{animation}} process began, a live-action reference version was filmed with live actors in costume serving {{as models for}} the animators in which Walt Disney insisted on because he wanted the characters to appear [...] "as real as possible, near flesh-and-blood." [...] However, Milt Kahl objected to this method, calling it [...] "a crutch, a stifling of the creative effort. Anyone worth his salt in this business <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how people move." [...] Helene Stanley was the live action reference for Princess Aurora. The only known surviving footage of Stanley as Aurora's live-action reference is a clip from the television program Disneyland, which consists of the artists sketching her dancing with the woodland animals. Stanley previously provided live-action references for Cinderella and later for Anita from 101 Dalmatians, and portrayed Polly Crockett for the TV series Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{research}} by Simone Kühn and Marcel Brass suggests that our consciousness {{may not be}} what causes some actions to be vetoed at the last moment. First of all, their experiment relies on the simple idea that we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when we consciously cancel an action (i.e. we should have access to that information). Secondly, they suggest that access to this information means humans should find it easy to tell, just after completing an action, whether it was impulsive (there being no time to decide) and when there was time to deliberate (the participant decided to allow/not to veto the action). The study found evidence that subjects could not tell this important difference. This again leaves some conceptions of free will vulnerable to the introspection illusion. The researchers interpret their results to mean that the decision to [...] "veto" [...] an action is determined subconsciously, just as the initiation of the action may have been subconscious in the first place.|$|E

The new day promised peace. But all the suns had gone down for Jim Europe, and Harlem didn't seem the same." [...] Europe was granted the first ever public funeral for an African American in the city of New York. Tanney Johnson said of his death: [...] "Before Jim Europe came to New York, the colored man knew nothing but Negro dances and porter's work. All that has been changed. Jim Europe was the living open sesame to the colored porters of this city. He took them from their porter's places and raised them to {{positions}} of importance as real musicians. I think the suffering public <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that in Jim Europe, the race has lost a leader, a benefactor, and a true friend." ...|$|E
