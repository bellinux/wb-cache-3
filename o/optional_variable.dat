40|$|Abstract Background Many {{questions}} in statistical genomics can be formulated {{in terms of}} variable selection of candidate biological factors for modeling a trait or quantity of interest. Often, in these applications, additional covariates describing clinical, demographical or experimental effects must be included a priori as mandatory covariates while allowing {{the selection of a}} large number of candidate or <b>optional</b> <b>variables.</b> As genomic studies routinely require mandatory covariates, it is of interest to propose principled methods of variable selection that can incorporate mandatory covariates. Methods In this article, we propose the ridge-lasso hybrid estimator (ridle), a new penalized regression method that simultaneously estimates coefficients of mandatory covariates while allowing selection for others. The ridle provides a principled approach to mitigate effects of multicollinearity among the mandatory covariates and possible dependency between mandatory and <b>optional</b> <b>variables.</b> We provide detailed empirical and theoretical studies to evaluate our method. In addition, we develop an efficient algorithm for the ridle. Software, based on efficient Fortran code with R-language wrappers, is publicly and freely available at [URL]. Results The ridle is useful when mandatory predictors are known to be significant due to prior knowledge or must be kept for additional analysis. Both theoretical and comprehensive simulation studies have shown that the ridle to be advantageous when mandatory covariates are correlated with the irrelevant optional predictors or are highly correlated among themselves. A microarray gene expression analysis of the histologic grades of breast cancer has identified 24 genes, in which 2 genes are selected only by the ridle among current methods and found to be associated with tumor grade. Conclusions In this article, we proposed the ridle as a principled sparse regression method for the selection of <b>optional</b> <b>variables</b> while incorporating mandatory ones. Results suggest that the ridle is advantageous when mandatory covariates are correlated with the irrelevant optional predictors or are highly correlated among themselves...|$|R

IBM mainframe disk, drum and mass storage devices, called direct access storage devices (DASD) are addressed using a six byte seek address for seek commands and a five byte CCHHR for search count commands. OS/360 and other S/360 operating systems used an 8-byte address structured as MBBCCHHR (Extent (M)-Bin (BB)-Cylinder (CC)-Head (HH)-Record (R), which {{was capable of}} storing records of varying size, up to 255 such records per track, with the zeroth record (R0) being reserved for certain error correction information, such as [...] "skip defects"). In addition to data, records could also contain a key. The length of the key, like {{the length of the}} data, was specified by the application writing the record. In addition to addressing records by number, it was possible to search disks by key, using the underlying count key data (CKD) structure. The term [...] "fixed-block architecture" [...] was created by IBM in 1979 to distinguish this format from its variable-length record format. Fixed-block architecture was adopted for a few mainframe HDDs produced by IBM beginning in the 1970s, and contemporary DASD systems continue to support 3310 and 3370 compatibility. MVS continues to require CKD DASD, although by the 1990s all new IBM HDDs used fixed sectors internally. IBM's various FBA disks had block sizes of 100 or 200 characters, and 270,366, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 bytes.|$|E

With the aim of complying with Eurostat recommendations, {{in the third and}} fourth quarters 2004 was conducted the test of variable on monthly wages and salaries in the Labour Force Survey in Italy. We tested different ways to collect this information in order to find the best one. In particular, according to Eurostat guidelines, we tested the impact of asking gross or net salary and the impact of asking exact salary, salary in bands or a double approach (start by asking exact salary and if no answer in bands). So we tested four different formulations: 1) net exact; 2) net in bands; 3) gross exact; 4) gross in bands. With reference to the problem of partial non-response and interview break-offs, the analysis concerns the following issues: the degree of the problem in different waves; the effect of telephone or face to face interviews in CAPI-CATI systems; the impact of proxy interviews and comparisons among waves between a direct and a proxy interview. We are also able to analyse wages for which there is a higher frequency of non-response to this item depending on profession characteristics. Moreover, considering the longitudinal section of the sample, we use the second interview to the same group in the next quarter (the following wave) as a control interview. In this case it is possible to study the characteristics of fours respondent’s profiles: a) response in first and second wave; b) response only in the first wave; c) response only in the second wave; d) non-response in both waves. We describe groups focusing on the similarity/dissimilarity between the groups and on the degree of homogeneity within each group both on the basis of work variables and on the basis of demographic variables.

40|$|Background: Advanced airway {{management}} {{is a critical}} intervention that can harm the patient if performed poorly. The available literature on this subject is rich, {{but it is difficult}} to interpret due to a huge variability and poor definitions. Several initiatives from large organisations concerned with airway management have recently propagated the need for guidelines and standards in pre-hospital airway management. Following the path of other initiatives to establish templates for uniform data reporting, like the many Utstein-style templates, we initiated and carried out a structured consensus process with international experts to establish a set of core data points to be documented and reported in cases of advanced pre-hospital airway management. Methods: A four-step modified nominal group technique process was employed. Results: The inclusion criterion for the template was defined as any patient for whom the insertion of an advanced airway device or ventilation was attempted. The data points were divided into three groups based on their relationship to the intervention, including system-, patient-, and postintervention variables, and the expert group agreed on a total of 23 core data points. Additionally, the group defined 19 <b>optional</b> <b>variables</b> for which a consensus could not be achieved or the data were considered as valuable but not essential. Conclusion: We successfully developed an Utstein-style template for documenting and reporting pre-hospital airway management. The core dataset for this template should be included in future studies on pre-hospital airway management to produce comparable data across systems and patient populations and will be implemented in systems that are influenced by the expert panel. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the relative importance of the factors that influence the overall satisfaction of real estate students and also examine the extent to which demographic backgrounds affect this. Furthermore, this paper benchmarks the satisfaction of real estate students against that of built environment students. Design/methodology/approach: The data used in this paper have been collected from the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) within the Australian Graduate Survey (AGS). Dimensionality reduction was used to prepare the data about the courses identified in the AGS for analysis. This was done in order to simplify classification of real estate and built environment courses examined in this paper. Descriptive and statistical analysis methods were used to analyse student satisfaction variables and identify the extent to which demographic factors influenced overall student satisfaction. Findings: Real estate students in Australia have a relatively higher level of student satisfaction compared to built environment students overall, but built environment students have a higher level of satisfaction with regard to compulsory variables such as “Good Teaching Scale” and “Generic Skills Scale”. However, real estate students show a higher level of agreement in the Likert scale regarding the <b>optional</b> <b>variables</b> “Appropriate Assessment” and “Learning Community”, respectively. The most important factor for overall student satisfaction was the question: “the staff made it clear right from the start what they expected from the students”. The answers to this question had a Pearson correlation value of 1. 000 for both real estate and built environment students. Age and mode of study also have some impact on the overall satisfaction level of both sets of students, while gender, degree class and the year the university were established are additional factors affecting the overall satisfaction of built environment students. Practical implications: This research identifies the factors that affect the satisfaction of property course students in ascending order of importance. Course directors of real estate courses can use the findings of this research to make recommendations on the redesign and redevelopment of their courses in order to make them more attractive and appealing to students to enhance student recruitment and retention.

This task presents various challenges {{due to the}} nature of the messages: Textual descriptions, multiple topics, heterogeneous content, variable text length and varying recurrence of the statements.

Our scheme consists of identifying parts of a past message and declaring them <b>variable,</b> <b>optional</b> or reusable. This formulation of case reuse corresponds, from an application point of view, to the dynamic creation of a response template from antecedent messages. We describe and compare two strategies for selecting the messages portions to be reused: Case grouping and condensation models. Our results indicate that the case grouping strategy is a better choice. We also describe some of our experiments for identifying variable parts, based on named entity extraction techniques. ...|$|R
