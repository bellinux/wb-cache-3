25|$|By 1800, Fletcher {{was worried}} that he might lose his job, {{as a result of}} the {{shortage}} of funds and the levels of compensation paid to landowners. He therefore asked Rennie if he could move on, and in 1801 obtained a post as Superintendent for the construction of Union Bridge in Aberdeen. The project was facing severe financial difficulty and another Act was submitted to Parliament. In the Act, dated 24 March 1801, the company noted that of the £20,000 authorized by the previous Act, only £17,800 had been subscribed. They obtained powers to raise another £20,000, in £20 shares, on which interest at five per cent would be paid. The preamble to the Act stated that much of the canal had been completed, but that the company had tried and failed to raise any more money. Interest on the new shares would be paid once receipts from the tolls allowed, and the full five per cent would be paid before any returns were made against the <b>original</b> <b>shares.</b> The company hoped to sell the new shares to the existing shareholders, but not all of them were keen to expand their holdings. A public sale of shares in September 1801 raised £11,421.|$|E
500|$|The first {{threat from}} a railway came in 1825, {{when there was}} a {{proposal}} for a line from Framilode Passage to Brimscombe Port. The canal tolls were reduced as a bargaining tool, but the promoters went ahead with their bill. The Stroudwater Company opposed it and it was defeated in Parliament. The Great Western Railway opened a line from Swindon to Gloucester in 1845, which passed through Stroud, but the effects on the canal were rather less than the effects on the Thames and Severn. However, in 1863 the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway Act was passed, allowing the construction of a railway from Stonehouse to Dudbridge and Nailsworth that directly competed with the canal. Dividends fell below 5 per cent after 1880 although they did not cease entirely until 1922. Around the same time the connection to the Severn at Framilode became blocked leaving the connection to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as the only link between the canal and the River Severn. [...] The last toll was paid in 1941, and most of the canal was formally abandoned by an Act of Parliament granted in 1954. Although this removed the need to maintain the waterway for navigation, the Company of Proprietors was not disbanded, and retained most of their other powers. It consists of those who now own the <b>original</b> <b>shares,</b> although over half of the shares were transferred to a Trust in the 1950s, which prevents hostile takeovers and ensures that the company will always be run {{for the benefit of the}} communities through which the canal passes. After the closure of the canal the canal company continued to generate income for many years through the sale of water and some monies produced by property holdings.|$|E

The cost exceeded the authorised capital by a large margin, with the extra being borrowed, but the company continued to pay a 7 per cent dividend on the <b>original</b> <b>shares</b> and on those created to finance the new work. In 1823 and again in 1831, the Newark Navigation Commissioners proposed improvements to the river, so that larger vessels could be accommodated, but the Trent Navigation Company were making a good profit, and {{did not see the}} need for such work.|$|E
2500|$|Berkshire Hathaway {{has never}} split its Class A shares because of management's desire to attract {{long-term}} investors {{as opposed to}} short-term speculators. However, Berkshire Hathaway created a Class B stock, with a per-share value originally kept (by specific management rules) close to [...] of that of the <b>original</b> <b>shares</b> (now Class A) and [...] of the per-share voting rights, and after the January 2010 split, at [...] the price and [...] the voting rights of the Class-A shares. Holders of class A stock are allowed to convert their stock to Class B, though not vice versa. Buffett was reluctant to create the class B shares, but did so to thwart the creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes. As Buffett said in his 1995 shareholder letter: [...] "The unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly {{in the face of}} these goals. They would be sold by brokers working for big commissions, would impose other burdensome costs on their shareholders, and would be marketed en masse to unsophisticated buyers, apt to be seduced by our past record and beguiled by the publicity Berkshire and I have received in recent years. The sure outcome: a multitude of investors destined to be disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|... much of {{the route}} was through sand, and large {{quantities}} of water had to be pumped out of the workings, using three steam engines. The £90,000 had been spent by May 1796, and additional calls on the shares were used to raise the extra £40,000 authorised. Another Act of Parliament was obtained in December 1796, to authorise a further £40,000, {{and by the time}} the new route was completed on 28 May 1798, a total of £162.50 had been called on each £100 share. The <b>original</b> <b>shares</b> were worth £118.75, and financial matters were simplified by issuing additional shares so that they all had a nominal value of £100. Lord Dudley resigned from the committee at this point, having steered the company through twenty-two year of construction. The working capital had risen from just £7,000 to over £200,000 in this period, and no dividends had been paid. Traffic through the new tunnel was meagre until 1802, when the Stratford Canal provided a link to the Warwick and Birmingham Canal (later the Grand Union Canal), and hence to London. The first dividend was paid in 1804, and although dividends were never high, they averaged around 4 per cent between 1826 and 1844.|$|E

2500|$|The Midland Counties Railway (MCR) Act {{obtained}} in 1837 included clauses {{to protect the}} canal, but were accused of interfering with the canal while they were building their line, and the Nottingham Canal obtained an injunction. As part of the negotiations, the company agreed {{to the construction of}} an interchange basin near to [...] Station. Although the station did not open until 1842, the canal company started to reduce tolls in mid 1840, to retain traffic against railway competition. Despite these efforts, income soon began to fall, from £12,536 in 1841 to £5,981 in 1852. Some workers were dismissed, salaries were reduced, and other cost-cutting initiatives were made. The company decided {{that it would be better}} to sell the canal to a railway company, rather than see continual decline, and the Ambergate and Manchester Railway agreed to pay £225 for each canal share, within six months of opening their line. However, the railway company amalgamated with two others, becoming the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway. They opened a line from Nottingham to [...] in July 1850, but then refused to buy either the Nottingham Canal or the Grantham Canal, which had made the same agreement with the original railway company. After several court cases and an appeal to the House of Lords, the sale was agreed, and the final committee meeting of the canal company was held on 4 April 1856. A dividend of £1 and 10 shillings (£1.50) was paid on the <b>original</b> <b>shares,</b> but the shareholders only received £50 per share in cash from the sale, as the rest was paid in railway shares. Further amalgamations followed, and the canal was owned by the Great Northern Railway by 1861.|$|E

40|$|User {{contributions}} {{are critical to}} social commerce sites. Prior studies mainly examined motivational factors influencing user contributions. In the current study, we examine effects of interface layouts on user contributions, {{from the perspective of}} attention allocation. We also distinguish between the two types of user contributions: creating <b>original</b> <b>sharing</b> and appreciating others' sharing. Since attention is a limited resource, we argue that interface layouts may lead to attention trade-off between the two types of user contributions. Leveraging an opportunity of a popular social commerce site's transformation to Pinterest-style infinite scrolling layouts, we collected panel data. Empirical findings show that the new layouts design has opposite effects on the two types of user contribution: a positive effect on users' appreciation of others' sharing, but a negative effect on users' <b>original</b> <b>sharing.</b> Some user characteristics moderate the effects. The findings yield important implications for research and websites design practice. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved...|$|R
