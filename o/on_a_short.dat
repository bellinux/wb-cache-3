5|$|From {{the start}} of his Cairo posting Clarke learned the art of {{deception}} by trial and error. From mistakes during Camilla he learned to focus on what he wanted the enemy to do rather than on what he wanted them to think.

From Bastion he discovered the difficulty of running a large deception <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> timescale. From these lessons Clarke evolved his principles of deception.|$|E
