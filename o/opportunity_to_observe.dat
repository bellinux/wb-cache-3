5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} a rare <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> the corona (the outer {{layer of the}} Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It {{is very hard to}} predict this in advance.|$|E

There is evidence of parasitic behaviour by fungi on algae Palaeonitella, provoking a hypertrophic response. Herbivory is also evident, judging by boring and piercing wounds {{in various states of}} repair, and the mouthparts of arthropods.|$|E
25|$|Milner {{made his}} first {{appearance}} for Newcastle United during their pre-season tour of Asia, scoring his first goal for the club in a 1–1 draw against Kitchee, in Hong Kong.

25|$|Drawing on the {{scientific}} method, Geddes encouraged close observation {{as the way}} to discover {{and work with the}} relationships among place, work and folk. In 1892, to allow the general public an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> these relationships, Geddes opened a “sociological laboratory” called the Outlook Tower that documented and visualized the regional landscape. In keeping with scientific process and using new technologies, Geddes developed an Index Museum to categorise his physical observations and maintained Encyclopedia Graphicato, which utilised a camera obscura to provide an opportunity for the general public to observe their own landscape to witness the relationships among units of society. The Outlook Tower was built in Edinburgh's Old Town and continues {{to be used as a}} museum.|$|E

25|$|The tours {{provided}} Ruskin {{with the}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> and to record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant if largely conventional poetry, {{some of which}} was published in Friendship's Offering. His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by a copy of Samuel Rogers's poem, Italy (1830), which was given to him as a 13th birthday present. In particular, he admired deeply the accompanying illustrations by J. M. W. Turner, and much of his art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and Samuel Prout whose Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, Copley Fielding and James Duffield Harding. Gradually, he abandoned his picturesque style in favour of naturalism.|$|E
500|$|The organism's {{discovery}} was most significant {{because of the}} huge range extension of the anomalocaridids it caused: the group was only previously known from lagerstätten of the lower-to-middle Cambrian, 100 million years before. [...] This underlined the utility of lagerstätten like the Hunsrück Slate: these exceptionally preserved fossil horizons {{may be the only}} available <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> non-mineralised forms.|$|E

500|$|Aberdeen, {{a coastal}} city, gave Struthers the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> the whales which were {{from time to}} time washed up on Scotland's coast. In 1870 he observed, {{dissected}} and described a Blue Whale (which he called a [...] "Great Fin-Whale") from Peterhead. He brought the entire skeleton of a sei whale back to the anatomy department at Aberdeen, where for a century it was suspended overhead in the hall. He vigorously collected examples {{of a wide range of}} species to form a museum of zoology, with the intention of illustrating Darwin's theories. As an energetic and forceful personality with a strong enthusiasm for zoology, he alarmed his colleagues at the University of Aberdeen by constantly asking for money and space to acquire and house his collection.|$|E
500|$|William Jennings Bryan {{was born}} in rural Salem, Illinois in 1860. His father, Silas Bryan, was a Jacksonian Democrat, judge, lawyer and local party activist. [...] As a judge's son, the younger Bryan had ample <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> the art of speechmaking in courtrooms, {{political}} rallies, and at church and revival meetings. In post-Civil War America, oratory was highly prized, and Bryan showed aptitude for it from a young age, raised in his father's house in Salem. [...] Attending Illinois College beginning in 1877, Bryan devoted himself to winning the school prize for speaking. [...] He won the prize in his junior year, and also secured the affection of Mary Baird, a student at a nearby women's academy. She became his wife, and was his principal assistant throughout his career.|$|E

500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what you are doing and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{appearance}} in Batman: Arkham Origins included a speech {{delivered at the}} conclusion of the character's story arch. The player is given the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> Anarky after he has been defeated, and watch as the teenager enters a monologue in which he laments the downfall of society, tries to reconcile his admiration for Batman, and ultimately denounces the Caped Crusader as a false hero. Nick Dinicola of PopMatters, in comparing the game to its predecessor, Batman: Arkham City, asserted that the narrative of Origins consistently challenged Batman's ideological reasons for acting as he does, whereas City uncritically took his motivations as a given. [...] "Anarky’s wonderful speech takes Batman to task for the contradictions in his symbolism," [...] writes Dinicola, choosing that moment in the game as one of several examples of this theme. [...] "Considering that Batman is very explicitly a symbol of fear, Anarky is equating the rise of Batman with the downfall of society." [...] Dinicola was also of the opinion that the willingness to use characters like Anarky to scrutinize Batman's heroism, rather than simply assert it, allowed the game to ultimately prove and uphold Batman as a heroic figure in a way City could not. To Dinicola, this validated the act of challenging a superhero's traditional interpretation in service to the story.|$|E
