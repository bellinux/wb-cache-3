40|$|The health {{benefits}} of oat cereals are linked to its high nutritional compounds, mixed-linkage (1 → 3) (1 → 4) -β-D-glucans (commonly referred to as β-glucans) in particular. This thesis was intended {{to focus on the}} accumulation features of oat nutritional compounds with an emphasis on β-glucans. Four Norwegian oat varieties (Odal, Haga, Vinger and Belinda) were grown at Vollebekk experiment farm of Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU) in the growing season 2013. The sample collection was started fifteen days after anthesis (DAA), and nine harvesting dates were performed in whole growing season. The samples were analyzed for total β-glucans content (including water-soluble and water-insoluble β-glucans analysis for a variety Odal), total starch content and protein content in addition to gelatinization properties of <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> using Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The result showed a significant increasing trend for each nutritional compound per groat during grain filling period. The average content (in %) of total beta-glucans increased from 0. 3 % at 15 -DAA to 4. 2 % at 41 -DAA, and the sharp increases occurred in the 10 days period from 20 -DAA to 30 -DAA. The statistical analysis showed that the accumulation features of those nutritional compounds and the gelatinization parameters of <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> are significantly affected by varieties and the different harvesting date. Overall, Belinda will be the best choice for food because of the higher content of β-glucans content compared to other varieties. M-P...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of thickness (between 80 and 120 µm) on apparent opacity, water vapor permeability and mechanical properties (tensile and puncture) of <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> films plasticized with glycerol, sorbitol, glycerol:sorbitol mixture, urea and sucrose. Films were stored under 11, 57, 76 and 90 % relative humidity (RH) to study the mechanical properties. It was observed that the higher the thickness, the higher was the opacity values. Films without the plasticizer were more opaque in comparison with the plasticized ones. Glycerol:sorbitol films presented increased elongation with increasing thickness at all RH. Puncture force showed a strong dependence on the film thickness, except for the films plasticized with sucrose. In general, thickness did not affect the water permeability. 201...|$|E

In order to evaluate its possible application as thickening agent the rheological investigations of system containing residual <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> were carried out. They involved performing of pasting profiles and texture profile analysis of flour pastes and gels in the presence of starch hydrolyzate, which recently played a increasing role in food industry as alternative for sucrose. Also commercial wheat and oat flours were investigated as reference material It was observed differences in pasting profile and texture of gel caused by introduction of starch hydrolyzate into systems containing cereal flours.

40|$|Lipids from wheat, oat, lentil {{and potato}} {{starches}} were extracted by acid hydrolysis and by selective solvent extraction with chloroform-methanol 2 : 1 v/v [CM] at ambient temperature, followed by n-propanol-water 3 : 1 v/v [PW] at 90 - 100 °C. The acid hydrolysed extracts which represented the total starch lipid [TSL] content ranged from 0. 1 % (w/w) (potato) to 1. 13 % (w/w) (oat). The combined action of CM and PW resulted in almost complete removal of starch lipids (> 98. 6 %) {{from most of}} the starches, the exception being wheat, where the solvent extraction efficiency (%TSL) was 96. 3 %. The free lipids in the CM extracts (%TSL) ranged from 5. 4 % (wheat) to 22. 1 % (lentil), whereas the free and bound lipids (amylose-lipid complex) in the PW extracts ranged (%TSL) from 77. 7 % (lentil) to 90. 8 % (wheat). Neutral lipids (NL) formed the major lipid class in the CM extracts of all starches, while in PW extracts there were NL and phospholipids (PL) in potato, glycolipids (GL) in lentil, and PL in wheat and <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> preparations. There was a great variation among the starches with respect to the major components of the lipid classes in both CM and PW extracts. Monoacyl lipids were most abundant in cereal starches (> 78 % TSL). The fatty acid composition of NL, GL and PL in CM and PW extracts was determined. [...] The physicochemical properties of PW defatted starches of wheat, oat, lentil and potato were determined by monitoring changes in relative crystallinity (RC), Brabender viscosities, swelling factor (SF), amylose leaching (AML), susceptibility towards acid and α-amylase, thermal properties and retrogradation. The RC of potato and lentil starches increased by 21 and 7. 8 %, respectively, on defatting, while that of the other starches remained virtually unchanged. Defatting eliminated the pasting peak of cereal starches and increased the thermal stability and reduced the hot paste consistency of all starches. However, these changes were larger in potato and lentil. The SF of all starches decreased on defatting, with the decrease being more pronounced in potato and lentil. In comparison with their native counterparts, the extent of AML at different temperatures was higher in defatted wheat and oat starches. The extent of acid hydrolysis of native and defatted starches of wheat and oat were similar throughout a common time interval (2 - 20 days). However, during the first stage of hydrolysis, defatted granules of lentil and potato were hydrolysed (4 and 7 days, respectively) {{to a greater extent than}} were their native counterparts. Defatted granules of all starches were hydrolysed by porcine α-amylase to a greater extent than were native starches. The gelatinization temperature of defatted wheat and <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> preparations were slightly lower than their native counterparts. Defatted granules of potato and lentil starch gelatinized over broader and higher temperature ranges than did native starches. The results suggested that amylose and amylopectin chains in native granules are more associated with each other in potato and lentil than in the other starches. Defatting did not hasten or delay the onset time of the retrogradation endotherm in wheat, potato and lentil starches. However, the retrogradation endotherm of defatted <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> appeared earlier than that of native starch. The differences in the onset (To), peak (Tp) and conclusion (Tc) temperatures of the retrogradation endotherm of native and defatted starch gels were only marginal and remained practically unchanged during the time course of retrogradation. The transition temperatures of retrograded gels were lower than those of gelatinized starches. The enthalpies of retrogradation (∆HR) of defatted starches were higher than those of their native counterparts. At the end of 20 days storage, this increase amounted to 4. 7, 3. 6, 1. 7 and 2. 2 J/g in defatted wheat, oat, lentil and potato starches respectively. The gel strength (after a storage period of 24 h at 25 °C) of all four native starches increased upon defatting. The results suggest that the interactions between reassociating starch chains are of a stronger order of magnitude (due to lipid removal) in defatted than in untreated starches. [...] A heat-moisture treatment study was carried out with native wheat, oat, lentil, yam and potato starches. The starch samples were heat treated at 100 °C for 16 h at moisture contents between 10 and 30 %. The heat-treatment did not change granule size and shape. In <b>oat</b> <b>starch,</b> granules were less compactly packed after heat-treatment. The X-ray diffraction intensities increased in wheat, oat and lentil starches, but decreased in potato and yam. The X-ray patterns of wheat and oat starches remained unchanged, while those of lentil, potato and yam starches became more cereal like. In all starches, the swelling factor and amylose leaching decreased, being more pronounced in potato. Heat-treatment induced complex formation between amylose and native lipids. Differential scanning calorimetry of the heat-treated samples showed a broadening of the gelatinization temperature range and a shifting of the endothermal transition towards higher temperatures. These changes were more pronounced in potato starch. The gelatinization enthalpy of wheat, oat and lentil starches remained unchanged, but those of potato and yam starches decreased on heat-treatment. Heat-treatment increased the 95 °C Brabender consistency of wheat starch, but decreased those of oat, lentil, potato and yam starches. In all starches, thermal and shear stability increased after heat-treatment. Acid hydrolysis decreased on heat-treatment of wheat and lentil starches, but increased in oat, potato and yam starches. However, in potato and yam starches the foregoing trend was evident only during the first seven days of hydrolysis. Thereafter, acid hydrolysis was more pronounced in native than in heat-treated starches. The susceptibility towards hydrolysis by porcine pancreatic α-amylase decreased on heat-treatment of wheat and lentil starches, whereas increases were observed for oat, potato and yam starches. The results indicated that the extent of starch chain associations within the amorphous regions and the degree of crystalline order are altered during heat-moisture treatment. The magnitude of these changes were found to be dependent upon the moisture content during heat-treatment and on the starch source. The effect of heat-moisture treatment (100 °C, 30 % moisture for 16 h) on the thermal and textural characteristics of retrograding starch gels from wheat, oat, lentil and potato were also investigated. The heat-treatment did not hasten or delay the onset time of the retrogradation endotherm in wheat, potato and lentil starches. However, in <b>oat</b> <b>starch,</b> heat-moisture treatment advanced the onset time from 15 days (native) to 6 days. The differences in To, Tp and Tc of the retrogradation endotherm of native and heat-moisture treated starch gels were only marginal, and remained practically unchanged during the time course of retrogradation. However, the enthalpy of retrogradation (∆HR) increased upon heat-moisture treatment in wheat, oat and lentil starches but decreased in potato. Furthermore, in native and heat-moisture treated starches, the ∆HR increased with storage (at 25 °C) time. The gel strength (after a storage period of 24 h at 25 °C) of all four starches increased upon heat-moisture treatment and more marked in potato starch. The results indicated that the changes in thermal characteristics and texture of a heat-moisture treated starch gel on storage is determined by the interplay of the changes in crystallinity, SF and AML on heat-moisture treatment. [...] Annealing was studied with native wheat, oat, lentil and potato starches. The starch samples were annealed at various starch/water ratios at 50 °C for time intervals ranging from 0. 5 to 72 h. Annealing did not change granule size and shape. <b>Oat</b> <b>starch</b> granules were less compactly packed after annealing. X-ray diffraction patterns remained unchanged, and X-ray intensities changed only marginally in all starches. The SF, AML and the gelatinization temperature range (GTR) decreased on annealing. The extent of decrease in SF and AML followed the order: lentil > wheat > potato > oat, while the corresponding order for GTR was: wheat > lentil > oat > potato. The gelatinization transition temperatures (GTT) and enthalpy (∆H) increased on annealing. However, the increases in GTT and ∆H did not begin concurrently during the time course of annealing. Increases in ∆H were slower and were evident only at 1, 2, 6 and 48 h respectively, in lentil, potato, oat and wheat starches. The extent and rate of increase in GTT and ∆H followed the order: potato > lentil > wheat > oat. The magnitude of changes in GTT and ∆H increased with increase in annealing moisture content. The susceptibility of <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> to enzyme and acid hydrolysis increased on annealing. However, decreases occurred in the other starches (lentil > wheat > potato). Thermal and shear stability of starch granules increased on annealing (potato > lentil > wheat > oat). The results showed that the above changes in physicochemical properties were due to increased interaction between and among starch components during annealing. Annealing (50 °C, 75 % moisture for 72 h) did not hasten or delay the onset time of the retrogradation endotherm in wheat potato and lentil starches. However, in <b>oat</b> <b>starch,</b> annealing advanced the onset time from 15 days (native) to 6 days. The differences in To, Tp and Tc of the retrogradation endotherm of native and annealed starch gels were only marginal and remained practically unchanged during the time course of retrogradation. The ∆HR increased in all four native starches not only upon annealing, but also with the time of storage. The increase in gel strength was marginal in wheat and oat starches after annealing, but was more pronounced in potato and lentil starches. The results indicated that the degree of chain reassociation in an annealed starch gel is influenced by the double helical content within the annealed granule prior to gelatinization...|$|E
40|$|Particles {{can be used}} to {{stabilize}} multi-phase systems known as Pickering emulsions. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how starch particles affect emulsion properties. Starch granules were used individually as well as in binary mixtures. To obtain a wide variety of starch properties granules were selected based on botanic variation (quinoa, oat, waxy barley, waxy maize and potato). The properties of the starch particles were furthermore changed by size fractionation by sedimentation, acid hydrolysis, cold gelatinization, or dissolution-precipitation, which resulted in different particle sizes and shapes. Almost all samples were modified with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) to 1. 7 %- 3 %. The particle size was found to be important, since decreased particle sizes lead to decreasing emulsion drop size and increased stabilization against creaming. Decreased particle size up to 89 % (potato), 64 % (waxy maize) and 62 % (waxy barley) by acid hydrolysis, and from 15 µm to 120 nm (waxy maize) by dissolution-precipitation, had a strong impact on decreasing emulsion drop size. The shape also influenced the affinity for the oil/water interface. Smooth rounded particles (waxy barley < 10 µm) seemed to provide smaller emulsion drops than smaller/similar sizes of polyhedral particles (quinoa and <b>oat).</b> <b>Starch</b> particles from ~ 120 nm (nanoparticles) to < 10 µm (granules) were suitable for stabilization of emulsions, and the smaller the particle, the lesser weight of starch was needed for droplets stabilization. The best emulsifying capacity and stability was obtained with the nanoparticles (~ 120 nm particle size) which gave emulsions that were stable for up to 1 year. Mixtures of starch granules in emulsion systems showed that when two types of starch granules are mixed, one is more likely to dominate on the interface but when the starch content is low both starches might adsorb. In the case of <b>oat</b> <b>starch,</b> it was seen that Pickering emulsion could be formed also with granules that had not been OSA-modified and that these adsorbed granules could be gelatinized in situ using CaCl 2. Cold gelatinization of oat resulted in an increase in particle size and at a minimum level of gelatinization these swelled granules increased the emulsion index for the emulsions they were stabilizing.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} the {{molecular}} weight (MW), viscosity, and solubility of β-glucan on the rate of in vitro starch digestion and estimated glycemic index (GI) were evaluated. Extracted <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> and β-glucan suspensions with high, medium, and low MW were heated to gelatinize the starch. The viscosity increased and the solubility decreased {{with an increase in}} the MW of β-glucan. The in vitro starch hydrolysis of the mixtures and a control, white bread, increased as the digestion time increased. As the MW of β-glucan increased, the starch hydrolysis decreased during in vitro digestion. The in vitro estimated GI of the mixture without β-glucan, determined from the starch hydrolysis rate, was 88. 3 for Jim and 80. 0 for N 979, which decreased to 68. 4 and 66. 8, respectively, with the inclusion of high-MW β-glucan. The estimated GI values were negatively correlated with the β-glucan peak and final viscosities (r = − 0. 81 and − 0. 82). These results illustrated the importance of viscosity attributed to the β-glucan MW on starch hydrolysis during in vitro digestion. These findings will help to develop new food products with a low GI by using oat β-glucan...|$|E

The experiment was conducted during 20 days in water recirculation system. Sixty fishes (initial average weight 60 g) were used and divided into three treatments composed of the following diets: inclusion of peeled oats, defatted rice bran and control diet, all with 36 % crude protein and 3, 200 Kcal DE/Kg. There {{was no significant difference in}} growth parameters. The analysis demonstrated a reduction in liver glycogen content for the treatment with oats; however, no apparent changes in the activity of the enzymes alanine-aminotransferase and glucose- 6 -phosphatase were observed, raising the possibility that the fishes did not use gluconeogenesis. The blood analysis, showed no significant differences in the determinations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and albumin; however, serum levels of total protein were higher for treatment with defatted rice bran, and triglyceride levels were lower in animals that received diet containing <b>oat</b> as <b>starch</b> source.

40|$|Adhesion of 19 Bifidobacterium strains {{to native}} maize, potato, <b>oat,</b> and barley <b>starch</b> {{granules}} was examined to investigate links between adhesion and substrate utilization {{and to determine}} if adhesion to starch could be exploited in probiotic food technologies. Starch adhesion was not characteristic of all the bifidobacteria tested. Adherent bacteria bound similarly to {{the different types of}} starch, and the binding capacity of the starch (number of bacteria per gram) correlated to the surface area of the granules. Highly adherent strains were able to hydrolyze the granular starches, but not all amylolytic strains were adherent, indicating that starch adhesion is not a prerequisite for efficient substrate utilization for all bifidobacteria. Adhesion was mediated by a cell surface protein(s). For the model organisms tested (Bifidobacterium adolescentis VTT E- 001561 and Bifidobacterium pseudolongum ATCC 25526), adhesion appeared to be specific for α- 1, 4 -linked glucose sugars, since adhesion was inhibited by maltose, maltodextrin, amylose, and soluble starch but not by trehalose, cellobiose, or lactose. In an in vitro gastric model, adhesion was inhibited both by the action of protease and at pH values of ≤ 3. Adhesion was not affected by bile, but the binding capacity of the starch was reduced by exposure to pancreatin. It may be possible to exploit adhesion of probiotic bifidobacteria to starch granules in microencapsulation technology and for synbiotic food applications...|$|R
40|$|Aspergillus phoenicis is an {{interesting}} heat tolerant fungus that can synthesize enzymes with several applications in the food industry due to its great hydrolytic potential. In this work, the fungus produced high enzymatic levels when cultivated on inexpensive culture media consisting of flakes from different origins such as cassava flour, wheat fibre, crushed soybean, agro-industrial wastes, starch, glucose or maltose. Several enzymatic systems were produced from these carbon sources, but amylase was the most evident, followed by pectinase and xylanase. Traces of CMCases, avicelase, lipase, &# 946;-xylosidase, &# 946;-glucosidase and &# 945;-glucosidase activities were also detected. Amylases were produced on rye flakes, <b>starch,</b> <b>oat</b> flakes, corn flakes, cassava flour and wheat fibre. Significant amylolytic levels were produced in the culture medium with glucose or when this sugar was exhausted, suggesting an enzyme in the constitutive form. Cassava flour, rye, oats, barley and corn flakes were also used as substrates in the hydrolytic reactions, aiming to verify the liberation potential of reducing sugars. Corn flakes induced greater liberation of reducing sugars {{as compared to the}} others. Thin layer chromatography of the reaction end products showed that the hydrolysis of cassava flour liberated maltooligosaccharides, but cassava flour and corn, rye, oats and barley flakes were hydrolyzed to glucose.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} of the risks of pollution in biological systems and one potential problem is the synthetic antioxidants, used for e. g. the stabilisation of polymeric materials. Natural antioxidants are an interesting alternative, if the high efficiency and thermal stability of the synthetic compounds can be reached. In the work described in this thesis, vitamin E (alfa-tocopherol) was studied as a natural antioxidant for the stabilisation {{of one of the}} major plastics, polyethylene (PE). The dependence of the surrounding environment for the efficiency of alfa-tocopherol in polyethylene (PE), throughout thermal aging, was characterised by sensitive techniques. Two techniques which have shown a high sensitivity in oxidation detection of polymers; chemiluminescence (CL) and gas chromatographic analysis, were compared with the commonly used methods, infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermal analysis. Three different additive systems were selected as active domains for -tocopherol in PE. Two of these contained carboxylic acid groups, poly (ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (EAA) and polyTRIM/PAA core-shell particles (Core), and the third, <b>oat</b> <b>starch,</b> had no such groups. The additives containing carboxylic groups improved the long-term efficiency of alfa-tocopherol in PE, according to carbonyl index measurements made by FT-IR, while the additive without carboxylic acid groups gave no improvement. The amount of carboxylic acids emitted from the materials after thermal aging, assessed by head-space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), also showed that EAA increased the antioxidant efficiency of alfa-tocopherol, whereas the Core system showed lower antioxidant efficiency. Reference systems containing the synthetic antioxidant Irganox 1076 and EAA or <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> had the same performance as the materials stabilised with only the antioxidants. CL measurements in an inert atmosphere (TLI) have earlier been shown to give earlier oxidation detection than carbonyl index measurements in unstabilised PE. In this work, the TLI analysis and the carbonyl index measurements had the same sensitivity in the detection of oxidation in the stabilised materials. Assessment of low-molecular weight carboxylic acids in PE during the aging was made by gas chromatographic analysis together with solid-phase extraction. Propanoic acid showed the best correlation with the carbonyl index measurements, even if the carbonyl index showed earlier detection of oxidation. It was also found that TLI and CL in an oxidative atmosphere (CL-OIT) had the same sensitivity and were in accordance for all of the materials, with exception of the materials containing EAA and alfa-tocopherol or Irganox 1076. CL-OIT was also compared to the oxygen induction time determined by thermal analysis. QC 2010092...|$|E
40|$|Various botanical and {{structural}} characteristics of starchy foods {{are considered to}} modify the rate of starch digestion and the glycaemic responses in humans. The main objective {{of the study was}} to examine the impact of fermented barley and oat microstructure on the rate of in vitro starch hydrolysis. A dynamic gastrointestinal model was used to estimate the degree of starch hydrolysis during in vitro digestion of fermented whole grain cereal meals. Light microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to study the microstructural changes. In parallel to the in vitro studies, the impact of fermented barley and oats on postprandial plasma glucose responses was evaluated in a human study. Micrographs were taken during in vitro digestion experiments with fermented whole grains and compared with micrographs of boiled barley (undigested). Images showed that most of the <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> granules were degraded after 120 min of digestion, whereas barley starch granules were less degraded, even after 180 min of digestion. The findings were confirmed by faster starch hydrolysis from the fermented oat meal, measured as maltose generated during in vitro digestion. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated from the plotted maltose curves of the meals. AUC for barley tempe (266 [*]±[*] 33) was 40 % of the AUC for oat tempe (663 [*]±[*] 8) and significantly different (p[*]<[*] 0. 007) from AUC oat tempe. The in vitro data closely resembled the AUCs for plasma glucose from the parallel human study. In terms of glucose response, the mean AUC for barley tempe was 46 % of the AUC for oat tempe in the human study.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of dietary inclusion level of a low lignin hull, high-oil groat (CDC SO-I) oat on the performance, carcass characteristics and rumen degradation characteristics of feedlot cattle. In the first trial, 200 crossbred steers (average weight of 427. 3 ± 22. 4 kg) were allocated to 20 pens. Five treatments, formulated by replacing barley with increasing levels of CDC SO-I oat (Barley grain:CDC SO-I oat ratios of 100 : 0; 75 : 25; 50 : 50; 25 : 75 and 0 : 100; DM basis) were used. Four pens were randomly allocated to each treatment diet. Over the entire study there was a linear decrease (P 0. 05) than the mean pH of 5. 5 for the oat-fed cattle. Treatment did not affect (P> 0. 05) time spent below pH cutoff values of 5. 8, 5. 5 and 5. 2. No effect of oat inclusion level (P> 0. 05) was observed on total VFA levels, molar proportion of individual fatty acids and osmolality while isobutyrate (P= 0. 05) and ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentrations decreased linearly (P= 0. 02) with the higher inclusion of CDC SO-I oat. Time spent eating was linearly (P< 0. 01) increased with higher inclusion level of CDC SO-I oat. Over all, {{the results of this}} study indicate that the replacement of barley by CDC SO-I oat in finishing diets decreases dry matter intake and as a result leads to reduced ADG, increased days on feed and lower slaughter and carcass weights. The reduced performance might be the result of higher fat content, high hull and/or faster degradation rate of <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> leading to subacute ruminal acidosis in cattle fed higher levels of oat. However, replacing barley with CDC SO-I oat does not significantly change the rumen environment.

Germination and different heating processes can be used to improve the texture and flavour of cereals. In this study effects of germination and wet and dry heating on the microstructure, instrumental structure and sensory properties of two oat varieties were assessed. The microstructure of native, germinated, autoclaved and extruded grains of the hulled cv. Veli and hull-less cv. Lisbeth was examined by light microscopy, the texture was measured by determining the milling energy and hardness of the grains and sensory characteristics were evaluated with descriptive sensory profile analysis. In cv. Veli the cells of the starchy endosperm were smaller than in cv. Lisbeth and ß-glucan was concentrated in the subaleurone layer. In cv. Lisbeth ß-glucan was evenly distributed in the starchy endosperm. The grains of cv. Lisbeth were more extensively modified in the germination process than the grains of cv. Veli, otherwise the effects of processing on the grains of the two cultivars were similar. Germination caused cell wall degradation, autoclaving and extrusion cooking caused starch gelatinization. Autoclaving resulted in the hardest perceived texture in <b>oat.</b> Gelatinization of <b>starch</b> appeared to contribute more to the hardness of oat groats than the cell wall structure.

In stirred-tank-batch fermentations, mutant DP 3 in 12 % glucose, 3 % yeast extract-mineral salt-oleic acid medium produced lactic acid {{more than four times}} faster than the wild type. Mutant DP 3 produced 117 g/l lactic acid compared with 67 g/l for the wild type. Mutant DP 3 exhibited faster specific growth rates, shorter lag phases, greater lactic acid fields, and better lactic acid tolerance than the wild type. Mutant DP 3 was stable for over 1. 5 years (stored freeze dried). Mutants with enhanced lactic acid-producing capacity were obtained each time the strain development procedure was employed;Combinations of lactobacilli and biofilm-forming bacteria were evaluated in continuous fermentations for lactic acid production using various supports. Twelve different bacteria, including species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Thermoactinomyces, and Thermomonospora, were tested for biofilm-forming capabilities. Solid supports that were evaluated in either batch or continuous fermentations were pea gravels, porcelain berl saddles, 3 M-macrolite ceramic spheres, and polypropylene (pp) mixed with 25 % various agricultural materials (e. g. corn <b>starch,</b> <b>oat</b> hulls) and extruded to form chips. The best biofilm formation was observed with Pseudomonas fragi, Streptomyces viridosporus T 7 A, and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris. Biofilm formation on the pp-composite chips was detected at harvest by chip clumping and gram-staining. Lactic acid bacteria used in the fermentations were Lactobacillus amylophilus, Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii mutant DP 3. S. viridosporus T 7 A and L. casei on pp-composite chips were the best combination of those tested. In 25 -ml continuous fermentations, biofilm reactors produced 10 to 14 g/l lactic acid at a flow rate of 0. 24 ml/min, whereas 4. 5 g/l of lactic acid was produced by the suspension culture.

In Experiment 2, which immediately followed Experiment 1, and aimed to detect carry over effects of previous feeding of barley straw and grain processing, feed levels were either 650 g/d grain or 400 g/d grain with 550 g/d Persian clover hay. Data were analysed by ANOVA. In Experiment 1, processing {{had no effect on}} digestible dry matter intake. The number of whole grains lost per 100 g of fresh faeces and whole grains loss as the % of grain dry matter intake were affected by an interaction between processing and roughage quality. Whole grain fed with Persian clover hay had greater grain loss than all other diets. Whole grain loss was greater with whole grain than with processed grain. Level of feeding had no effects on grain loss. In Experiment 2, more whole grains were lost in fresh faeces when fed with Persian clover hay than when fed without hay, an effect of previous feeding with barley straw reduced whole grain excretion, and more barley grains were lost than <b>oat</b> grain. Faecal <b>starch</b> was affected, with higher levels when whole barley grain was fed, particularly with Persian clover hay, or when previously fed barley straw at a high level. Feeding grain at 650 g/d did not increase grain or starch excretion. Whole grains represented a small loss of grain dry matter intake in faeces, averaging 0. 8 % with a maximum recorded of 2. 6 %. Faecal concentration of the whole grains may be altered by grain size and the digestibility of the roughage component of the diet. In this study an additional cost of 3 % for processing grains would not have provided economic benefits...|$|R
40|$|During the 20 th century, the {{economic}} position of oats (Avena sativa L.) decreased strongly {{in favour of}} higher yielding crops including winter wheat and maize. Presently, oat represents only ∼. 1. 3 % of the total world grain production, and its production system is fragmented. Nonetheless, current interest is growing because of recent knowledge on its potential benefits in food, feed and agriculture. This perspective {{will serve as a}} further impetus, with special focus on the recently valued advantages of oats in human food and health. Five approved European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) health claims apply to oats. Four relate to the oat-specific soluble fibres, the beta-glucans, and concern the maintenance and reduction of blood cholesterol, better blood glucose balance and increased faecal bulk. The fifth claim concerns the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, especially present in the endosperm, which reduces the risks of heart and vascular diseases. Furthermore, <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> has a low glycemic index, which is favourable for weight control. Oat-specific polyphenols and avenanthramides have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, oats can contribute significantly to the presently recommended whole-grain diet. Next to globulins, oats contain a small fraction of prolamin storage proteins, called 'avenins', but at a much lower quantity than gluten proteins in wheat, barley and rye. Oat avenins do not contain any of the known coeliac disease epitopes from gluten of wheat, barley and rye. Long-term food studies confirm the safety of oats for coeliac disease patients and the positive health effects of oat products in a gluten-free diet. These effects are general and independent of oat varieties. In the EU (since 2009), the USA (since 2013) and Canada (since 2015) oat products may be sold as gluten-free provided that any gluten contamination level is below 20. ppm. Oats are, however, generally not gluten-free when produced in a conventional production chain, because of regular contamination with wheat, barley or rye. Therefore, establishing a separate gluten-free oat production chain requires controlling all steps in the chain; the strict conditions will be discussed. Genomic tools, including a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker array and a dense genetic map, have recently been developed and will support marker-assisted breeding. In 2015, the Oat Global initiative emerged enabling a world-wide cooperation starting with a data sharing facility on genotypic, metabolic and phenotypic characteristics. Further, the EU project TRAFOON (Traditional Food Networks) facilitated the transfer of knowledge to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to stimulate innovations in oat production, processing, products and marketing, among others with regard to gluten-free. Finally, with focus on counteracting market fragmentation of the global oat market and production chains, interactive innovation strategies between customers (consumers) and companies through co-creation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Cereals contain {{naturally}} occurring biopolymers (for example proteins and starches) {{that can be}} used as renewable raw materials in a variety of speciality chemical applications. The separation of protein and starch biopolymers from wheat is well established and relies on a group of proteins called glutens that have a unique network-forming functionality. Oat and other cereals do not naturally contain these gluten proteins and typically rely on chemical-based separation techniques which alter the chemical and physical structures and damage the inherent natural functionality of the biopolymers. This research study investigated the separation of the protein and starch fractions from cereals using the Al-Hakkak Process, a new aqueous process. This process involves adding water and wheat gluten protein to cereals that do not contain gluten. The wheat gluten interacts with the cereal proteins, facilitating the separation of the starch and protein fractions whilst retaining their inherent natural functionality. The aim of this research project was to investigate and optimise the pilot scale separation performance of the Al-Hakkak Process using oat flour. As very little prior research had been carried out, the focus was to characterise the <b>oat</b> <b>starch</b> and protein separation performance and gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved. A variety of techniques were employed. Large scale deformation rheology was used to gain an understanding of the oat-gluten dough rheology and establish the relationship between the rheology and the separation performance. Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to investigate the structure of the oat-gluten protein network. The molecular interactions between the oat and gluten proteins were studied using gel electrophoresis. The network-forming functionality of the new oat-gluten protein was explored. The influence of various processing parameters on the pilot scale separation performance was investigated and the results compared with other data collected through the study to identify key processing parameters. This research programme has resulted in interesting, encouraging and some unexpected outcomes and these are discussed in detail in the thesis. It was concluded that an insoluble protein network formed in the oat-gluten dough and both kneading and extraction processes were found to contribute to the formation of this. A key conclusion was that the changes {{that took place in the}} oat-gluten dough were similar to, but not identical to, the changes that occur in wheat dough. It was proposed that the mechanism for the development of a protein network in oat-gluten dough differed from wheat dough for two main reasons: a) the presence of the oat flour disrupted the normal wheat gluten behaviour, and b) components in the oat flour altered the activity of the gluten proteins. The research identified key processing parameters for the Al-Hakkak Process including kneading time, gluten content, and sodium chloride content of the oat-gluten dough as well as sodium chloride concentration, pH, and temperature of the extract liquor. An important discovery was that the oat and gluten proteins interacted at a molecular level through reducible, covalent, bonding (most likely disulphide linkages) to form the insoluble protein network in the oat-gluten dough. It was concluded that these reducible bonds coupled the individual protein subunits to form new hybrid oat-gluten protein molecules (a combination of oat proteins and gluten proteins). Both insoluble and soluble proteins in the oat and gluten flour were involved in the formation of the insoluble protein network in the oat-gluten dough. This outcome has applications beyond the Al-Hakkak Process, as this new knowledge can be applied to the wider dough processing industry. It was concluded that the wheat gluten was the source of the protein network-forming functionality of the hybrid oat-gluten protein and that the oat proteins had a diluting effect. It was proposed that oat-gluten protein flour from the Al-Hakkak Process could be reused to replace the commercial wheat gluten flour in subsequent production batches. During spray drying of the starch stream, the soluble biopolymers in the extract liquor were found to act as an adhesive and glued individual starch granules together to form spherical agglomerates. Acidification of the extract liquor was found to enhance this agglomeration. It was proposed the acidified starch granules were sticker during spray drying due to the partial acid hydrolysis of the starch granule suface which enhanced the agglomeration...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{investigations}} into the influence of heat treatment on the manufacturing of oat flakes. Sources of variation in the oat flake quality are reviewed, including the whole chain from the farm to the consumer. The most important quality parameters of oat flakes are the absence of lipid hydrolysing enzymes, specific weight, thickness, breakage (fines), water absorption. Flavour, colour and pasting properties are also important, but {{were not included in}} the experimental part of this study. Of particular interest was the role of heat processing. The first possible heat treatment may occur already during grain drying, which in Finland generally happens at the farm. At the mill, oats are often kilned to stabilise the product by inactivating lipid hydrolysing enzymes. Almost invariably steaming is used during flaking, to soften the groats and reduce flake breakage. This thesis presents the use of a material science approach to investigating a complex system, typical of food processes. A combination of fundamental and empirical rheological measurements was used together with a laboratory scale process to simulate industrial processing. The results were verified by means of industrial trials. Industrially produced flakes at three thickness levels (nominally 0. 75, 0. 85 and 0. 90 mm) were produced from kilned and unkilned oat groats, and the flake strength was measured at different moisture contents. Kilning was not found to significantly affect the force required to puncture a flake with a 2 mm cylindrical probe, which was taken as a measure of flake strength. To further investigate how heat processing contributes to flake quality, dynamic mechanical analysis was used to characterise the effect of heat on the mechanical properties of oats. A marked stiffening of the groat, of up to about 50 % increase in storage modulus, was observed during first heating at around 36 to 57 °C. This was also observed in tablets prepared from ground groats and extracted <b>oat</b> <b>starch.</b> This stiffening was thus attributed to increased adhesion between starch granules. Groats were steamed in a laboratory steamer and were tempered in an oven at 80 110 °C for 30 90 min. The maximum force required to compress the steamed groats to 50 % strain increased from 50. 7 N to 57. 5 N as the tempering temperature was increased from 80 to 110 °C. Tempering conditions also affected water absorption. A significantly higher moisture content was observed for kilned (18. 9 %) compared to unkilned (17. 1 %) groats, but otherwise had no effect on groat height, maximum force or final force after a 5 s relaxation time. Flakes were produced from the tempered groats using a laboratory flaking machine, using a roll gap of 0. 4 mm. Apart from specific weight, flake properties were not influenced by kilning. Tempering conditions however had significant effects on the specific weight, thickness and water absorption of the flakes, as well as on the amount of fine material (< 2 mm) produced during flaking. Flake strength correlated significantly with groat strength and flake thickness. Trial flaking at a commercial mill confirmed that groat temperature after tempering influenced water absorption. Variation in flake strength was observed, but at the groat temperatures required to inactivate lipase, it was rather small. Cold flaking of groats resulted in soft, floury flakes. The results presented in this thesis suggest that heating increased the adhesion between starch granules. This resulted in an increase in the stiffness and brittleness of the groat. Brittle fracture, rather than plastic flow, during flaking could result in flaws and cracks in the flake. These would be expected to increase water absorption. This was indeed observed as tempering temperature increased. Industrial trials, conducted with different groat temperatures, confirmed the main findings of the laboratory experiments. The approach used in the present study allowed the systematic study of the effect of interacting process parameters on product quality. There have been few scientific studies of oat processing, and these results can be used to understand the complex effects of process variables on flake quality. They also offer an insight into what happens as the oat groat is deformed into a flake...|$|E

The digestibility of highly CL maize starches with different amylose contents was determined by Englyst, Available Carbohydrate Dietary Fiber and Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Method 991. 43 methods. CL waxy and normal maize starch granules swelled much more at higher temperatures, resulting in significantly lower total dietary fiber content than high-amylose maize starch. The alkali treatment study on low levels of cross-linking in starch affected the ratios of total bound phosphate esters which changed the degree of starch swelling, crytallinity and pasting properties of the CL starch. The study on the mechanism of the digestive enzymes {{and the extent of}} digestion during the incubation of CL wheat starch in AOAC Method 2009. 01 showed progressive digestion after 16 h of incubation, which may not reflect in-vivo response in human. Extrusion of normal and waxy wheat flours resulted in the breakdown of starch and an increase in the insoluble protein, which affected the textural and structural properties of extrudate. High energy input {{played a major role in}} radial expansion of normal hard wheat extrudate, whereas higher amylopectin in soft waxy wheat flour was a dominant factor in determining the radial expansion when compared to normal soft wheat. Inclusion of soft waxy wheat in the oat flour formulations at 18 % moisture content improved the textural and structural properties of extrudates. Low cross-linking level of CL waxy maize <b>starch</b> in <b>oat</b> flour formulation increased the void fraction and reduced the breaking strength of extrudates, whereas higher cross-linking levels of CL starches improved the resistant <b>starch</b> level on <b>oat</b> flour formulation but had very poor structural and textural properties. The study offers a good insight on the properties and digestibility of CL starch, as well as using low levels of CL starch to improve textural properties of nutritional extruded products. In addition, study on the extrusion of wheat flours with different amylose and protein contents provides knowledge on the influence of chemical compositions and energy input on the physico-chemical properties of extrudates...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the composition (moisture, lipid content, ash content, nitrogen content, amylose content, and starch damage), granule morphology, physicochemical characteristics (X-ray diffraction pattern, degree of crystallinity, degree of swelling, amylose leaching, gelatinization parameters), and the average degree of polymerization (DP) of cereal starches (normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, and VII, rice and oat) in their native state and after acid hydrolysis (2. 2 N HCI at 35 °C). [...] The moisture contents of the cereals starches were in the range 10. 4 - 12. 2 % (dry basis). The total lipid content in normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice and oat starches was 0. 86, 0. 01, 1. 21, 1. 49, 1. 01, and 1. 13 %, respectively. The surface (unbound) lipids constituted 0. 06 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 04 %, 0. 11 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 11 % of the total lipid in normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice and oat starches, respectively. The bound lipid content in normal maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice and oat starches was 0. 76 %, 1. 16 %, 1. 33 %, 0. 98 %, and 1. 01 %, respectively. However, waxy maize was devoid of bound lipid. The ash and nitrogen contents of the cereal starches were in the range 0. 09 - 0. 45 % and 0. 01 - 0. 05 % respectively. The apparent amylose content was 23. 7 %, 1. 1 %, 49. 0 %, 66. 9 %, 15. 2 %, and 20. 9 % in normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice, and oat starches, respectively. The total amylose content was 26. 5 %, 1. 1 %, 61. 9 %, 78. 4 %, 20. 6 %, and 29. 3 %, respectively, in normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice and oat starches. The percentage of total amylose complexed by native lipids was 10. 6 %, 20. 8 %, 14. 7 %, 26. 2 %, and 28. 7 %, in normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice and oat respectively. The extent of starch damage was low in all starches (0. 3 - 0. 7 %). [...] The average granule diameter of native normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice and oat starches ranged from 7 - 8, 5 - 15, 4 - 16, 6 - 13, 2 - 7, and 5 - 12 μm respectively. Granules of native rice and oat starches were polygonal to irregular in shape. Maize starches granule were polygonal to irregular in shape. Except for native <b>oat</b> <b>starch,</b> the surface of other native cereal starch granules were covered with fissures or pores of varying diameter. [...] The average degree of polymerization (DP) in native normal maize, waxy maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, rice and oat starches were, 813, 685, 1247, 1285, 1389, and 708, respectively. [...] Native normal maize, waxy maize, rice, and oat starches, exhibited the typical 'A'-type X-ray spectrum of cereal starches. Amylomaize V and VII starches exhibited a 'B'-type X-ray spectrum. The relative crystallinity of the native starches followed the order, waxy maize (49 %) > rice (36 %) > normal maize (34 %) > oat (32) > amylomaize (19 %) > amylomaize VII (16 %). [...] The swelling factor (SF) of native starches followed the order waxy maize> normal maize> oat> rice> amylomaize V> amylomaize VII. Amylose leaching (AML) of native starches followed the order rice> normal maize> oat> amylomaize Vll> amylomaize V. [...] The gelatinization transition temperatures range (Tc-To) for native starches followed the order; amylomaize VII> amylomaize V> rice> waxy maize> normal maize> oat. The gelatinization enthalpy (∆H) of the native starches followed the order: waxy maize> rice> normal maize> amylomaize VII> amylomaize V> oat. [...] All starches exhibited a two stage hydrolysis pattern. A relatively high rate was observed during the first 6 days, followed by a slower rate thereafter. At {{the end of the}} 8 th day of hydrolysis (corresponding mainly to the degradation of the amorphous region of the granule), normal maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, waxy maize, rice and oat starches were hydrolyzed to the extent of 61. 1, 32. 6, 28. 5, 68. 1, 62. 0, and 64. 4 % respectively. Between the 9 th and 15 th day (corresponding mainly to the degradation of starch crystallites) the increase in the extent of hydrolysis was more pronounced in normal maize (9. 3 %) than in oat (8. 3 %), rice (8. 1 %), waxy maize (7. 2 %), amylomaize V (3. 0 %), and amylomaize VII (3. 1 %) starches. At the end of the 15 th day, normal maize, amylomaize V, amylomaize VII, waxy maize, rice and oat starches were hydrolyzed to the extent of 73. 4, 37. 0, 32. 3, 77. 3, 75. 3, and 72. 9 %, respectively. [...] In all starches, the number and size of pores on the granule surface increased after acid hydrolysis. In addition, granules were either deformed or fragmented. In all acid treated starches, DP decreased rapidly during the first 48 h. The extent of decrease in DP beyond 48 h, followed the order amylomaize VII > amylomaize V > normal maize > rice ~ waxy maize > oat. [...] Acid hydrolysis increased X-ray intensities, but had no influence on the X-ray diffraction pattern. Acid treatment decreased (7. 4 %) the relative crystallinity (RC) of waxy maize starch, but increased (7. 7 - 8. 9 %) RC of the other starches. [...] Granule swelling was monitored by changes in swelling factor (SF). Acid hydrolysis for 24 h increased the SF (rice> amylomaize V> amylomaize VII> oat> normal maize). However, granule swelling was not detectable in waxy maize starch. A decrease in SF occurred after 2 days hydrolysis in oat and rice starches, but after 3 days for maize starches. Granular swelling was not detectable in oat, rice and normal maize starches after the 4 th, 5 th, and 8 th, day of hydrolysis, respectively. However, amylomaize V, and VII showed measurable SF even after the 8 th day of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis for 24 h, increased amylase leaching (AML) in all starches (oat> normal maize> amylomaize V> amylomaize VII> rice). Thereafter, AML decreased gradually. The extent of this decrease followed the order: oat> normal maize> rice> amylomaize V> amylomaize VII. [...] In all starches, To (onset temperature of gelatinization) decreased, but Tp (midpoint temperature of gelatinization), Tc (conclusion temperature of gelatinization) and Tc-To (gelatinization temperature range) increased with acid hydrolysis. The extent of increase in Tc-To (after 24 h hydrolysis) followed the order: waxy maize> amylomaize V> normal maize> oat> rice. The extent of increase in ∆H (enthalpy of gelatinization) after 24 h hydrolysis, followed the order: amylomaize V> rice> oat> normal maize> waxy maize...|$|E
