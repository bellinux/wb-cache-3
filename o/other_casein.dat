40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} genetic and nongenetic variation in the degree of glycosylation of κ-casein (κ-CN) and to estimate the effects of glycosylated (G-κCN) and unglycosylated (U-κCN) κ-CN contents on milk coagulation properties of Simmental cows. Measures of contents of the main casein fractions, G-κCN, and U-κCN, and assessment of genotypes at CSN 2, CSN 3, and BLG were obtained by reversed-phase HPLC analysis of 2, 015 individual milk samples. Content of total κ-CN (κ-CNtot, g/L) was the sum of G-κCN and U-κCN, and the glycosylation degree of κ-CN (GD) was measured as the ratio of G-κCN to κ-CNtot. Rennet coagulation time (RCT) and curd firmness were measured by using a computerized renneting meter. Measures of curd firmness were adjusted for RCT before statistical analysis. Variance components of κ-CNtot, G-κCN, U-κCN, and GD were estimated by Bayesian procedures and univariate linear models that included the class effects of the herd-test-day, parity, days in milk, genotypes at milk protein genes, and animal. These class effects, those of G-κCN, U-κCN, and content of <b>other</b> <b>caseins,</b> and the linear effect of milk pH were accounted for by models investigating the influence of κ-CN glycosylation on coagulation properties. The GD ranged from 22 to 76 %, indicating that variation in G-κCN depends on the variation both in κ-CNtot and in the efficiency of κ-CN glycosylation. Genotype CSN 3 BB exhibited high G-κCN and U-κCN relative to that of CSN 3 AA. Heritability of G-κCN, U-κCN, and GD was high and ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 56. A large proportion of the additive genetic variation in G-κCN and U-κCN was attributable to influence of CSN and BLG, but these genes did not affect variation in GD, and across-genotypes differences in the trait were small or trivial. Average RCT of the milk class having the highest G-κCN was, on average, 2 min (standard deviation 0. 5) shorter than that of the lowest class. Conversely, U-κCN and content of <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> were not associated with any effect on RCT, except for a slight delay in coagulation when U-κCN was very high. Curd firmness increased when the contents of both κ-CN fractions and <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> increased. This study provides evidence that the positive association between RCT and κ-CN content is exclusively attributable to the glycosylated fraction of the protein. Because exploitable additive genetic variation in G-κCN exists, improvement of κ-CN composition through selective breeding might be an effective way to enhance milk coagulation properties...|$|R

5000|$|Milk is {{approximately}} {{made up of}} 3.0-3.5% proteins, the main proteins in cream are caseins and whey proteins, caseins are globular proteins with phosphoserine residue. Of the total fraction of milk proteins caseins make up 80% of the fraction while the whey protein make up 20% of the total fraction of proteins. There are four main classes of caseins; β-caseins, α(s1)-caseins, α(s2)-casein and κ-caseins. These casein proteins form a multi molecular colloidal particle known as a casein micelle. The proteins mention have an affinity to bind with <b>other</b> <b>casein</b> proteins, or to bind with calcium phosphate, this binding is what forms the aggregates. The casein micelle are the aggregates of β-caseins, α(s1)-caseins, α(s2)-caseins, that are coated with κ-caseins. The proteins are held together by small clusters of calcium phosphate, the micelle also contains lipase, citrate, minor ions, and plasmin enzymes, along with entrapped milk serum. Casein micelles are rather porous structures, ranging {{in the size of}} 50-250 nm in diameter and the structures on average are 6-12% of the total volume fraction of milk. The structure is porous {{in order to be able}} to hold a sufficient amount of water, it structure also assists in the reactivity of the micelle. The formation of casein molecules into the micelle is very unusual due to β-caseins large amount of propyl residues (the proline residues disrupt the formation of α-helical and β-sheet [...] ) and because κ-caseins only contain one phosphorylation residue (they are glycoproteins). Due to κ-caseins being glycoproteins, they are stable in the presence of calcium ions so the κ-caseins are on the outer layer of the micelle to partially protect the non glycoproteins β-caseins, α(s1)-caseins, α(s2)-caseins from precipitating out in the presence of excess calcium ions. Casein micelles are not heat sensitive particles, they are pH sensitive. The colloidal particles are stable at the normal pH of milk which is 6.5-6.7, the micelles will precipitate at the isoelectric point of milk which is a pH of 4.6.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to gain a better understanding of the formation, stability and microstructure of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by commercial sodium (ALANATE 180) and calcium caseinates (ALANATE 380). The study also determined the effects of heat treatment and NaCI addition on the formation and stability of these emulsions. Emulsions were prepared using various concentrations of sodium or calcium caseinate solutions (0. 5 to 5. 0 %) and 30 % soya oil. Surface protein coverage (mg/m 2) in freshly prepared emulsions was determined from analysis of the aqueous phase after centrifugation of emulsions at 45, 000 g for 40 minutes, using the Kjeldahl method. SDS-PAGE was used to identify the adsorbed protein components in the cream phase. Creaming stability was determined after storage of emulsions for 24 hours at 20 °C by a low speed centrifugation method. The microstructure of these emulsions was determined using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The aggregation state of caseins in sodium and calcium caseinate solutions was determined by successive centrifugation, gel permeation chromatography and multi-angle laser light scattering techniques. For emulsions stabilized with sodium caseinate, the surface protein concentration increased gradually with protein concentration up to 3 %, but the increase was much smaller at higher concentrations. By comparison, the surface protein coverage in emulsions stabilized with calcium caseinate showed an almost linear increase with protein concentration (0. 5 to 5. 0 %). At all protein concentrations, the surface protein coverage of emulsions stabilized with calcium caseinate was higher than that of sodium caseinate emulsions. β-Casein was adsorbed in preference to <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> in emulsions made using ≤ 2. 0 % sodium caseinate, but αs-casein (αs 1 - + αs 2 -) appeared to adsorb in preference to <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> when emulsions were made using > 2. 0 % sodium caseinate. In calcium caseinate-stabilized emulsions, αs-casein was found to adsorb in preference to <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> at all protein concentrations used. Heat treatment (121 °C for 15 min) of sodium caseinate emulsions or heat treatment of sodium caseinate solutions prior to emulsion formation, at all caseinate concentrations, resulted in an increase in surface protein coverage and altered the proportions of individual caseins at the droplet surface. The surface protein coverage of emulsions formed with calcium caseinate solutions increased markedly when the emulsions were heated (121 °C for 15 min) or when calcium caseinate solutions were heated prior to emulsion formation. The preferential adsorption of αs-casein, observed in the unheated calcium caseinate emulsions, diminished after heating, which was due to polymerization of αs-casein during heating and/or degradation of this casein. In sodium caseinate emulsions, the surface protein coverage and the composition of emulsion droplets were influenced by the presence of NaCl prior to emulsion formation. The surface protein coverage in emulsions made with 1 and 3 % sodium caseinate increased with an increase in NaCl concentration up to 40 mM, with a large increase in the adsorption of αs-casein at the droplet surface. Addition of NaCl beyond 40 mM had no further effects on surface coverage and composition. Similar trends were observed when NaCl was added to the emulsions after they were formed. By contrast, in calcium caseinate emulsions, the surface protein coverage decreased with increase in NaCl concentration up to 40 mM, but with further increase in NaCl concentration the surface protein coverage increased slightly. In these emulsions, the composition of the interface remained largely unafffected by NaCl addition; αs-casein was adsorbed in preference to <b>other</b> <b>caseins.</b> Creaming stability of calcium caseinate emulsions, after storage at 20 °C for 24 hours, increased with an increase in protein concentration. However, the creaming stability of sodium caseinate emulsions decreased markedly as the protein concentration was increased above 2 %. This decrease in stability was attributed to the reversible flocculation arising from a 'depletion flocculation' mechanism. This flocculation in turn resulted in enhanced creaming at high caseinate concentrations. In sodium caseinate emulsions, the appearance of the droplets in the confocal micrographs was dependent on the concentration of protein used for making emulsions. Emulsions formed with low concentrations of sodium caseinate (0. 5 and 1. 0 %) appeared to be homogenous with no sign of flocculation. However the emulsions made with > 2 % sodium caseinate showed some irregular flocs, which appeared to be forming a network structure at higher concentrations of protein. In contrast, confocal micrographs of emulsions formed with calcium caseinate at all protein concentrations showed individual droplets. The creaming stability of these emulsions improved, when the emulsions were heated or when emulsions were made using heated sodium or calcium caseinate solutions. The presence of 200 mM NaCl prior to emulsion formation resulted in improved creaming stability and a reduced degree of flocculation...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{large-scale}} isolation of beta-casein from renneted skim milk was developed. The Curd from renneted skim milk was dispersed in hot (>= 70 degrees C) water to inactivate residual chymosin. The heated curd was subsequently recovered by centrifugation. resuspended {{in water and}} incubated at 5 degrees C, during which P-casein dissociated from the curd, the suspension was centrifuged and the aqueous phase lyophilised. The isolated protein consisted mainly of beta-cascin, containing a minor amount of gamma-caseins and traces of <b>other</b> <b>caseins.</b> Unless chymosin was fully inactivated by heating, some beta-casein was hydrolysed at the Leu(192) -Tyr(193) bond. The yield of beta-casein increased with incubation time, up to similar to 20 % of the beta-cascin present in the milk after 24 h at 5 degrees C. Reducing milk pH to 5. 5 or 6. 0, prior to renneting, caused {{a high level of}} contamination with alpha(s) -cascins. This isolation procedure can be easily scaled-up to an industrial process and the beta-casein-depleted curd may be used for the manufacture of rennet casein or processed cheese.

40|$|Selected dairy caseins {{have been}} shown to have {{capacity}} for chaperone-like regulation of folding pathways of <b>other</b> <b>caseins,</b> specifically in preventing development of fibrillar aggregates of beta sheet structure. An assay based on fibril formation by reduced and carboxymethylated-kappa casein (RCM-kCn) was thus used to screen for anti-fibril activity among a selection of dairy protein hydrolysates, in order to discover peptides with possible anti-fibril, chaperone activity. From the selection of eight dairy hydrolysates based on different dairy protein fractions, two of the hydrolysates of whey protein exhibited superior anti-fibril bioactivity against RCM-kCn and amyloid beta (Aβ), the peptide associated with fibrillar plaque deposits in brains of Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Disease patients. It is also possible that the chaperone-like activity responsible for anti-fibril activity may exert protective bioactivity in other protein folding diseases involving proteins other than Aβ, accessible from the periphery. Antifibril peptides may also confer stability and prevent aggregation of thermally denatured dairy protein systems during processing.

40|$|The major {{physiological}} function of milk is {{the transport of}} amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and minerals to mammalian offspring. Caseins, the major milk proteins, are secreted {{in the form of}} a micelle consisting of protein and calciumphosphate.

Absence of a-casein protein significantly curtails secretion of other milk proteins and calcium-phosphate, suggesting a role for a-casein in the establishment of casein micelles. In contrast, secretion of albumin, which is not synthesized in the mammary epithelium, into milk is not reduced.

40|$|Molecular chaperones are {{a diverse}} group of {{proteins}} that stabilise partially folded target proteins to prevent their misfolding, aggregation and potential precipitation under conditions of cellular stress, e. g. elevated temperature. Protein aggregation, particularly the formation of highly ordered protein aggregates termed amyloid fibrils, is of considerable research interest because of its intimate association {{with a wide range of}} debilitating diseases, including Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s, Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s and Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s diseases and type II diabetes. In this review, we discuss the ability of the milk casein proteins to act in a chaperone-like manner. This property is of biological importance since at least two of the casein proteins, αS 2 - and κ-casein, have a propensity to assemble into amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions. The fibril-forming propensity of α S 2 - and κ-casein, the possibility of its occurrence in mammary tissue, and the ability of the <b>other</b> <b>casein</b> proteins, α S 1 - and β-casein, to inhibit the aggregation of α S 2 - and κ-casein and other proteins, are discussed.

40|$|Indigenous goat breeds kept by {{majority}} of smallholder rural farmers in Eastern Africa are {{adapted to the}} local environment. These goats are critical for nutrition and income of their keepers. Milk production per doe is extremely variable. The variation in milk yield in goats is due to varied management practices and variability in genetic make-up of the animals. The variation in kappa-casein gene and the distribution frequencies of its variants amongst indigenous Eastern Africa goat populations were investigated. A 458 base pairs sequence in exon 4 of 296 goat samples were amplified, sequenced and variation analyzed. Nine point mutations corresponding to base transitions were identified. Three sites were synonymous substitutions while the other six mutations were non-synonymous. All the amino acid substitutions were conservative. Analysis {{of the association of}} the mutations yielded nine haplotypes. The occurrence of these haplotypes in ten goat populations indicated that only one haplotype occurred at a rather high frequency.

40|$|The {{extensive}} polymorphism {{recorded at}} the CSN 1 S 1 locus {{has been shown}} to influence goat milk composition and its technological properties. A deficit in alphaS 1 -casein is responsible for the accumulation of immature caseins in distended rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae of mammary epithelial cells (MEC). This triggers a chronic ER stress which induces, in turn, an adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR). Our data strongly suggest: i) the existence of a membraneassociated form of alphaS 1 -casein, which is required for efficient export of the <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> from the ER to the Golgi apparatus; ii) that alphaS 1 -casein {{plays a key role in}} the early steps of casein micelle biogenesis. A differential proteomic analysis (2 D-DIGE) of milks from goats of extreme genotypes (A/A vs. O/O) at the CSN 1 S 1 locus revealed the over representation of ER-resident proteins in O/O milks, strongly suggesting a singular secretion mechanism for this genotype. In addition, goats of O/O genotype produce fat globules smaller in size and displaying significant differences in MFGM composition, including both MFGM proteins and polar lipids. A relationship between genotypes at the CSN 1 S 1 locus and the profile (structure and composition) of milk free oligosaccharides (OS), which are also built within the ER, has been shown, thus providing additional evidence for the impact of alphaS 1 -casein deficiency on the functioning of MEC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Caseins, {{the main}} milk proteins, {{aggregate}} in the secretory pathway of mammary epithelial cells into large supramolecular structures, casein micelles. The role of individual caseins {{in this process}} and the mesostructure of the casein micelle are poorly known. Results In this study, we investigate primary steps of casein micelle formation in rough endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles prepared from rat or goat mammary tissues. The majority of both α S 1 - and β-casein which are cysteine-containing casein was dimeric in the endoplasmic reticulum. Saponin permeabilisation of microsomal membranes in physico-chemical conditions believed to conserve casein interactions demonstrated that rat immature β-casein is weakly aggregated in the endoplasmic reticulum.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Caseins, {{the main}} milk proteins, {{aggregate}} in the secretory pathway of mammary epithelial cells into large supramolecular structures, casein micelles. The role of individual caseins {{in this process}} and the mesostructure of the casein micelle are poorly known. RESULTS: In this study, we investigate primary steps of casein micelle formation in rough endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles prepared from rat or goat mammary tissues. The majority of both alphaS 1 - and beta-casein which are cysteine-containing casein was dimeric in the endoplasmic reticulum. Saponin permeabilisation of microsomal membranes in physico-chemical conditions believed to conserve casein interactions demonstrated that rat immature beta-casein is weakly aggregated in the endoplasmic reticulum. In striking contrast, {{a large proportion of}} immature alphaS 1 -casein was recovered in permeabilised microsomes when incubated in conservative conditions.

40|$|International audienceS-carboxymethylated (SCM) κ-casein {{forms in}} vitro fibrils that display several {{characteristics}} of amyloid fibrils, although the protein is unrelated to amyloid diseases. In {{order to get}} insight into the processes that prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils made of κ-caseins in milk, we have characterized in detail the reaction and the roles of its possible effectors: glycosylation and <b>other</b> <b>caseins.</b> Given that native κ-casein occurs as a heterogeneous mixture of carbohydrate-free and carbohydrate-containing chains, kinetics of fibril formation were performed on purified glycosylated and unglycosylated SCM κ-caseins using the fluorescent dye thioflavin T in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for morphological and structural analyses. Both unglycosylated and glycosylated SCM κ-caseins {{have the ability to}} fibrillate. Kinetic data indicate that the fibril formation rate increases with SCM κ-casein concentration but reaches a plateau at high concentrations, for both the unglycosylated and glycosylated forms. Therefore, a conformational rearrangement is the rate-limiting step in fibril growth of SCM κ-casein. Transmission electron microscopy images indicate the presence of 10 - to 12 -nm spherical particles prior to the appearance of amyloid structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra reveal a conformational change within these micellar aggregates during the fibrillation. Fibrils are helical ribbons with a pitch of about 120 – 130 nm and a width of 10 – 12 nm. Taken together, these findings suggest a model of aggregation during which the SCM κ-casein monomer is in rapid equilibrium with a micellar aggregate that subsequently undergoes a conformational rearrangement into a more organized species. These micelles assemble and this leads to the growing of amyloid fibrils. Addition of αs 1 -and β-caseins decreases the growth rate of fibrils. Their main effect was on the elongation rate, which became close to that of the limiting conformation change, leading to the appearance of a lag phase {{at the beginning of the}} kinetics...|$|R
40|$|A casein kinase II-type {{protein kinase}} has been {{purified}} from the cytosolic fraction of etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L.) plumules to about 90 % purity as judged from Coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. This kinase has a tetrameric [alpha][alpha]'[beta] 2 structure with a native molecular mass of 150 kD, and subunit molecular masses of 41 and 40 kD {{for the two}} catalytic subunits ([alpha] and [alpha]') and 35 kD for the putative regulatory subunit ([beta]). Casein and phosvitin {{can be used as}} artificial substrates for this kinase. Both serine and threonine residues were phosphorylated when mixed casein, [beta]-casein, or phosvitin were used as the substrate, whereas only serine was phosphorylated if [alpha]-casein or histone III-S was the substrate. The kinase activity was stimulated 130 % by 0. 5 mM spermine (the concentration required for 50 % of maximal enzyme activity [A 50] = 0. 1 mM) and 80 % by 2. 5 mM spermidine (A 50 = 0. 4 mM), whereas putrescine and cadaverine had no effect. The kinase was very sensitive to inhibition by heparin (concentration for 50 % inhibition [I 50] = 0. 025 [mu]g/mL). In contrast to most <b>other</b> <b>casein</b> kinase II-type protein kinases, this preparation was inhibited by K+ and Na+, with I 50 values of 75 and 65 mM, respectively. Pretreatment of the purified kinase preparation in vitro with alkaline phosphatase caused a 5 -fold decrease in its activity. Additionally, this kinase also lost its activity when its [beta] subunit was autophosphorylated in the absence of substrate. These results suggest that the activity of this casein kinase II protein kinase may be regulated by the phosphorylation state of two different sites in its multimeric structure...|$|E

Its effects on the growth and activity of starter cultures used in Cheddar cheese manufacturing were also tested. The presence of bacteria protease (T 25) exerted indirect influence on the growth of starter cultures. The addition of the protease to milk used for Cheddar cheese manufacturing caused differences in the growth patterns of bacteria during {{the first month of}} ripening. There was a trend in the lowering of percent total fat, protein, nitrogen, moisture content and yield (dry weight) of the cheese to which bacteria protease was added. The pH changes observed in the control cheese sample during aging were slightly higher than the sample containing the bacterial protease. A gradual degradation of αS₁-casein fraction was observed in the protease treated cheese during aging. Also, T 25 protease gives better activity with α-casein as a substrate compared to <b>other</b> <b>casein</b> fractions. Addition of this bacterial protease (5 mg/L, 9. 45 mg/L, 10 mg/L and 20 mg/L) to pasteurized milk prior to the addition of renneting agent (porcine pepsin) in the manufacture of Cheddar cheese by the conventional method, results in a product which is able to achieve higher intensity of cheddaring flavour (P< 0. 05) and higher preference score (P< 0. 01) within 6 months of aging when compared to that of the control cheese not containing the bacterial protease. No off-flavour or bitterness was detected in the protease treated cheese throughout the ripening period. The texture of the cheeses remained fine during aging.

40|$|Cow 2 ̆ 7 s milk is principally {{made up of}} lactose, fat {{and protein}} {{together}} with minerals and vitamins. However, the prima compositional factor determining the processing quality of milk for the manufacture of cheese is the protein content. Milk with a high protein concentration, particularly casein content, gives a high yield of cheese, has good processability and produces good quality cheese. The higher the ratio of casein to whey proteins the more suitable is the milk for cheddar cheese. Fat content is also important but {{should be in the}} appropriate ratio to casein; the casein:fat ratio is generally between 0. 64 and 0. 72. The protein level in milk and its suitability for cheddar cheesemaking are affected by production factors such as stage of lactation, feed quality, herd health and environmental conditions. High-quality feed is the most important determinant of high protein milk. However, mastitis and environmental factors such as heat stress have negative effects. The effect of season appears to be small after the quality and availability of feed and climatic effects are taken into account. There is conflicting evidence {{of the relationship between the}} content of individual caseins and the suitability of milk for cheddar cheesemaking. However, evidence seems to be reasonably strong for a positive effect of κ-casein on micellar casein stability and superior cheesemaking properties. There is also a strong evidence for the effects of some genetic variants of milk proteins on cheddar cheesemaking. Milks containing the variants β-lactoglobulin BB and κ-casein BB, alone or in combination, have been shown to be superior to milks containing the corresponding AA or AB variants. The reason for this is not clear, but it is thought to be related to the differences in protein structure, increased ratio of κ-casein to <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> and increased casein:whey protein ratio in these milks. Both positive and negative correlations between the contents of various minerals and salts, and the processability of milk for cheddar cheesemaking have also been reported. However, the only one which stands out is ionic or free calcium; milks with high Ca have better cheesemaking properties than milks with low Ca concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} polymorphism {{recorded at}} the CSN 1 S 1 locus {{was shown to}} influence goat milk composition and its technological properties. A deficit in alphaS 1 -casein {{is responsible for the}} accumulation of immature caseins in distended rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae of mammary epithelial cells (MEC). This triggers a chronic ER stress which in turn induces an adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR). Our data strongly suggest that alphaS 1 -casein interacts with the <b>other</b> <b>caseins</b> as from the ER and that this complex is required for their transport to the Golgi. A differential proteomic analysis (2 D-DIGE) of milks from goats of extreme genotypes (A/A vs. O/O) at the CSN 1 S 1 locus revealed the over representation of ER-resident proteins in O/O milks, strongly suggesting a singular secretion mechanism for this genotype. In addition, goats of A/A genotype produce fat globules larger in size and displaying significant differences in MFGM composition, including both MFGM proteins and polar lipids. The effects of the genotype at the CSN 1 S 1 locus on the profiles of oligosaccharides (OS), which are also built within the ER where both lipids and caseins are synthesized, have been investigated. The milk free OS were profiled and their structures elucidated. A relationship between genotypes at the CSN 1 S 1 locus and milk OS expression was observed, demonstrating the influence of genotypes on OS structure and composition. Finally, using different functional genomic approaches, we succeeded in highlighting the general dysfunction occurring in MEC from alphaS 1 -casein deficient animals, and in identifying genes contributing to the adaptive UPR and proteins involved in the transport between the ER and the Golgi apparatus, as well as enzymes participating to the biosynthesis of lipid droplets, the precursors of MFGs. Taken together our results demonstrate that a close mechanistic relationship exists between biosynthesis and secretion pathways of the main components of milk: casein micelles, milk fat globules and oligosaccharides. We definitely demonstrated the relevance of the goat model as an experimental system to unravel the underlying mechanisms and to appraise the possibility to dissociate these biosynthesis pathways in order to modulate selectively one or the other.
