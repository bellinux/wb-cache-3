5|$|However, the {{aggressive}} tactics of Haywood and the IWW, {{along with their}} call for abolition of the wage system and the overthrow of capitalism created tension with moderate electorally-oriented leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Socialist</b> Party. Haywood and the IWW focused on direct action and strikes, which often led to violence, and were less concerned with political tactics. When Haywood was quoted speaking at public meetings in New York City {{to the effect that}} he had never advocated the use of the ballot by the workers but had instead favored the tactics of direct action, an initiative recalling Haywood from the NEC was launched by the State Executive Committee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Socialist</b> Party of New York. In February 1913 the recall of Haywood was approved by a margin of more than 2-to-1. Following his defeat, Haywood left the ranks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Socialist</b> Party, joined by thousands of other IWW members and their sympathizers.|$|E

5|$|After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several {{attempts}} were made to revive the organisation, culminating in the formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Socialist</b> International (Second International) in 1889. This, in turn, was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over World War I. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the Labour and Socialist International, supporters of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks had already set up the Communist International (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International. This was organised on a democratic centralist basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.|$|E

The congress also saw the WPK and North Korea move away from orthodox communism by emphasizing the Juche idea over Marxism–Leninism, giving the party a nationalistic bent. The next party congress was not convened before 2016, despite party rules that stipulated that a congress had to be held every fifth year.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the {{government}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Socialist</b> Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate {{political parties in}} response to growing demands to allow political activities outside the Communist party.

In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.|$|E
