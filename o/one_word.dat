In contrast, his follow-up <b>One</b> <b>Word</b> Extinguisher was about his relationship with a woman and the vast spectrum of emotions felt during a break-up.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand <b>one</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form <b>one</b> <b>word</b> class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E
40|$|This {{review of}} the book Perform or… From Discipline to Performance (Krakow 2011) is a {{thorough}} meta-linguistic analysis. Maciąg deciphers the linguistic mechanisms McKenzie uses. The keys to the American researcher’s theories are the terms performance and challenger, {{and the concept of}} the "lecturing machine". McKenzie does not, however, formulate precise definitions, he only "illustrates the performative aspect of speaking through one’s own special, iterative speech about oneself (about <b>one’s</b> <b>words</b> and in <b>one’s</b> <b>words)</b> "...|$|R

5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said <b>one</b> <b>word</b> about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|The Act of December 11 was {{the second}} stage in the {{progression}} towards the final Act of Independence. The first draft, demanded by chancellor Georg von Hertling, was prepared by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 1. Further changes were jointly prepared by the German chancellery and by a delegation of the Council of Lithuania. The delegation's members were Antanas Smetona, Steponas Kairys, Vladas Mironas, Jurgis Šaulys, Petras Klimas and Aleksandras Stulginskis. After discussion amongst the parties, a compromise was reached on the document's text. The German representative, Kurt von Lersner, insisted that not <b>one</b> <b>word</b> be changed in the agreed-upon text and that all the Council members sign the document.|$|E
5|$|The French {{astronomer}} Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille {{first described}} the constellation in French as la Machine Pneumatique (the Pneumatic Machine) in 1751–52, commemorating the air pump invented by the French physicist Denis Papin. De Lacaille had observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southern stars during a two-year {{stay at the}} Cape of Good Hope, devising fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. He named all but one in honour of instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Lacaille depicted Antlia as a single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, while German astronomer Johann Bode chose the more advanced double-cylinder version. Lacaille Latinised the name to Antlia pneumatica on his 1763 chart. English astronomer John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to <b>one</b> <b>word</b> in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated his constellations thus on occasion. This was universally adopted. The International Astronomical Union adopted {{it as one of}} the 88 modern constellations in 1922.|$|E

5000|$|Madden {{points out}} that a {{cornerstone}} of their new paradigm of performance is its emphasis on integrity (keeping or when not keeping, then honoring they define honoring <b>one's</b> <b>word).</b> Erhard, Jensen, et al. write, “Integrity is important to individuals, groups, organizations and society because it creates workability. Without integrity, the workability of any object, system, person, group or organization declines; and as workability declines, the opportunity for performance declines. Therefore integrity is {{a necessary condition for}} maximum performance. As an added benefit, honoring <b>one's</b> <b>word</b> is also an actionable pathway to being trusted by others.” ...|$|R

25|$|Compound {{words are}} {{typically}} spelt as <b>one</b> <b>word</b> (without spaces) and phrases are normally spelt {{as more than}} <b>one</b> <b>word</b> (with one or more spaces), {{but this is not}} always the case. Hyphenated spelling is considered an alternative to writing as <b>one</b> <b>word</b> and is used, e.g., if a compound contains a proper name.|$|E
25|$|Problematic point(s):, linguistically speaking, {{these do}} not {{constitute}} an actual compound (because the meaning is not institutionalized), {{so there is no}} sound reason for writing them in <b>one</b> <b>word.</b> In addition, the normal alternative for writing in <b>one</b> <b>word</b> is writing with hyphens, rather than writing separately, so this opposition is unusual in Hungarian orthography.|$|E

25|$|Problematic point(s): certain region {{names have}} become <b>one</b> <b>word,</b> {{dropping}} the hyphen, such as Dunakanyar, {{and there are}} approx. 60 such forms. Quarters {{also need to be}} written as <b>one</b> <b>word,</b> even if they contain a proper name (e.g. Wekerletelep, lit. “Wekerle’s settlement”), and even if they exceed the 6 syllables (e.g. Szépkenyerűszentmárton, 7 syllables and 4 elements, despite the above-mentioned syllable-counting rule).|$|E

25|$|Problematic point(s): {{there are}} more than fifty phrases written in <b>one</b> <b>word</b> only after one single derivational suffix (e.g. partra száll ’disembark’ but partraszállás ’disembarkation’).|$|E
