40|$|Abstract: Outbreaks of diarrhoea, {{haemolytic}} uraemic {{syndrome and}} food poisoning {{have been associated}} with the consumption of (apple and orange ciders) <b>and</b> (apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices).</b> The organisms implicated in these outbreaks have been Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and Salmonella typhi (a group D serotype), indicating the resistance of the serotypes of these organisms to acidic pH. The acid tolerance, the growth, and the survival of these organisms were investigated in both natural (unpasteurized, untreated) and pasteurized, treated apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders. The effects of benzoic acid, as a preservative, on the growth of the mentioned bacteria subjected to examination, in trypticase soy broth <b>and</b> apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders were also examined. It was evident that E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) organisms grew well in trypticase soy broth at pH level ranging from 3. 0 to 9. 0. The growth of both mentioned serotypes were inhibited by adding 0. 05 % of benzoic acid. Similarly, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. typhi strains grew well in both natural (unpasteurized) as well as in pasteurized apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders, and the growth was inhibited by adding 0. 1 % of benzoic acid. The possible sources of contamination of natural apple <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> ciders with E. coli O 157 :H 7 serotype and S. typhi (a group D serotype) are discussed. The study declared the efficacy of acids, their salts and derivatives in controlling microbial growth in food in general.

As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she never meant to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E

25|$|After using toothpaste, <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> other juices have an {{unpleasant}} taste. Sodium lauryl sulfate alters taste perception.

40|$|Objective: To {{characterize}} physically <b>and</b> chemically, non-sweetened <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> <b>orange</b> nectars sweetened with sucrose or sweet flavoring agents, {{with respect}} to their pH, titratable acidity (TA) and total soluble solids content (TSSC), as well as to evaluate the correlation of the latter property with the others. Method: Aliquots of three lots of two <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> two <b>orange</b> nectars containing sucrose and two containing sweet flavoring agents were evaluated. Mineral water was used as a control. The TSSC was determined using an Abbe refractometer. The pH was recorded using a digital pH meter, while TA was quantified by titrating samples of the beverages with 0. 1 M NaOH until reaching pHs 5. 5 and 7. 0. Data were subjected to Pearson's correlation test, regression analysis, analysis of variance and Tukey's test (α= 0. 05). Results: TSSC values presented a strong correlation with TA, and these properties exhibited a quadratic relationship. Although the pH values were not dependent on the presence of sucrose or sweet flavoring agents, a significantly greater amount of base was necessary to reach pHs 5. 5 and 7. 0 in the beverages without sucrose or flavoring agents. Conclusion: <b>Orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> nectars presented similar pH values, which was not associated with the presence of sucrose or sweet flavoring agents in the beverages. Higher TA values were obtained for the <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> lower for the nectars, regardless of containing sucrose or sweet flavoring agents. The increase of TSSC did not implicate in decrease of TA in the beverages...|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial peptide ligand library technology, {{coupled to}} mass spectrometry, {{has been applied}} to {{extensively}} map the proteome of orange pulp and peel and, via this fingerprinting, to detect its presence in commercial <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> drinks. The native and denaturing extraction protocols have captured 1109 orange proteins, as identified by LC-MS/MS. This proteomic map has been searched in an orange concentrate, from a Spanish juice manufacturer, as well as in commercial <b>orange</b> <b>juices</b> <b>and</b> soft drinks. The presence of numerous orange proteins in commercial juices has demonstrated the genuineness of these products, prepared by using orange fruits as original ingredients. However, the low number of identified proteins in sparkling beverages has suggested that they were prepared with scarce amounts of fruit extract, thus imparting lower quality to the final products. These findings not only increase the knowledge of the orange proteome but also present a reliable analytical method to assess quality and genuineness of commercial products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the White House. His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of <b>orange</b> <b>juice</b> <b>and</b> whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E
