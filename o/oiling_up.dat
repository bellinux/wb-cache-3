[...] "Ain't no ust to talk," [...] he went on. [...] "It's like damming a stream--you dam it about half tight an' the fust lively rain will break the dam to bits; but you dam it good an' hard an' it will stick, {{no matter how hard}} it rains and by-an'-by the water will find out it's got to go a new way--an' the French an' Injuns will find they've got to leave the English alone. I ain't much on eddication, but I kin figger thet out, an' so kin any man whose head is level;" [...] and Barringford resumed his gun oiling.|$|E

50|$|Most radial engines {{have the}} {{cylinders}} arranged evenly around the crankshaft, although some early engines, sometimes called semi-radials or fan configuration engines, had an uneven arrangement. The best known engine {{of this type}} is the Anzani engine, which was fitted to the Bleriot XI used for the first flight across the English Channel in 1909. This arrangement had the drawback of needing a heavy counterbalance for the crankshaft, but was used to avoid the spark plugs <b>oiling</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave [...] "The Booze Cruise" [...] {{four stars}} out of five, writing that [...] "clever lyrics and a melody that grabs your {{attention}} like that hottie <b>oiling</b> <b>up</b> with sunblock make this an easy song to finish before you realize you’ve begun." [...] The song {{was written by}} Noll Billings, Jeff Coplan and Chuck Jones on August 24, 2011. A writing session was set for that very hot summer day in Nashville, when Billings said that a fun way to spend that day would be {{to get on a}} booze cruise. The song was written in 45 minutes.|$|E
50|$|By 1918 a Clerget {{handbook}} advised maintaining {{all necessary}} control {{by using the}} fuel and air controls, and starting and stopping the engine by turning the fuel on and off. The recommended landing procedure involved shutting off the fuel using the fuel lever, while leaving the blip switch on. The windmilling propeller made the engine continue to spin without delivering any power as the aircraft descended. It was important to leave the ignition on to allow the spark plugs to continue to spark and keep them from <b>oiling</b> <b>up,</b> so that the engine could (if all went well) be restarted simply by re-opening the fuel valve. Pilots were advised to not use an ignition cut out switch, as it would eventually damage the engine.|$|E

50|$|Throttling {{a running}} engine back to reduce revs was {{possible}} by closing off the fuel valve to the required position while re-adjusting the fuel/air mixture to suit. This process was also tricky, so that throttling back, especially when landing, was often accomplished by intermittently cutting the ignition using the blip switch. Cutting cylinders using ignition switches had the drawback of letting fuel continue {{to pass through}} the engine, <b>oiling</b> <b>up</b> the spark plugs and making smooth restarting problematic. Also, the raw oil-fuel mix could collect in the cowling. As this could cause a serious fire when the switch was released, it became common practice for part or all of the bottom of the basically circular cowling on most rotary engines to be cut away, or fitted with drainage slots.|$|E
5000|$|The Seagull {{outboard}} motor had a simple single cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine. Atop {{the engine was}} a magneto, and on its port side was a simple carburetter with no air filter. Even a rudimentary rubber [...] "storm cowl" [...] was an optional extra, and induction noise when running was pronounced. Above the cylinder head was bolted a small brass fuel tank whose 10:1 fuel/oil mix was gravity-fed to the carb via a clear plastic tube that served to capture dirt particles in its U-bend. A simple plastic filter filter on the banjo union to the carb gave rudimentary secondary filtering, {{but it was still}} not unusual for the carb jets to become blocked. Starting was effected with a hand-wound pull-rope, although a recoil starter became an option in due course. Connecting the motor to the gearbox and propeller werere two downtubes, the forward one containing the drive shaft and the aft tube serving as the exhaust, which vented underwater. This arrangement meant that the engine could not be rotated 360 degrees as can more modern engines. The Seagull handbook advises that the engine can be safely run at full throttle (partly to prevent the spark-plug from <b>oiling</b> <b>up)</b> but adds that is wasteful to try to exceed the maximum design speed of a displacement hull, suggesting a [...] "one-third open throttle" [...] usually suffices. The engines proved very rugged as they used high quality materials, and would last for years even in harsh marine environments and in developing countries. Seagull outboards were utilitarian in nature with a relatively slow-turning prop, and so were ideal for use in dinghies, tenders and small yachts. The Silver Century Plus model could propel a displacement hull of up to 26 feet in length; but all Seagull outboards were unsuitable for high speed craft.|$|E
