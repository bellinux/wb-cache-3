5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—"One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E
25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Dylan became disillusioned {{about using}} the Hawks in the studio. He {{recorded}} more material at Studio A on January 25, backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Rick Danko (or Bill Lee), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin, and organist Al Kooper. Two more new compositions were attempted: [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" [...] and [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)". Dylan was satisfied with [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know"; the January 25 take was released as a single {{a few weeks later}} and was subsequently selected for the album.|$|E
6000|$|... "These {{are times}} when stern truths must be spoken," [...] said Henri. [...] "The lives <b>of</b> <b>us</b> all <b>must</b> now be in {{constant}} jeopardy--that is, <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>must</b> go out to battle." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ick seg adieu, wij twee wij moeten scheiden (I say farewell, both <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> we <b>must</b> part) ...|$|R
60|$|Fail. O, {{one thing}} I had almost {{forgot to tell}} you; one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> two <b>must</b> ever be near Sir Timorous.|$|R
500|$|... "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know" [...] is a {{straightforward}} {{account of a}} burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: [...] "I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You don't {{have to take it}} so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all." [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know" [...] was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.|$|E
500|$|The New York {{sessions}} comprise: two takes of [...] "Medicine Sunday", one take of [...] "Jet Pilot", twelve takes of [...] "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?", seven takes of [...] "I Wanna Be Your Lover", fourteen takes of [...] "Visions of Johanna", sixteen takes of [...] "She's Your Lover Now", four takes of [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat", twenty-four takes of [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)", one take of [...] "I'll Keep It with Mine", and one take of [...] "Lunatic Princess".|$|E
500|$|Another session {{took place}} on January 27, this time with Robertson, Danko, Kooper and Gregg. Dylan and his band {{recorded}} [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat" [...] and [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)" [...] again, but Dylan was {{not satisfied with the}} recorded performance of either song. Also at this session Dylan attempted a rough performance of [...] "I'll Keep It with Mine", a song which he had already recorded twice as a demo. The musicians added some tentative backing in a rendering biographer Clinton Heylin described as [...] "cursory". The recording was ultimately released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 in 1991.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} Hetty will ever marry, Deerslayer," [...] she said, [...] "and if your name is to be borne by either <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> it <b>must</b> be borne by me." ...|$|R
500|$|Although The Basement Tapes {{reached the}} public in an unorthodox manner, officially {{released}} eight years after the songs were recorded, critics have assigned them an important place in Dylan's development. Michael Gray writes, [...] "The core Dylan songs from these sessions actually do form a clear link between ... two utterly different albums. They evince the same highly serious, precarious quest for a personal and universal salvation which marked out the John Wesley Harding collection—yet they are soaked in the same blocked confusion and turmoil as Blonde on Blonde. 'Tears of Rage', for example, is an exact halfway house between, say, 'One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)' and 'I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine'".|$|E
500|$|Polizzotti, in {{his study}} of Highway 61 Revisited, writes that the opening track of Side Two, [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] is in a similar vein to [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", but the song offers [...] "a touch of sympathy and even comfort in place of {{relentless}} mockery". The song is structured as a series of ABAB quatrain verses, with each verse followed by a chorus that is simply a repeat of the last line of each verse: [...] "Won't you come see me Queen Jane?". Gill calls this song [...] "the least interesting track" [...] on Highway 61, but praises the piano ascending the scale during the harmonica break as an evocation of [...] "the stifling nature of an upper class existence". Others have speculated that the song is directed at Joan Baez and the folk movement, which Dylan had largely left behind. [...] "Queen Jane Approximately" [...] was released as the B-side of Dylan's [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)" [...] single in early 1966.|$|E
500|$|The {{final year}} of the war—1918—started with {{disaster}} and ended in triumph. On 21 March 1918, General Erich Ludendorff, Chief of the German General Staff, launched the Spring Offensive, which was intended to defeat the Allies on the Western Front before {{the strength of the}} American Expeditionary Force (AEF) could become overwhelming. The main weight of the first blow—Operation Michael—fell on General Gough' s Fifth Army which was forced to retreat. In response to the crisis facing the Allies, French Generalissimo Ferdinand Foch was made Supreme Commander of the Allied forces on the Western Front, placing the BEF under his strategic direction. The next German attack came south of Ypres in the Battle of the Lys river and here too the BEF fell back. Field Marshal Haig issued his famous Order of the Day, [...] "With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause, each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> fight on to the end." [...] A third major German offensive, falling mainly on the French, was finally halted on the Marne in June. On 8 August, General Rawlinson's Fourth Army launched the Battle of Amiens which marked the start of the Hundred Days Offensive, the final Allied offensive on the Western Front. Over the following weeks, all five armies of the BEF went on the offensive from the Somme to Flanders. Fighting continued right up until the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11:00 am on 11 November 1918.|$|E
5000|$|Their cause must be {{our cause}} too. Because {{it is not}} just Negroes, but really it is all <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> who <b>must</b> {{overcome}} the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.|$|R
6000|$|... "One <b>of</b> <b>us</b> two <b>must</b> have {{a strong}} {{presumption}} against him of being one, whether or no. Either the clean and decorously clad man, or the dirty and indecorously clad man. I don't say which." ...|$|R
60|$|So, {{like the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> Smith <b>must</b> wait to learn the truth {{concerning}} many things, and more particularly as to which of those two circles of ancient gold the Director-General gave him yonder at Cairo.|$|R
500|$|Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day {{gave the}} film 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "a deeply moving experience", and writing for Kapoor deemed it as [...] "her best {{performance}} till date". Meena Iyer of The Times of India gave Neerja 4 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Neerja raises {{a toast to}} the daunting spirit of India's daughters; every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> salute Neerja." [...] Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "As a movie watching experience, Neerja is flawless. [...] There's not a single false note." [...] Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra awarded 4 out of 5 stars, saying that [...] "Neerja is a truly inspiring story that will grip you from the first frame till the last." [...] Sarita Tanwar from Daily News and Analysis gave 4 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "Neerja is quite easily the finest film in recent times (on par with Talvar) {{based on a true}} story." [...] Raja Sen from Rediff.com gave 4 out of 5 stars as well and called it [...] "an absolute must-watch," [...] adding that [...] "Sonam Kapoor is exceptional as Neerja Bhanot." [...] Suahni Singh of India Today rated the film as a 3.5 stars and stated, [...] "Sonam Kapoor delivered her career-best performance as she assuredly plays an abused wife, a beloved daughter and a flight attendant caught in her worst nightmare." ...|$|E
2500|$|During WW I, the {{expression}} to fight [...] "with one's {{back to the}} wall" [...] became a widely-known way to refer to making a last stand. The London Times reported on April 13, 1918 that General Douglas Haig ordered British troops that [...] "Every position must be held to the last man...With our backs to the wall...each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> fight on to the end".|$|E
2500|$|During {{and between}} tours, Dylan and the Hawks {{attempted}} several recording sessions, but {{with less than}} satisfying results. Sessions in October and November yielded just one usable single ("Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window"), and two days of recording in January 1966 for what {{was intended to be}} Dylan's next album, Blonde on Blonde, resulted in [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)", which was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album. On [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know", Dylan was backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Danko (or Bill Lee), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin, and Al Kooper (who was more a guitarist than an organist) playing organ. Frustrated by the slow progress in the New York studio, Dylan accepted the suggestion of producer Bob Johnston and moved the recording sessions to Nashville. In Nashville, Robertson's guitar was prominent on the Blonde on Blonde recordings, especially [...] "Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat", but {{the other members of the}} Hawks did not attend the sessions.|$|E
60|$|FATHER DEMPSEY [with gentle irony]. Oh! is it Jews {{you want}} to make <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> I <b>must</b> catechize you a bit meself, I think. The next thing you'll be proposing is to repeal the disestablishment of the {{so-called}} Irish Church.|$|R

6000|$|... "Bernard, it {{is nearly}} eleven o'clock," [...] she cried. [...] "We must go into the drawing-room at once. What will aunt think <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> You <b>must</b> come with me, of course; but you'd better say good night now. There, that will do, sir!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Greg Puciato {{indicated}} that he chose the album title [...] "pretty much as soon as I finished writing [...] song" [...] of the same name. He explained that the meaning behind the title involves [...] "a lot of issues on the album relate to co-dependency and unknowingly destroying a relationship and taking responsibility for that and not pointing outward. The chorus of the song says 'one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> die, but the killer won’t survive.' In a relationship, you're both fifty percent at fault. It's about accepting responsibility instead of directing it outward." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 Drake {{was awarded}} the Ridenhour Prize for Truth Telling and was co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award. Accepting the SAAII award he said, with {{references}} to an 1857 speech of Frederick Douglass: [...] "Power and those in control concede nothing ... without a demand. They never have and they never will. ...each and every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> keep demanding, must keep fighting, must keep thundering, must keep plowing, must keep on keeping things struggling, must speak out and must speak up until justice is served because {{where there is no}} justice there can be no peace." ...|$|E
60|$|And I {{pray that}} God may rest {{the souls of}} those two as I pray He may rest the souls <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>must</b> some time go the way that those two {{and so many others}} have {{travelled}} before us. Amen.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't {{be of any}} use," [...] {{cried the}} young girl gaily. [...] "We're all wrapped up, and you couldn't form any idea <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> You <b>must</b> wait, and let us burst upon you when we {{come out of the}} dressing-room at Madame Uccelli's." ...|$|R

2500|$|In Germany militant Darwinismus {{elevated}} Darwin to heroic status. When {{the eminent}} Freethinker Doctor Ludwig Büchner requested an audience {{he thought he}} was greeting a noble ally. To Darwin this was a grotesque misunderstanding, but he felt unable to refuse. Darwin's wife Emma Darwin expressed her expectation that their guest [...] "will refrain from airing his very strong religious opinions" [...] and invited their old friend the Revd. John Brodie Innes. On Thursday 28 September 1881 Büchner arrived with Edward Aveling. Darwin's son Frank was also present. Darwin wittily explained that [...] " [...] & I have been fast friends for 30 years. We never thoroughly agreed on any subject but once and then {{we looked at each other}} and thought one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> be very ill".|$|E
2500|$|An {{incident}} {{involving a}} drunken student on October 4 {{gave rise to}} more racial tensions. While an African-American student group, the Legion of Black Collegians, was preparing for Homecoming activities, a white student walked on stage and was asked to leave. Supposedly, while departing the premises the student said, [...] "These niggers are getting aggressive with me", according to the LBC. This prompted chancellor Loftin, traveling outside the US, to record a video message in response and to release a statement that said, [...] "Racism and all prejudice is heinous, insidious and damaging to Mizzou... That is why all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>must</b> commit to changing the culture at this university." [...] Later that month, the student group [...] "Concerned Student 1950" [...] was created, referring to the first year the University of Missouri admitted black students.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1965, Gregg {{joined the}} Hawks, who were then backing Dylan on tour, when Hawks' drummer Levon Helm left. He {{remained}} with the Hawks {{for about a}} month before being replaced by Sandy Konikoff. He recorded with Dylan in the November 30 sessions at which an early version of [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] and possibly the single release of [...] "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?" [...] were recorded. He also recorded with Dylan at the January 1966 Blonde on Blonde sessions at which [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Must</b> Know (Sooner or Later)" [...] was recorded, as well as several other songs which either did not make the album or were rerecorded later for the album, including [...] "I'll Keep It With Mine", which was eventually released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991.|$|E
