Bain himself would later say of the thirty-year-old Romney, [...] "He had the appearance [...] of confidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> was maybe ten years older." [...] Unlike other consulting firms, which issued recommendations and then departed, Bain & Company [...] immersed itself in a clients' businesses and worked with them until changes were implemented. Romney became a vice-president of the firm in 1978, working with such clients as the Monsanto Company, Outboard Marine Corporation, Burlington Industries, and Corning Incorporated. Within a few years, the firm considered him one of its best consultants. In fact, clients sometimes preferred to use him rather than more-senior partners.|$|E

2500|$|When Kiefer Sutherland {{took the}} project, {{he did not}} {{understand}} that the series was set in real-time, having skipped the line that said, [...] "All events take place in real time." [...] Kiefer said it was, in fact, the interaction between the characters that prompted him to take the pilot. Sutherland was sent the script by director Stephen Hopkins, with whom he had a previous relationship. Sutherland was attracted to the shades of grey in the Jack Bauer character, as well as his status as a [...] "normal guy", citing Jack's inability to handle his own teenage daughter. The Tony Almeida character was originally called [...] "Geller" [...] in the original Pilot script, who Bernard called a [...] "backbiting Jewish techie guy". Bernard didn't understand why they had sent him the script, given his Hispanic ethnicity. Carlos and the crew came up with the Tony Almeida name fifteen minutes before shooting, but the legal department wouldn't let them use it. Legal told the crew that they could use the name 'Tonio', which Carlos found underwhelming. Bernard said, [...] "So we were filming the very first scene, Kiefer walking down CTU, and he turns to me and says, 'Sorry man, I can't call you Tonio, I'm just gonna call you Tony.' I owe Kiefer everything: Tonio's the name <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> gets killed in the first episode." ...|$|E

Considine {{wrote in}} the Baltimore Sun that [...] "Rivers' idea of `funny' {{generally}} seems the work <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> read too many issues of Mad magazine, {{but there are some}} good bits here." [...] Helen Bryant of The Dallas Morning News wrote [...] "Irving Berlin, it's not" [...] while the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the album [...] "this year's hip offering." ...|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic editor William Ruhlmann later {{highlighted}} the song. Also, Donald A. Guarisco retrospectively praised the lyrics: [...] "The tongue-in-cheek lyrics {{tell the tale}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who’s</b> realized he cant 'live by rock ‘n’ roll and brew alone' and sets his sights on his ideal woman (...) The lyric devotes equal time to his vampy object of affection". He added that, [...] "This unique blend of vocal and instrumental firepower makes 'Dead Ringer For Love' feel like a long-lost outtake from the Grease soundtrack on steroids." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to TVGuide.com, Cole {{originally}} {{balked at}} the part of Peter Cochran when he realized he would be playing an undercover cop, saying, [...] "I'm {{not going to take}} the part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> finks on his friends!" [...] He changed his mind, however, when he read the script and gathered the show's potential appeal.|$|E
5000|$|The movie gained mostly {{negative}} reviews, Roger Ebert stated: [...] "The movie, {{which could}} have been a funny send-up of Hollywood talent requirements, gets distracted by subplots that after its promising start, My Giant isn't a comedy about an agent and a giant, so much as the heartwarming tale <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> learns to be a better family man." ...|$|E

5000|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Karandash, Nikulin and Shuydin created the clown duo [...] "Nikulin and Shuydin" [...] which lasted until Shuydin {{suffered}} a severe illness in 1983. Shuydin's clown image was that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> daring <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> knows everything, {{in contrast to}} the image of Nikulin, who was lazy and melancholic. Thus, their joint work was based on conflicting characters.|$|R
50|$|The song is woven {{around the}} word Hosanna which is {{considered}} sacred and used in liturgy by Jews and Christians. The word is a shout of adoration and literally means save now.

5000|$|Emma Fraser of The Observer spoke {{most highly}} of Ruth Negga's performance, with her writing: [...] "'... Preacher is only two episodes in, {{but it is}} clear that Tulip is a TV style icon we need ... There's {{toughness}} to her demeanor and yet her costuming has flashes of femininity mixed in with leather, jeans and boots", while fellow journalist Sean T Collins highly praised the performance from Joseph Gilgun, by stating, [...] "This dude is a fucking supernova in this role, for real. He has the rangy physicality <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who’s</b> had just enough to drink to give his every movement a tiny bit more momentum than required to get the job done — he always seems to be leaning, slouching, lunging, weaving, careening, even when sitting still." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A-' grade, and described it as [...] "the start of something new".|$|R
5000|$|According {{to former}} Islanders general manager Mike Milbury, Wang “assumed that nobody {{could put a}} goal past a sumo wrestler”. Milbury said that “He was <b>a</b> man <b>of</b> his word, <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> desperately {{wanted to keep the}} team on the Island.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Indiaglitz:"The {{brilliant}} composer in A R Rahman has woven a lovable song {{around the}} word Hosanna (considered auspicious by Christians). With rap interludes in between by Blaaze, the song sticks to hearts instantly. Anantha Sreeram's lyrics describes the {{joy in the}} heart and soul <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> comes across his beloved. A soulful romantic number, the song with Suzanne chipping in with her best is the USP of the album." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{really like}} Enjoi. The brand is {{a breath of}} fresh air. I was on the East and {{detached}} from any team member so I was kind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> rode the products, but not on the team. Especially ’cause they are a group of friends. I hung out with Marc Johnson a couple times. He was totally cool. I have always been a huge fan of his, so that was great.|$|E
5000|$|The opening track, [...] "In the Engine Room," [...] starts {{just before}} dawn and it ends 24 hours later with [...] "Shore Duty". It is {{essentially}} the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> has run away from a farm town, joined the Navy, and found a crew that has built a routine together. When their ship pulls into a port for shore leave, they get drunk, and the boilerman sleepwalks, falls in the water, and drowns.|$|E

50|$|Lastly, {{the film}} {{provided}} a holistic perspective, by highlighting the struggles {{within the black}} community as well. Even during the car chase between the detectives and thieves, there were different video takes of stereotypes of black people in the streets. For example, there was a drug addict stumbling {{in the middle of}} the road, unfriendly black hotties strutting on the sidewalk in traditional African cloth and <b>of</b> course, <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> was trying to holler at them. The car chase ends with the detectives running into <b>a</b> cart <b>of</b> watermelons.|$|R
2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, guest star Dylan McDermott spoke {{about being in}} the second season of American Horror Story, [...] "I loved doing the show. It's like being home for me. We talked about it I think early in the season. He [...] called me over the summer and {{we were trying to}} figure out what was the best plan and in what capacity. I wasn't sure myself and obviously he's the master and the genius that figures this shit out. So the day the show premiered he called me and he explained it to me because I hadn't read any of the scripts. He explained to me what my character was going to be and I was like, 'Are you fucking kidding me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, John M. Gilbertson said, [...] "On Hiatt's easy-strolling [...] "Ride On Out a Ways", Los Lobos' Tex-Mex waltz [...] "The Long Goodbye" [...] and Vince Gill and Guy Clark's cheerfully two-stepping [...] "Lookout Mountain Girl", Bromberg casually throws out riffs and licks that {{nevertheless}} stick. Even his singing, {{which is}} thinner and weaker than his other skills, expresses the charming nonchalance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> never {{has to worry}} about the company he keeps." ...|$|E
5000|$|The film's cast {{consists}} {{mostly of}} youngsters. Surinamese model and former Miss India-World Fareisa Joemmanbaks made her debut through this film. Rajesh Nair roped in Bollywood actress Tashu Kaushik for an important role. Nair had promised her a role when both met in Uganda some three years before. About his role, Nishan, who rose to fame with Ee Adutha Kalathu says: [...] "My role is <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> owns an ad agency and happy go lucky person." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tobias {{described}} the single [...] "Love Tyger" [...] as a [...] "tribute to himself". It describes the history <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> {{is brought to}} Earth by the Gods {{as a gift to}} mankind. Its guitar riff was conceived by Tobias himself and the song was thought of even before Age of the Joker, but Tobias decided not to include it in that album nor in Avantasia's The Mystery of Time, due to it being too [...] "light-hearted".|$|E

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1981 I was hearing {{occasional}} rumors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> in Lakewood <b>who</b> rode skateparks and was really hot. So I tracked him down.

5000|$|... "The Little Girl I Once Knew" [...] follows {{familiar}} territory as the Beach Boys' 1964 outtake [...] "All Dressed Up for School", {{telling the}} story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> reacquaints with a girl from his past who has now grown up and catches his eye. According to Mark Dillon, some speculate that the song was written about Brian's then-wife Marilyn Wilson. Mike Love reportedly {{had a hand in}} the lyrics. In the 1990s, his lawsuit for officially-recognized writing contributions failed to include [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew".|$|E
5000|$|Diamond {{described}} [...] "Longfellow Serenade" [...] in {{the liner}} notes to his 1996 compilation album, In My Lifetime: [...] "Occasionally I like using a particular lyrical style which, in this case, lent itself naturally to {{telling the story}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> woos his woman with poetry." [...] The title of the song is {{a reference to the}} 19th-century American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Diamond chose to reference Longfellow specifically after recalling an instance in which, while in his teens, Diamond had used one of the poet's works to successfully seduce a significantly older woman.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music on}} What the....You Mean I Can't Sing?! largely derives from funk and soul music. Van Peebles' lyrics {{encompass}} themes ranging from lighter and humorous to more socially conscious themes, {{although it is}} less politically oriented than Van Peebles' spoken word albums; the most political song on the album is [...] "Save The Watergate 500", which refers to the Watergate scandal. Domestic violence is explored on [...] "There", which Van Peebles described as [...] "a story <b>of</b> how <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> gets it on the job comes home and kicks his old lady's ass." [...] Because Van Peebles wanted {{to pay tribute to}} another singer, he recorded <b>a</b> version <b>of</b> [...] "Superstition", <b>a</b> song by Stevie Wonder, who he admired.|$|R

2500|$|In 2015, game {{designer}} Josh Millard released Ennuigi. Ennuigi adds metafictional commentary to {{the original}} game since it relates the story of Luigi's inability {{to come to terms}} with the lack <b>of</b> narrative. In <b>a</b> Reddit thread, Millard commented [...] "I [...] think it's a pretty weird implied narrative once you step back and look at it, and enjoyed funneling some thoughts about all that into <b>a</b> recharacterization <b>of</b> Luigi as <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you'd expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise." ...|$|R
