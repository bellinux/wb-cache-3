5|$|After Brian reveals Meg's {{secret to}} Peter and Lois, who don't want her seeing Luke again, he soon breaks {{out of jail}} during a prison riot and tries {{to hide in the}} Griffins' house. When Brian comes to Meg's room to {{apologize}} for what he did to her, he finds him just as Peter enters. Peter <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> is happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E
5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, and it <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E

500|$|... "Say Hello to My Little Friend" [...] {{continued}} and introduced key thematic elements {{to the series}} that were originally introduced in [...] "The Little Guy". Key themes in this installment included when Michael was unable to see Rex and realized that Hawkins {{was trying to kill}} him in the car crash. It was described as a [...] "show about grief" [...] when it first started airing and that the [...] "cause of the car crash didn't really matter" [...] at that time. Now, however, The A.V. Club noted that Awake is [...] "dabbling in crooked cops and God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> else". He observed that Michael could be having another defense to keep the fantasy world alive because of his thoughts with Hawkins.|$|E
500|$|The Association {{had turned}} to the Scott Stamp and Coin Company of New York to market the coins. [...] Scott was able to sell some of the 1928 half dollars. These actions have been {{interpreted}} negatively by numismatic scholars: Q. David Bowers alleges that Scott's representative, Wayte Raymond, proposed melting most of the issue to create an artificial scarcity, and that the company [...] "desired {{to capitalize on the}} gullibility of collectors and their need to complete sets by having more varieties coined. Scott figured that if additional Oregon Trail half dollars could be minted with the date 1933 they could be sold effectively at the Century of Progress Exposition held that year in Chicago." [...] Swiatek and Breen noted, [...] "through God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> manner of political manipulation, the Oregon Trail Memorial Association managed to obtain approval of a new 1933 Denver issue" [...] for sale at the exposition.|$|E
2500|$|During the Patriots bye week, Belichick {{stated that}} Moss [...] "is the smartest {{receiver}} he's ever been around." [...] He compared Moss' {{ability to see}} the field and anticipate plays to that of Tom Brady, and to Lawrence Taylor who Belichick coached with the New York Giants. He said Moss not <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> he's doing on a play, but what everybody else on the field is doing as well. [...] "That's what makes them special. They just have a sixth, seventh sense", Belichick said.|$|E

2500|$|There is an advantage, however, in {{learning}} things for oneself. Cobbett, discovering the world anew, understands it better in its small details, and is {{better equipped to}} persuade others. Cobbett's observations are always fresh. [...] "Whatever he finds out, is his own, and he <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> he finds out. He is in the constant hurry and fever of gestation: his brain teems incessantly with some fresh project." [...] If he is an egotist, his focusing on his own life is justified because he finds well-observed details in that life's events {{to provide the best}} illustrations of his thoughts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} {{is known for}} its harmonic sophistication and extensive use of inverted chords, including third inversions such as B7/A. The first chord of the verse (D major/A) is a non-diatonic chord. The tonic chord (E major) usually only appears with the major 3rd or the 5th in the bass. The entire verse progression sounds restless and ambiguous, until the line [...] "God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> I'd be without you" [...] when the chord progression finally reaches a clear goal (A–E/G#–F#m7–E). This has been cited by musicologists as {{a good example of how}} lyrical meaning can be supported and enhanced by a chord progression—along with the melody hook which also provides an example of [...] "a sense of increasing melodic energy that comes by way of the gradually ascending line". Stephen Downes similarly named the song's [...] "tonal plasticity" [...] emphasized by the disuse of authentic cadences and root-position tonics as the reason for its [...] "expansiveness". In musicologist Philip Lambert's opinion, the song's vocal counterpoint evokes the sacred traditions of a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach or an oratorio by George Frideric Handel. Andy Gill of the post-punk band Gang of Four describes the composition: ...|$|E
2500|$|The song {{inspired}} songwriter Margo Guryan to {{move into}} writing pop music. She said: [...] "I {{thought it was just}} gorgeous. I bought the record and played it a million times, then sat down and wrote 'Think of Rain.' That's really how I started writing that way. I just decided it was better than what was happening in jazz." [...] Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne wrote that [...] "It's impossible to exaggerate how beautiful this song is. Everywhere, it takes risks." [...] Bono said in October 2006 during Brian Wilson's induction into the UK Music Hall of Fame that [...] "the string arrangement on 'God Only Knows' is fact and proof of angels". Jimmy Webb, an American popular music composer, has also stated his love for the song, stating, [...] "I love 'God Only Knows' and its bow to the baroque that goes {{all the way back to}} 1740 and Johann Sebastian Bach. It represents the whole tradition of liturgical music that I feel is a spiritual part of Brian's music. And Carl's singing is pretty much at its pinnacle—as good as it ever got." [...] In a 2003 solo concert in Tel Aviv, Steven Wilson, frontman of Porcupine Tree, declared [...] "God Only Knows" [...] as his favorite song of all time. On the Insurgentes listening party that took place in Mexico City in 2009, Steven Wilson said it was a perfect song. Simon Neil of Scottish band Biffy Clyro has the lyrics [...] "God <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> I'd be without you" [...] tattooed across his chest.|$|E

2500|$|After {{deciding}} {{on the story}} and the main character, he would balance the characters, in terms of genders, personalities, and ages represented; when making character personalities, he used the Enneagram of Personality as reference, which classifies people into nine groups; the decision to do this came from {{the importance of the}} number [...] "9" [...] in the storyline of 999. An important thing to him when making characters was to create a mystery behind them, to make players curious about who the characters are and what their pasts are like. Another important element was the use of misdirection: by deliberately making certain characters seem like bad people, he would aim to get players to focus on them more, making it more difficult for them to see who the [...] "real bad guy" [...] is. He aimed to not give the player characters strong personalities, {{in order to make it}} easier for players to empathize with them. He chose to have the games be played from a first person perspective as he felt it makes for [...] "a stronger impact" [...] and is more interesting than a third person perspective; it was also used to limit the information that is available to the player in a realistic way, as the player <b>only</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> they experience or are told. Because the player characters in most games can die many times, Uchikoshi felt that video game characters' deaths may be taken lightly, which he saw as a weak point in games. To combat this, he focused on trying to get players to want to keep the story alive, rather than trying to keep the player character alive; as a result of wanting to keep the story going, players would also avoid the death of their character.|$|E
