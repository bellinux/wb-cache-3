40|$|Abstract. The SCOOP model {{extends the}} Eiffel {{programming}} language {{to provide support}} for concurrent programming. The model {{is based on the}} principles of Design by Contract. The semantics of contracts used in the original proposal (SCOOP 97) is not suitable for concurrent programming because it restricts parallelism and complicates reasoning about program correctness. This article outlines a new contract semantics which applies equally well in concurrent and sequential contexts and permits a flexible use of contracts for specifying the mutual rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> and suppliers while preserving the potential for parallelism. We argue that it is indeed a generalisation of the traditional correctness semantics. We also propose a proof technique for concurrent programs which supports proofs—similar to those for traditional non-concurrent programs—of partial correctness and loop termination in the presence of asynchrony...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Large {{parts of}} today’s {{software}} systems {{are devoted to}} detecting and recovering from failures, making exception handling a critical issue in software development. Concurrent software complicates this issue: most concurrent programming languages require a mechanism to deal with asynchronous exceptions, {{but because of the}} diverse design choices underlying each language, no approach fits all situations. We introduce a classification of possible approaches to guide the development of asynchronous exception mechanisms, and we show its applicability by deriving a sound and comprehensible mechanism for SCOOP, an object-oriented programming model for concurrency. We describe the key idea of the mechanism using the accountability framework, which precisely defines the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>client</b> and supplier regarding the reporting of exceptions. The framework not only provides the necessary intuition to apply the mechanism correctly, it is also useful to comprehend other approaches.

This means that any implementations or redefinitions of inherited routines {{also have to be}} written to comply with their inherited contract. Preconditions can be modified in redefined routines, but they may only be weakened. That is, the redefined routine may lessen the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>client,</b> but not increase it.|$|R
40|$|The {{result of}} the {{research}} showed that {{the position of the}} Bank and the clients in a credit contract is never in balance. The reason of PT Bank Mandiri for applying the requirement for Single Banker in giving credit to debtors is merely to apply prudential principle. The legal consequence of its implementation of applying the requirement for Single Banker in credit contract of PT Bank Mandiri, Tbk related to the Law on Hypothecation is that it will be legally null and void because it is contrary to Law No. 4 / 1996 on Hypothecation. In practice, however, a credit contract is never legally null and void because of applying the requirement for Single Banker since it is generally practiced by the banks in Indonesia. It is recommended that Bank Indonesia as the establisher and supervisor of the National Banking standardize the content of credit contract of each bank operating in Indonesia by paying attention to the balance in right between a debtor and a bank. In order to make it balanced and righteous in the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> creditor and debtor, before signing the credit contract, both parties should understand its content so that the right and <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> can be completely understood...|$|R
40|$|Murābahah {{transaction}} {{is similar}} to business characteristics (tijārah) because it can make benefit (profit) and also, it can be risky (loss) that must be anticipated. One of the risks is a failure to obey agreement (default) in part <b>of</b> <b>client.</b> In order to anticipate losses elicited by the failure, then penalties {{were assigned to the}} default clients in sharia financial institutions and conventional ones of Indonesia. In addition, penalties cannot be assigned arbitrarily without considering justice elements as stated in Al-Qur’an and Sunnah and laws of Indonesian Republic. BMT Amanah Ummah of Sukoharjo branch is one of sharia financial institution that is applying penalties in Murābahah transaction to default clients. As an Islamic-based financial institution, BMT Amanah Ummah is, of course, making instructions published by National Sharia Council as one of guides in its every activity. Purpose of the research is to know conformity of penalties application to clients who are failed to obey Murābahah agreement in BMT Amanah Ummah of Sukoharjo branch based on instruction of National Sharia Council, especially about fine penalty. In order to understand the problem, researcher used field research with descriptive-qualitative method, namely a method of describing occurrence or facts found in field, then researcher evaluated penalties implementation in BMT Amanah Ummah of Sukoharjo branch based on instructions of National Sharia Council and supported by results of interview and documentation. Based on the research, it can be concluded that based on data presentation and revealing of Murābahah transactions, implementation of penalties by BMT Amanah Ummah of Sukoharho branch was agreeing with content of instructions published by National Sharia Council. Fine penalties applied by the Islamic bank were allowed by instruction of National Sharia Council, namely DSN No. 17 /DSN/IX/ 2000 and money of the penalties that were distributed by the bank to LAZIS UMS was conforming to contents of the instruction requiring that the fund obtained from penalties should be provided to social fund. Penalty of security goods auction was also agreeing with content of instruction of DSN No. 47 /DSN-MUI/II/ 2005 in which the Islamic bank can sell Murābahah object/security goods, and if money acquired from the auction exceeds <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>client,</b> the excess will be returned to client, whereas if the money is less than <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>client,</b> then the shortage will still be <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>client.</b> Key words: Penalty, Failure to obey Agreement, Murabahah, BMT Amanah Ummah, Instruction of National Sharia Counci...|$|R

The first part generally focuses on the relation between an advocate and a client. This part is composed of four chapters. Chapter one attempts to define basic terminology used in this paper, such as advocacy, client and advocate. Then the history of advocacy from ancient Rome is outlined in brief as well as legislation of advocacy. Chapter two looks at various ways of formation of the relation between an advocate and a client, it focuses on the most common way - a contract about providing legal services. Chapter three is one of the crucial chapters of this paper and concentrates on chosen rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> an advocate towards a client and vice versa, rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> a <b>client</b> towards an advocate. The last chapter of the first part explicates the termination of the relation between an advocate and a client. The second part of the thesis is more specific, final 18 pages deal {{with one of the most}} signifiant <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> an advocate - <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> secrecy.

The lawyer amuses himself by befriending a carefree and contented man and destroys his peace of mind by presenting him with the means to buy a farm. It is a disaster and eventually his client begs Philippus to return him to his former way of life. In the poem, Horace is pointing out to Maecenas that the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> his <b>client</b> status should not be urged to the point of damaging his health and that, if he cannot be allowed his independence, he is ready to return the benefits he has received in the past. The story he tells follows immediately after a shorter reference to one of Aesop's animal fables pointing to the same conclusion, [...] "The Fox and the Weasel".|$|R
40|$|The Australian Psychological Society Code of Ethics {{explicitly}} {{states that}} clients {{are to be}} informed about the legal limits of confidentiality prior to engaging in any psychological relationship. Maintaining and respecting client confidentiality is also seen as a major professional obligation. Despite this, little research has examined how limits of confidentiality is introduced, discussed, and oriented to in real-life psychological consultations. An initial consultation between a client and a provisionally registered psychologist was used to explore how a psychologist and client interactively managed limits of confidentiality. Using a discursive psychological framework, analysis revealed that while the psychologist complied with the ethical <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> informing the <b>client</b> <b>of</b> the limits of confidentially before counselling began, {{the way in which}} the psychologist enacted this restricted the client's opportunities to ask questions or seek clarification about these limits. Further, when the psychologist explicitly asked for <b>client</b> confirmation <b>of</b> understanding and acceptance of these limits, what the client confirmed and accepted appears unclear. Given that breaches of confidentiality are Registration Board matters, this lack of clarity and limiting <b>of</b> <b>client</b> interaction is concerning. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recently, the Index Coding {{problem has}} {{attracted}} a significant interest from the research community. In this problem, a server needs to deliver packets to a set <b>of</b> wireless <b>clients</b> over a noiseless broadcast channel. Each client needs to obtain a certain subset of packets and {{can take advantage of}} another subset available to it as side information. The objective is to satisfy the demands <b>of</b> all <b>clients</b> with the minimum number of transmissions. In this paper, we study the Index Coding problem from the game-theoretic perspective. We assume that each client is selfish and has a hidden private value for each packet it requests. The objective of server is to maximize the social welfare that captures the trade-off between the values of the received packets and the transmission cost incurred by the server. The transmission process is decided through an auction in which the clients are required to submit bids to the server. Each bid implies an <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>client</b> to pay for the packets it can obtain from the channel. Our goal is to design a truthful auction scheme that provides an incentive for each client to bid the true value of the packets. We propose a truthful mechanism to achieve the maximum social welfare. The key component of our scheme is to determine the encoding functions of the transmitted packets, which is NP-hard. We present an efficient approximation algorithm that guarantees both the approximation ratio and the truthfulness properties. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} been written against a {{background}} of growing concern for business and professional ethics generally, and draws most of its material from the field of organisation development where such issues have been on the agenda for more than a decade. It is the author's view that a cross-fertilisation of ideas on the subject of ethical practice between OD and Management Science/Operational Research is long overdue. There is a rising awareness within MS/OR that systems or contingency approaches to consultancy interventions call for the ability to discriminate between situations, so that an appropriate choice of methodology may be made. There is less awareness of the ethical issues which this implies. Consultants are required to be competent in making such choices, not to misrepresent their capabilities, and to take account of conflicting interests within organisations. This calls, among other things, for impartiality, diagnostic skill and a general understanding of behaviour in organisations. Following an analysis <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> to <b>clients</b> and other affected parties, a summary of guiding principles for ethical consulting practice is offered.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain.

40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R

40|$|Taking care {{of people}} with disabilities is dated back to history. Nowadays there are many ways how to take care, socialize and {{integrate}} people with special needs. For people with some handicap there are number of fences at the same time, which are impossible to break through without help of the other people. We can also find out that people with disabilities are exposed to some kinds of discrimination. The most severe fence for those people is that they have got nearly closed access to the labour market. People with disabilities belong in disadvantaged groups at the labour market and they are suffering from long-term unemployment. Sheltered workshops are one way how to integrate those people. People with health problems and with changed working ability work there. Working in the sheltered workshops isnt only earning money. It is also a place where especially the disabled people can become members of society and can gain new experience. I tried to find out similarities and differences in running of chosen sheltered workshops. Based on my stay in Massachusetts, USA I chose to concentrate on describing non-government, non-profit organization called Road to Responsibility, Inc. In the Czech Republic I chose for the same purpose Domov sv. Anežky, o. p. s. in Týn nad Vltavou. In theoretical part of thesis, I concentrate on the problems of disability. I am describing history of {{care of people}} with disabilities, the types of disability, socialization and last, but not least jobs opportunities and self [...] fulfillment of peoplewith disabilities. The practical section of thesis is divided into two parts. In part one I am describing running of the chosen companies and their sheltered workshops and in part two I am graphically displaying found information. I chose to do research two different ways. The first one was secondary data analysis and content analysis. I also collected information from interviews, in which I talked to employees and managers of the workshops. Before I started collecting data I chose what information I want to find out, what documents I want to study so I will get the result I wanted [...] to find out the similarities and differences of the chosen workshops in USA and in Czech Republic. The information were e. g. rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>clients,</b> the founders <b>of</b> those companies, what do they offer, personal security, qualifications of employees, rates of pay for people with disabilities and last but not least what types of workshops each organization runs. Based on the information I collected, I realized, that certain differences between Road to Responsibility and Domov sv. Anežky exists. The main difference is different rates of pay for people with disability for their work. Another difference is how the rights <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> are exercise. I can declare that both my hypothesis were correct. I am convinced, that my work points out the similarities and differences, which exist in sheltered workshops in the Czech Republic and USA.
