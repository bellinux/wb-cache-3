500|$|One of Wistert's {{teammates}} on the 1932 and 1933 Michigan {{football teams}} was future U.S. President Gerald Ford. [...] In {{an interview in}} the February 1974 issue of [...] "Michigan Alumnus", Wistert said of Ford: [...] "He was a real good competitor – a real bulldog type. Even during a losing year, he was voted MVP by his teammates. They felt he was <b>one</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> could stay and fight for a losing cause." ...|$|E
500|$|Ford played center, linebacker, {{and long}} snapper for the school's {{football}} team, {{and helped the}} Wolverines in two undefeated seasons and national titles in 1932 and 1933. The team suffered a steep decline in his 1934 senior year, however, winning only one game. Ford was the team's star nonetheless. After a game during which Michigan held heavily favored Minnesota (the eventual national champion) to a scoreless tie in the first half, assistant coach Bennie Oosterbaan later said, [...] "When I walked into the dressing room at halftime, I had {{tears in my eyes}} I was so proud of them. Ford and [...] Sweet played their hearts out. They were everywhere on defense." [...] Ford later recalled, [...] "During 25 years in the rough-and-tumble world of politics, I often thought of the experiences before, during, and after that game in 1934. Remembering them has helped me many times to face a tough situation, take action, and make every effort possible despite adverse odds." [...] His teammates later voted Ford their most valuable player, with one assistant coach noting, [...] "They felt Jerry was <b>one</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> would stay and fight in a losing cause." ...|$|E

500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the <b>one</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|With {{the idea}} of Star Treks genesis in mind, the central story became Cochrane's warp drive test and humanity's first contact. Drawing on clues from {{previous}} Star Trek episodes, Cochrane was placed in mid-21st century Montana, where humans recover from a devastating world war. In the first script with this setting, the Borg attack Cochrane's lab, leaving the scientist comatose; Picard assumes Cochrane's place to continue the warp test and restore history. In this draft Picard has a love interest in the local photographer Ruby, while Riker leads {{the fight against the}} Borg on the Enterprise. Another draft included John de Lancie's omnipotent character Q. Looking at the early scripts, the trio knew that serious work was needed. [...] "It just didn't make sense [...] that Picard, the <b>one</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> has a history with the Borg, never meets them," [...] Braga recalled. Riker and Picard's roles were swapped, and the planetside story was shortened and told differently. Braga and Moore focused the new arc on Cochrane himself, making the ideal future of Star Trek come from a flawed man. The idea of Borg fighting among period costumes coalesced into a [...] "Dixon Hill" [...] holographic novel sequence on the holodeck. The second draft, titled Star Trek: Resurrection, was judged complete enough that the production team used it to plan expenses. The film was given a budget of $45million, [...] "considerably more" [...] than Generations $35million price tag; this allowed the production to plan a larger amount of action and special effects.|$|E

5000|$|The {{bottom line}} is that Kimmo - Mika's brother and the band's former drummer changed our style pretty much after the release of Ugra-Karma. It was his vision of how we should sound, {{and the rest of us}} weren't happy at all. It is useless for a band like us to try to be a copy of Danzig or fucking Paradise Lost.

It was <b>one</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> wanted to go a different way, and the rest did not agree.

With the opportunity to win and in fading light, Scott sank his 15 ft birdie putt for the victory.

5000|$|In Bayou St. John, the cichlid {{threatens to}} {{overwhelm}} native species and ruin {{the efforts of}} the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to restore the historical fishery of Bayou St. John. Because the fish competes with native fish for shallow mating sites, it reduces the chances of the diverse fishery ever being fully recovered. The fish has already eliminated several smaller fish in this bayou, including killifish and sheepshead minnows. In fact, if the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries did not routinely re-stock several midsized species, {{it is likely that the}} cichlid would have eliminated these fish too. Because of this, there is even a competition at the City Park Big Bass Fishing Rodeo & Fishtival to catch the most cichlids. According to a fisherman Joe Adams, who participates in the competition, [...] "They will eat just about anything...I know <b>one</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> catches them with French fries...pieces of a hot dog and pieces of canned corn." [...] Despite these efforts, there is practically no chance or eradicating this fish from New Orleans' waters mainly because of its quick mating cycle.|$|E
