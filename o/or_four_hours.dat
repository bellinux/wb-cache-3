5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially {{one on a}} knoll overlooking {{the square of the}} 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry {{because of the presence of}} French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the tirailleurs. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E

25|$|Caffeine is {{a central}} nervous system {{stimulant}} that reduces fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after about three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 1839, Sandford was {{commissioned}} major {{general of the}} First Division and held command for nearly three decades. Although having a fine service record, Sandford kept an informal atmosphere and sometimes lax discipline within his command. Units were also far below regimental quotas. Brigadier generals were late reporting for duty and he himself was very late organizing division formations on occasion. This often resulted in delays such as military parades being three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> overdue. These officers were generally not held accountable for their negligence and courts-martial were rarely held.|$|E

She played an engaged woman who develops a one-sided attraction to her commitment-phobic co-worker. Khan said about Kapoor's craft, [...] "We'd be shooting {{a scene from}} multiple angles—for three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> you're doing the same scene, the same lines—and here is this person [...] who brings consistency to her work, {{from the way she}} talks, to her accent." [...] Although Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called Kapoor's performance [...] "stiff and rehearsed", Daily News and Analysis Johnson Thomas found her [...] "likeable and believable". I Hate Luv Storys was Kapoor's first commercial success, earning [...] worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Filming on [...] "Extinction" [...] {{began on}} July 31, 2003, with a shoot that lasted the {{following}} seven working days. To represent the jungle {{of the alien}} planet, the soundstage was inundated with foliage. A Xindi landing pod was created to appear in those same scenes. Several of the main cast were required to undergo extended make-up sessions lasting three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> every day for six days of the shoot in order for their characters to appear {{in a number of}} different stages of mutation. The make-up on Jolene Blalock was not as extensive as that on Scott Bakula, Dominic Keating and Linda Park due to her character's Vulcan anatomy. Both Bakula and Keating had to wear bladders on their throats as a special effect which were inflated when they growled. Following the experience, Park praised John Billingsley, who in his role as Doctor Phlox has to undertake similar make-up regimes for every episode.|$|E

500|$|In {{the evening}} of 19 January 1943, Crombie was {{airborne}} over India with his navigator Warrant Officer Raymond Moss. At approximately 20:45, the pair intercepted a formation of four Japanese bombers flying over Budge Budge. Crombie flew his aircraft towards the group but his initial attack drew fire from the bombers, setting the starboard engine ablaze. Despite the damage, he pushed ahead with the assault and shot {{down one of the}} bombers. Flames from the burning engine then began to sweep back, and Crombie ordered Moss to bail out. Alone, Crombie continued the assault, shooting down a second bomber, before turning his attention to a third. Due to his efforts, the penultimate aircraft was [...] "so badly damaged... that it could not have reached its base". At this time, Crombie sought out the fourth and final machine. However, his petrol tank exploded, and he was forced [...] "to bale out with his clothing alight". He landed in [...] "the most God awful swamp", and walked for three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> before he reached an army unit in the area, which returned him to his squadron.|$|E
500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side air bags. Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E

5000|$|The {{usage of}} dual feeds {{of the same}} channel is a commonplace method for premium {{channels}} such as HBO, Showtime and Starz, in which the Pacific time zone feed of the primary channel is packaged with the East Coast feed of the main channel and the pay service's multiplex channels (if the premium channel has any). Most commonly, the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone feeds of only the main channel are packaged together, although some providers may also provide both coastal feeds of a premium service's multiplex channels. In some cases, cable networks (such as cable news and sports channels) [...] "fake" [...] the dual feed approach by recycling their same-day prime time programming during the overnight hours on a three (<b>or</b> <b>four)</b> <b>hour</b> cycle; in this case, the programs are automatically rebroadcast at the advertised time (or one hour later) in the Pacific Time Zone.|$|R

2500|$|... {{the miners}} must {{sometimes}} work {{in places where}} {{there is so little}} circulation of air, that their candles can scarcely burn; and I have almost invariably observed, that a continuance for any considerable length of time, (although in such situations they may only work three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> daily), brings on pneumonia in the young and plethoric, and hydrothorax in the old, if rather of spare habit of body; and if there should happen to be any healthy middle-aged men working as hand-neighbours to these others, although of course both must breath the same impure air, these middle-aged men will remain free from any urgent complaint, till both their young and their aged neighbours are laid aside, perhaps never more to return. I became so fully convinced of this fact, as long ago to have induced me to recommend to the agents and overseers of this place, to avoid, as much as possible, putting thither very young or very old men into such situations.|$|E

Most of the knowledge and information that we have about {{the traditions of the}} Taínos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas. Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described an [...] "Areyto" [...] in the following manner: [...] "And on this island what I could understand was that their songs which they call 'areytos,' were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from one day to the next." ...|$|E

Miller was critical of the New York club in particular:"When a club deliberately imports six or eight {{of the best players}} in Canada, feeds them like fighting cocks, keeps them with nothing to do from one week's end to another but play lacrosse, and then plays them against a team composed of business men who don't get a chance to practice more than three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> a week, I think it's about time to stop it ...

2500|$|Toots Mondt's second {{plan was}} to promote this new style of wrestling on a much higher scale. [...] Toots {{convinced}} Ed Lewis and his manager Billy Sandow of forming their own promotion as opposed to having different promoters controlling them. The team of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow used their connections to convince many other wrestlers to sign up. Under the control of Mondt, Lewis and Sandow, they served as bookers and agents. Toots also instituted time limits as wrestling matches would often go three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b> Within six months, the [...] "Gold Dust Trio" [...] controlled the course of professional wrestling in North America. Their product was moved out from venues such as burlesque theaters and back alley halls to the major sports venue in each city.

The Gold Dust Trio later dissolved from a power struggle between Toots Mondt & Billy Sandow's brother Max.|$|E
2500|$|Gaines's Mill was {{an intense}} battle, {{the largest of}} the Seven Days and the only {{clear-cut}} Confederate tactical victory of the Peninsula Campaign. Union casualties from the 34,214 engaged were 6,837 (894 killed, 3,107 wounded, and 2,836 captured or missing). Of the 57,018 Confederates engaged, losses totaled 7,993 (1,483 killed, 6,402 wounded, 108 missing or captured). Since the Confederate assault was conducted against {{only a small portion of}} the Union Army (the V Corps, one fifth of the army), the army emerged from the battle in relatively good shape overall. Lee's victory, his first of the war, could have been more complete if it were not for the mishaps of Stonewall Jackson. Historian Stephen W. Sears speculates that it were not for Jackson's misdirected march and his poor staff work, the major assault that Lee unleashed at 7 p.m. could have occurred three <b>or</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> earlier. This would have put Porter in grave jeopardy, without any last-minute reinforcements and the cover of darkness. He quotes Edward Porter Alexander, prominent Confederate artillery officer and postwar historian: [...] "Had Jackson attacked when he first arrived, or during A.P. Hill's attack, we would have had an easy victorycomparatively, & would have captured most of Porter's command." ...|$|E
