5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1916 he was {{transferred}} as first lieutenant to a Q-ship under Gordon Campbell. A Q-ship was a merchant ship with hidden weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the Q-ship would feign damage until the enemy {{was close enough to}} engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of Q-ship strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> and brought him in to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of Q-ship operations.|$|E

As he is about to tell her, Central Perk manager Gunther (James Michael Tyler) confesses his love for Rachel.

After Rachel leaves, Ross has a change of heart, and Phoebe takes him in her taxi to follow Rachel to the airport.|$|E
5|$|SCI {{can lead}} to {{significant}} insecurities, which have repercussions for sexuality and self-image. SCI often affects body image, either due to the host {{of changes in the}} body that affect appearance (e.g. unused muscles in the legs become atrophied), or due to changes in self-perception not directly from physical changes. People frequently find themselves less attractive and expect others not to be attracted to them after SCI. These insecurities cause fear <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> and deter people from initiating contact or sexual activity or engaging in sex. Feelings of undesirability or worthlessness even lead some to suggest to their partners that they find someone able bodied.|$|E
5|$|Woodruff's {{contributions}} to surgery were important and long-lasting. In addition to performing the first kidney transplant in the UK, he devised {{a method of}} implanting a transplanted ureter in the bladder during transplants that is still used today. Furthermore, he established a large, efficient transplant unit in Edinburgh that {{remains one of the}} world's best. Although best known for these clinical accomplishments, Woodruff's {{contributions to}} the study <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> and tolerance induction were equally important. Among these contributions, Woodruff's work with anti-lymphocyte serum has led to its wide use to reduce rejection symptoms in organ transplant recipients up to the current day.|$|E

I manipulated two factors, delay and feedback, that are known to influence the use <b>of</b> recollection <b>rejection.</b> Recollection rejection was used to reject false suggestions in the misinformation paradigm. Manipulating delay time {{did not affect the}} acceptance of misinformation or the use <b>of</b> recollection <b>rejection.</b> Warning participants about false information reduced misinformation acceptance but did not lead to increased rates <b>of</b> recollection <b>rejection.</b> Collectively, these findings suggest an important role for recollection rejection in rejecting misleading suggestions about events...|$|R

30|$|Other papers {{argue that}} very small probabilities are {{regarded}} as zero (Brito 1975) or that small probabilities for high wins result in a high risk for the decision maker (Allais 1952; Weirich 1984) with a large payment. While these arguments can explain increasing pattern <b>of</b> <b>rejections</b> for positive St. Petersburg game, they fail badly in explaining increasing pattern <b>of</b> <b>rejections</b> <b>of</b> participation that we observe in our data from St. Petersburg games with negative prizes. This is so as nullification of small probabilities or increasing risk for a risk-seeker (as revealed in Holt–Laury elicitation treatment in Experiment 2) make participation in the game with negative prizes more attractive as n increases, so we should observe a decreasing pattern <b>of</b> <b>rejections</b> as n increases, {{the opposite of what}} we see in our data, with monetary payment as well as waiting time.|$|R
5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was particularly interested in thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study <b>of</b> <b>rejection.</b> The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{transplant}} rejection and subsequent damage to the new lung or lungs, patients must take a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs.

The immunosuppressive regimen is begun just before or after surgery. Usually the regimen includes ciclosporin, azathioprine and corticosteroids, but as episodes <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> may reoccur throughout a patient's life, the exact choices and dosages of immunosuppressants may have to be modified over time. Sometimes tacrolimus is given instead of ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil instead of azathioprine.|$|E

25|$|One way of {{reducing}} the risk <b>of</b> <b>rejection</b> {{is to use a}} technique called deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK). In a DALK graft, only the outermost epithelium and the main bulk of the cornea, the stroma, are replaced; the person's rearmost endothelium layer and the Descemet's membrane are left, giving some additional structural integrity to the postgraft cornea. Furthermore, it is possible to transplant freeze-dried donor tissue. The freeze-drying process ensures this tissue is dead, so there is no chance <b>of</b> <b>rejection.</b> Research from two trials in Iran provide low to moderate evidence that graft rejection is more likely to occur in penetrating keratoplasty than in DALK, though the likelihood for graft failure were similar with both procedures.|$|E
