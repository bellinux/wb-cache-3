Over £230 million was extended in loans from the City of London to state and Commonwealth treasuries during the 1920s. A further £140 million arrived through private investment. Bruce's plan for Australian economic development needed a much stronger role for the Commonwealth government than had been traditionally accepted. Both he and Page were [...] "conspicuously national rather than federal in their outlook" [...] and sought major changes to federal-state relations in order implement their development policy. Increasingly <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> are becoming national in character... Our financial resources are curtailed {{and there is an}} immediate repercussion throughout the Commonwealth. All <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> are common problems. None can be prosperous unless all are prospering. I am more convinced that {{we have to look at}} all <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> with the eyes of a nation and not as individuals. Where a great problem confronts a State it may be solved by the cooperation of the Commonwealth for the benefit of the States, and the benefit and advancement of the whole of Australia.|$|E

Then we use power functions of order two, three and four in <b>our</b> <b>problem</b> and find the respective condtions for obtaining an equilibrium for <b>our</b> different <b>problems.</b> In {{the last part of}} the paper, we consider using another definition of equilibrium to solve <b>our</b> <b>problem</b> when the utility function that we use in <b>our</b> <b>problem</b> is the negative part of x and also find the condtions for obtaining an equilibrium...|$|R

[...] The band were so confident {{of the quality of the}} words that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve. [...] "Roger's concerns in it are not out of date," [...] remarked Gilmour on the album's twentieth anniversary. [...] "He did a fantastic job with those words. Then, Roger was always more verbal than the rest of us, who had no great confidence in our lyric-writing. Probably, in hindsight, we should have stuck at it: the roots of <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> were being set back then. But we all got the credit and money that we were happy with." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} with King, despite only {{resulting in the}} completion of one track, [...] "Bad Boyfriend", gave the band perspective and direction. Manson said that because the band members still had problems speaking to each other, King could not get much work out of the band, so they realized {{that they needed to}} work out their differences and was the catalyst for the band getting back together and working harmoniously. Vig said that the tensions led the band members to become [...] "burned out on each other", and that reuniting made them feel able to play [...] "...fast and furiousas if our lives depended on it". Manson overcame her writer's block and began to inject political slants into her lyrics, matching them with some new material the band wrote immediately after the King sessions; both [...] "Metal Heart" [...] and [...] "Boys Wanna Fight" [...] referenced the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. Despite a plan to record some material with producer Tony Hoffer, the band decided to complete the rest of the album themselves. Erikson later said, [...] "It was kind of seductive to think that maybe someone else [...] solve all of <b>our</b> <b>problems,</b> but in the end you gotta do it yourself".|$|E

The Divan refused; Madhavan then requested for permission to make a representation to the Maharaja himself which was denied.

[...] He railed against what he saw as the widespread effeminacy in male dancing which, in his opinion, [...] "tragically" [...] stigmatized the genre, alienating boys from entering the field: [...] "Dancing does attract effeminate young men. I don't object to that as long as they don't dance effeminately. I just say that if a man dances effeminately he dances badly — just as if a woman comes out on stage and starts to sing bass. Unfortunately, people confuse gracefulness with softness. John Wayne is a graceful man and so are some of the great ball players...but, of course, they don't run the risk of being called sissies." [...] In his view, [...] "one of <b>our</b> <b>problems</b> is that so much dancing is taught by women. You can spot many male dancers who have this tuition by their arm movements — they are soft, limp and feminine." [...] He acknowledged that, in spite of his efforts — in TV programs such as Dancing: A Man's Game (1958) for example — the situation changed little over the years.|$|E
