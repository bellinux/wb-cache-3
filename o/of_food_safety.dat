40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>safety</b> {{programs}} set out {{how safe}} food is produced. The primary objective <b>of</b> designing <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> plans {{is to ensure}} food is safe and suitable for human consumption. However if the design <b>of</b> the <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> plan is affected by {{lack of knowledge of}} the biological, chemical and physical (BCP) hazards <b>of</b> the <b>food</b> production process, then <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> may not be assured. This paper focuses on three problems when analysing the microbiological hazards that can affect the quality <b>of</b> the <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> plan and which may result in unsafe food and {{a false sense of security}} for the food manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|Non-regulatory <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> {{management}} schemes, as {{a complement}} or alternative to mandatory regulation, {{have become a}} prevalent component <b>of</b> the <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> control system <b>of</b> the global <b>food</b> supply chain. This study focused on non-regulatory <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management schemes implemented by the New Zealand food manufacturing industry, and examined the motivation for, challenges and impacts of, {{and the role of}} third-party certification bodies in the implementation <b>of</b> non-regulatory <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management schemes. In particular, factors influencing the effectiveness <b>of</b> nonregulatory <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management schemes and the quality <b>of</b> third-party <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> audits were examined. It was found that non-regulatory <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management is a key component <b>of</b> the entire <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management system in New Zealand. The implementation <b>of</b> nonregulatory <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management schemes was mainly driven by major customers’ requirements, a desire to improve product quality and safety, and the desire to be recognized by the industry and the public. After the implementation of these schemes, enterprises experienced many desirable changes such as the improvement of product traceability, increasing <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> awareness <b>of</b> employees, and reduced customer complaints. Notably, the implementation improved the <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> culture. The major challenges encountered during the implementation of these schemes were increased paper work, and the cost of development and implementation. The service of thirdparty certification bodies was important for food companies to continuously improve their <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management. Enterprise characteristics made a substantial difference to the propensity <b>of</b> <b>food</b> manufacturing enterprises to implement non-regulatory schemes. These characteristics made notable differences to the relative importance of different incentives to implement non-regulatory schemes and the food manufacturing enterprise’s experiences of the implementation of non-regulatory schemes. The effectiveness <b>of</b> non-regulatory <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> management schemes was largely influenced by the <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> culture in <b>food</b> manufacturing companies and the quality <b>of</b> third-party <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> audits. A relatively robust <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> culture is in place in the food manufacturing industry, although there are areas needing improvement and change. The audit quality could be affected by accreditation, competition in the certification market, competency and integrity of auditors, audit scope, audit time, and surveillance activities of scheme owners...|$|R

WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to address food safety issues along the entire food production chain—from production to consumption—using new methods of risk analysis. These methods provide efficient, science-based tools to improve food safety, thereby benefiting both public health and economic development.|$|E

25|$|The FQPA was {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} reform <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> and pesticide laws in decades and posed an implementation challenge for the EPA. Immediately following {{the passing of the}} FQPA, the EPA moved to create the Food Safety Advisory Committee. The committee was founded with the intention of fostering an open and public implementation process. Within 10 years, the EPA had successfully reassessed 99% of the nation's pesticide tolerances (recommending the revocation of 3,200, recommending the modification of 1,200 and approving 5,237). In addition to the reassessing of pesticide tolerances, the EPA accommodated the use of special classes of pesticides, addressed the public policy issue of clinical studies to verify pesticide effects, and expedited the availability of safe pesticides.|$|E
25|$|Changes in China's food {{production}} system are generating an awareness <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> problems. China's agricultural system is composed mostly of small land-holding farmers and subsistence agriculture. China, however, has less arable land than other nations and farmers intensively use fertilizer and pesticides to maintain high {{food production}}. Food {{is sold in}} both open air markets and urban supermarkets, and by the late 1990s, China's farms were adapting to more specialized crop production as the local markets become more connected to the national and international markets. However, local authorities largely control food regulation enforcement unless the central government steps in. As urban consumers' incomes increase, the demand for quality food goods, safer production, and processed foods also increases, and urban residents and supermarkets attract more national and media attention to food problems.|$|E
25|$|No single {{agency is}} {{responsible}} for all food safety regulations and enforcement in China, and the departments' duties often overlap. There are also local and regional food safety agencies, {{but there is no}} clear hierarchy of agencies at the local or national levels. In response to complexity of numerous agencies monitoring and regulating food safety, the National People's Congress established the State Food and Drug Administration in 2003. The State Food and Drug Administration was supposed to oversee the all aspects <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> regulations and unify food safety controls. However, the State Food and Drug Administration has not become the main governing department as the government had intended, and the other national agencies have continued to regulate and monitor food safety. This unclear division of duties has created conflict and confusion when citizens have sought to complain or when a major crisis needed to be resolved.|$|E

25|$|Membership to INFOSAN is voluntary, but is {{restricted}} to representatives from national and regional government authorities and requires an official letter of designation. INFOSAN seeks to reflect the multidisciplinary nature <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> and promote intersectoral collaboration by requesting the designation of Focal Points {{in each of the}} respective national authorities with a stake in food safety, and a single Emergency Contact Point in the national authority with the responsibility for coordinating national food safety emergencies; countries choosing to be members of INFOSAN are committed to sharing information between their respective food safety authorities and other INFOSAN members. The operational definition of a food safety authority includes those authorities involved in: food policy; risk assessment; food control and management; food inspection services; foodborne disease surveillance and response; laboratory services for monitoring and surveillance of foods and foodborne diseases; and food safety information, education and communication across the farm-to-table continuum.|$|E

40|$|Although {{foodborne}} illness is preventable, more than 56, 000 people per year become ill in the U. S., creating high economic costs, loss of productivity and reduced {{quality of life}} for many. Experts agree that the home is the primary location where foodborne outbreaks occur; however, many consumers do not believe the home to be a risky place. Health care professionals need to be aware <b>of</b> consumers’ <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> attitudes and behaviors in the home and deliver tailored <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> interventions that are theory-based. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to synthesize/summarize the <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> literature by examining the following: consumers’ perceptions and attitudes towards <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> and their susceptibility to {{foodborne illness}} in the home, work, and school; common risky <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> practices and barriers to handling food safely; and the application <b>of</b> theory-based <b>food</b> <b>safety</b> interventions.
