5|$|During the {{administration}} of Ferdinand Marcos, the region <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment of Presidential Decree No. 824 on November 7, 1975. The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns, as a separate regional unit of government. On the 405th anniversary of the city's foundation on June 24, 1976, Manila was reinstated by Marcos as {{the capital of the}} Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period. Presidential Decree No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and {{in the eyes of the}} world, the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade, commerce, education and culture.|$|E
5|$|In Livingston County, I-96 {{passes to}} the south of Fowlerville and Howell. Near the Livingston County Spencer J. Hardy Airport on the western edge of Howell, I-96 meets M-59, which carries the Howell {{business}} loop easterly to Grand River Avenue. The freeway expands to six lanes and runs parallel to Grand River Avenue on the southern side of town. The business loop reconnects near Lake Chemung {{on the east side of}} town, and I-96 turns further {{to the south}}east. On the northeast side of Brighton, I-96 crosses over Grand River Avenue and the landscape transitions to include residential subdivisions. I-96 crosses US23 and enters the far northwestern edge <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> Detroit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system in the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area, including a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue with a station between Cherry and James streets. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970. The failure of the Forward Thrust ballot measures {{led to the creation}} <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Construction of a {{real estate}} project is close to one side <b>of</b> the <b>metro</b> station which has {{finished}} main structure building. The diagram <b>of</b> the <b>metro</b> station is used as supporting during the excavation of the pit {{of the real estate}} project, which will result in the one side unloading <b>of</b> the <b>metro</b> station. Bearing the unbalanced soil pressure, the metro station will have additional deformation and internal force. During the pit design, the additional deformation and internal force is analyzed for every step of the excavation. And the additional force is superimposed with the original force <b>of</b> the <b>metro</b> station to calculate the final internal force <b>of</b> the <b>metro</b> station. By adjusting the design parameters of the pit, the safety <b>of</b> the <b>metro</b> station is evaluated...|$|R

5|$|M-53 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that connects Detroit to The Thumb region. The highway starts in Detroit at {{a connection with}} M-3 and ends in Port Austin, Michigan at M-25. In between, the trunkline passes through the northern suburbs <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> Detroit, connects to freeways like Interstate69 (I-69) and provides access to rural farmland. In Macomb County, M-53 follows the Christopher Columbus Freeway, while {{the remainder of the}} highway is known as Van Dyke Avenue in the metro area or Van Dyke Road elsewhere. The highway has also been named the Earle Memorial Highway for one of the pioneers of the Good Roads Movement and Michigan's highway system.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side of the county line, I-75 begins to run inland of, and {{parallel}} to, the Detroit River, entering the Downriver area. The freeway turns northerly after the interchange with M-85 (Fort Street) near Gibraltar, and the LECT departs I-75 to follow M-85 north of the interchange. The landscape transitions to suburban residential areas instead of farmland through this area. The freeway turns back northeasterly in Taylor and intersects the southern end of M-39 (Southfield Highway) in Lincoln Park. I-75 crosses the Ecorse River and passes through an industrial area <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> Detroit. Further north, the freeway spans the River Rouge in the southern part of Detroit.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} design {{plans for the}} station called for a clean utilitarian structure typical <b>of</b> <b>metro</b> stations of that period. Due {{to the efforts of}} the city's chief architect Mykola Zharikov, the design was scrapped in favor of one that resembles an ancient Kievan Rus' temple by Borys Zhezherin, Vadym Zhezherin, and Zharikov himself. Such a design was a particularly risky feat, since Ukraine {{was a part of the}} secular Soviet Union at the time of the station's construction. Vadym Zhezherin and Mykola Zharikov, among the other artists and architects of the station, were bestowed the State Prize of Ukraine in the Field of Architecture for their work in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Forward Thrust Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system for the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area. One of the key components of the system was a downtown subway tunnel on 3rd Avenue terminating at Union Station, where it would split into a south branch to serve Georgetown and Renton, and an east branch to serve Bellevue. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970.

5|$|Interstate 94 (I-94) {{is a part}} of the Interstate Highway System {{that runs}} from Billings, Montana, to the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. In Michigan, it is a state {{trunkline}} highway that enters the state south of New Buffalo and runs eastward through several metropolitan areas in the southern section of the state. The highway serves Benton Harbor–St. Joseph near Lake Michigan before turning inland toward Kalamazoo and Battle Creek on the west side of the peninsula. Heading farther east, I-94 passes through rural areas in the middle of the southern Lower Peninsula, crossing I-69 in the process. I-94 then runs through Jackson, Ann Arbor, and portions <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> Detroit, connecting Michigan's largest city to its main airport. Past the east side of Detroit, the Interstate angles northeasterly through farmlands in The Thumb to Port Huron, where the designation terminates on the Blue Water Bridge at the Canadian border.|$|E

5|$|M-15 {{runs through}} mostly rural {{agricultural}} communities of The Thumb connecting {{the northern edge}} <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> Detroit with the Tri-Cities area. It starts at a junction south of the village of Clarkston in northern Oakland County. The highway runs north along Ortonville Road from the intersection with US24 (Dixie Highway) near Deer and Middle lakes through Clarkston. Continuing through town on Main Street near Parke Lake, it comes to an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75) north of the village next to Little Walters Lake. South of Ortonville near Lake Louise and Bald Eagle Lake, M-15 turns northwest between the two lakes. The trunkline becomes State Road at the county line and turns north again near Shinanguag Lake near the Ortonville State Recreation Area outside Goodrich in southeastern Genesee County. South of Davison, M-15 intersects I-69 near the Davison Country Club before running through town. In Otisville, State Road curves around {{to the west of}} some small lakes and through town.|$|E
5|$|Metro: Last Light {{takes place}} in 2034, {{one year after the}} events <b>of</b> <b>Metro</b> 2033, {{following}} the ending of the original novel in which Artyom's missile strike against the Dark Ones — mysterious beings that seemingly threatened the survivors of a nuclear war living in the Moscow Metro — occurred. The Rangers, a neutral peacekeeping force that operates throughout the system, have since occupied the D6 military facility Artyom visited during the first game. This is a huge, and not fully explored pre-war bunker, and Artyom, now a Ranger himself, remains unsure whether killing the Dark Ones was the correct decision. Rumors of D6's discovery, and its great riches, have spread around the Metro; rival factions, such as the Communist Red Line and Nazi Fourth Reich, hope to seize the bunker and its contents.|$|E
