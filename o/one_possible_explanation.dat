40|$|Using ammonia as {{nitrogen}} {{source for}} molecular beam epitaxy, the GaN-based diluted magnetic semiconductor Ga 1 -xMnxN is successfully grown with Mn concentration up to x~ 6. 8 % and with p-type conductivity. The films have wurtzite structure with substitutional Mn on Ga site in GaN. Magnetization measurements revealed that Ga 1 -xMnxN is ferromagnetic at temperatures higher than room temperature. The ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition temperature, Tc, {{depends on the}} Mn concentration of the film. At low temperatures, the magnetization increases with increasing of magnetic field, implying that a paramagnetic-like phase coexists with ferromagnetic <b>one.</b> <b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> will be proposed for the coexistence of two magnetic phases in the grown films.

40|$|Selected {{parts of}} ten frozen core samples from Holes 482 A, 482 B, 483 A, and 485 A, Leg 65 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP), were {{analyzed}} for residual carbohydrates {{in order to}} determine the provenance and history of the organic material in the sediments. The samples, which represented silty-clay, shale, and nannofossil- chalk sediments, were analyzed for water-soluble monosaccharides, acid-soluble monosaccharides, and for starch and cellulose. Most samples yielded positive results for acid-extractable (polymeric) arabinose, fucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose. Amylose was detected in seven of the samples, whereas cellulose was found in only <b>one.</b> <b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> for the relatively high levels of free sugars are suggested in the conclusions to this chapter...|$|R
5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges {{began to}} migrate {{west to the}} steppe near the Lower Dniester. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> of this was that the Roxolani, who were the Iazyges' eastern neighbors, were also {{migrating}} west, due to pressure from the Aorsi, which {{put pressure on the}} Iazyges and forced them to migrate west as well.|$|E
5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of individual organs in animal embryos involves {{the formation of}} tissue-specific stem cells that sustain cell renewal of their own tissue for the lifetime of the organism. Although details of their origin are not always known, tissue-specific stem cells usually share the expression of key transcription factors with cells of the embryonic rudiment from which they arise, and are probably in a similar developmental state. On the other hand, the isolation of pluripotent stem cells from the postnatal organism has encouraged the formulation of models of embryonic and postnatal development that are at variance with the conventional <b>ones.</b> <b>Possible</b> <b>explanations</b> {{for the existence of}} such cells, and the issue of whether they also exist in vivo, are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|<b>One</b> other <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> {{about the}} cause of this {{perception}} of higher attractiveness is [...] "mere familiarity or exposure" [...] (Zajonc, 1968). This means that previously seen stimuli may be perceived more positively than new stimuli. In addition, another explanation comes from the commodity theory (Brock, 1968). According to commodity theory, as people find mates in the bar and leave with them, there is a scarcity of individuals left in the bar. This scarcity increases the desirability and perceived attractiveness of those left in the bar.|$|R
50|$|In the Singtali Formation times (Late Cretaceous-Palaeocene), the Indian craton {{submerged}} {{and stable}} shallow marine conditions ensued. This event is possibly related to flexure, {{such that the}} Spontang ophiolite was obducted onto the Northern Indian Plate margin. <b>One</b> more <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> is related to extensional tectonics, such that India has drifted and detached from Gondwana, and northwards subduction of the Neotethys (Tethys Ocean) beneath Asia occurred. Therefore, the Singtali Formation has been interpreted as pre-collisional transgressive sediments, {{at the same time}} there was a global eustatic sea level rise during the Late Cretaceous.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E
5|$|However some {{properties}} have so {{far gone}} unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which {{may be due to}} unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it loses its electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small dust particles partially corotate with the planet, they will move outward during the shadow pass creating an outward extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain a dip in the particle distribution and ring's brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry <b>one</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA.

It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

5|$|During his exile at Cephellania, Hybrida {{pretended to}} act as {{governor}} of the island which the people secretly allowed. In 49 BC, his nephew, Mark Antony, {{was elected to the}} role of tribune of the people and a legate of Caesar's in Italy. Despite this, Hybrida remained in exile until 47 BC when he returned to Rome at the request of Caesar himself. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> for this is that Mark Antony was indebted to Hybrida; as Hybrida was in exile and had no civil rights, he could not enforce a payment and this suited Mark Antony. Hybrida was a candidate for censorship around 45 BC; his character and support from Mark Antony, however, made his attempt at the position a failure. The final mention of Hybrida during his life comes from Cicero who commented upon Mark Antony's divorce from Antonia Hybrida Major and the insult this conferred upon Hybrida himself.|$|E
5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular momentum. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained azimuthal variations in normal optical depth and width. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> {{is that the}} ring has an azimuthal wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp {{outer edge of the}} δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad component is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
5000|$|An early, {{tenacious}} critic was Karl Popper whose 1934 book Logik der Forschung, {{arriving in}} English in 1959 as The Logic of Scientific Discovery, directly answered verificationism.

[...] And the deductive fallacy of affirming the consequent reveals any phenomenon's capacity to host over <b>one</b> logically <b>possible</b> <b>explanation.</b> Accepting scientific method as hypotheticodeduction, whose inference form is denying the consequent, Popper finds scientific method unable to proceed without falsifiable predictions.

5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. <b>One</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> for this trend is that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and <b>one</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation</b> was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for <b>one</b> <b>possible</b> <b>explanation,</b> but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E

We also examine the portfolio effect on skewness and kurtosis across {{month of the year}} to see if such an anomaly exists. The empirical results support a weak month-of-the-year effect in higher moments of stock returns. Using a complete sample of all possible combinations for each portfolio size, we show that portfolio effect varies across month of the year for both skewness and kurtosis. In particular, our results show that diversification does not necessarily provide benefits to rational investors when the stock return distribution is non-normal, even though portfolio formation can reduce standard deviation. In June, August and October, diversification across industrial sectors results in a more negatively skewed and leptokurtic return distribution, which is not preferred by investors with risk-aversion.
