A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E

500|$|One {{day in the}} mid-1990s, Smith was at {{her home}} talking {{to one of her}} {{daughter}}s on the phone. After telling her mother {{what she was going to}} that night, her daughter asked Smith what her plans for that night were. Because she did not have anything fun planned, Smith lied so her daughter wouldn't have to worry about her. After the conversation ended, Smith realized that she didn't need her own children worrying about her at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> their adult lives and decided that it was time to return to her career. With country artist Marty Stuart (whom she later married in 1997), acting as the album's main producer, Smith signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records in 1996. Although the label preferred her to record an album of duets, Smith decided to go by her own terms and record a solo studio album. In October 1998 she released her second self-titled studio album. Consisting of ten tracks, nine of them were co-written by both Smith and Stuart. Although the album attracted little attention, it was given high critical praise for its traditional and contemporary style. Kurt Wolff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book Country Music: The Rough Guide commented that the album sounded [...] "far gutsier than anything in the Reba and Garth mainstream". Thom Jurek <b>of</b> Allmusic gave <b>the</b> release four out of five stars, calling it [...] "a solid effort", also commenting, [...] "...it stands head and shoulders over most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>that's</b> come out <b>of</b> Nash Vegas in over a decade.

[...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|R

40|$|Este trabalho é um ensaio que se propõe como forma de recepção estética da obra RIO OIR (1976 - 2011), do artista plástico contemporâneo Cildo Meireles. Trata-se de uma escultura sonora condensada num disco de vinil, composto, de um lado, por sons de águas captadas dos rios brasileiros (referente à palavra oir) e, de outro, de sons de risadas humanas (presentes no verbo rir/rio). O amplo processo de realização da obra deu-se por intermédio de uma expedição que percorreu quatro lugares diferentes do Brasil (Estação Ecológica de Águas Emendadas; Foz de Iguaçu; Foz do Rio São Francisco; pororoca do Rio Araguari), com o intuito de realizar a coleta destes sons. A partir desta obra e do documentário Ouvir o Rio (2011), de Marcela Lordy - que nos apresenta o processo de criação e execução da mesma -, iniciamos uma pesquisa acerca da poética do artista, suas escolhas e concepções sobre o trabalho, a partir de textos críticos e de seus depoimentos em entrevistas. O impacto da obra e, posteriormente, do documentário acerca de seu processo, levou a pesquisadora a buscar na Psicologia Social, assim como na Filosofia, na Psicanálise e na Antropologia, e também em suas próprias elaborações e memórias, estofo teórico e experiencial capaz de tornar possível a realização da recepção {{singular}} suscitada pelo contato com os dois trabalhos. Situando-se no universo da arte contemporânea, a autora partiu do campo da percepção e da materialidade da obra, composta por sons de águas e risadas, como abertura para o campo da escuta e da reflexão acerca de certa experiência que se revelou como experiência da finitude. O que a obra apresenta, portanto, pede interpretação, suscita leitura crítica; porém, só é possível realizá-la na medida em que o terreno do pensamento se abre ao não pensado e dele se fertiliza na forma de uma experiência, ou seja, como algo que nos acontece, que exige de nós criação e, portanto, nos transformaThis work is {{an essay}} which is {{intended as a}} form of aesthetic reception of RIO OIR (1976 - 2011), a work by contemporary artist Cildo Meireles. RIO OIR is a sound sculpture condensed in a vinyl record, which has on one side <b>the</b> sounds <b>of</b> waters collected from Brazilian rivers (relating to the word oir) and, on the other side, sounds of human laughter (which appear in the rir/rio verb forms). The extensive execution process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work comprised a expedition through four different locations in Brazil (the Águas Emendadas Ecological Station; Foz do Iguaçu; <b>the</b> mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> São Francisco River; <b>the</b> pororoca <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Araguari River) in order to colect such sounds. Starting with this work and the documentary Ouvir o Rio (Listening to the River) (2011), by director Marcela Lordy, which shows us <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> creation and execution of Meireless work, we started an investigation into the artists poetics, his choices and conceptions about his work, based on critical writings and on his own statements in interviews. <b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work and subsequently <b>of</b> <b>the</b> documentary has led the researcher to seek experiential and theoretical background in Social Psychology, as well as in Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, Anthropology and in her own concoctions and memories, which could facilitate <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> a singular work of reception induced by the contact with both works of art.
