25|$|On {{the third}} day of the hostage crisis, the Beslan siege {{collapsed}} into a bloodbath. After the bloody conclusion of the crisis, Nur-Pashi attempted to escape by disguising himself as a hostage and hiding under an OMON truck. One of the local residents noticed him, at which point he was pulled <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> the truck and almost lynched by an angry mob before being arrested by Russian special forces.|$|E
25|$|Seathwaite Fell is a {{northern}} ridge of Great End in the Scafells. It projects <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> the great northern cliff of its parent, occupying a tongue of land between two tributaries of the River Derwent. These are Styhead Gill {{to the west}} and Grains Gill to the east, the streams meeting at Stockley Bridge below the nose of the fell. Sty Head Gill falls from the walkers' pass at Sty Head, the main pedestrian route from Borrowdale to Wasdale. Near the head of the pass is Styhead Tarn. This in turn is fed by the outflow of Sprinkling Tarn, a beautiful indented pool lying between Seathwaite Fell and Great End. Sprinkling Tarn lies very close to the course of Grains Gill, ensuring that Seathwaite Fell is almost surrounded by water.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

50|$|Walnut Springs Park (also {{known as}} the Walnut Branch Walk) in Seguin, Texas is a network of {{walkways}} and bridges {{along the banks of}} Walnut Branch, a small tributary of the Guadalupe River.

500|$|Olga left Gatchina for {{the first}} time in the early fall of 1888 when the {{imperial}} family visited the Caucasus. On 29 October, their return train approached the small town of Borki at speed. Olga's parents and their four older children were eating lunch in the dining-car when the train lurched violently and came off the rails. The carriage was torn open; the heavy iron roof caved in, and the wheels and floor of the car were sliced off. The Tsar crawled <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> the crushed roof, and held it up with [...] "a Herculean effort" [...] so that the others could escape. There were 21 fatalities. Empress Marie helped tend the wounded, and made makeshift bandages from her own clothes. An official investigation found that the crash was an accident, but it was widely assumed that two bombs had been planted on the line.|$|E

He is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement {{at the start}} of the book, when he is placed under the Imperius Curse by Yaxley, who uses his position to infiltrate the senior ranks of the Ministry. Thicknesse is described as a man with long hair and a beard, which are mostly black but tinged with some grey, along with a great overhanging forehead and glinting eyes. Harry's immediate impression is of [...] "a crab looking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> a rock." ...|$|E
2500|$|Natalie {{began her}} plot to capture Sara {{long before the}} event {{actually}} happened. [...] She was witness {{at a crime scene}} of a car wreck, where she saw Grissom gently stroke Sara's arm; it was then she decided to take her revenge on Grissom for Ernie Dell's death. [...] She managed to buy the wrecked car, and transported it to the desert. She then began making a miniature depicting Sara trapped beneath the car. The model of Sara showed her with her arm sticking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> the car, still moving (there was a motor attached to the arm that she had bought just days before the event).|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} Leeby's nods, Hendry slowly pulled <b>out</b> his boots <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> the table, and sat looking at them, preparatory to putting them on. He was {{beginning}} {{at last to}} be a little scared, though his face did not show it.|$|R
60|$|A sudden {{chorus of}} screams and cries had broken <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the passage <b>beneath,</b> with the {{shouting}} {{of a man}} and the sound of rushing steps. In an instant De Catinat was half-way down the stairs, and was staring in amazement at the scene in the hall beneath.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1867, Private John Randall of Troop G of the 10th Cavalry Regiment was {{assigned}} to escort two civilians on a hunting trip. A band of 70 Cheyenne warriors swept down on them.

Randall scrambled to safety behind a washout under the railroad tracks, where he fended off the attack with only his pistol until help from the nearby camp arrived. The Indians quickly retreated, leaving behind 13 dead warriors. Private Randall suffered a gunshot wound to his shoulder and 11 lance wounds, but recovered. The Cheyenne quickly spread word of this new type of soldier, [...] "who had fought like a cornered buffalo; who like a buffalo had suffered wound after wound, yet had not died; and who like a buffalo had a thick and shaggy mane of hair." ...|$|E

60|$|Carrier had {{resumed his}} {{interesting}} occupation of picking his teeth: his long, thin legs were stretched <b>out</b> before him; <b>from</b> <b>beneath</b> his flaccid lids he shot swift glances upwards, whenever Martin-Roget in his restless pacing crossed and recrossed {{in front of}} the open door. But anon, when the latter came to a halt under the lintel and with his foot almost across the threshold, young LalouÃ«t was upon him in an instant, barring the way to the inner sanctum.|$|R
5000|$|... 1941During the 1941 model year, the 1941 Chrysler Town & Country 4-door 8-passenger {{station wagon}} {{made its debut}} as the first woodie with an all-steel roof.

60|$|She cast a rapid {{glance over}} her shoulder, and {{gathering}} up her silk skirt, drew <b>out,</b> <b>from</b> the pocket <b>beneath,</b> the few crumpled pages, and passed them {{without a word}} to Danton. Lawford kept him plainly in view, as, lowering his great face, he slowly stooped, and holding the loose leaves with both fat hands between his knees, stared into the portrait. Then he truculently lifted his cropped head.|$|R

60|$|Hamel {{sat alone}} upon the terrace, his {{afternoon}} coffee {{on a small}} {{table in front of}} him.

There were several little incidents in connection with their expedition which he scarcely understood.|$|R
60|$|He {{was busy}} for some little time {{scraping}} stones <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the hollow <b>beneath</b> the ledge, {{and then he}} built a rough wall of the larger ones on two sides of it. After that they got Miss Kinnaird there with some difficulty, and when she and the others had crept into the shelter and wrapped the blankets round them, he turned away and stretched himself out beneath the largest stone he could find. For an hour he lay there smoking, and then put his pipe away. He had not much tobacco, {{and it occurred to}} him that he might want the little that remained on the morrow.|$|R

Several odd fish can be found throughout the store, which also react to the flashlights. Preparing to leave the restaurant, Mike can be found with his girlfriend Celia, allowing guests to dunk her in water by using their flashlights to activate her tank.

60|$|Presently I {{came out}} into a wide space, which I knew to be Charing Cross by the statue of Charles the First which stood in the centre of it, and the throat of a street which was {{just in front of}} me must be the Strand.

On one hand was Golden's Hotel, and a crowded mail-coach was dashing <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the arch <b>beneath</b> it, the horn blowing merrily; on the other hand, so I was told by a {{friendly}} man in brown, was Northumberland House, the gloomy grandeur whereof held my eyes for a time.
