5|$|Due to {{the traditions}} that have <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> the film, such as {{anthropomorphic}} animals and easter egg crossovers between movies {{that have been}} spotted by fans, a blog post entitled The Pixar Theory was published in 2013 by Jon Negroni to make the belief {{that all of the}} characters within the Pixar universe were related.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the epidemiology and outcomes of infections <b>occurring</b> <b>within</b> 180  days after HT. Specifically, we aimed to determine risk factors for non-viral infections <b>occurring</b> <b>within</b> 8, 30 and 180  days following HT.|$|R

25|$|Early PTS {{occur at}} least once in about 4 or 5% of people hospitalized with TBI, and late PTS occur at some point in 5% of them. Of the {{seizures}} that <b>occur</b> <b>within</b> the first week of trauma, about half <b>occur</b> <b>within</b> the first 24 hours. In children, early seizures are more likely to <b>occur</b> <b>within</b> an hour and a day of injury than in adults. Of the seizures that <b>occur</b> <b>within</b> the first four weeks of head trauma, about 10% occur after the first week. Late seizures occur at the highest rate in the first few weeks after injury. About 40% of late seizures start within six months of injury, and 50% start within a year.|$|R
5|$|Security {{concerns}} {{were brought up}} by the public when two incidents of vandalism at train depots <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> two years. In both incidents, graffiti on the affected trains were discovered after they entered revenue service.|$|E
5|$|The Cologne War (1583–88) {{devastated the}} Electorate of Cologne, a {{historical}} ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire, within present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, in Germany. The war <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> {{the context of}} the Protestant Reformation in Germany and the subsequent Counter-Reformation, and concurrently with the Dutch Revolt and the French Wars of Religion.|$|E

5|$|The seasons column {{lists the}} first year of the season of the player's first game and the last year of the season of the player's last game. For example, a player who played one game in the 1996–97 IHL season would be listed as playing with the team from 1996 to 1997, {{regardless}} of what calendar year the game <b>occurred</b> <b>within.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of a weak–moderate La Niña episode, most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that developed}} within the season <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> the Coral Sea. The weak La Nina conditions also affected {{the amount of}} tropical cyclones {{that occurred during the}} year, with only 5 tropical cyclones occurring within the basin. During December 24, Tropical Cyclone Gertie moved into the basin from the Australian region, before it passed to the south of New Caledonia and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> {{a few hours}} of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{the father}} of the child is the husband of the teenage girl. The {{conception}} may <b>occur</b> <b>within</b> wedlock, or the pregnancy itself may precipitate the marriage (the so-called shotgun wedding). In countries such as India, the majority of teenage births <b>occur</b> <b>within</b> marriage.|$|R

5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing {{capillaries}} and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{aftershocks}} {{occurred after}} the main tremor. The first four (of magnitude 2.8, 2.2, 4.2 and 3.4) <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> 12hours {{of the main}} shock. A 2.5-magnitude shock occurred just after midnight on August 25, followed at 05:07 UTC by the strongest, a magnitude 4.5 aftershock that woke many residents in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C., and was felt {{as far away as}} New England, Georgia, and Illinois.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, Crook's brigade {{searched for}} Heth's {{infantry}} again, but Heth withdrew to the mountains. On the same day, Colonel William M. Bolles {{resigned from the}} 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry. In the following months, three officers were promoted. Lieutenant Colonel Paxton was promoted to colonel during July. During August, Major Rollin L. Curtis was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and Captain William H. Powell was promoted to major. Additional promotions <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> the companies.|$|E

5|$|On March 12, Morgan {{scored a}} hat-trick against Rodez to lead Lyon to a 6–0 win and {{advance to the}} semi-finals of the French Cup. She scored four goals and {{recorded}} two assists during the semifinal against Hénin-Beaumont (three of the four <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> a ten-minute span). Lyon won the Cup after a penalty shootout on May 19. Morgan did not play during the French Cup final due to a lingering hamstring injury suffered during a match against Paris Saint-Germain.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday May 8, 1997, at 21:42 UTC, BeppoSAX's Gamma Ray Burst Monitor {{registered}} a gamma-ray burst {{that lasted}} approximately 15seconds. It was also detected by Ulysses, a robotic space probe designed {{to study the}} Sun, and by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The burst also <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> {{the field of view}} of one of BeppoSAX's two X-ray Wide Field Cameras. Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team localized the burst to an error box—a small area around the specific position to account for the error in the position—with a diameter of approximately 10arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|River {{development}} <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> {{the structure}} of the 1909 International Boundary Waters Treaty between the US and Canada. The United States Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925, which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Power Commission to explore the development of the nation's rivers. This prompted agencies to conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development; the reports produced by various agencies were presented in House Document308. Those reports, and subsequent related reports, are referred to as 308 Reports.|$|E
50|$|Pomatostomus temporalis temporalis - This {{subspecies}} <b>occurs</b> <b>within</b> Australia in {{the states}} of Victoria, eastern Queensland (including Cape York), New South Wales and south-eastern South Australia. It is a vagrant or accidental visitor to the Australian Capital Territory. It is also the subspecies believed to <b>occur</b> <b>within</b> New Guinea.|$|R

5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of {{nothing of the sort}} having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> the game.|$|E
5|$|The 1868 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was among the}} quietest on record, with only four tropical cyclones recorded. Only three seasons had fewer storms than in 1868, and seven had {{the same number of}} storms. Initially, there were no known storms during the season, although a re-analysis confirmed the activity. All tropical activity <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> a 45‑day span. There may have been other unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Corydon {{was a minor}} {{engagement}} {{that took}} place July 9, 1863, just south of Corydon, which had been the original capital of Indiana until 1825, and was the county seat of Harrison County. The attack occurred during Morgan's Raid in the American Civil War as a force of 2,500 cavalry invaded the North {{in support of the}} Tullahoma Campaign. It was the only pitched battle of the Civil War that occurred in Indiana, and no battle has <b>occurred</b> <b>within</b> Indiana since.|$|E
