40|$|We study a coupling/decoupling method {{between a}} superconducting qubit and a <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> {{that uses a}} {{controllable}} time-dependent electromagnetic field (TDEF). As in recent experiments, the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> can be either an LC circuit or a cavity field. When the qubit and the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> are initially fabricated, their detuning should be made far larger than their coupling constant, so these can be treated as two independent subsystems. However, if a TDEF {{is applied to the}} qubit, then a "dressed qubit" (i. e., qubit plus the electromagnetic field) can be formed. By choosing appropriate parameters for the TDEF, the dressed qubit can be coupled to the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> and, thus, the qubit and the <b>data</b> <b>bus</b> can exchange information {{with the assistance of the}} TDEF. This mechanism allows the scalability of the circuit to many qubits. With the help of the TDEF, any two qubits can be selectively coupled to (and decoupled from) a common <b>data</b> <b>bus.</b> Therefore, quantum information can be transferred from one qubit to another.
