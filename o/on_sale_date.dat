[...] "My most extreme act of self-censoring in Imperial Bedrooms," [...] he said, however, was to omit a three-line description of a silver wall, because he felt that Clay would never have written it. Ellis stated he had no plans to make changes to the book as it stands in a second edition. Months prior to the book's release, Ellis tweeted the first sentence of the novel, [...] "They had made a movie about us."

Calves were assigned randomly to treatment as a completely randomized design. On d 2, 1 d restricted and 1 d ad libitum treatments were transported 150 km to UNL ARDC feedlot near Mead, Nebraska. 0 d treatment remained at the Dalbey-Halleck Research Unit. All treatments were allowed free choice grass hay and water. At 0800 on d 3, 0 d treatment was loaded into trailers and transported to the ARDC feedlot. At 0800 on d 3, 1 d restricted treatment was withheld from grass hay and water. At 1000 on d 3, all calves were co-mingled and processed to obtain a sale BW. The mixed procedures of SAS were used for statistical analysis, with steer as the experimental unit.
