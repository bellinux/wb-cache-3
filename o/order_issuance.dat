40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} executive <b>order</b> <b>issuance</b> on {{the separation of powers}} among the executive and legislative branches—particularly in the realm of foreign affairs. It concludes that judicial vagueness and avoidance regarding presidential directives has resulted in increased Executive authority. The aggrandizement of presidential powers in foreign affairs is revealed through examples from both the Bush and the Obama Administrations. By reviewing landmark U. S. Supreme Court cases, such as United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp. (1936) and Youngstown Sheet 2 ̆ 6 Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the paper examines the traditional framework of the Court regarding presidential direct action and the distribution of power in the federal government...|$|E
40|$|Executive {{orders are}} a {{significant}} source of presidential power although scholars disagree on the nature of that power. It has been argued that executive orders are an indication of a president's failure to persuade others to act as he desires; others contend that executive orders offer "power without persuasion. " This dissertation introduces the conditional model of executive <b>order</b> <b>issuance</b> and duration in order to offer a synthesis to these competing views, and to offer {{a better understanding of the}} opportunities and constraints faced by the president when choosing to act unilaterally through executive orders. The conditional theory holds that both the issuance and duration of executive orders is a function of the president's ideological proximity to Congress and the Supreme Court, and the availability of fresh policy space...|$|E

40|$|As long as {{governmental}} institutions have existed, {{efforts have been}} undertaken to reform them. This research examines a particular strategy, coercive controls, exercised through a particular instrument, executive orders, by a singular reformer, {{the president of the}} United States. The presidents studied- Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton-are those whose campaigns for office were characterized to varying degrees as against Washington bureaucracy and for executive reform. Executive <b>order</b> <b>issuance</b> is assessed through an examination of key factors for each president including political party affiliation, levels of political capital, and legislative experience. A classification typology is used to identify the topical dimensions and levels of coerciveness. The portrayal of the federal government is analyzed through examination of public, media, and presidential attention. The results show that executive orders are significant management tools for the president. Executive orders also represent {{an important component of the}} transition plans for incoming administrations. The findings indicate that overall, while executive orders have not increased in the aggregate, they are more intrusive and significant. When the factors of political party affiliation, political capital, and legislative experience are examined, it reveals a strong relationship between executive orders and previous executive experience, specifically presidents who served as a state governor prior to winning national election as president. Presidents Carter, Reagan, and Clinton (all former governors) have the highest percent of executive orders focusing on the federal bureaucracy. Additionally, the highest percent of forceful orders were issued by former governors (41. 0 %) as compared to their presidential counterparts who have not served as governors (19. 9 %). Secondly, political party affiliation is an important, but not significant, predictor for the use of executive orders. Thirdly, management strategies that provide the president with the greatest level of autonomy-executive orders redefine the concept of presidential power and autonomous action. Interviews of elite government officials and political observers support the idea that executive orders can provide the president with a successful management strategy, requiring less expenditure of political resources, less risk to political capital, and a way of achieving objectives without depending on an unresponsive Congress...|$|E

The Office rejected such claims and declined to patent them, but the CCPA repeatedly reversed the Office's rulings and <b>ordered</b> the <b>issuance</b> of patents. The Office's position was hampered during the 1960s by the uncertainty over whether the Supreme Court could review decisions of the CCPA, because it was unclear whether it was an Article I or Article III court.

Additionally, fifteen Democratic state attorneys general released a joint statement calling the executive order [...] "unconstitutional, un-American and unlawful", and that [...] "we'll work together to fight it".In response to the lawsuits the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement on January 29 that it would continue to enforce the executive order and that [...] "prohibited travel will remain prohibited". On the same day a White House spokesperson said that the rulings did not undercut the executive order. On January 30 Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover pending the confirmation of Trump's nominee barred the Justice Department from defending the executive order in court; She said she felt the order's effects were not in keeping [...] "with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek justice and stand for what is right". After Yates spoke against Trump's refugee ban Trump quickly relieved her of her duties calling her statement a [...] "betrayal" [...] to the Department of Justice. He replaced her with Dana J. Boente the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. This leadership alteration was referred to, by some, as [...] "the Monday Night Massacre".The state of Washington filed a legal challenge, State of Washington v. Trump, against the executive order; Minnesota later joined the case. On February 3 District Judge James Robart of the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington presiding in Washington v. Trump issued a ruling temporarily blocking major portions of the executive order; he said that the plaintiffs had [...] "demonstrated immediate and irreparable injury", and were likely to succeed in their challenge to the federal defendants. Robart explicitly wrote his judgment to apply nationwide. In response to Robart's ruling the Department of Homeland Security said on February 4 that it had stopped enforcing the executive order, while the State Department reinstated visas that had been previously suspended.|$|R
