25|$|In 2006 One Day Cricket in England {{was given}} a major revamp by the ECB. This led to quite a few changes for day/night cricket in England. For the first time Day/Night matches were played in the than known C Trophy {{although}} as in the Twenty20 Cup matches were limited to the counties who owned paramount floodlights who were joined by Hampshire in becoming the fifth county to install paramount floodlights at the Rose Bowl. Also 2006 saw {{the launch of the}} NatWest Pro40 League which replaced the National League however under the new format the counties only played other once in their divisions as opposed to home and away. This meant that the number of day/night matches played in the competition was reduced because the counties had fewer home matches to play with. The story stayed the same for 2007 but for <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>On</b> 10 September 2007, ten years after the first day/night matches were played in England Lord's finally got to stage its first game under floodlights with a match between Middlesex and Derbyshire, a match which Middlesex won by 4 wickets.|$|E
25|$|The narcissistic manager {{will have}} two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate – status symbols like company cars, company-issued {{smartphone}} or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates. Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries. The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective decisions; while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to their potential for attention-gaining for the manager themself. Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate narcissism. He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as Al Dunlap and Robert Allen) who, he suggests, literally have only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> their minds: profits. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} been {{described}} as a [...] "slick repackaging" [...] of the Law of Attraction, a concept originating in the New Thought ideas of the late 19th century. In producing the film, the law was intentionally [...] "packaged" [...] with a focus on [...] "wealth enhancement" [...] — differing from the more spiritual orientation of the New Thought Movement. One of the film's backers stated, [...] "we desired to hit the masses, and money is the number <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> the masses' minds". A review in salon.com described the packaging of the products related to the film as having [...] "a look... that conjures a 'Da Vinci Code' aesthetic, full of pretty faux parchment, quill-and-ink fonts and wax seals.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{activity}} of the New Left became Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War as conducted by liberal President Lyndon Johnson. The anti-war movement escalated the rhetorical heat, as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came in sustained protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Liberals fought back, with Zbigniew Brzezinski, chief foreign policy advisor of the 1968 Humphrey campaign, saying the New Left [...] "threatened American liberalism" [...] in a manner reminiscent of McCarthyism. While the New Left considered Humphrey a war criminal, Nixon attacked him as the New Left's enabler—a man with [...] "a personal attitude of indulgence and permissiveness toward the lawless". Beinart concludes that [...] "with the country divided against itself, contempt for Hubert Humphrey was the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> which left and right could agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{division}} of Germany after 1949 looking increasingly permanent, there were practical and legal disputes over which Germany should inherit those German brand names from before the war that still conferred value {{in the eyes of}} consumers. [...] One particularly bitter dispute concerned the BMW brand. [...] Another concerned the national airline, known till 1945 as Deutsche Luft Hansa. [...] Directly {{after the end of the}} Second World War, <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> which the Soviet Union and the United States were able to agree was that no new German state should be permitted to operate an airline. [...] The military implications of a German state having access to a permanent pool of trained pilots and air industry expertise were uppermost in the minds of politicians. [...] However, geo-political priorities moved on, and in 1953 Lufthansa was founded, a West German airline with its primary hub reassuringly located next door to a massive US airbase south of Frankfurt am Main. [...] In 1955 the East German government responded, staking a claim to the [...] "Lufthansa" [...] brand by creating Deutsche Lufthansa. [...] Since the Lufthansa name had already been registered by the West German airline, the East German entity faced a succession of lawsuits and was, in the meantime, not able to register as a member of the International Air Transport Association. [...] Eventually it would be rebranded as Interflug. [...] In the meantime, reflecting the intensely political nature of the airline business, when Deutsche Lufthansa was created in 1955 it made sense that its Director in Chief should be the son of the aging East German President. [...] On 1 July 1955 Arthur Pieck, who had no experience of flying or of the airline business, was appointed [...] "Hauptdirektor" [...] of the national airline.|$|E

2500|$|In 1949 Munschke {{switched}} from local government to national government {{when he took}} a position working for the Party Central Committee, again becoming head of the critical personnel department. By 1952 the government and their allies were looking to create an East German Kasernierte Volkspolizei (People's Police in Barracks), a quasi-military police service which is seen, in retrospect, as a precursor to the establishment in 1956 of an East German army. <b>One</b> <b>thing</b> <b>on</b> which the Soviets and their western allies had agreed back in 1945 was that Germany should not have its own army, but after the establishment in 1949 of the German Democratic Republic and the de facto division of what remained of Germany into two separate states, each in one of two competing military alliances, and both German states accommodating several hundred thousand fraternal troops from (respectively) the United States and the Soviet Union, perceived priorities had changed. [...] Both side were quietly preparing to re-introduce national armies into their versions of post-war Germany. In the late summer of 1952 Eward Munschke was surprised to find himself being interviewed by the East German leader, Walter Ulbricht himself. On 1 October 1952, despite never having held any military rank in any national army, Munschke was promoted to the (police) rank of major general, with the job of [...] "Kaderchef", tasked by Ulbricht to select capable and suitable young men ("befähigte und geeignete junge Männer auszuwählen ...") for the new quasi-military police brigade. Munschke's record in the Spanish Civil War and as a resistance operative in the Netherlands during the war, together with his never-questioned loyalty to his country's Communist status quo, had evidently impressed Ulbricht, and he stayed in the post of [...] "Kaderchef" [...] to which he had been appointed by the leader for five years. [...] The position went with a government job as Chief of Cadre administration ( [...] Chef der Verwaltung Kader) in the [...] which was the government department responsible for the police. [...] The National People's Army (NVA / Nationale Volksarmee) was formally founded on 1 March 1956, and this was also the date on which Ewald Munschke was appointed Deputy Minister for National Defence, and the country's first Head of Personnel Administration with the Ministry for National Defence (Chef der Verwaltung Kader beim Ministerium für Nationale Verteidigung). It was largely on the basis of Munschke's approach that the new East German officer class was drawn almost exclusively from the industrial and agricultural working classes.|$|E
