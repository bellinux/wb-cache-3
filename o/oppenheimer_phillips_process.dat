5|$|Oppenheimer {{worked with}} his first {{doctoral}} student, Melba Phillips, on calculations of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by deuterons. When Ernest Lawrence and Edwin McMillan bombarded nuclei with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of George Gamow, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, <b>Oppenheimer</b> and <b>Phillips</b> worked out a theory {{now known as the}} Oppenheimer–Phillips process to explain the results, a theory still in use today.|$|R

50|$|Electrochemical {{fluorination}} (ECF), or electrofluorination, is a foundational organofluorine chemistry {{method for}} {{the preparation of}} fluorocarbon-based organofluorine compounds. The general approach represents an application of electrosynthesis. The fluorinated chemical compounds produced by ECF are useful because of their distinctive solvation properties and the relative inertness of carbon-fluorine bonds. Two ECF synthesis routes are commercialized and commonly applied: the Simons <b>process</b> and the <b>Phillips</b> Petroleum <b>process.</b> It is also possible to electrofluorinate in various organic media. Prior {{to the development of}} these methods, fluorination with fluorine, a dangerous oxidant, was a dangerous and wasteful process. Also, ECF can be cost-effective but it may also result in low yields.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) for 15 OECD economies from 1990 to 2012 using an iterative <b>Phillips</b> curve <b>process</b> and tests {{the relationship between}} strictness of employment protection and the NAIRU. A possible negative externality of employment protection legislation is {{a higher level of}} structural unemployment. Using Prais-winsten estimation correcting for panel-level heteroscedasticity a panel-specific first-order autoregressive process, results indicate that there is no relationship between strictness of protection for individual and collective dismissals for regular contracts and the NAIRU. The effect of strictness of employment protection for regular contracts is sensitive to model specification; the coefficient loses its significance when full controls are used in estimation. An implication is that deregulation is not a necessary policy tool in addressing the problem of structural unemployment. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1914, Augustus E. Phillips {{established}} the company's first seafood processing plant on Hooper's Island in Maryland’s Chesapeake Bay. The A.E. <b>Phillips</b> packing plant <b>processed</b> seafood {{from many of}} the watermen in the region. In 1956, after a surplus season of crabs, son Brice Phillips and wife Shirley opened the first “crab shack” in Ocean City, Maryland. Brice and Shirley began building a new dining room each year at Phillips Crab House until it finally seated 1400 people.|$|R

50|$|A trade {{study or}} {{trade-off}} {{study is the}} activity of a multidisciplinary team to identify the most balanced technical solutions among a set of proposed viable solutions (FAA 2006). These viable solutions are judged by their satisfaction {{of a series of}} measures or cost functions. These measures describe the desirable characteristics of a solution. They may be conflicting or even mutually exclusive. Trade studies are commonly used in the design of aerospace and automotive vehicles and the software selection <b>process</b> (<b>Phillips</b> et al. 2002) to find the configuration that best meets conflicting performance requirements.|$|R
5000|$|In summer 2003 {{the band}} retreated to Austin Texas {{to write and}} record demos for their second {{full-length}} [...] "This May Be The Year I Disappear" [...] {{with the help of}} producer and friend Rory <b>Phillips,</b> a <b>process</b> that would take almost eight months, due to recording setbacks and producer shifts. The band moved to Los Angeles and recorded, then scrapped an entire album of material with Linkin Park producer, Don Gilmore at NRG Studios in North Hollywood. According to the band's A&R and label, the recordings weren't up to par with the original demos recorded by the band months earlier, so the band headed back to Rory Phillip's studio in Austin Texas to proceed recording. They recorded a few new songs and had them mixed, along with a handful of the original demos, by Andy Wallace. This May Be the Year I Disappear was released in October 2004. The album marked a significant change in sound, with the band moving away from their signature post-hardcore sound and toward a pop rock sound, polarizing many of the band's fans.|$|R
5000|$|The British {{established}} a colony in Sydney Cove in January 1788 after the First Fleet sailed 9 months from Portsmouth. The {{early years of}} the colony suffered from a sense of provisionality and the attitude of the majority of convicts and their guardians that they would return to Britain once they had [...] "done their time." [...] The colony was poorly equipped, had little food supplies, and did not understand the climate or soil. For its first two years it faced starvation. In 1790, Governor <b>Phillip</b> began the <b>process</b> of freeing convicts and granting them land, such as that at Rose Hill 20 km inland which provided a stable food supply to the colony.|$|R
30|$|Some {{individuals}} in the sample have unobserved wages (i.e., the individual's labor supply is zero). This constitutes a problem because the estimation method used requires numerical values for all individuals. This situation is often handled by replacing the unobserved wages with predictions based on observable wages (controlling for sample selection). 9 Replacing missing wages with predicted wages {{has the effect of}} introducing two distinct distributions of wages depending on whether individuals are observed to be working or not. Ignoring this issue makes the statistical specification of the likelihood function misspecified, as illustrated by MaCurdy et al. (1990). An alternative would be to replace both observed and unobserved wages with predicted wages (e.g., Meghir and <b>Phillips,</b> 2010). This <b>process</b> makes the statistical specification correct, but it causes the budget set to be misspecified for all individuals because it is based on predicted rather than observed wages.|$|R
30|$|Our meta-analyses also {{revealed}} significant moderators of fungal species richness response to fire. Although quantifying disturbance-driven changes in fungal species richness is valuable from a biodiversity perspective, {{it is perhaps}} more important to quantify specifically how the structure of soil fungal communities change in response to disturbance. For instance, although Chen and Cairney (2002) found that overall fungal species richness did not change post fire, they found that species assemblages changed from mainly ECM to AM fungi, with possible commensurate changes in nutrient cycling <b>processes</b> (<b>Phillips</b> et al. 2013). Furthermore, our analyses suggest that mycorrhizal colonization following fire is driven mainly by indirect, post-fire environmental changes rather than the direct effects of fire-induced fungal mortality. This finding suggests that resource managers {{may be able to}} manipulate site conditions post fire to make them more conducive to post-fire mycorrhizal colonization of new plant propagules. Nevertheless, small sample sizes and underrepresented taxa, biomes, and fire types limit the inferential power of our conclusions from both meta-analyses. Further studies of fire effects on fungi in novel environments, targeting underrepresented fungal guilds and life stages, are needed to comprehensively assess the role of fire in shaping soil fungal communities. Additionally, we recommend that future studies document burn severity (e.g., dNBR; Miller and Thode 2007), as well as other important fire characteristics (e.g., fire weather, fuel moisture), to provide the necessary context for improving our mechanistic understanding of the role of fire in sustaining soil fungal communities and the ecosystems they support.|$|R
