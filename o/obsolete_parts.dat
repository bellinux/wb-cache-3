40|$|A {{key driver}} of {{software}} obsolescence is change in hardware and system software standards. In {{the area of}} software tools, there is now great pressure to host on Intel/Windows platforms tool functions {{that in the past}} were typically found in Unix or mainframe environments. In such cases, there can be value in reusing core parts of such legacy systems. Two standard methods for doing this are reengineering and wrapping. Reengineering, being unrestricted in the changes allowed, permits the removal of <b>obsolete</b> <b>parts</b> of a system but creates the risk that changes will break the complex and brittle reused code. Wrapping involves the reuse of existing code without change, but at the cost of including obsolete elements into the new environment. In this paper we propose unwrapping as a new synthesis of these two approaches. To unwrap is to remove unwanted design elements, but with a strong emphasis on leaving core code unchanged. We discuss our preliminary use of this approach to reuse core eleme [...] ...|$|E
40|$|As {{the pace}} of {{technological}} progress increases, technology obsolescence problems will have a greater effect on traditionally sustainment-dominated industries. Many organizations rely solely on reactive approaches to manage obsolescence events as they occur, often employing lifetime buys, aftermarket sources and other mitigation approaches {{to ensure that they}} have enough parts to last through the system’s lifecycle. Strategically planned design refreshes coupled with various mitigation approaches can, in many cases, lead to greater cost avoidance than reactive mitigation alone. Design refresh planning is performed by organizations that wish to avoid the high costs of purely reactive obsolescence solutions. Planning to phase-out specific parts at certain times lessens the reliance on reactive solutions (and the resulting quest for <b>obsolete</b> <b>parts)</b> and, in turn, lessens the total cost of sustaining a system. However, design refreshing solely to manage obsolescence is not practical for many systems, and therefore, obsolescence management refresh activities need to be coordinated with the technology insertion roadmap.

40|$|The {{business}} of supporting legacy electronic systems is challenging due to mismatches between the system support {{life and the}} procurement lives of the systems' constituent components. Legacy electronic systems are threatened with Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) -type obsolescence, {{and the extent of}} their system support lives based on existing replenishable and non-replenishable resources may be unknown. This thesis describes the development of the End of Repair/End of Maintenance (EOR/EOM) model, which is a stochastic discrete-event simulation that follows the life history of a population of parts and cards and operates from time-to-failure distributions that are either user-defined, or synthesized from observed failures to date. The model determines the support life (and support costs) of the system based on existing inventories of spare parts and cards, and optionally harvesting parts from existing cards to further extend the life of the system. The model includes: part inventory segregation, modeling of part inventory degradation and periodic inventory inspections, and design refresh planning. A case study using a real legacy system comprised of 117, 000 instances of 70 unique cards and 4. 5 million unique parts is presented. The case study was used to evaluate the system support life (and support costs) through a series of different scenarios: <b>obsolete</b> <b>parts</b> with no failure history and never failing, <b>obsolete</b> <b>parts</b> with no failure history but immediately incurring their first failures with and without the use of part harvesting. The case study also includes analyses for recording subsequent EOM and EOR dates, sensitivity analyses for selected design refreshes that maximize system sustainment, and design refresh planning to ensure system sustainment to an end of support date. Lifetime buys refer to buying enough parts from the original manufacturer prior to the part's discontinuance in order to support all forecasted future part needs throughout the system's required support life. This thesis describes the development of the Lifetime Buy (LTB) model, a reverse-application of the EOR/EOM model, that follows the life history of an electronic system and determines the number of spares required to ensure system sustainment. The LTB model can generate optimum lifetime buy quantities of parts that minimizes the total life-cycle cost associated with the estimated lifetime buy quantity...|$|E
40|$|The {{contact system}} was {{originally}} {{identified as an}} <b>obsolete</b> <b>part</b> of the coagulation system, {{but it has been}} repeatedly implicated in inflammatory states, such as infection, as well as in allergic- and chronic inflammatory disease. Under these conditions, there is surprisingly little evidence that factor XII (FXII) acts as a coagulation factor, and its activity appears to be mainly directed toward activation of the kallikrein-kinin system. The contact system factors interact with pathogens as well as cells of the (innate) immune system on several levels. Among others, these cells may provide negatively charged surfaces that contribute to contact activation as well as release enzymes that feed into this system. Furthermore, cellular receptors have been identified that bind contact factors at sites of inflammation. Based on the accumulated evidence, we propose a model for enzymatic crosstalk between inflammatory cells and the plasma contact system. During these reactions, FXII is enzymatically cleaved by non-contact system enzymes. This generates unactivated FXII fragments that can subsequently be rapidly activated in the fluid phase. The resulting enzyme lacks procoagulant properties, but retains its pro-inflammatory characteristic as a prekallikrein activator...|$|R

40|$|The key to any {{sustainable}} {{presence in}} space {{is the ability}} to manufacture necessary tools, parts, structures, spares, etc. in situ and on demand. Cost, volume, and up-mass constraints prohibit launching everything needed for long-duration or long-distance missions from Earth, including spare parts and replacement systems. There are many benefits to building items as-needed in situ using computer aided drafting (CAD) models and additive manufacturing technology: (1) Cost, up-mass, and volume savings for launch due to the ability to manufacture specific parts when needed. (2) CAD models can be generated on Earth and transmitted to the station or spacecraft, or they can be designed in situ for any task. Thus, multiple people in many locations can work on a single problem. (3) Items can be produced that will enhance the safety of crew and vehicles (e. g., latches or guards). (4) Items can be produced on-demand in a small amount of time (i. e., hours or days) compared to traditional manufacturing methods and, therefore, would not require the lengthy amount of time needed to machine the part from a solid block of material nor the wait time required if the part had to be launched from Earth. (5) Used and <b>obsolete</b> <b>parts</b> can be recycled into powder or wire feedstock for use in later manufacturing. (6) Ultimately, the ability to produce items as-needed will reduce mission risk, as one will have everything they need to fix a broken system or fashion a new part making it available on a more timely basis...|$|E
40|$|Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed compartments, {{filled with}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for the {{degradation}} of macromolecules. Proteins and other substrates are delivered to the lysosomes by various pathways including endocytosis, and autophagy, a pathway utilized by the cell for the disposal of <b>obsolete</b> <b>parts.</b> Many steps are necessary for the correct synthesis and processing of lysosomal enzymes. Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are caused by genetic defects that affect the synthesis or processing of lysosomal hydrolases. Therefore, a lysosomal disorder can {{be due to a}} defect in a specific hydrolase, by deficiencies in activator proteins, in the receptors or in the trafficking of enzymes. The EUCLYD consortium will be focusing on four specific LSDs, namely Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) and Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD), as prototypes of disorders with different stored materials in various organs and tissues outside the CNS. The issues to be investigated in the proposed project are: i. pathophysiology and mechanisms underlying the symptoms and leading to devastating clinical consequences; ii. natural history, and iii. testing of novel therapeutic approaches. These issues will be addressed by patients studies and with animal models recapitulating the phenotype of LSDs. Recent advances in the pathophysiology of LSDs point to the role of secondary processes triggered by substrate storage. A better understanding of these processes is crucial to identify new targets of therapy. Enzyme replacement and substrate reduction therapies were successfully introduced in the treatment of specific LSDs. However, pilot clinical trials should be supported by post-marketing studies to further assess the efficacy of these therapies and to develop standardized treatment protocols. To this purpose, a precise knowledge of the natural history of LSDs is essential. Novel therapeutic strategies, such as enzyme enhancement and gene therapy, are still under investigation in cell systems and in animal models. EUCLYD will provide further testing of these approaches in order to translate state-of-the-art knowledge into clinical applications and reach patient’s bedside...|$|E
