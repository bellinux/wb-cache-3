5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing),</b> but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of fossils of extinct species was explained by theories such as catastrophism. Catastrophism claimed that {{animals and plants}} were periodically annihilated {{as a result of}} natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ex nihilo (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing).</b> The extinct organisms could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be immutable.|$|E

25|$|Leibniz {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the I Ching through his contact with the French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet, who visited China in 1685 as a missionary. Leibniz saw the I Ching hexagrams as an affirmation of the universality of his own religious beliefs as a Christian. Binary numerals were central to Leibniz's theology. He believed that binary numbers were symbolic of the Christian idea of creatio ex nihilo or creation <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E

25|$|Jainism {{does not}} support belief in a creator deity. According to Jain doctrine, the {{universe}} and its constituents—soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion—have always existed. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws. It {{is not possible to}} create matter <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of conservation of mass). Jain text claims that the universe consists of jiva (life force or souls) and ajiva (lifeless objects). The soul of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.|$|E
25|$|Pedro's {{decision}} {{to defy the}} Cortes was met with armed opposition across Brazil by troops loyal to Portugal. The ensuing Brazilian War of Independence spread {{throughout most of the}} country, with battles fought in the northern, northeastern, and southern regions. The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824, and independence was recognized by Portugal on 29 August 1825. In addition to those Brazilians and Portuguese who fought in the war, much of the credit for this victory is credited to Bonifácio's cabinet. It created an army and a navy practically <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing,</b> greatly improved government finances, and unified the provinces under a single, cohesive leadership.|$|E

In 1989 he was ordained bishop of Abuja and in 1997 archbishop of Province III of the Church of Nigeria, consisting of the northern dioceses of Nigeria. On February 22, 2000, he was elected primate of the Church of Nigeria, the second biggest church in the Anglican Communion, then numbering 18 million members.

25|$|The {{idea that}} God created the world <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> (creatio ex nihilo) is central today to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism – indeed, the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides {{felt it was}} the only concept that the three {{religions}} shared – yet it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible. The Priestly authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function. This was still the situation in the early 2nd century AD, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God; {{by the beginning of the}} 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation ex nihilo had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage {{performances}} were {{heavily influenced by}} orality. Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it [...] "better to say things as they are, than to create events <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing,</b> which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth". After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre—inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes—could be developed. Allah jang Palsoe {{was intended to be}} the first published stage play in this new tradition.|$|E

[...] He was highly critical of contemporary writers who relied more on their fantasies than logic and truth. [...] Hoping to keep his story grounded in reality, Kwee researched {{the history of the}} Baduy, the geological formation of Krakatoa, and the events of 1883 and 1928; in total he consulted 15 books, all in English or Dutch. Writing began on 19 March 1928 and was completed on 28 May of that year. Drama dari Krakatau consists of sixteen chapters, which were spread over 125 pages in the first printing.|$|E
500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast.

The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director he knows how to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making a big deal <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing.</b> [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E
500|$|For {{decades the}} Roman Catholic Church avoided {{official}} refutation of evolution. However, it would rein in Catholics who proposed that evolution could {{be reconciled with}} the Bible, as this conflicted with the First Vatican Council's (1869–70) finding that everything was created <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> by God, and to deny that finding could lead to excommunication. In 1950, the encyclical Humani generis of Pope Pius XII first mentioned evolution directly and officially. It allowed one to enquire into the concept of humans coming from pre-existing living matter, but not to question Adam and Eve or {{the creation of the}} soul. In 1996, Pope John Paul II said that evolution is [...] "more than a hypothesis" [...] and acknowledged the large body of work accumulated in its support, but reiterated that any attempt to give a material explanation of the human soul is [...] "incompatible with the truth about man." [...] Pope Benedict XVI has reiterated the conviction that human beings [...] "are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution. Each of us {{is the result of a}} thought of God. Each of us is willed, each of us is loved, each of us is necessary." [...] At the same time, he has promoted the study of the relationship between the concepts of creation and evolution, based on the conviction that there cannot be a contradiction between faith and reason. Along these lines, the research project Thomistic Evolution, run by a team of Dominican scholars, endeavours to reconcile the scientific evidence on evolution with the teaching of Thomas Aquinas.|$|E
500|$|In The Fountain, the Tree of Life was {{a central}} design {{and part of the}} film's three periods. The tree was based on Kabbalah's Sefirot, which depicts a [...] "map" [...] of {{creation}} {{to understand the nature of}} God and how he created the world ex nihilo (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>nothing).</b> The Sefirot Tree, being two to three hundred feet tall in lore, had to be resized for The Fountain to fit in the camera's frame. Pieces of driftwood and pieces from real trees in Canada were collected for the tree's branches and roots, and sculpted molds of the pieces were applied to a steel frame to create the tree's body. According to production designer James Chinlund, the tree, part of an enormous set surrounded by green screens, and other sets presented difficult logistical problems because of the small budget given to the resurrected project. The tree set itself had been a collaboration between Chinlund, Aronofsky, and cinematographer Matthew Libatique to create the appropriate design, particularly the palette in comparison to the biospheric ship that carries the tree in the astronaut period. Aronofsky described the astronaut period as a homage to David Bowie's [...] "Space Oddity"; the protagonist's name [...] "Tom" [...] originating from the Major Tom of the popular song. Co-writer Ari Handel researched biospherics, such as the Biosphere 2, to help design the ship that carried the protagonist and the tree through space. With respect to the glass-sphered ship's design, Aronofsky argued, [...] "There is no reason a spaceship would be built like a giant truck in space." ...|$|E
