5|$|The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system {{comprising}} the Sun and the <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> orbit it, {{either directly or}} indirectly. Of those <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.|$|E
5|$|A graph {{is formed}} by a {{collection}} of vertices and edges, where the vertices are structureless <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> are connected in pairs by edges. In {{the case of a}} directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex.|$|E
5|$|Believers in Planet X/Nibiru {{have given}} it many names since it was first proposed. All are, in fact, names for other real, {{hypothetical}} or imaginary Solar System <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> bear little resemblance either to the planet described by Lieder or to Nibiru as described by Sitchin.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{template}} class {{describes an}} <b>object</b> <b>that</b> stores a pointer {{to a single}} allocated <b>object</b> <b>that</b> ensures <b>that</b> the <b>object</b> to which it points gets destroyed automatically when control leaves a scope.|$|R
50|$|When two noun phrases {{follow a}} {{transitive}} verb, {{the first is}} an indirect <b>object,</b> <b>that</b> which is receiving something, {{and the second is}} a direct <b>object,</b> <b>that</b> being acted upon. Indirect objects can be noun phrases or prepositional phrases.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> sinks (is totally submerged), the volume of the object is {{displaced}}. In {{the case of}} an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> floats, the amount of fluid displaced will be equal in weight to the displacing object.|$|R
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> are both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in}} part by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal, rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E
5|$|Shape {{has been}} {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category. Infants assume that <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> have the same shape also share a name. Shape plays an important role in both appropriate and inappropriate extensions.|$|E
5|$|Static {{equilibrium}} {{was understood}} {{well before the}} invention of classical mechanics. <b>Objects</b> <b>that</b> are at rest have zero net force acting on them.|$|E
5000|$|... "An <b>object</b> <b>that</b> {{has been}} {{modified}} {{to fit a}} purpose" [...] or [...] "An inanimate <b>object</b> <b>that</b> one uses or modifies {{in some way to}} cause a change in the environment, thereby facilitating one's achievement of a target goal". Hauser, 2000 ...|$|R
50|$|Under certain conditions, it is {{possible}} that a variable of a parameterized type refers to an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is not of that parameterized type. The variable will always refer to an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is an instance of a class that implements the parameterized type.|$|R
50|$|Any <b>object</b> <b>that</b> {{may be used}} can be {{considered}} a service. Any <b>object</b> <b>that</b> uses other <b>objects</b> can {{be considered}} a client. The names {{have nothing to do with}} what the objects are for and everything to do with the role the objects play in any one injection.|$|R
5|$|The {{impulse to}} make {{teaching}} or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some {{of these have}} inspired artists such as the Dadaists Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp and Max Ernst, and following Man Ray, Hiroshi Sugimoto.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Saturn {{are made up}} of objects ranging in size from {{microscopic}} to moonlets hundreds of meters across, each in its own orbit around Saturn. Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, because there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> form Saturn's ring system and the larger <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> have been named as moons. Over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mindâ€“body problem already described.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} problems {{of this type}} concern collections of <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> need to be updated, such as the cells of a spreadsheet {{after one of the}} cells has been changed, or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. <b>Objects</b> <b>that</b> are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E
50|$|The lathe is {{so named}} because it {{produces}} {{the same type of}} <b>object</b> <b>that</b> a real lathe would produce: an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is symmetrical about an axis of rotation. However, unlike objects produced by a real lathe, the object can have an axis of rotation through a hole (e.g. a torus).|$|R

5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, {{research}} into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, and had only produced <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both uranium-235 and plutonium, and implosion technology would not be required.|$|E
5|$|Burial 195 {{was flooded}} with mud in antiquity. This flood had covered wooden <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> had {{completely}} rotted away {{by the time the}} tomb was excavated, leaving hollows in the dried mud. Archaeologists filled these hollows with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K'awiil, the wooden originals long gone.|$|E

Goat is an animate object.Here similarly, the prefix ga- on the verb -walas marks for third person singular <b>object,</b> <b>that</b> is for yivar, 'dog'. Dog is an animate object.|$|R
5000|$|... "Craving is the {{aspiring}} to an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> one {{has not yet}} reached, like a thief's stretching out {{his hand in the}} dark; clinging is the grasping of an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> one has reached, like the thief's grasping his objective....

5|$|Finding more objects {{would allow}} astronomers {{to make more}} {{accurate}} predictions about the orbit of the hypothesized planet. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, when it is completed in 2023, {{will be able to}} map the entire sky in just a few nights, providing more data on distant Kuiper belt <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> could both bolster evidence for Planet Nine and help pinpoint its current location.|$|E
5|$|He {{perceived}} {{books as}} permanent <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> were invested with power. This power was {{unique in that}} it could transmit ideas to people of different times, cultures, and interests, and do so in ways other art forms could not. This ambition laced all of his work, particularly in his later years. Lissitzky was devoted {{to the idea of}} creating art with power and purpose, art that could invoke change.|$|E
5|$|In Cold Blood is a 3D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a direct control interface, the player guides John Cord's movements with a keyboard or gamepad.
