5|$|By the mid-1930s, Barrowclough was {{disenchanted with}} the state of New Zealand's {{military}} forces, which was in decline due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the discontinuation of compulsory military training. In 1936, he encouraged the reformation of the National Defence League of New Zealand (NDL), a defence lobby group which aimed to encourage and revitalise New Zealand's defence preparations for war. The country's defence arrangements were in a poor state of affairs at the time but the NDL gained little traction with the Labour Government.|$|E

5|$|The {{town had}} {{a budget of}} $74,753,260 for fiscal year 2006/2007. It {{consists}} of three separate fiscal accounting funds: the General Fund, the Capital Projects Fund, and the Debt Service Fund. The General Fund is the operating fund for the town and accounts for all financial resources of the town except the Capital Projects Fund and the Debt Service Fund. The Capital Projects Fund is used to acquire land and facilities, and improve public facilities, including roads, bike paths, fire stations, vehicle replacement, drainage improvements, and park development. The Debt Service Fund accounts for the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the payment of debt.|$|E

5|$|According to the city's {{metropolitan}} bishop, Symeon (in office 1416/17–1429), {{both he and}} the Despot Andronikos sent repeated {{pleas for}} aid to Constantinople, but the imperial government was short <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> preoccupied with its own problems. At long last, a single unnamed commander {{was sent to the}} city, but he brought neither men nor money with him. The commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have born the brunt of the cost. The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, when the news spread that they had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E
30|$|Second, {{through the}} efforts of policy entrepreneurs, the health {{insurance}} policy innovation also received support from the Ministry <b>of</b> Human <b>Resources</b> <b>and</b> Social Security with policy entrepreneurs’ efforts.

During the policy innovation, the SSDNC always requested consultations with and information from the Ministry <b>of</b> Human <b>Resources</b> <b>and</b> Social Security.

40|$|The {{construction}} as {{a sector}} of the economy {{is one of the largest}} consumers <b>of</b> energy <b>resources,</b> <b>and</b> the building materials industry is today one of the most energy-intensive construction industry. At the enterprises of the building materials industry the different approaches and methods are used to solve <b>resource</b> <b>and</b> energy problems. Energy saving is considered not as an complex approach in the enterprise activity, but as activity for the implementation of specific energy-saving projects, which have limitations in time <b>and</b> in <b>resources.</b> The authors suggest to use a softwareoriented approach to solving the problems <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> <b>and</b> energy saving. For practical application of program-oriented approach we offer to use a structuring method of the decision-making, not previously used to solve problems <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> <b>and</b> energy saving...|$|R
40|$|The time {{evolution}} of the price <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> sold to the market and of the price difference, between sold <b>and</b> extracted <b>resources,</b> is investigated in case of no accumulation of the resources; i. e. when the <b>resources</b> are extracted <b>and</b> sold to the market at the same mass flow rate. The price evolution <b>of</b> sold <b>resources</b> varies with time according to {{the relation between the}} price increase factor, PIF, <b>of</b> sold <b>and</b> extracted <b>resources.</b> The price evolutions <b>of</b> sold <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> price difference are investigated according to the relation between extraction rate and interest rate <b>of</b> extracted <b>and</b> sold <b>resources.</b> The price <b>of</b> sold <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the price difference increase with time if the PIF <b>of</b> sold <b>resources</b> is greater than the PIF <b>of</b> extracted <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the initial price is greater than the critical price <b>of</b> sold <b>resources,</b> which depends on the initial price <b>of</b> extracted <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the interest rate <b>of</b> non-extracted <b>and</b> extracted <b>resources.</b> The price <b>of</b> sold <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the price difference decrease with time if the PIF <b>of</b> sold <b>resources</b> is greater than the PIF <b>of</b> extracted <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the initial price is smaller than the critical price <b>of</b> sold <b>resources.</b> The other cases are discussed extensively in the paper.

5|$|After the {{demotion}} of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially {{worked together}} well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible {{due to a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty. Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} renewal {{of the civil war}} in 1352, these factors {{destroyed}} any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its despotes in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent Despotate of the Morea, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.|$|E
5|$|Around 1730, the Baroque style {{gradually}} {{began to}} break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the demise}} of German naval power in the Pacific the fleet unit concept was no longer seen as being relevant, and Australia {{did not have a}} clear role. As a result, post-war budget cuts {{prompted}} the RAN to take the battlecruiser out of active service, as the large share <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> manpower consumed by Australia could be better used elsewhere in the RAN. In August 1920 the battlecruiser was rated by the Naval Board as 11th out of the RAN's 12 priorities. Accordingly, the ship's company was reduced later that year and she was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot as a gunnery and torpedo training ship. In the event of a major conflict, Australia was to serve in a role akin to coastal artillery. She was not considered to have been placed in reserve at this time, however, as it was not possible for the RAN to provide a trained complement at short notice.|$|E
5|$|In the Star Trek universe, {{prior to}} the arrival of Voyager in the Delta Quadrant, {{hostilities}} between the Trabe and the Kazon led to the Trabe keeping them subjugated. Violence between the Kazon was encouraged to limit the risk of them rising up against the Trabe. Before being conquered by the Trabe, the Kazon were the most advanced society in the quadrant. On stardate 2346, Jal Sankur united the sects into the Kazon Order or the Kazon Collective to overthrow the Trabe. The Kazon stole the Trabe's technology and ships and, rather than settle on a new homeworld, became a nomadic species. After achieving independence from the Trabe, the Kazon continued to fight among themselves for control <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> technology.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Matchbox toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with 3D modelling. He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained by rotating the models along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and blue, as well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the rendering process was a waste <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from the models over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E

5|$|Social {{stratification}} is {{the hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies stratification traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> lack of social mobility in stratified societies.|$|E
