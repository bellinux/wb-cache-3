Although the games developed in Japan have not been released <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> region, Konami and 4Kids Entertainment developed a series of games that were only released in North America and Europe. Characters of the Shaman King series have also made appearances in the games Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, {{it is virtually impossible to}} link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

25|$|These {{treatment}} regimens {{last from}} one to four weeks.

IgM and IgG antibody levels may be elevated for years even after successful treatment with antibiotics. As antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended.|$|E

Mackellar's senior debut for Scotland came in April 2000, at the ICC Six Nations Challenge in Zimbabwe. His best performance came against Denmark, where he took figures of 3/23 from nine overs. <b>Outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tournament, Mackellar's only other game for Scotland came the following month, against Wiltshire in the 2000 NatWest Trophy.|$|E

25|$|As an Aztec city, it {{contained}} a sacred plaza with a temple {{and perhaps a}} lord's palace. Outside this plaza area was the residential area for the elite called the pipiltin, consisting of large houses occupied by extended families. There was probably also a central market. <b>Outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was a second residential zone for the common population, called the macehualtin. The organization of the city reflected that of Texcoco but at a smaller scale. There is evidence that this city produced crafts such as ceramics on a large scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact number}} of texts in the Kangyur is not fixed. Each editor takes {{responsibility}} for removing texts he considers spurious or adding new translations. Currently {{there are about}} 12 available Kangyurs. These include the Derge, Lhasa, Narthang, Cone, Peking, Urga, Phudrak and Stog Palace versions, each named after the physical location of its printing (or copying {{in the case of}} manuscripts editions). In addition, some canonical texts have been found in Tabo and Dunhuang which provide earlier exemplars to texts found in the Kangyur. The majority of extant Kangyur editions appear to stem from the so-called Old Narthang Kangyur, though the Phukdrak and Tawang editions are thought to lie <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> textual lineage. The stemma of the Kangyur have been well researched in particular by Helmut Eimer and Paul Harrison.|$|E
25|$|On 3 January 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network {{announced}} that it had purchased Current TV in the United States and would be launching an American news channel. 60% of the channel's programming would be produced in America while 40% would be from Al Jazeera English. That was later changed {{at the request of}} the cable and satellite providers to almost 100% American programing. Regardless Al Jazeera America maintained a close working relationship with Al Jazeera English. The channel aired Newshour in the morning and midday hours and cut to live Al Jazeera English coverage of large breaking international news stories <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> Al Jazeera English programmes Witness, Earthrise, Listening Post, Talk To Al Jazeera Al Jazeera Correspondent and 101 East along with Al Jazeera Investigates regularly aired on Al Jazeera America.|$|E

25|$|On {{the front}} {{face of the}} {{mechanism}} (see reproduction here:) there is a fixed ring dial representing the ecliptic, the twelve zodiacal signs marked off with equal 30 degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the constellation boundaries were variable. <b>Outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic Egyptian calendar, twelve months of 30 days plus five intercalary days. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the Greek alphabet. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of all three Brothers Halbertsma, their short fiction and poetry was {{gathered}} {{under the supervision of}} librarian and archivist Gerben Colmjon and bookseller and historian Wopke Eekhoff. In 1871, it was published by the firm of J. de Lange in Deventer, under the title of Rimen en Teltsjes ("Rhymes and Tales"). Apart from a few of his poems and his part in De Skearwinkel fan Joutebaas ("Boss Joute's Barbershop"), Tsjalling Halbertsma works, however, remained <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> collection. It was not until the fourth reprint of Rimen en Teltsjes, which was published in 1918 by publisher and bookshop owner Rinse van der Velde from Leeuwarden, that the composition of the work was thoroughly adjusted. At that time Tsjalling's contribution took a more visible form through the absorption of De Wiersizzerij fan Maaike Jakkeles ("The Fortune-telling of Maaike Jakkeles") and a number of shorter texts and poems.|$|E
500|$|Salon Kitty {{became even}} more popular when {{selected}} guests {{in the military and}} diplomatic corps were told the [...] "secret codeword" [...] and monitors made thousands of recordings during their visits. One of the customers was Galeazzo Ciano, son-in-law of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and Foreign Minister of Fascist Italy, whose forthright opinions about the Führer were not particularly positive. Another visitor, SS general Sepp Dietrich, wanted all the 20 special girls for an all-night orgy, but he revealed no secrets. Additionally, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels has been marked as a client; he enjoyed [...] "lesbian displays" [...] that were otherwise considered anti-social acts <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> context. Heydrich also made a number of [...] "inspection tours", although the microphones were turned off on those occasions.|$|E

500|$|Ollivierre was {{the first}} black West Indian cricketer to play county cricket, and the first West Indian cricketer to {{establish}} a cricketing reputation <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> region. Other West Indians looked to follow his example, and several were approached by English counties with a view to qualifying. At least one of Ollivierre's Derbyshire colleagues was unhappy playing alongside a black cricketer; Bill Storer, according to the cricket writer E. H. D. Sewell, believed in [...] "England for the English" [...] and specifically objected to presence of black people. However, {{there is no evidence that}} Ollivierre experienced any difficulties from spectators, and the historian Jack Williams suggests that despite racism inherent in English cricket at the time, Ollivierre's presence may have [...] "created goodwill towards non-whites among [...] white supporters".|$|E
500|$|In a more {{critical}} vein, The New York Times chief music critic Donal Henahan {{alluded to the}} publicity buildup for the opera by opening his column, headed [...] "That was it?", by calling the work [...] "fluff" [...] and [...] "a Peter Sellars variety show, worth a few giggles but hardly a strong candidate for the standard repertory". New York magazine Peter G. Davis admired Maddalena's portrayal of the president, calling him [...] "positively eerie. The tilt of his head, the jerky walk, the nervous hand movements, even the way he sits and crosses his legs are Nixon to the life". [...] However, Davis felt the opera had little chance of survival once the initial public attention ended. St. Louis Post-Dispatch critic James Wierzbicki called the opera [...] "more interesting than good... a novelty, not much more." [...] Television critic Marvin Kitman, {{just prior to the}} telecast of the original Houston production in April 1988, stated [...] "There are only three things wrong with Nixon in China. One, the libretto; two, the music; three, the direction. <b>Outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> it's perfect." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{preference}} for British cooking methods {{is apparent in}} cookbooks brought to the New World. [...] There was a general disdain for French cookery, even among the French Huguenots in South Carolina and French Canadians. One cookbook common in the colonies, The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy, by Hannah Glasse, held the French style of cookery in disdain, stating [...] "the blind folly of this age that would rather be imposed on by a French booby, than give encouragement to a good English cook!" [...] She does add French recipes to the text but speaks out flagrantly against the dishes, [...] "...think(ing) it an odd jumble of trash." [...] The French and Indian War (1754–1764) reinforced anti-French sentiment. The conflict strengthened an age-old English distrust of the French, and led the English to deport French-speaking people, as in the forced migration of the Acadians to Louisiana. The Acadian French brought a profound French influence to the diet of settlers in Louisiana, but had little influence <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> region.|$|E
