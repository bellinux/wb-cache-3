5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three largest banks. The much larger foreign <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E

30|$|The {{conventional}} multiple rectangular integral {{is merely}} <b>the</b> inverse <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> partial differential. It {{is impossible to}} regard the conventional multiple rectangular integral as <b>the</b> inverse <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total differential in <b>the</b> derivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conventional curl or divergence theorem. There should be <b>the</b> inverse <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total differential in this sense. Fortunately, both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curl and the divergence theorems are derived by substituting the total differentials into our new method of a triangular integral.
