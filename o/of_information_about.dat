It also summarizes found informations concerning sing languages and compares <b>informations</b> <b>about</b> sign languages included in Czech and English introductions to the study of language.

Pantoliano was cast in March 2002. Urich works for the New York Post, rather than the Daily Bugle as in the comics, because the film rights to the Bugle were held by Sony Pictures at that time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Egypt {{during the reign}} of Djedkare Isesi is the Abusir papyri. These are administrative documents, covering a period of 24 years during Djedkare's reign; they were discovered in the mortuary temples of pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre and queen Khentkaus II. In addition to these texts, the earliest letters on papyrus preserved to the present day also date to Djedkare's reign, dealing with administrative or private matters.|$|E

5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply enormous amounts <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the world: the program {{needs to have}} {{some idea of what}} it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E

The player was later identified as Saleem Malik, and it was revealed that the Australian trio had privately reported him for offering them money to throw matches.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are {{the main}} source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Badami Chalukya history.

The Badami cliff inscription of PulakeshinI (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of PulakeshinII (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old Kannada script.|$|E

Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> Vesta.|$|E

5|$|Many of the regnal {{dates of}} the East Anglian kings are {{considered}} unreliable, often being based upon computations.
