Britain's {{conflict with}} Spain, the War of Jenkins' Ear, {{became part of}} the War of the Austrian Succession when a major European dispute broke out upon the death <b>of</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. At issue was the right of Charles's daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed to his Austrian dominions. George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where he was more able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector.|$|E

5|$|Emeric was {{the eldest}} child of Béla III of Hungary and Béla's first wife, Agnes of Antioch. His tutor was an Italian priest, Bernard. Nicholas, Archbishop of Esztergom, crowned the eight-year-old Emeric king on 16 May 1182, which {{confirmed}} Emeric's right to succeed his father. Emeric was betrothed to a daughter <b>of</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor Frederick I, but {{she died in}} 1184. Béla III appointed Emeric to administer Croatia and Dalmatia around 1195.|$|E
5|$|He had {{intended}} {{to go to the}} bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon speaking of the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the Church <b>of</b> <b>Holy</b> Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.|$|E

5000|$|A {{litany of}} this new form {{is that of a}} codex in the Library of St. Mark's, Venice, dating {{from the end of the}} 13th or the {{beginning}} of the 14th century. It is found, though with occasional variants, in many manuscripts, a sure sign that this text was especially well known and favourably received. It omits the petitions, and consists of seventy-five praises joined to the usual invocation, [...] "Sancta Maria". Here is a short specimen, showing the praises to be met with most frequently also in other litanies of that or of later times: [...] "Holy Mary, Mother and Spouse of Christ, pray for me MSS. have [...] "pray for us"-the [...] "pray" [...] is always repeated; Holy Mary, Mother inviolate; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Temple <b>of</b> the <b>Holy</b> Ghost; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Queen <b>of</b> Heaven; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Mistress <b>of</b> the Angels; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Star <b>of</b> Heaven; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Gate <b>of</b> Paradise; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Mother <b>of</b> True Counsel; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Gate <b>of</b> Celestial Life; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Our Advocate; Holy Mary, brightest Star <b>of</b> Heaven; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Fountain <b>of</b> True Wisdom; <b>Holy</b> Mary, unfailing Rose; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Beauty <b>of</b> Angels; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Flower <b>of</b> Patriarchs; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Desire <b>of</b> Prophets; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Treasure <b>of</b> Apostles; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Praise <b>of</b> Martyrs; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Glorification <b>of</b> Priests; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Immaculate Virgin; <b>Holy</b> Mary, Splendour <b>of</b> Virgins and Example of Chastity", etc.|$|R

5|$|In the Latin Church, Catholic men {{may serve}} as deacons or priests by {{receiving}} sacramental ordination.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the root of the quarrel between Cnut and Malcolm lies in Cnut's pilgrimage to Rome, and the coronation <b>of</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor Conrad II, where Cnut and Rudolph III, King of Burgundy had the place of honour. If Malcolm were present, and the repeated mentions of his piety in the annals make it quite possible that he made a pilgrimage to Rome, as did Mac Bethad mac Findláich ("Macbeth") in later times, then the coronation would have allowed Malcolm to publicly snub Cnut's claims to overlordship.|$|E

5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin <b>of</b> <b>Holy</b> Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E

5|$|The general {{framework}} of the coronation service {{is based on the}} sections contained in the Second Recension used in 973 for King Edgar. Although the service has undergone two major revisions, a translation and has been modified for each coronation for the following thousand years, the sequence of taking an oath, anointing, investing of regalia, crowning and enthronement found in the Anglo-Saxon text have remained constant. The coronation ceremonies takes place within the framework <b>of</b> <b>Holy</b> Communion.|$|E
5|$|The show of {{solidarity}} between the sisters {{did not last}} long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry Prince Philip of Spain, the son <b>of</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor Charles V and an active Catholic. Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.|$|E
