5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public <b>Order</b> <b>Branch</b> of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted football fans, hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Police Service {{launched}} Operation Withern, {{an investigation}} into the events leading up to and during the riots. The operation was initially led by Detective Superintendent John Sweeney of the Metropolitan Police Service, with detectives from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, specialist investigators from the Public <b>Order</b> <b>Branch,</b> and police support staff. Detective Superintendent Robin Bhairam, took over the post event investigation, where officers were drawn from all over the MPS, from different business groups, and placed into 10 Investigation Hubs across London. The Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Steve Kavanagh, stated that the number of officers deployed tripled between 6 and 7 August.|$|E

Variations in % refixation paralleled changes in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). As light attenuated with increasing <b>branch</b> <b>order</b> % refixation decreased. Increased PAR in the winter due to a more sparse canopy lead to increases in % refixation. Total chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a:b ratios were consistent with shade acclimation as <b>branch</b> <b>order</b> increased. Corticular photosynthesis may be a mechanism to enhance shrub expansion due to increased whole plant carbon use efficiency (CUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) attributed to refixation...|$|R

50|$|A {{branch is}} an {{instruction}} {{in a computer}} program that can cause a computer to begin executing a different instruction sequence and thus deviate from its default behavior of executing instructions in <b>order.</b> <b>Branch</b> (or branching, branched) may also refer to the act of switching execution to a different instruction sequence {{as a result of}} executing a branch instruction. A branch instruction can be either an unconditional branch, which always results in branching, or a conditional branch, {{which may or may not}} cause branching, depending on some condition. Branch instructions are used to implement control flow in program loops and conditionals (i.e., executing a particular sequence of instructions only if certain conditions are satisfied).|$|E
