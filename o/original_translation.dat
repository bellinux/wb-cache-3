25|$|In {{translations}} of the Bible into modern European languages, {{such as the}} Luther Bible or the King James Bible, the word eunuchus as found in the Latin Vulgate is usually rendered as officer, official or chamberlain, {{consistent with the idea}} that the original meaning of eunuch was bed-keeper (Orion's first option). Modern religious scholars have been disinclined to assume that the courts of Israel and Judah included castrated men, even though the <b>original</b> <b>translation</b> of the Bible into Greek used the word eunoukhos.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known Arabic {{translation of}} the Shahnameh was done in c. 1220 by al-Fath bin Ali al-Bondari, a Persian scholar from Isfahan and {{at the request of}} the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus Al-Mu'azzam Isa. The translation is Nathr (unrhyming) and was largely forgotten until it was republished in full in 1932 in Egypt, by historian Abdelwahhab Azzam. This modern edition was based on incomplete and largely imprecise fragmented copies found in Cambridge, Paris, Astana, Cairo and Berlin. The latter had the most complete, least inaccurate and well-preserved Arabic version of the <b>original</b> <b>translation</b> by al-Bondari.|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} no {{continuing}} plot—the {{focus of the}} stories is Yotsuba's daily voyage of discovery. Many chapters take place on successive days (for details, see List of Yotsuba&! chapters), so that the series follows, almost literally, the characters' daily lives. The tone can be summarized by the motto, used on chapter title pages and advertising, , or in the <b>original</b> <b>translation,</b> [...] "Enjoy Everything".|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Dragon Quest I & II was {{released}} for Game Boy Color; {{the game is}} also compatible with Game Boy. A year later, it was localized in America as Dragon Warrior I & II. This remake {{is similar to the}} Super Famicom version, bit with 8-bit graphics. Compared with the NES version, it featured better graphics and was less difficult. [...] The remake also provided a quick-save function to allow players save and load game anywhere unless they reset the Game Boy. In the Game Boy Color localization, the main characters' and towns' names were retranslated to be similar to the original Japanese names: legendary hero [...] "Erdrick" [...] was retranslated as [...] "Loto", and the castle name [...] "Midenhall" [...] was re-dubbed [...] "Lorasia". The <b>original</b> <b>translation</b> had a lot of errors, and Enix changed the names to help fix that.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{published}} in Europe by Rising Star Games alongside other Marvelous products including [...] and Arc Rise Fantasia. The English translation was carried over from the North American version, although the English language version underwent regional adjustment, and some minor faults were corrected. The game was also translated into French, Italian, German and Spanish, which made using the <b>original</b> <b>translation</b> more practical than creating a new one. Originally scheduled for November 2009, it was first shifted into 2010, then moved back into 2009. The game released in Europe on November 6 of that year. Upon release in the United Kingdom, most retailers did not stock it: this was put down to a general attitude {{that it would not}} sell like prevalent franchises or games from mainstream genres. The game released in Australia on December 3, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Although a {{prototype}} cartridge of the English NES Final Fantasy II was produced, the project was, by Moriyama's own admission, {{still far from}} complete; [...] "We had so very limited memory capacity we could use for each game, and it was never really [...] "translating" [...] but chopping up the information and cramming them back in... our boss had no understanding in putting in extra work for the English version at that time." [...] In 2003, when the game was finally released to English-speaking audiences as part of Final Fantasy Origins, it was released with new graphics, music, and a brand new translation {{under the supervision of}} Akira Kashiwagi. A fan translation of the original game was also created prior to the release of Origins, and makes use of an <b>original</b> <b>translation</b> as the existence of the prototype cartridge was not common knowledge at the time.|$|E

500|$|The PlayStation re-release {{featured}} {{only minor}} {{changes to the}} English localization. The title of the game was reverted to Final Fantasy VI from Final Fantasy III, to unify the numbering scheme of the series in North America and Japan with the earlier release of Final Fantasy VII. A few item and character names were adjusted, as in the expansion of [...] "Fenix Down" [...] to [...] "Phoenix Down". Unlike the PlayStation re-release of Final Fantasy IV included in the later Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation, the script was left essentially unchanged. The Game Boy Advance re-release featured a new translation by a different translator, Tom Slattery. This translation preserved most of the character names, location names, and terminology from the Woolsey translation, but changed item and spell names to match the conventions used in more recent titles in the series. The revised script preserved certain quirky lines from the original while changing or editing others, and it cleared up certain points of confusion in the <b>original</b> <b>translation.</b> The Wii Virtual Console release used the Final Fantasy III name of the SNES game.|$|E

2500|$|Comparison of a back-translation {{with the}} {{original}} text is sometimes used as {{a check on the}} accuracy of the <b>original</b> <b>translation,</b> much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation.

2500|$|One {{challenge}} in performing a linguistic {{analysis of the}} Book of Mormon is that no original text is available for analysis; only handwritten printers' copies transcribed from the original handwritten copies of the original English text, and a few pages of the <b>original</b> <b>translation</b> produced by Smith are available. As with any translation, {{the influence of the}} translator is inextricably part of the translated text in matters of word choice.

2500|$|There is {{evidence}} for schoolboys playing a [...] "football" [...] ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable {{as an early}} allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word [...] "pass" [...] {{in the most recent}} translation is derived from [...] "huc percute" [...] (strike it here) and later [...] (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. [...] The original word translated as [...] "goal" [...] is , literally meaning the [...] "pillar {{at each end of the}} circus course" [...] in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to [...] "get hold of the ball before [...] does" [...] (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation [...] "Throw yourself against him" [...] (...) [...] It is clear that the game was rough and tackles allowed included the [...] "charging" [...] and pushing/holding of opposing players ("drive that man back" [...] in the <b>original</b> <b>translation,</b> [...] "repelle eum" [...] in original Latin).

Medhurst claimed {{this was an}} <b>original</b> <b>translation</b> based on the Kangxi Zidian, {{but it was in}} fact just an edited abridgment of Morrison's dictionary, a [...] "plagiarism rather than an original compilation" [...] The American sinologist and missionary Samuel Wells Williams compiled the 1874 Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language, whose Chinese title (...) echoed that of Part II of Morrison's work (...) [...] The preface says that although many similar Chinese-English dictionaries by Medhurst, Elijah Coleman Bridgman, and others were published in small numbers, they became [...] "very scarce, while the number of students has increased tenfold", and learners of Chinese relied on reprints of Morrison [...] Williams explicitly identified [...] "Dr. Medhurst's translation of the K'anghi Tsz'tien" [...] as a more important source for his own work than Morrison's dictionary [...] The British diplomat and sinologist Herbert Giles edited A Chinese-English Dictionary, published in 1892 and 1912. Giles praised Morrison as [...] "the great pioneer" [...] of Chinese-English lexicography, but criticized his failure to mark aspiration. He said Medhurst [...] "attempted aspirates" [...] but omitted some and wrongly inserted others. While Williams correctly marked aspiration and tones, Giles says [...] "he provided too few phrases, and mistranslated a large number of those" [...] Ironically, Yang's textual analysis finds that Giles's dictionary is more closely linked to Williams's than to Morrison's [...]|$|E
