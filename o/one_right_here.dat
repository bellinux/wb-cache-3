I kind of was just really free in the mind when I did this CD right here - Eyrth, Wynd & Fyre - those are elements right there. That fire’a that truth, and that wind, that’s the substance, and the Earth is the strength that keeps me grounded. So these elements right here exist within my style and life, what I had to go through, so I got that and I got the other double CD with DJ Snips and J-Ronin and of those producers, good looking out for J-Ronin on A&R’ing the project.

5000|$|... “What {{methods have}} I used?" [...] said Griswold. “Why, honest ones, I hope. I {{have tried to}} make a good {{publication}} and sell it upon its merits. That has been my formula of success. Difficulties? Well, I have known what it is to live on three dollars a week. It has not been all plain sailing. But there has always been plenty of encouragement to go on, and at present my journal is on an extremely satisfactory footing. No, I don’t think that a woman has any advantage over a man in the publishing field—certainly she had many disadvantages ten years ago, for women had not begun to do so large a share of the world’s work, and when she went into business there were many who looked askance at her efforts. Those days are past, happily, and now she is on an equal footing with men—is at liberty to go ahead unquestioned and do the best that lies in her. In the advertising field there are probably as good opportunities as in other departments of business. In fact, there are some notably successful women in advertising and publishing. Miss Keyes, of the Semi—ready Clothing Company, is <b>one</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> in New York, while in Chicago there is Mrs. Dr. Ellen Sage, who was formerly with the J. Walter Thompson agency, and who is now an independent ad writer. In publishing, there are Miss Caro M. Clarke and Miss Helen Winslow, of Boston. Miss Clarke has been very successful as a publisher of fiction, and was almost the first to use billboard advertising as a medium for exploiting novels. Women are successful as advertising solicitors, while in ad writing there are many lines that she can handle to better advantage than men provided she has equal ability. Her viewpoint gives her certain advantages, of course, but it is all a matter of ability. The day is gone when she can be classed by herself. The February issue of Profitable Advertising is to be a woman’s number, dealing with her work in the field of publicity, and I think that it will be something of a revelation. As for the woman who wishes to embark in advertising — well, if she has ability, I believe it better for her to enter upon actual work as the associate of an advertising manager. Real experience transcends all theory. Such positions almost invariably give her experience of retail advertising, which seems to be the natural point of beginning in an advertising career. Retail advertising operations bring one into close touch with readers. You fire at short range and fire often, and the experience gained is invaluable in general publicity." ...|$|E

Despite all the efforts to produce skilled people in traditional fields, the tide of sustainable employment in those areas, appears to be structurally prohibitive raising basic questions of whether traditional perceptions of Technology in school curriculum remains viable and whether a rethink of why Technology ought be taught is now due for a new discourse. In our complex new world, the <b>one</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> and now and unfolding outside the school gate, we ought cast forward and rethink the new opportunities before us with Technology studies as a subject in waiting. This paper explores the proposition that, in the context of understanding the role of innovation and knowledge in the world economy, {{it may be time to}} completely rethink the role of Technology in schooling as having a unique purpose in the curriculum. One that is characterised by its focus on graduate attributes rather than specific traditional equipment skilling expressed in the finish of ‘objects ’ and by its responsive behaviour to a modern world economy, with complex social and ecological pressures.
