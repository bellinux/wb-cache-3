500|$|Early {{editors of}} Shakespeare's works, {{beginning}} with Nicholas Rowe (1709) and Lewis Theobald (1733), combined {{material from the}} two earliest sources of Hamlet available at the time, Q2 and F1. Each text contains material that the other lacks, with many minor differences in wording: scarcely 200 lines are identical in the two. Editors have combined them {{in an effort to}} create one [...] "inclusive" [...] text that reflects an imagined [...] "ideal" [...] of Shakespeare's original. Theobald's version became standard for a long time, and his [...] "full text" [...] approach continues to influence editorial practice to the present day. Some contemporary scholarship, however, discounts this approach, instead considering [...] "an authentic Hamlet an unrealisable ideal. ... there are texts of this play but no text". The 2006 publication by Arden Shakespeare of different Hamlet texts in different volumes is perhaps evidence of this shifting focus and emphasis. Other editors have continued to argue the need for well-edited editions taking material from all versions of the play. Colin Burrow has argued that [...] "most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>should</b> read a text that is made up by conflating all three versions ... it's about as likely that Shakespeare wrote: [...] "To be or not to be, ay, there's the point" [...] , as that he wrote the works of Francis Bacon. I suspect most people just won't want to read a three-text play ... a version of the play that is {{out of touch with the}} needs of a wider public." ...|$|E
500|$|After his {{selection}} {{as a vice}} presidential candidate, Biden was criticized by his own Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington Bishop Michael Saltarelli over his stance on abortion, which goes against the church's pro-life beliefs and teachings. [...] The diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president, Biden {{would not be allowed}} to speak at Catholic schools. [...] Biden was soon barred from receiving Holy Communion by the bishop of his original hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, because of his support for abortion rights; however, Biden did continue to receive Communion at his local Delaware parish. [...] Scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state Catholic voters between the Democratic campaign and liberal Catholic groups, who stressed that other social issues should be considered as much or more than abortion, and many bishops and conservative Catholics, who maintained abortion was paramount. Biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others. Bishop Saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to Biden's: [...] "No one today would accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.' Likewise, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>should</b> accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.'" ...|$|E

Jenny Next was never actually born but placed in the mind of Thursday Next by Aornis Hades which is why Jenny never makes an appearance in [...] "First Among Sequels".|$|E
2500|$|As {{they marched}} {{to meet the}} Saxons, Eldol, Duke of Gloucester told Aurelius that he greatly wished to meet Hengist in combat, noting that [...] "one of the two <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>should</b> die before we parted." [...] He {{explained}} {{that he had been}} at the Treachery of the Long Knives, but had escaped when God threw him a stake to defend himself with, making him the only Briton present to survive. Meanwhile, Hengist was placing his troops into formation, giving directions, and walking through the lines of troops, [...] "the more to spirit them up." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television. [...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her {{up as much}} as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs might not want to stick around, but the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>should</b> be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E

2500|$|In the humiliating {{aftermath}} of Suez in 1956, Lady Avon's most famous public remark {{to a group}} of Conservative woman that, [...] "in the past few weeks I have really felt as if the Suez Canal was flowing through my drawing room", was widely reported. Lady Avon has since described this observation as [...] "silly, really idiotic", though it remains probably the most quoted utterance of the whole crisis. One example of its durability was a journalist's observation some 54 years later, with reference to the Iraq War of 2003, that [...] "if, as Clarissa Eden remarked, the Suez Canal ran through her drawing room, Iraq and the decisions that flowed from it still haunt [...] Labour [...] and stir up antipathies and discomforts". Another instance was in 2013 when options for airport expansion around London were being debated. Journalist Rachel Johnson, sister of London's mayor Boris Johnson, recalled Lady Avon's remark and added, [...] "But for those of us in West London, any further expansion to Heathrow and the airport really will be in our back yards". More directly, The Times newspaper cited Lady Avon's words in 2011 in connection with a call by the outgoing Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus (later Lord) O'Donnell for Prime Ministerial spouses to receive greater support from public funds: [...] "In a constitutional monarchy, the consort of the prime minister is not an official role ... Yet, as the Countess of Avon so vividly pointed out, it can be impossible to keep public scrutiny at bay altogether". In Lady Avon's view, both she and her husband [...] "were quite naive about how the press works. Neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>should</b> have been, but we were." ...|$|E
