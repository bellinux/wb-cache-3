Through the end of the war, the squadron continued this training function, as well as transporting the crews to their new squadrons and ferrying aircraft to squadrons in need of replacements due to combat losses, accidents, or <b>overdue</b> for <b>maintenance.</b> PBY Catalina, PBM Mariner and PB2Y Coronado seaplanes were assigned the squadron for training purposes. In August 1944, Commander Air Force, Paciﬁc Fleet advised that the rotation of squadrons in the forward area would be discontinued in the near future and that only the personnel in the squadrons would be rotated. Crews being trained at NAS Kaneohe Bay would be sent to replacement pools in the forward areas for reassignment to squadrons as needed.

50|$|Carolina Southern Railroad {{is a short}} line rail {{operator}} running on less than 100 mi of rail at a maximum speed of 10 mi/h km/h. It transports mostly freight brought to it from national {{rail operator}}s. The company makes one scheduled delivery per month into the City of Myrtle Beach. It is located off of Main Street in Conway, South Carolina {{and is one of}} the few remaining train depots in South Carolina. It has been Painstakingly restored to its former glory and the Carolina Southern Railroad has become one of the frequent destinations for freight services as well as passenger cars and observational locomotives. The railroad was originally erected in late 1886 and the first train steamed into the Conway Depot in December 1887. The Carolina Southern Railroad stands as a permanent landmark in Southern History. Carolina Southern Railroad is a member of the Carolina Rails system with connections that run from Whiteville, North Carolina to Mullins, South Carolina and also from Chadbourn, North Carolina to Conway. Carolina Southern railroad is also responsible for operation of the Waccamaw Coast Line Railroad, which is a railway that runs from Conway to Myrtle Beach. On August 30, 2011, Carolina Southern Railroad voluntary shut down because several bridges along the rail were <b>overdue</b> for <b>maintenance.</b> The shutdown caused Carolina Southern Railroad to lay off nearly all of its employees. On May 24, 2012, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) commenced a bridge inspection on the CSR and the Waccamaw Coastline Railroad (the Horry County portion of rail). Fifty-two of 187 bridges were inspected and seven had critical defects. On May 26, 2011, the CSR voluntarily ceased operation, so that they could bring in a certified bridge engineer to inspect the seven critical bridges and prepare a plan for their repairs. Based on the engineer’s recommendations, CSR made the necessary repairs on the bridges and CSR resumed operations August 8, 2011. The FRA returned to inspect the bridges and made a recommendation that CSR cease operations until all bridge repairs were completed. There are currently efforts to bring the railroad back online.|$|R
50|$|Impressed by the German {{campaign}} of 1940 against France, the Soviet People's Commissariat of Defence (Defence Ministry, Russian abbreviation NKO) ordered {{the creation of}} nine mechanized corps on 6 July 1940. Between February and March 1941 the NKO ordered another twenty to be created. All of these formations were larger than those theorized by Tukhachevsky. Even though the Red Army's 29 mechanized corps had an authorized strength of no less than 29,899 tanks by 1941, they {{proved to be a}} paper tiger. There were actually only 17,000 tanks available at the time, meaning several of the new mechanized corps were badly under strength. The pressure placed on factories and military planners to show production numbers also led to a situation where the majority of armored vehicles were obsolescent models, critically lacking in spare parts and support equipment, and nearly three quarters were <b>overdue</b> for major <b>maintenance.</b> By 22 June 1941 there were only 1,475 of the modern T-34s and KV series tanks available to the Red Army, and these were too dispersed along the front to provide enough mass for even local success. To illustrate this, the 3rd Mechanized Corps in Lithuania was formed up of a total of 460 tanks; 109 of these were newer KV-1s and T-34s. This corps would prove {{to be one of the}} lucky few with a substantial number of newer tanks. However, the 4th Army was composed of 520 tanks, all of which were the obsolete T-26, as opposed to the authorized strength of 1,031 newer medium tanks. This problem was universal throughout the Red Army, and would play a crucial role in the initial defeats of the Red Army in 1941 at the hands of the German armed forces.|$|R

5000|$|It {{is planned}} {{to expand the}} current airport building, {{including}} the current arrival and departure hall, as more airlines and tourists come to Bonaire. It is also plannedd to repair the airport's runway after certain speculations that the runway had a crack in it.

Since Bonaire is now {{the responsibility of the}} Netherlands, including ownership of the airport, it must comply with European standards, which are much stricter than the ICAO standards.

50|$|The Moree-Sydney {{route is}} one of 14 {{regulated}} by the State Government. Prior to 30 March 2013, the route had been served by up to 20 weekly QantasLink flights, using Bombardier Dash 8 turboprop airliners. Controversially, this ended with the awarding of the license to Brindabella Airlines on behalf of Transport New South Wales following a tender process. The move was met by considerable opposition within the Moree community, with concerns being raised about a lack of consultation, reduced baggage allowance, loss of frequent flyer program benefits as well as smaller aircraft operating the route and less operational flexibility {{in the event of}} delays or cancellations. Prior to 27 January 2012, Brindabella Airlines operated weekday services to Brisbane, but these flights ceased after the company reviewed services to the region following a merger with Aeropelican, a move which damaged the airline's reputation in the local community.

5000|$|A {{plan for}} Fitzroy to {{relocate}} to Sydney had its beginnings in Easter 1979, when Fitzroy president Frank Bibby and Graeme Plum (Fitzroy committeeman 1979-1983) were invited by Kevin Humphries, president of the NSW Rugby League, to the Sydney Cricket Ground, for the 'Rugby League Marathon'. During the game Bibby and Plum {{concluded that there was}} a great opportunity for Australian football in Sydney and that Fitzroy should be a part of that. The club carried out a series of fact finding work, including lining up a deal with a licensed Australian rules club in North Sydney to act as a social club, finding sponsors and even lining up a bank to assist with finances, if they were given significant representation on the board. The promising initial findings encouraged some of those on the Fitzroy committee to consider a move was worthy of more investigation.In July 1980, President Frank Bibby stated publicly that Fitzroy was effectively bankrupt. The Club was $300,000 in debt and the deficit was expected to be $400,000 {{by the end of the}} VFL season in September. On 15 July, the Club defaulted on a cheque for $17,500 to the Australian Taxation Office, wages cheques were expected to be dishonoured that week; creditor could not be paid; an annual repayment of a major loan was six months overdue; a taxi company threatened the previous week to stop servicing the Club unless there was a significant payment on an outstanding account, and <b>overdue</b> <b>maintenance</b> work continued to force staff to work in sub-standard accommodation.

40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Sydney Campus {{opened the}} doors to its new {{state-of-the-art}} facility for its medicine and nursing schools in Darlinghurst on 2 nd March 2008. Located opposite St Vincent’s Hospital, the new seven storey building {{has been designed to}} join and complement the restored historic Sacred Heart complex, of church, school, and presbytery. The University has successfully undertaken the major restoration of the 1912 church, which replaced an earlier 1852 church on the site designed by architect Charles Hansom. Hansom’s work was inspired by the famous English architect, Augustus Pugin, said to be responsible for the ‘gothic revival movement’ which began in the 1840 s in England. Sacred Heart’s fascinating history began when, under instructions from the Archbishop of Sydney (1842 - 1877), John Bede Polding, Hansom designed, not only the church, but also a school located in the under storey. A later school was constructed in 1880 adjacent to the church, to house up to 500 girls on the upper level and up to 500 boys on the lower level. It was connected to the church by a timber bridge. That school now houses the University’s medical library on the upper level, and tutorial rooms on the lower level. The under storey to the church, now houses a student common room and new Parish facilities. To cater for a rapidly growing congregation, a new and larger, church was constructed between 1910 to 1912, over the foundations of the first church, utilising some of the original stonework. It was designed by architect James Nangle who {{went on to become the}} head of Technical Education in NSW from 1913 to 1933. In 1958, in response to a still growing congregation, architect Elsa Davey was commissioned to lengthen and modernise the Church. The new works included a new sanctuary and apse, lined with a large mosaic depiction of the Risen Christ, designed by Enrico Gaudenzi, and constructed by the famous Vatican Mozaic studio. Other works included additional confessionals, and replacing the original timber windows and leadlights, with aluminium frames and orange glass. In 1970 a new presbytery was built on the site, replacing two earlier ones, located on the other side of Victoria Street, where St Vincent’s Hospital is now located. By 2005 the Sacred Heart Church, the Presbytery, and the School were in poor physical condition, either under used or empty. It was suggested by Cardinal George Pell, Archbishop of Sydney, that it might be possible for Notre Dame to restore the church, and develop the balance of the site as a facility for its medical and nursing schools. The rest, as they say, is history. Work commenced in 2006. The 1958, now discordant extensions and ‘modernisations’ to the Church were demolished, except for the 65 tonne mosaic and apse, which was lifted back to the reconstructed 1912 end of the nave. This was a major engineering feat given the weight of the concrete apse and the fragility of the artwork. It won engineer, Elwyn Berchowitz, the 2007 NSW Engineering Award, both for the heritage category, and for the overall winner for all categories. The University’s architect, Marcus Collins explains, “The restoration of the Sacred Heart Church to its 1912 configuration and detailing has given back to the Church its original architectural integrity. Together with the essential and long <b>overdue</b> <b>maintenance</b> undertaken, the upgrading of the fabric, the new services, and with the additional facilities constructed, the future of Sacred Heart, as the Darlinghurst parish church, has been ensured. ” Semester One is well underway in the medical and nursing schools, and the restored church with its new facilities is promising to be in great demand. The Archbishop of Sydney was one of the first visitors to the newly restored Sacred Heart Church. He visited the first cohort of medical students on their orientation day. Cardinal Pell, congratulated the University on the new Darlinghurst site. 2 ̆ 2 Sacred Heart Parish Darlinghurst retains its historic Sydney parish church, and it is very good to see the parish site restored so beautifully with office and meeting facilities for the parish as well as the university buildings. 2 ̆ 2 The University has built a superb new facility for educating doctors and nurses and for supporting university medical research. 2 ̆ 2 It has also made ingenious use of the existing parish buildings for teaching and administrative purposes. 2 ̆ 2 The parish church, in particular, has been magnificently restored. The mosaic of the Sacred Heart has been returned to its original splendour. Once the furnishing of the sanctuary is completed satisfactorily, the parishioners of Darlinghurst and the University Community will have a beautiful church in which to pray and worship. The partnership between the parish, the archdiocese and the University has been successful for all involved, and I look forward to welcoming the first graduates from the new university campus in a few years time, and to increasing vitality in a growing parish community. 2 ̆ 2 Media contact: Michelle Ebbs 040 895 913...|$|E
