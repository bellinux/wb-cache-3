5|$|Of the {{thirteen}} no-hitters pitched by Phillies players, three have been {{won by a}} score of 6–0, and three by a score of 1–0, more common than any other results. The largest margin of victory in a Phillies no-hitter was ten runs, in a 10–0 win by Chick Fraser. Charlie Ferguson's no-hitter, the first in franchise history, was a 1–0 victory, as {{were two of the}} more recent regular season no-hitters, thrown by Kevin Millwood in 2003 and Roy Halladay in 2010. Three pitchers to throw no-hitters for the Phillies have been left-handed: Johnny Lush (in 1906), Terry Mulholland (in 1990) and Cole Hamels (in 2015). The other eight pitchers were right-handed. Halladay is the only Phillies' pitcher to throw more than one no-hitter in a Phillies uniform, and others, including Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, have pitched more than one in their careers. The longest interval between Phillies no-hitters was between the games pitched by Lush and Bunning, encompassing 58 years, 1 month, and 20 days from May 1, 1906 to June 21, 1964. Conversely, the shortest interval between no-hitters was between Halladay's two 2010 no-hitters, with a total of merely four months and seven days from May 29 to October 6; the shortest gap between regular-season no-hitters was between Mulholland's and Tommy Greene's games (nine months and eight days from August 15, 1990 to May 23, 1991). Two <b>opponents</b> <b>have</b> been no-hit by the Phillies more than one time: the San Francisco Giants, who were defeated by Mulholland (in 1990) and Millwood (in 2003); and the Cincinnati Reds, who were no-hit by Rick Wise (in 1971) and Halladay (in 2010).|$|E

Frist received enormous praise from former First Lady Nancy Reagan for supporting expanded federal financing for stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|While a team is short-handed, {{they are}} {{permitted}} to ice the puck as they wish, without having the icing infraction called against them.

25|$|Proponents and <b>opponents</b> <b>have</b> {{been both}} criticized for overstating the {{benefits}} or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy.|$|E

With the loss, Arkansas had only scored six points in two SEC title game appearances, while in contrast, Razorback <b>opponents</b> <b>have</b> scored 64 points against them. Arkansas would make a much better showing their next time in Atlanta, but fail to win again in the 2006 SEC Championship Game against the Florida Gators.|$|E
25|$|Arguments between proponents {{and opponents}} of the current electoral system include four {{separate}} but related topics: indirect election, disproportionate voting power by some states, the winner-takes-all distribution method (as chosen by 48 of the 50 states), and federalism. Arguments against the Electoral College in common discussion focus mostly on the allocation of the voting power among the states. Gary Bugh's research of congressional debates over proposed constitutional amendments to abolish the Electoral College reveals reform <b>opponents</b> <b>have</b> often appealed to a traditional version of representation, whereas reform advocates have tended to reference a more democratic view.|$|E
25|$|<b>Opponents</b> <b>have</b> {{argued that}} at least in North America, wolves {{contribute}} little to overall livestock losses. In 2005 0.11% of all cattle losses were due to wolves. In states with wolf populations, they were responsible {{for an average of}} 2.5% of predation on sheep. Jim Dutcher, a filmmaker who raised a captive wolf pack, observed that the wolves were very reluctant to try meat that they had not previously eaten or seen another wolf eat before, possibly explaining why livestock depredation is unlikely except in cases of desperation. In Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, wolf predation accounts for 1% of total sheep deaths.|$|E
