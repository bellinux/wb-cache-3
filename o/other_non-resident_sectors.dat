50|$|Alternatively, Indo-Canadian {{culture has}} {{developed}} its own identity compared to <b>other</b> <b>non-resident</b> Indians and {{from people in}} India. It {{is not uncommon to}} find youth uninterested with traditional Indian cultural elements and events, instead identifying with mainstream North American cultural mores. However such individuals exist in a minority and there are many youth that maintain a balance between western and eastern cultural values, and occasionally fusing the two to produce a new product, such as the new generation of Bhangra incorporating hip hop based rhythm. For instance, Sikh youth often mix in traditional Bhangra, which uses Punjabi instruments with hip hop beats as well as including rap with Black music entertainers. Notable entertainers include Raghav and Jazzy B.|$|R
50|$|The {{resident}} {{members of}} the Hospital consisted of a custos or warden, two or more priests, three or more brethren, some ten sisters, three or more poor men and women — who were to make themselves generally useful according to their health and strength. Besides these, there were various officials and servants necessary for so large an establishment, such as cook, barber surgeon, laundress, dairymaid, cowherd, shepherd, brewer, and swineherd. There {{appears to have been}} a large body of men, partially non-resident, who, acting as under-stewards, managed the various properties of the Hospital, and had to give account thereof to the warden.

40|$|Drawing on a {{combination}} of qualitative methods using data collected from gay neighborhoods in Chicago and Washington, DC, this article develops the notion of vicarious citizenship—the exercise of rights and claims-making by nonresidential stakeholders who personally identify politically, economically, or socio-culturally with a local community. Vicarious citizens include a diversity of self-identified com-munity members, some of whom were former or displaced residents of the neigh-borhood, who draw on a variety of socio-territorial practices to mobilize against per-ceived normative and political threats to their visions of authentic community. At times, vicarious citizens may hold differing and even conflicting perspectives on the functions of community, challenging the claims of local residents and those with more material stakes in the local area. I argue the notion of vicarious citizenship can expand our understanding of how gay neighborhoods remain relevant among certain LGBT populations who, for a variety of reasons, select into neighborhoods outside established gay areas. Vicarious citizenship can also be found in <b>other</b> <b>non-resident</b> communities...|$|R
5000|$|Under current law, [...] imposes an {{expatriation}} tax on [...] "covered expatriates". The term [...] "covered expatriates" [...] {{is defined}} in [...] as former citizens or long-term residents whose world-wide assets exceeded $2 million, whose five-year average tax liability exceeded $148,000, or who could not certify that they complied with their U.S. tax obligations for the five years preceding their loss of citizenship. The tax {{is equivalent to the}} 15% capital gains tax that would be paid on a sale at the marked-to-market value of all of the former citizen's property. When Saverin renounced, he had to pay that expatriation tax. Going forward, under existing law he receives similar treatment to <b>other</b> <b>non-resident</b> aliens: he is exempt from U.S. capital gains tax on U.S. investments, but is subject to a 30% withholding tax on U.S.-source dividends and interest payments. He is no longer subject to U.S. gift or estate taxes; however, [...] imposes an equivalent inheritance tax on U.S. citizen or U.S. resident heirs of covered expatriates.|$|R

50|$|Blackville is {{considered}} the Salmon Capital of the Miramichi. It boasts plenty of excellent fishing pools, and New Brunswick yields {{tens of thousands of}} fish every year for anglers. Atlantic salmon fishing in North America is restricted to fly fishing only and there are strict seasons, catch limits and <b>other</b> restrictions. <b>Non-residents</b> of New Brunswick are required to hire a licensed guide to fish for Atlantic salmon. Guides are available locally and one can be hired to serve up to three anglers. The Main Southwest Miramichi is also one of only a few remaining rivers in which the fishing rights are still privately owned in North America and fishing access can be difficult unless arranged through a commercial sporting camp or outfitter. Numerous salmon flies were credited as invented in the Blackville area, including the Blackville Special, Reliable and Oriole. The Miramichi River produces nearly fifty percent of all the rod-caught salmon in North America.|$|R

5000|$|California is a [...] "may issue" [...] {{state for}} permits to carry {{concealed}} guns. The willingness of issuing authorities in California ranges from No Issue in most urban areas to Shall Issue in rural counties. Additionally, the issuing authority can also impose {{restrictions on the}} CCW permit-holder, such as limiting concealed carry only to the purposes listed on the approved CCW permit application. However, concealed carry permits are valid statewide, regardless of where they were issued. This creates a situation where residents in presumptively No Issue locations such as Los Angeles and San Francisco cannot lawfully carry a concealed firearm, but residents from other counties with more permissive CCW issuance policies can lawfully carry within these same jurisdictions. California does not recognize concealed carry permits issued by <b>other</b> states, and <b>non-residents</b> are generally forbidden from obtaining a California concealed carry permit.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} New Urbanists' contention that retail centers within easy walking of residential neighborhoods will attract {{a much higher}} walk and bike mode share and many fewer and shorter trips than planners and traffic engineers have typically assumed. This contention of the New Urbanists is {{compared to that of}} the travel behaviorists, who argue that travelers' choice of destinations for shopping is a function of modal availability, travel time and cost, and the number, amount and variety of land uses available at each destination, such that many residents will bypass shopping in their neighborhood and go to <b>other</b> destinations, while <b>non-residents</b> may choose to shop in the neighborhood based upon its attractiveness and accessibility. This paper answers the following general questions: Who uses neighborhood shopping districts? Under what conditions do the presence of retail activities within walking distance of housing support walking as a mode of transportation for non-work trips? This broad question is answered by considering the following related questions in traditional neighborhoods: (1) To what extent to these shopping areas attract residents and to what extent do they attract non-residents? (2) How do the complexity of travel, frequency of shopping and types of goods and services used by residents differ from those of non-residents? (3) What mode of transportation do the residents and non-residents use to get to the shopping areas? (4) What characteristics of travel (complexity of travel, frequency of travel) and shopping (types of stops influence mode choice? (5) How do the travel and shopping characteristics and the mode of travel vary among the shopping areas? (6) What level of shopping activity is supported in these shopping areas and can they include lower levels of parking as suggested by the New Urbanists? (7) What factors do customers consider in determining where to shop and how do these attitudes differ between walkers and non-walkers? and (8) What factors lead merchants to locate in various shopping areas and how well do merchants understand their customer base...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{constructs}} financial-account {{stock data}} for Denmark 1875 - 2005 {{on an annual}} frequency and explores the historical monetary and financial trends and cycles {{on the basis of}} the new data set. The annual financial-account data constructed in the paper are based on a comprehensive range of historical financial statistics. The data set presented is broken down by 8 institutional sectors (central bank; commercial banks and savings banks; mortgage-credit institutes; lifeinsurance companies and pension funds; investment associations; central government; <b>other</b> residents; <b>non-residents)</b> and 6 main types of financial instruments (gold and SDR; currency; loans and deposits; bonds, shares and mutual funds shares; insurance technical reserves; capital and reserves). Commercial banks, savings banks and mortgage-credit institutions played a significant credit-supplying role in the Danish economy already during the late 19 th century and in the beginning of the twentieth century. A turning point emerged during the early 1930 s, and by the middle of the 1950 s the ratio of credit to GDP had declined substantially. Since then the trend has reversed but the pre-World War I level was not reached until the decade from the mid- 1970 s to the mid- 1980 s. To some extent real asset prices have displayed a similar pattern. There has been a massive growth in the assets under management by life-insurance companies and pension funds since the mid- 1970 s and by collective investment funds since the mid- 1990 s. There has been a much stronger positive correlation between money and prices at the longterm frequencies (8 - 40 years cycles) than at the business cycle frequency (2 - 8 years), but in the post-World War II period prices seem to have led money at all frequencies. In the period 1875 - 1945 house prices led credit from mortgage-credit institutions with a considerable leadtime (6 years) in the long-term cycles - in the post World War II period the lead-time has been considerable shorter (1 year). During the whole period 1875 - 2005 real credit granted by banks and mortgage-credit institutions have been almost contemporaneous with real GDP, and the largest correlation coefficients have occurred in the long-term cycles. The overall conclusion in the paper is that financial accounts are a useful framework for organising and analysing financial data even when data sources are somewhat fragmented and sparse, which is often the case in relation to historical financial statistics. Financial accounts can be useful in an attempt to paint a more coherent picture of the historical development of the financial system and the financial structure. Utilising accounting identities a system of financial accounts allows e. g. for the compilation of the net financial asset position of the non-financial private sector, even when no separate balance-sheet statistics covers this sector. To date projects related to historical national-accounts have - both in Denmark and internationally - only focused on the real side of the economy. It would, however, be interesting if future projects would make an attempt to cover long-span time series of financial accounts as well, including both stock- and flow-data...|$|R
40|$|In India, {{airports}} {{were totally}} owned and managed by central {{government or the}} armed forces. The Airport Authority of India (AAI), a body functioning under the Ministry of Civil Aviation was responsible for managing the airports in India. In 2000, there were 117 usable airports (including 26 civilian enclaves maintained by the military) in India, which according to ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) was more than China, which had 76 airports. Out of these, scheduled commercial operations were made only to 61 airports. According to projections, Indian air passenger traffic was estimated to grow to 100 million passengers by 2012 from 36. 98 million in 1998 - 99. Growth projections in the cargo front were also promising. The draft policy on Airport Infrastructure of December 1997 acknowledged the importance of developing airport infrastructure in the country. Airport infrastructure was linked to development of India international competitiveness and her ability to attract foreign investments. The policy opened the doors of private investment in this sector, including investments from foreign airport authorities. Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) was the first airport in India {{to be built in}} the joint sector with public - private participation. The airport users and <b>other</b> benefactors, mainly <b>non-resident</b> Indians, the general public, government of Kerala (GOK) and the airport service providers came together to build an airport of international standards. The new Cochin airport project was an alternative to the existing civil enclave in the naval airport, which was not capable of handling larger aircraft due to runway limitations. The development of this airport took place initially irrespective of the policy on airport infrastructure. Some of the parameters of this policy evolved as a result of CIAL. The cost of expanding the existing airport was almost equal to the cost of constructing a new airport. Further, it was considered near to impossible to obtain budgetary support form Government of India (GOI) for expanding the existing airport. The involvement of users was a pioneering concept of this project, which was conceived even while a definite policy on private participation in airport infrastructure was not in place. The process of project and financial structuring, project management including land acquisition and resource mobilization, dealing with regulatory bodies and managing early operations in the context of CIAL offers a rich learning experience for governance in developing successful infrastructure projects. This paper begins with the case study of CIAL, from which implications for governance and risk management are examined. The significant governance issues are land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement of project affected people, project development ensuring viability of airports and staffing. The key areas of risk management are political risk, revenue risk, operating risk and regulatory risk. ...|$|R
