5|$|I. C. Filitti {{studied at}} Saint Sava National College, {{where he was}} colleagues with future {{politician}} (and adversary) Ion G. Duca. He was an eminent student, who earned top distinctions annually, {{and moved on to}} study at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. His first ever published work as a historian was a French-language tome, Le Rôle diplomatique des phanariotes de 1700 à 1821 ("The Diplomatic Role of Phanariotes from 1700 to 1821"). Signed Jean C. Filitti, it was probably his Licence ès Lettres, and, although receiving good reviews, was never listed by its author in his official résumés. He became a Doctor of Law in 1904, when he published the first draft <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> about Regulamentul Organic as the first ever Romanian constitution.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{topology}} depends strongly on {{the ideas}} of set theory, developed by Georg Cantor in the later part of the 19th century. In addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, Cantor considered point sets in Euclidean space as part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Fourier series. For further developments, see point-set topology and algebraic topology.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, he {{conducted}} research in Sierra Leone and at Tela, Honduras. In the 1930s {{he returned to}} the U.S.A. and worked at the Worcester State Hospital, Worcester, Massachusetts, from whence he was commissioned to conduct a study for the Research Council on Problems of Alcohol. The eventual outcome <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> was the 1942 book, Alcohol Addiction and Chronic Alcoholism.|$|E

25|$|The {{second part}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> {{involved}} an offended hospital administration challenging Rosenhan to send pseudopatients to its facility, whom its staff would then detect. Rosenhan agreed {{and in the}} following weeks out of 193 new patients the staff identified 41 as potential pseudopatients, with 19 of these receiving suspicion from at least one psychiatrist and one other staff member. In fact, Rosenhan had sent no pseudopatients to the hospital.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Kerouac {{discovered}} Dwight Goddard's A Buddhist Bible at the San Jose Library, which {{marked the}} beginning <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Buddhism. However, Kerouac had earlier taken an interest in Eastern thought. In 1946 he read Heinrich Zimmer's Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization. In 1955, Kerouac wrote a biography of Siddhartha Gautama, titled Wake Up: A Life of the Buddha, which was unpublished during his lifetime, but eventually serialized in , 1993–95. It was published by Viking in September 2008.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} study the {{development}} of these learning sets, Harlow needed access to developing primates, so he established a breeding colony of rhesus macaques in 1932. Due to the nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study,</b> Harlow needed regular access to infant primates and thus chose to rear them in a nursery setting, rather than with their protective mothers. This alternative rearing technique, also called maternal deprivation, is highly controversial to this day, and is used, in variants, as a model of early life adversity in primates.|$|E

25|$|In {{the east}} window {{there is a}} Tree of Jesse commemorating Pusey, {{who was one of}} the leaders of the 19th-century Oxford Movement in the Church of England. Pusey died in 1882 and Pusey House was {{established}} as his memorial. The window is by Sir Ninian Comper and contains figures of Old Testament prophets, and fathers of the Church, representing some of the areas <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study,</b> surrounding Christ in Majesty and the Virgin and Child. The figure of Pusey can be seen, kneeling at the base of the second light from the right.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, he {{went for}} a period of Islamic study at a Shiite seminary in Najaf, Iraq. Nasrallah was forced to return to Lebanon in 1979, by that time having {{completed}} the first part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study,</b> as Saddam Hussein was expelling many Shia's, including Khomeini and Abbas Musawi a year earlier. Back in Lebanon, he studied and taught at the school of Amal’s leader Abbas al-Musawi, later being selected as Amal's political delegate in Beqaa, and making him a member of the central political office. Around the same time, in 1980, Saddam Hussein had Sadr executed.|$|E
25|$|Stove {{notes that}} in part one he has only {{demonstrated}} how an irrational position might be expressed, {{in such a way}} as it had some appearance of credibility, not that such a position is actually held by the subjects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study.</b> He now turns to establishing this second point. The philosophers he is criticising not only use language in unusual ways, but do indeed also make plain language assertions of an irrationalist nature. Stove presents examples of what he believes are the clearest statements of irrationalism in their writing. Ultimately he considers providing examples from Karl Popper suffices. He presents the quotes and paraphrases apparently in ascending order of irrationality.|$|E

In {{the last two years}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> he combined playing for the national team. The World Cricket League games in Namibia proved that he still had the level to play at international level as he steered the Netherlands home with a 65 to win by 1 wicket. The Netherlands also played the English Lions in a 3-match series, which surprisingly the Dutch won 2-1. Van Bunge had his part to play with some solid scores.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by the {{advances}} {{being made in}} the area of localized function within the brain, Paul Broca committed much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> to the phenomena of how speech is understood and produced. Through his study, it was discovered and expanded upon that we articulate via the left hemisphere. Broca's observations and methods are widely considered to be where neuropsychology really takes form as a recognizable and respected discipline. Armed with the understanding that specific, independent areas of the brain are responsible for articulation and understanding of speech, the brains abilities were finally being acknowledged as the complex and highly intricate organ that it is. Broca was essentially the first to fully break away from the ideas of phrenology and delve deeper into a more scientific and psychological view of the brain.|$|E
25|$|In When The Gods Came Down, Alford {{extended}} the scope <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> to Mesopotamian and biblical mythology. In this book, he separated his own exploded planet hypothesis of myth from Van Flandern’s exploded planet hypothesis of science. He {{argued that the}} Sumerian religion had been an ‘exploded planet cult’ and that its central myth had been encoded in tales of the gods {{coming down from the}} sky– of the deluge and the creation of man– of the wars between gods of heaven and earth– and of the sacred marriage of the god and the goddess. One of his most controversial claims was that the story of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ allegorised the fate of the heavenly planet, and that Jesus in all probability never existed unless as the lead actor in an ancient Passion play.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese scholar Shu Hikosaka on {{the basis}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Buddhist scriptures, ancient Tamil {{literary}} sources, as well as field survey, proposes the hypothesis that, the ancient mount Potalaka, the residence of Avalokiteśvara described in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra and Xuanzang’s Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, is the real mountain Pothigai in Ambasamudram, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. Shu also says that mount Potalaka has been a sacred place {{for the people of}} South India from time immemorial. It is the traditional residence of Siddhar Agastya, at Agastya Mala. With the spread of Buddhism in the region beginning {{at the time of the}} great king Aśoka in the third century BCE, it became a holy place also for Buddhists who gradually became dominant as a number of their hermits settled there. The local people, though, mainly remained followers of the Hindu religion. The mixed Hindu-Buddhist cult culminated in the formation of the figure of Avalokiteśvara.|$|E
25|$|In 1593, Galileo {{became a}} {{consultant}} to the Arsenal, advising military engineers and instrument makers and helping to solve shipbuilders' problems, many of them relating to matters of ballistics. He was also responsible for creating some major innovations in the production and logistics of the Arsenal. As a result of his interactions with the Arsenal, Galileo published a book later in his life addressing a new field of modern science, that concerned with the strength and resistance of materials. This science largely saw its roots in the knowledge of the shipwrights of the Venetian Arsenal. It is also supposed that Galileo's initial visits to the Arsenal were {{as a result of his}} initiative to further investigate Aristotle's questions concerning shipbuilding and navigation, found in the Mechanical Questions of Aristotle. As a result of these investigations, which were pursued by observing the work of the shipwrights, Galileo was asked to help in resolving a specific problem with the rowing units of the galleys. As a result <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> of Aristotle, and in particular Question 4 regarding the propulsion of ships by oar, Galileo was able to produce a response to this question and ended up becoming a major source of information for the shipbuilders of the Arsenal concerning matters of rowing, instruments, and ballistics.|$|E
25|$|La música en Cuba (The Music of Cuba) is an ethno-musicological {{study of}} the Music of Cuba {{starting}} from the sixteenth century {{with the arrival of}} European explorers, until the present day of publication, the mid-twentieth century. The blending of different culturesblack, white, mulattoes, criollos and nativesmirrors the blending of Cuba’s two main musical styles, the Christian European music and the elemental percussion and rhythm-based music of the transported Africans and aboriginal peoples of the island. The book includes a general history of music in colonized Latin America but mainly focuses on Cuban styles of music and dance, influential Cuban musicians and Cuban musical identity. Carpentier devotes a great deal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>study</b> to exploring the influence African descendants had on Cuban music. He has an entire chapter titled, “Los Negros” ("The Blacks") that explores the many substantial ways African music influenced all of Latin American music. According to Carpentier, the African influence on Cuban music in particular was deliberately concealed by the colonist prejudice of 18th and 19th century Cuba. At the time of the book's publication many white Cubans were reluctant to even acknowledge the blending of the cultures much less investigate it. Carpentier, though, was eager to do so and by making bold statements about Cuba’s past and integral relationships {{with a wide range of}} cultures he succeeded in giving back to Cuba an in-depth academic perspective of its own cultural identity through its music.|$|E
