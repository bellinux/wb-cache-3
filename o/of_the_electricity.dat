5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> {{generated}} by Hydro-Québec Generation comes from hydroelectric dams located far from load centres such as Montreal. Of the 33,000MW of electrical power generated, over 93% of {{that comes from}} hydroelectric dams and 85% of that generation capacity comes from three hydroelectric generation centers: James Bay, Manic-Outardes, and Churchill Falls.|$|E
5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions {{depends on how much}} the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E

5|$|Gibson {{pursued a}} {{successful}} business career. He {{worked as a}} salesman for Hoover products. In January 1933 he established his own company A.H. Gibson (Electrical), which was a distributor of electrical appliances and parts. He also spent some time working in New York. His company became A.H. Gibson Industries Ltd, and was listed on the stock exchange from 1949 to 1959, during which period he was chairman and managing director. Gibson also held other directorships, most notably of Volkswagen Australasia from 1961 to 1967 and Hoover Australia from 1964 to 1970. An active member of Victoria's wider business community in the 1940s, he was President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electricity</b> and Radio Federation of Victoria (1947–1949) and President of the Institute of Sales and Business Management (1946–1949).|$|E
5|$|He {{served on}} the boards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Electricity</b> Trust and the Housing Trust, among others. Here, unused to not being in {{absolute}} control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant to disagree with their former boss, regardless of their expertise. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard.|$|E
5|$|In net {{metering}} the price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> produced {{is the same}} as the price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E

5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> {{customers}} in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water {{in the city of}} Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, {{there was a lack of}} gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electricity</b> used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted {{to the location of}} the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E
