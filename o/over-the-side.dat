5000|$|... 2014: A {{main area}} of focus during Arctic West Summer 2014 (AWS14) was {{the study of}} {{phytoplankton}} blooms along the Chukchi Sea. [...] Healy also worked {{in conjunction with the}} United States Coast Guard Research and Development Center to test Aerostat balloons, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV), and oil tracking buoys.2013: Arctic West Summer 2013 (AWS13) consisted of four different missions for Healy, over which more than 19,000 miles were covered. The first mission utilized Healys unique <b>over-the-side</b> science capabilities in order to collect organisms and create an ecological picture of the Hanna Shoal region. The second mission yielded sediment samples from the Mackenzie River Basin through the use of coring devices. For the third mission the Coast Guard Research Development Center, in coordination with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, deployed numerous equipment for testing and development. The fourth and final mission deployed subsurface moorings and conducted numerous Conductivity, Temperature, Depth (CTD) tests to study the Alaskan Boundary Current. A group of researchers from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory tested their Submarine Team Behaviors Tool with the Healy crew in September 2013. They were part of the 50 person science team from the USCG Research and Development Center that evaluated technology for the recovery of [...] "simulated oil trapped in or under ice at the polar ice edge".2012: In January 2012, Healy escorted the Russian-flagged freighter Renda through pack ice to deliver an emergency supply of fuel to Nome, Alaska. Such a winter delivery had never been attempted before because the ice floes are 1 to 5 ft thick during the winter season. The resupply was vital to the city, and was the first-ever winter fuel delivery from the water in Western Alaska. Over the course of Arctic West Summer 2012 (AWS12), Healy travelled over 18,000 nautical miles and conducted 687 science casts. Healy also added 25% more data to the bathymetric mapping project of the extended continental shelf through multibeam sonar bottom-mapping. [...] This data was collected in support of the delineation of the American and Canadian continental shelves.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the growth of joint venture operations in the US Fishery Conservation Zone in the North Pacific since 1977. Joint ventures currently in operation are outlined and the foreign and domestic partners described. The most common joint ventures {{in the area are}} contractual joint ventures, which include <b>over-the-side</b> sales of fish, joint lease of processing ships and marketing, seafood trade agreements and joint ventures through US subsidiaries of foreign companies. Supply and demand factors in the joint venture market are analysed and it is pointed out that the joint ventures market does not satisfy the main principles of perfect competition. The author concludes that, because it is an imperfect market, US fishermen receive less for their fish than they would under pure competition conditions.

40|$|During the USCGC Healy ice {{trials in}} Baffin Bay in April/May 2000, the sea ice {{thickness}} and strength, {{as well as}} the snow thickness, were measured. The thickness of the ice was measured. The thickness of the ice was measured by augering, by an electromagnetic (EM) method, from cores, and with an <b>Over-the-Side</b> Video (OTSV). Good agreement was found from these methods in the first year ice, but less good for the two cores of multi-year ice. The snow thickness was measured by point survey measurements and from the OTSV. The OTSV method gave snow thicknesses consistently greater than the point measurement. These different methods are described and the results obtained are discussed. Sea ice strength was determined by drilling cores either by hand or with the RapidCore equipment, measuring temperature, salinity and density, and then calculating flexural strength. The mean strength of the first year ice was 315 kPa (46 psi) and the mean strength of two multi-year cores was 714 kPa (104 psi). Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Emergency crew escape {{capabilities}} {{have been}} less than adequate for fighter aircraft since before WW II. From the <b>over-the-side</b> bailout of those days through the current ejection seat with a rocket catapult, escaping from a disabled aircraft has been risky at best. Current efforts are underway toward developing a high-tech, smart ejection seat that will give fighter pilots more room {{to live in the}} sky, but an escape capsule is needed to meet current and future fighter envelopes. Escape capsules have a bad reputation due to past examples of high weight, poor performance and great complexity. However, the advantages available demand that a capsule be developed. This capsule concept will minimize the inherent disavantages and incorporate the benefits while integrating all aspects of crew station design. The resulting design is appropriate for a crew station of the year 2010 and includes improved combat acceleration protection, chemical or biological combat capability, improved aircraft to escape system interaction, and the highest level of escape performance achievable. The capsule is compact, which can allow a reduced aircraft size and weighs only 1200 lb. The escape system weight penalty is only 120 lb higher than that for the next ejection seat and the capsule has a corresponding increase in performance...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyse}} the {{repeatability}} of the University manufactured over-the- side mount for the recently acquired R 2 Sonic Multibeam Echosounder, by analysing the Roll, Pitch and Heading values for various calibration routines performed {{through a number}} of mobilisation periods from 2013 to 2014. For the analysis, data provided by Gwyn Jones from previous surveys and data obtained by the Author, was processed through QINSy Validator using the Calibration Alignment Tool. The results of which were used to compare and contrast between respective calibration routines. A large number of calibration routines could not be used due to less than optimal survey sites or errors in the data acquisition, leading to a recommendation of processing said calibrations before any subsequent surveys are carried out, and ultimately greatly reducing the amount of data {{that could be used for}} the analysis. Given the lack of the subsequent usable data it was hard determine with great certainty the degree of repeatability of re-seating the assembly after raising and lowering. It was, however, identified that there are notions of repeatability found within the results that would pertain to the over-side-mount having the ability to re-seat. Additionally, it was found that the assembly did not move through the ‘control’ calibration, whereby the pole was not raised, giving a confidence level to the assembly during surveys. With more data, a more rigorous analysis c be performed to ascertain with certainty that the <b>over-the-side</b> mount is repeatable between raising and lowering. A number of stability measures have also been suggested along with general survey practice for when conducting MBES surveys...|$|E
40|$|As an open cast mine {{reaches its}} {{economic}} limit {{many companies are}} deciding to leave a void up against the final high wall which subsequently fills up with water and deposited material. Sedimentation and deposited material build up in flooded open cast mine workings and is not being accounted for in the future mine plan and cost modelling phase of these areas. To understand this anomaly of additional overburden removal and pumping requirements, a bathymetric sounding survey is required so that overburden and coal extraction productivity rates can be more accurately determined. Bathymetry data can be collected using {{a wide variety of}} sensors including: lead lines, single beam and multi beam acoustic depth sounders, as well as airborne laser sensors, but are usually collected as a series of cross section lines. Bathymetric techniques will be analysed to determine whether inexpensive bathymetric equipment coupled with Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can provide a high level of precision, accuracy and what effect different transect and point spacing have on the accuracy of the volumes of deposited material. Only lead line, single and multi beam acoustic techniques will be considered due to the remoteness and cost constraints for this project. A low cost digital single beam echo sounding system unit coupled with RTK GPS for positioning and navigation, temporarily installed in an <b>over–the-side</b> configuration on a small fibreglass boat, was employed for this project along with recommendations with respect to the logistical suitability of this method and its ability to achieve desired accuracy and precision. This research project validated that RTK GPS coupled with inexpensive digital bathymetric sounding equipment may be utilised effectively, is a viable solution to this problem and has identified possible further researc...|$|E
40|$|The whole {{programme}} of JC 55 {{changed with}} the extensive damage to the ROV Isis on day 5 of the 42 -day cruise. As a result Plan B, an <b>over-the-side</b> science programme {{was put in place}} and sampling with CTD/SAPs, Megacore, gravity cores and SHRIMP. This limited a number of aspects of the sampling and visual observation of the seabed but resulted in a programme that achieved a remarkably high proportion of the objectives of the cruise. In the Bransfield Strait some hydrothermal activity was observed at Hook Ridge, together with areas of reducing sediment but no areas of extensive hydrothermal activity. A Middle Sister a small anomaly in the Eh readings on the CTD suggested hydrothermal release but visual observation of the seabed showed only sedimented and old areas of pillow lava. At the Axe (aka Edifice A), despite extensive CTDs, {{there was no evidence of}} any modern hydrothermal activity. At the three sites we did obtain excellent samples for geochemical and water analysis, as well as samples for microbial analysis, macrofaunal and isotope analysis. Megafauna and mosaic analysis was not possible because of the loss of use of Isis. On moving to the East Scotia Ridge at E 9 we were able to use SHRIMP to locate the Twin Peaks area (first sighted in 2009) and obtain a third annual set of images over a specified area. Additional exploration did not find any additional vents to those found on JC 42. Water column sampling in the plume for chemistry and microbiology was successful. At the Kemp seamount crater there were successful stations for water chemistry and microbiology. A long SHRIMP transect over the venting area within the caldera was particularly successful and this together with fine scale mosaicking gave a clear map of this venting field. Planned fine scale sampling and ROV swath could not be completed. A SHRIMP transect at the nearby recently-mapped Adventure caldera discovered a small vent site on the southern side of the crater. Lastly, we returned to the putative cold seep site off the southwestern end of South Georgia. High CH 4 levels in the water column and reduced sediment in cores suggested methane release but two SHRIMP surveys revealed no evidence of surface expression of a cold seep...|$|E
