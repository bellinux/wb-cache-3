25|$|Each Nike battery {{consisted}} {{of two or three}} areas; IFC, LA and general. The LA consisted to a maximum of four launching sections, each section {{consisted of}} an underground storage area, an elevator to move missiles to and from the surface launchers, and four aboveground firing locations. One of these locations was directly above the elevator, the others were reached by manually pushing the missiles <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> to the launcher along rails. The LA also had a control van to control and monitor the LA activities and maintenance facilities.|$|E
25|$|For Neff's {{office at}} Pacific All Risk, Wilder and set {{designer}} Hal Pereira conspired {{to create a}} little in-house joke, typical of Billy Wilder. In the opening scenes, as Walter Neff stumbles <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{on his way to}} his office to record his confession, the vast two-tiered office is empty and dark. With the camera following him, Neff lurches towards the balcony railing overlooking rows and rows of uniform corporate desks. Neff turns left, but the camera continues forward until it reaches the brink and stares down for an anxious moment into a colorless American business purgatory. Here, Pereira is said to have copied an existing office: the corporate headquarters of Paramount Pictures in New York City.|$|E

25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The north entrance {{was closed}} in the 1940s after the front steps were discovered to be sinking. The driveway {{in front of this}} entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance was used as the main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode the elevator to the roof. But he touched a power line as he climbed <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was {{closed in the}} 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded.|$|E
500|$|A [...] high wooden {{platform}} {{was constructed}} [...] to the south-east of Trinity ground zero (...) and [...] of TNT were stacked {{on top of}} it. Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> lifting {{them up to the}} platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the pile of boxes of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with [...] of beta ray activity and [...] of gamma ray activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured it into the tubing.|$|E
500|$|... "Office Olympics" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Schur. This episode was the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Producer Greg Daniels said {{the idea for the}} actual Office Olympics stemmed from The King of the Hill Office Olympics, which were created and ran by Daniel's former assistant Tim Croston and the show's two production assistants at the time: Tony Gennaro and Seranie Manoogian. The games were held in the King of the Hill offices, where Daniel served as executive producer. Daniels later elaborated on the types of games they played, stating [...] "Like, who’s going to get <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> first and races in chairs. The funny thing is then it became a TV episode and it has now gone full circle and I hear offices are doing it all over." [...] After the episode aired, other [...] "Office Olympics" [...] were organized in actual offices across the country. The Chicago Tribune organized an interview with a majority of The Office cast members who—in character—explained the rules to the various games. The Yogurt Lid Medals reappear in the third season finale, [...] "The Job": Receiving the lid and a note from Pam is the catalyst for Jim's decision between Pam and Karen.|$|E
50|$|If {{the initial}} height of <b>the</b> object falling <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{is less than}} 23,000 km, its orbit will have an apogee at the {{altitude}} where it was released from <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and a perigee within Earth's atmosphere; it will intersect the atmosphere within a few hours, and not complete an entire orbit. Above this critical altitude, the perigee is above the atmosphere, and the object {{will be able to}} complete a full orbit, returning to the altitude that it started from. By then, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> would be somewhere else, but a spacecraft could be dispatched to retrieve the object or otherwise remove it. The lower the altitude at which <b>the</b> object falls <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> greater the eccentricity of its orbit.|$|R
50|$|A bombing {{occurred}} on the 8th floor on August 20, 1969, injuring 20 people. The bomb, which police estimated to {{be the equivalent of}} 25 sticks of dynamite, was placed in a hallway just <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> some time during the evening and it exploded at around 10:30PM. The injured were on the night shift in the bank's stock bookkeeping department and were working {{on the other side of}} the corridor wall. Fortunately, the inside of this wall was lined with floor-to-ceiling automated file units that weighed 3 tons each and which absorbed most of the blast. Without them, the 20 injuries would all have been fatalities. The blast moved the file units about a foot, blew out all the windows on that side of the building and opened a 5 ft hole in the reinforced concrete floor. The bomber, Sam Melville, was convicted of this and seven other 1969 Manhattan bombings and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was killed by a state sharpshooter during the Attica Prison riots in September 1971.|$|R
50|$|The inquiry {{heard that}} the first officer {{had been unable to}} find all the control chocks {{normally}} used to lock the control surfaces on the aircraft while it was parked. There were concerns that one of the aircraft's control chocks might have been left in position instead of being removed before takeoff. The inquiry heard that all chocks were eventually accounted for. There was also a concern that one of the aileron chocks might have been inadvertently inserted in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> circuit. Chief Inspector James Harper told the inquiry that he made some test flights in a DC-3 aircraft in a similar configuration to the Fitzroy on the accident flight. One test showed that the DC-3 could be flown satisfactorily even with an aileron chock in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> circuit. Harper was satisfied the aircraft did not take <b>off</b> with <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> locked.|$|R
500|$|A {{year later}} a further {{discovery}} {{was made at}} Lindow Moss, just [...] south-west of the Lindow Woman. On 1 August 1984, Andy Mould, who {{had been involved in}} the discovery of Lindow Woman, took {{what he thought was a}} piece of wood <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> of the peat-shredding machine. He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it to be a human foot. The police were called and the foot was taken away for examination. Rick Turner, the Cheshire County Archaeologist, was notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of the body, which later became known as Lindow Man. Some skin had been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further deterioration of the body, it was re-covered with peat. The complete excavation of the block containing the remains was performed on 6 August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the Macclesfield District General Hospital for storage. As the body of Malika Reyn-Bardt had still not been found, it was thought possible the body might be hers, until it was determined to be male, and radiocarbon dated. The owners of the land on which Lindow Man was found donated the body to the British Museum, and on 21 August it was transported to London.|$|E
2500|$|Police found {{a bloody}} {{fingerprint}} smudge on the doorjamb {{of the entrance}} door. Also, there was a possible eyewitness to the killer's escape. An [...] "eye-witness", George Weinberg, heard gunshots at about 4 am.

2500|$|The {{lines to}} enter the {{observation}} decks, according to Concierge.com, are [...] "as legendary as the building itself:" [...] there are five of them: the sidewalk line, the lobby elevator line, the ticket purchase line, the second elevator line, and the line to get <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and onto the observation deck. For an extra fee tourists can skip {{to the front of}} the line. The Empire State Building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks, making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years.|$|E
50|$|In 1887, Alexander Miles of Duluth {{patented}} {{an electric}} elevator. He did not invent the first elevator; however, his design was very important. He improved {{the method of}} the opening and closing of elevator doors and he improved {{the closing of the}} opening to <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft when an elevator was not on that floor. At that time elevator patrons or operators were required to manually shut a door to cut <b>off</b> access to <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft, and he created an automatic mechanism that closed access to the shaft.|$|R

After Peggy catches her in a lie meant to cover up her going to an audition, Megan confesses as much to Peggy, who scolds her for taking a high-value job in the agency that others would [...] "kill to have". Late one night, Megan wakes Don up to tell him of her desire to start acting again, and with Don's {{apparent}} blessing, she quits her job at the agency the next morning. Don sees her <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> as she leaves the office. Moments after Megan leaves, Don calls up another <b>elevator.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> doors open, Don looks down to find no elevator, just a bare elevator shaft. He peers down into the empty abyss and then steps backward.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} option, {{the whole group}} non-violently takes over the {{security}} room and stabilize the market while Shaw talks the suicidal man out of bombing the train. Left with little time, the Machine deploys the third option, even though it only has a 2.07% chance of the team's survival in taking over <b>the</b> <b>elevator.</b> These odds increase to 22.48% when Shaw arrives with explosives to fend <b>off</b> <b>the</b> attackers. <b>The</b> <b>elevator,</b> however, stops functioning right as {{they are about to}} escape.

As such, Martine (Cara Buono) catches up and shoots Shaw multiple times while Root and the team watch in horror.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, J.W. Meaker {{patented}} {{a method}} which permitted elevator doors {{to open and}} close safely. In 1887, American Inventor Alexander Miles of Duluth, Minnesota patented an elevator with automatic doors that would close <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft.|$|E

We have also de-veloped a method to calculate the 3 D positions using a single camera and a single artificial landmark for a simple, stable and low cost visual measurement system...|$|R
50|$|The power {{goes on and}} <b>off</b> in <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> {{and each}} time the power is restored, {{something}} evil takes place. Dwight falls to his death on top of <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> and Lustig is electrocuted trying to restore power. Soon people in <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> start dying, and the suspicion keeps shifting between all in <b>the</b> <b>elevator.</b> Vince is thrown into a mirror only to have his jugular vein sliced causing him to bleed to death, the old woman is hanged on a lamp cord from <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> ceiling, Ben winds {{up on the floor}} with his neck twisted, and Sarah's throat is slit by a broken piece of the mirror. Finally, the old woman, who is the devil and faked her death, is left with Tony, now revealed as Tony Janekowski by his fiancée, Cheryl (Zoie Palmer). Tony confesses to having been responsible for a hit-and-run five years ago in which he killed a mother and her son. Detective Bowden hears him apologize over the radio. The Devil, powerless now that Tony has repented for his sin, curses before vanishing, and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> comes back online, sparing Tony's life. As the corpses of Sarah, Ben, and Vince are wheeled away, Bowden decides to take Tony into custody, and, while en route, informs him that he is the husband and father of the mother and son Tony killed in that accident. But despite saying he'd gone over what he'd say, or what he would do if they'd ever cross paths, he forgives Tony.|$|R
6000|$|I {{look back}} {{with a sigh of}} regret at those bright, early days in April when we were all buying hoes, and talking soil and waiting for the snow to be <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground. The street cars, as we went up and down to our offices, were a busy babel of garden talk. There was a sort of farmer-like geniality in the air. One spoke freely to strangers. Every man with a hoe was a friend. Men chewed straws in their offices, and kept looking out of windows to pretend to {{themselves}} that they were afraid it might blow up rain. [...] "Got your tomatoes in?" [...] one man would ask another as they went up in <b>the</b> <b>elevator.</b> [...] "Yes, I got mine in yesterday," [...] the other would answer, [...] "But I'm just a little afraid that this east wind may blow up a little frost.

50|$|As {{the mold}} disk is turning, <b>the</b> first <b>elevator</b> {{simultaneously}} rises to its upper {{position and the}} space bands and matrices are vertically aligned {{in preparation for the}} second transfer. The matrices have a series of teeth in a V-shaped notch on top, and as the transfer is completed, the matrices slide onto <b>the</b> second <b>elevator</b> bar which carries the matrices by these V-shaped notches. The space bands, having no such notches, remain in the second transfer channel and are soon gathered by two levers and pushed back into the space band box. While the space bands are being pushed into their box, <b>the</b> second <b>elevator</b> continues rising towards the distributing mechanism {{at the top of the}} machine, which returns the molds to their proper places in the magazine. At the top of the machine, a lever (the distributor shifter) moves left to get in position to push the incoming line of matrices <b>off</b> <b>the</b> second <b>elevator</b> and into <b>the</b> distributor box. This mechanism feeds the matrices at precise intervals such that they travel between three rotating screws. Each matrix is carried along a notched bar between the three screws until the notches on the bar and matrix match, whereupon the matrix drops down into its proper channel in the magazine.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic <b>elevators</b> {{dominated}} <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{market for}} 50 years – until {{the beginning of}} the 21 st century. With the emergence of machine-room-less (MRL) traction elevators in 1995, hydraulic elevators began dealing with increased competition. Nevertheless, fluid-driven systems have their distinct advantages, such as low maintenance cost due to wear-free driving com-ponents, flexibility of car and machine-room design, safety features, and easy and cost-effective installations. The room-saving properties of MRLs initially generated increasing numbers of MRL applica-tions. However, this shouldn’t be interpreted as a decreasing market for hydraulic <b>elevators,</b> since <b>the</b> fact is that hydraulic control-valve production is increasing yearly. As hydraulic elevators and their advantages become better known in developing countries, the increasing trend to MRLs is expected to level <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> future of <b>elevator</b> systems may become certain as their advantages and genuine costs become public. This article presents statistical information on <b>the</b> actual <b>elevator</b> market trend for low-rise buildings...|$|R
