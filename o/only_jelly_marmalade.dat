40|$|Nectarine is a {{subspecies}} of {{the peach}} which comes in summer, {{and is very}} advantageous because of high content of β-carotene. Like any other fruit it can be processed into half – product (puree, pulp), or final product (<b>jelly,</b> juice, <b>marmalade).</b> The primary ob-jective {{of this research was}} to determine how the time of storage and storage conditions affect rheological properties of nectarine puree. Rheological properties are shown as the rheological parameters and indicate consistency and viscosity, which are essential quality parameters of food products (or half–products). The measurements were carried out by rotation Rheometer, model VT 550 362 - 0001 HAAKE at 20 °C and shear rates 0 - 60 s- 1. The samples were kept at room temperature, in the refrigerator and in the freezer, during the period of 4 months. The results are presented graphically as the dependence of shear stress upon shear rate, and as a table which contains consistency coefficient and flow behaviour index. It is shown that consistency of all samples declines during storage time. The biggest change is in the samples stored in the freezer. Shear stress also declines during the storage time, most i...|$|R
5000|$|Special courses after a feast {{or dinner}} which often {{involved}} a special room or outdoor gazebo (sometimes {{known as a}} folly) with a central table set with dainties of [...] "medicinal" [...] value to help with digestion. These would include wafers, comfits of sugar-spun anise or other spices, <b>jellies</b> and <b>marmalades</b> (a firmer variety than we are used to, these would be more similar to our gelatin jigglers), candied fruits, spiced nuts and other such niceties. These would be eaten while standing and drinking warm, spiced wines (known as hypocras) or other drinks known to aid in digestion. One must remember that sugar in the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period was often considered medicinal, and used heavily in such things. This was not a course of pleasure, though {{it could be as}} everything was a treat, but one of healthful eating and abetting the digestive capabilities of the body. It also, of course, allowed those standing to show off their gorgeous new clothes and the holders of the dinner and banquet to show off the wealth of their estate, what with having a special room just for banqueting.|$|R
40|$|Levulose (D-fructose, fruit sugar), C 6 H 12 O 6 {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} ketohexose. This sugar has distinctive properties {{which make}} it of commercial interest. It is more costly than ordinary table sugar (sucrose). Levulose {{is characterized by a}} high degree of sweetness (6), great solubility (20), and medical usefulness when administered intravenously. Joslin (21) and Root and Baker (32) found levulose to be of great value in the treatment of diabetes. According to Daniel (8), it is assimilated and oxidized more quickly than sucrose, supplying the necessary energy requirements for the human system. Additional uses of levulose have been reported by McGlumphy and Eichinger (27), which include its application to improve the quality and the flavor of jams, <b>jellies,</b> <b>marmalades,</b> canned fruits, carbonated beverages, and corn sugar. Plants of the family compositae contain large amounts of levulose polymers, but the dahlia, chicory, and Jerusalem artichoke are the most promising sources because of the high levulose content and the ease of production (13). The tubers of Jerusalem artichoke were used in this study because they offer an inexpensive and prolific source from which levulose can be extracted. Since most of the levulose units in the artichoke tubers are linked together to form inulin or carbohydrate intermediate compounds between inulin and levulose, it is necessary to hydrolyze the material in order to free the levulose. Several investigators have reported the use of acid compounds. Anderson and Greaves (1) used H 2 SO 4 for hydrolysis, while Yamasaki (41) used HC 1 for the same purpose. Kleiderer and Englis (23) obtained complete hydrolysis of inulin by use of CO 2 and SO 2 at a pressure of 1000 pounds per square inch at 150 o C. for 60 minutes. As fare as can be determined from the literature, little work was done prior to 1953 using radioactive material to study peaceful uses of atomic energy. Since that time, a law was passed by the United States Congress authorizing the use of radioactive material for peaceful purposes, thereby making it possible to use atomic energy for this study. Since previous work has shown that gamma rays can convert starch to simple sugar (33), it was therefore, assumed that the inulin and other carbohydrate intermediates of Jerusalem artichoke upon hydrolysis by beta or gamma rays might yield fructose (35). The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of beta and gamma rays on inulin and other carbohydrate intermediate compounds present in the Jerusalem artichoke tubers and to compare the results with those obtained by hydrolysis with radiation plus hydrochloric acid...|$|R
