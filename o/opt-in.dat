English Language is taught in Year 10 and Literature the following year. Mathematics in taken by all pupils; they may <b>opt-in</b> for a GCSE in Statistics in Year 10, and the most able pupils may take Further Maths at GCSE in Year 11. Science courses are based on ability; pupils may study for three separate science qualifications, a dual or single award in Science or BTEC Applied Science. pupils may choose a modern foreign language (French, Spanish or German), a humanity (history or geography), computing or separate sciences (biology, chemistry and physics) for their options as part of the English Baccalaureate. Additionally, the school offers six technology courses at GCSE (electronics, food technology, graphics, product design, resistant materials and textiles), as well as art and design, drama, music, PE, RE and child development GCSE qualifications. Vocational courses are also offered at Level 2, including applied business, construction, engineering, health and social care, ICT, music, performing arts, and travel and tourism. Pupils also participate in work-related learning.|$|E

The Turnbull Liberal/National Coalition Government was quick to adopt changes to the program following the review.

The imposed limits included changes to some materials, limiting access to secondary schools as some material was not easily understood by younger students, and requiring parent <b>opt-ins.</b> Federal President of the Australian Education Union Correna Haythorpe criticised the decision requiring parent body consent before a school could instigate the program saying that decision should be made by educators.|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction]. This report {{constitutes}} Part II of {{the twin}} reports of the CEPS Task Force on Reviewing the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The Part I report, which {{was presented to the}} UK Presidency on 7 July 2005, 1 focused on a number of short-term implementation issues including transparency requirements for the National Allocation Plans (NAPs), the definition of installations, treatment of small installations, new entrants, closure and transfer rules, allocation methodologies, the possibility of <b>opt-ins</b> as well as monitoring, reporting and verification. This follow-up Part II report examines deep-seated topics such as whether the EU Emission Trading System (ETS) contributes to meeting Kyoto Protocol targets, economic impacts, effects on investment and the potential inclusion of aviation. These issues lie at the interface of NAP phase II and the longterm formal 2006 review. Neither of the two reports (Part I or Part II) examines issues related to the formal review of the EU ETS, which the Directive calls for no later than June 2006. Since this formal review, which will lead to an amendment of the Directive by co-decision, is likely to trigger a fundamental and longer-term debate, it is being treated in a separate CEPS Task Force launched in early 2006. After a status report of the ETS and a reminder of some fundamentals in sections 1 and 2, the following sections cover investment incentives (3), competitiveness (4 and 5) and aviation (6). The main findings of the report are contained in the Executive Summary, including Key Messages & Recommendations and an extended Full Summary.

25|$|Dayton {{took the}} oath of office to become Governor of Minnesota on January 3, 2011.

The first Democrat to serve as governor in 20 years, Dayton succeeded Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. On January 5, Governor Dayton signed two Executive Orders allowing the Minnesota Departments of Commerce and Health to apply for federal health-care grants, and provide $1.2 billion in federal funds toward an Early Option for a statewide Medicaid <b>Opt-In</b> program.

25|$|Because {{of public}} policies, cultural, infrastructural and other factors, presumed consent or opt-out models {{do not always}} {{translate}} directly into increased effective rates of donation. The United Kingdom has several different laws and policies for the organ donation process, such as consent of a witness or guardian must be provided to participate in organ donation. In terms of effective organ donations, in some systems like Australia (14.9 donors per million, 337 donors in 2011), family members are required to give consent or refusal, or may veto a potential recovery even if the donor has consented. Some countries with an opt-out system like Spain (36 effective donors per million inhabitants) or Austria (21 donors/million) have high donor rates and some countries with <b>opt-in</b> systems like Germany (16 donors/million) or Greece (6 donors/million) have lower effective donation rates. The president of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation has acknowledged Spain's legislative approach is likely not {{the primary reason for}} the country's success in increasing the donor rates, starting in the 1990s. Looking to the example of Spain, which has successfully adopted the presumed consent donation system, intensive care units (ICUs) must be equipped with enough doctors to maximize the recognition of potential donors and maintain organs while families are consulted for donation. The characteristic that enables the Spanish presumed consent model to be successful is the resource of transplant coordinators; it is recommended to have at least one at each hospital where opt-out donation is practiced to authorize organ procurement efficiently.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Ofsted {{recommended}} that Lincolnshire County Council review schools with under 600 pupils. Two years later, the Council's education officers suggested {{that some of}} these schools merge, close or federate to make them more economical. One such school was Lafford High in Billinghay, which had been under-performing in GCSE and A-level league tables. St George's became federated with Lafford and another small village school, Aveland High in Billingborough in 2005 and 2006 respectively. A plan to merge them into an Academy was announced the following year; Coteland's School in Ruskington was allowed to <b>opt-in.</b> When David Veal retired as headteacher of Coteland's in 2007, the school joined the federation; with that, Paul Watson became executive head of all four schools.

The County Council began consulting parents in 2008 about closing Lafford due to falling numbers. Despite denials from Watson, parents complained that he had lost [...] "passion" [...] for the school and that St George's [...] "cherry-picked" [...] the most able pupils.
