5|$|According to the 2001 census, 96% of the {{population}} was White British, and 2.1% non-white (mainly of British Asian origin). Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland; though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed immigrant workers from the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Politics in the Bay Area {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most liberal in California and in the United States. Since the late 1960s, the Bay Area cemented its role as the most liberal region in California politics, supporting the center left Democratic Party's candidates for U.S. President and continued to support Democratic candidates more than <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, even as California trended towards the Democratic Party over time. According to research by the Public Policy Institute of California, the Bay Area and the North Coast counties of Humboldt and Mendocino were the most consistently and strongly liberal areas in California.|$|E

Of the original zoological facilities in the park, the Deer Paddock, located near the present Carousel, was converted into a meadow and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located {{on the east side}} of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century.

5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and the Mojave Desert {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E
5|$|Waterloo was {{a decisive}} battle {{in more than}} one sense. Every {{generation}} in Europe up to the outbreak of the First World War looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history. In retrospect, it was seen as the event that ushered in the Concert of Europe, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress. The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, since the French Revolution of the early 1790s. It also ended the First French Empire and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.|$|E
5|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 {{men from the}} Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance {{to him and his}} government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E

The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any <b>other</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globe, {{due in part to}} <b>the</b> variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic climate and ecosystem and <b>the</b> characteristic ways <b>of</b> life of indigenous Arctic peoples.|$|R
5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments. Geographically and climatically we expect this, as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes, as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work in tracking bee colony changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globe among a wider array bee species to build the body of research on the impact of climate change on bees.|$|E
5|$|The {{pelagic zone}} {{contains}} macro- and microfauna and myriad zooplankton which drift with the currents. Most {{of the smallest}} organisms are the larvae of fish and marine invertebrates which liberate eggs in vast numbers because the chance of any one embryo surviving to maturity is so minute. The zooplankton feed on phytoplankton and on each other and form a basic part of the complex food chain that extends through variously-sized fish and other nektonic organisms, which are in turn eaten by larger squids, sharks, porpoises, dolphins, and whales. Some marine creatures make large migrations, either to <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean on a seasonal basis or up and down its vertical layers, often ascending to feed at night before descending to safety by day. Ships can introduce or spread invasive species through the discharge of ballast water or through the transport of organisms that have accumulated {{as part of the}} fouling community on the hulls of vessels.|$|E

5|$|As {{the once}} great Indian Ocean {{maritime}} {{power of the}} Chola dynasty in medieval India had waned and declined, Chinese sailors and seafarers began to increase their own maritime activity in South East Asia and into the Indian Ocean. Even during the earlier Northern Song period, when {{it was written in}} Tamil inscriptions under the reign of Rajendra Chola I that Srivijaya had been completely taken in 1025 by Chola's naval strength, the succeeding king of Srivijaya managed to send tribute to the Chinese Northern Song court in 1028. Much later, in 1077, the Indian Chola ruler Kulothunga Chola I (who the Chinese called Ti-hua-kia-lo) sent a trade embassy to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and made lucrative profits in selling goods to China. There were other tributary payers from <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world as well. The Fatimid-era Egyptian sea captain Domiyat traveled to a Buddhist site of pilgrimage in Shandong in 1008, where he presented the Chinese Emperor Zhenzong of Song with gifts from his ruling Imam Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, establishing diplomatic relations between Egypt and China that had been lost during the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907 (while the Fatimid state was established three years later in 910). During the Northern Song, Quanzhou was already a bustling port of call visited by a plethora of different foreigners, from Muslim Arabs, Persians, Egyptians, Hindu Indians, Middle-Eastern Jews, Nestorian Christians from the Near East, etc. Muslims from foreign nations dominated the import and export industry (see Islam during the Song dynasty). To regulate this enormous commercial center, in 1087 the Northern Song government established an office in Quanzhou {{for the sole purpose of}} handling maritime affairs and commercial transactions. In this multicultural environment there were many opportunities for subjects in the empire of foreign descent, such as the (Arab or Persian) Muslim Pu Shougeng, the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou between 1250 and 1275. Pu Shougeng had gained his reputable position by helping the Chinese destroy pirate forces that plagued the area, and so was lavished with gifts and appraisal from Chinese merchants and officials. Quanzhou soon rivaled Guangzhou (the greatest maritime port of the earlier Tang dynasty) as a major trading center during the late Northern Song. However, Guangzhou had not fully lost its importance. The medieval Arab maritime captain Abu Himyarite from Yemen toured Guangzhou in 993, and was an avid visitor to China. There were other notable international seaports in China during the Song period as well, including Xiamen (or Amoy).|$|E

25|$|The 19th century saw an {{unprecedented}} era of prosperity for the Mosel wine industry {{under the rule}} of Prussia starting with the historic vintage of 1819.

To promote the region's wine, the Prussian government lowered the tariffs for the import of Mosel wines to <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prussian kingdom. The development of the Zollverein customs union even further benefited the Mosel by reducing the customs on their wines traveling to <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German Confederation.
