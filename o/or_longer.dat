5|$|For half of {{the year}} <b>or</b> <b>longer,</b> adults live in slow-flowing river margins, lakes, or ponds, where {{reproduction}} takes place. Males perform a courtship display, and females lay around 200 eggs individually onto leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop two to four months in the water before reaching metamorphosis. For the remainder of the year, the newts live in shady land habitats, usually forests. Although not yet considered threatened, Danube crested newt populations have declined significantly, the reason being mainly habitat loss. The species is protected by law in the European Union.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, other {{coumarins}} {{are used}} instead of warfarin, such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab) but not for apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.|$|E

Some experts said that it could take six months <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> to pump all the water out of the city.|$|E
5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{may also}} occur during a gradual dosage reduction, but are {{typically}} less severe and may persist {{as part of}} a protracted withdrawal syndrome for months after cessation of benzodiazepines. Approximately 10% of patients experience a notable protracted withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for many months or in some cases a year <b>or</b> <b>longer.</b> Protracted symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a sub-acute level of severity. Such symptoms do gradually lessen over time, eventually disappearing altogether.|$|E

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids are the {{structural}} units (monomers) {{that make up}} proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins encoded by DNA/RNA genetic material is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome. The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy {{of one of the}} organism's genes.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer aged {{she began}} to suffer more {{frequent}} health problems. In June 1964, she underwent surgery to remove a kidney stone. Although the doctors initially predicted a six-week recovery, after two months they predicted {{that it might be}} a year <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> before she felt completely well. The following year, she suffered a mosquito bite that turned septic, prompting the doctors to offer skin grafts. In July 1973 she suffered a slight stroke and spent three weeks in a nursing home. When her brother Boris died later that year, Heyer was too ill to travel to his funeral. She suffered another stroke in February 1974. Three months later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer, which her biographer attributed to the 60–80 cork-tipped cigarettes that Heyer smoked each day (although she said she did not inhale). On 4 July 1974, Heyer died. Her fans learned her married name for the first time from her obituaries.|$|E

5|$|On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton offered {{conditional}} clemency to sixteen {{members of}} the FALN convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to bomb-making, and sedition, {{as well as for}} firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> in prison, which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received, according to the White House. Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce violence, at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress. Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 2011 (76 FR 81133), FMCSA {{published}} a final rule amending its hours-of-service (HOS) regulations for drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). The final rule adopted several {{changes to the}} HOS regulations, including a new provision requiring drivers to take a rest break during the work day under certain circumstances. Drivers may drive a CMV only if 8 hours or less have passed {{since the end of}} the driver’s last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of at least 30 minutes. FMCSA did not specify when drivers must take the 30-minute break, but the rule requires that they wait no longer than 8 hours after the last off-duty or sleeper-berth period of that length <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> to take the break. Drivers who already take shorter breaks during the work day could comply with the rule by taking one of the shorter breaks and extending it to 30 minutes. The new requirement took effect on July 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{contains}} medium-sized, semiaquatically specialized oryzomyine rodents. They have long, coarse fur that is grayish to reddish on the upperparts {{and white}} to buff on the underparts. The marsh rice rat superficially resembles the introduced species black rat and brown rat, but has larger differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The vibrissae (whiskers) are short and the ears {{are small and}} well-haired. The tail is usually as long as <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> than the head and body and is sparsely haired, but the hairs on the lower side are longer than those above. Females have eight mammae, as in most oryzomyines. The hindfeet are broad and have the first and fifth digits notably shorter than the middle three. The upper surface is hairy, but the underside is naked and covered with small irregularities (squamae). The pads are generally poorly developed, as are the ungual tufts. Interdigital webbing may be present, but its development is variable within the genus.|$|E

5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} {{served as}} an alternative destination for Imperial Airways when Croydon was fogbound. The runway was {{just long enough for}} this purpose. Using Penshurst as an alternate destination caused delays to the passengers as there were no Customs facilities. On 18 February 1932, both Croydon and Penshurst were fogbound, and Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXE Hengist diverted to Heston Aerodrome. As Customs facilities existed there, passengers were on their way in 10 minutes, as opposed to the three hour <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> delay when using Penshurst. The practice of having a Customs Officer attend Penshurst on a daily basis was instigated, but it was discontinued in February 1935. On 24 October 1932, a German and a French airliner diverted to Penshurst due to smog over London.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length hair <b>or</b> <b>longer</b> is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E
