5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy <b>ootheca,</b> in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground to feed for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground to feed on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an <b>ootheca.</b> She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be impregnated only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cockroach {{control is}} {{performed}} by the application of chemical insecticides which exert high selective pressure on populations and introduces synthetic substances in the environment, motivating the search for other methods of control such as entomopathogenic fungi. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the pathogenicity of the JAB 42 Aspergillus westerdijkiae to females and <b>oothecae</b> of Periplaneta americana and to demonstrate its mechanism of action on <b>oothecae.</b> Suspensions containing 106 to 108 conidia/ml were used to infect females and <b>oothecae.</b> Mortality and other variables such as scanning electron microscopy were used to demonstrate the mechanism of action of the fungus. The isolated JAB 42 A. westerdijkiae is pathogenic to <b>oothecae</b> of P. americana, with low capacity to kill females. Adhesion, germination, penetration and extrusion of the fungus on the cockroach <b>oothecae</b> were observed...|$|R
500|$|The {{mating season}} in {{temperate}} climates typically {{takes place in}} autumn, while in tropical areas, mating can occur {{at any time of}} the year. To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an <b>ootheca.</b> Depending on the species, the <b>ootheca</b> can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs. The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch. An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically. The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually. [...] In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring.|$|E
50|$|Another wasp species, Anastatus floridanus, {{is also an}} <b>ootheca</b> {{parasite}} of Eurycotis floridana, laying eggs in an <b>ootheca</b> {{carried by}} the female, or into a deposited <b>ootheca</b> as many as 36 days old.

50|$|The wasp species Aprostocetus hagenowii is an egg {{parasite}} {{of several}} species of cockroaches, including Eurycotis floridana. The small, parasitic wasp deposits its eggs into the <b>ootheca</b> of the cockroach, resulting in an average of 648 parasites per <b>ootheca.</b> The parasites eat the cockroach eggs and emerge from the <b>ootheca</b> as adults.|$|E
40|$|Periplaneta {{americana}} (L.) {{is one of}} {{the major}} hygienic pests distributed worldwide. Evania appendigaster (L.) is a parasitic wasp species of <b>oothecae</b> of R americana and could, therefore, be used in the control of P. americana. Before releasing the parasitized <b>oothecae,</b> however, it is important to inhibit embryogenesis of P. americana to prevent them from hatching. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of four physical treatments (freezing, heating, UV irradiation, and gamma irradiation) on the hatchability of the treated <b>oothecae</b> and also to measure the parasitism rate, emergence rate, and developmental time of E. appendigaster in the treated <b>oothecae.</b> The results revealed that P. americana hatched front UV-treated <b>oothecae,</b> whereas the eggs receiving the other three treatments did not hatch. The results also indicated that, except for the oven-heated <b>oothecae,</b> those receiving the other three treatments had no effect on the parasitism rate of E. appendigaster. In addition, the freezing treatment had the highest impact on the emergence rate and developmental times of E. appendigaster, with < 20 % emergence. Overall, our results suggested that gamma irradiation had the lowest impact on the parasitism rate, emergence rate, and the developmental times of E. appendigaster. The application of parasitized <b>oothecae</b> to P. americana habitats, such as sewer networks, together with bait control, may effectively reduce the population of P. americana...|$|R

50|$|Reproduction {{is usually}} ovoviviparous, the <b>ootheca</b> carried {{internally}} during gestation until nymphs hatch {{within the body}} and are delivered, usually at night or in darkness. Occasionally stress or other factors may result in premature release of the <b>ootheca,</b> which can result in non-viability of the eggs. The <b>ootheca</b> itself measures 9x3.5x2.5 mm, housing 30-36 eggs in two rows of alternately spaced segments. Remains of the egg case are expelled around the time the nymphs are being born, sometimes pulled out with the hind limbs, and the <b>ootheca</b> fragments are usually quickly devoured by the newborn nymphs.|$|E
50|$|Two {{weeks after}} mating, the females lay egg cases known as <b>ootheca</b> on twigs and branches. The <b>ootheca</b> is 5 - 10 mm long, with each <b>ootheca</b> {{containing}} 10-20 eggs.

50|$|The female wasp lays an egg {{inside the}} roach <b>ootheca</b> (egg case), and the wasp larva hatches quickly and consumes the roach eggs. Technically, they are thus predators, rather than parasites or parasitoids as other {{parasitic}} wasps. A single egg is laid per <b>ootheca,</b> into a host egg in some Evaniidae, {{and between the}} eggs in others. Some are able to oviposit even when the female cockroach still carries the fresh <b>ootheca</b> around, while other ensign wasps will only attack oothecae that are completed and have been dropped by the mother roach. The wasps {{seem to be able}} to determine if an <b>ootheca</b> is already used to host a larva, and refrain from depositing eggs in such cases; alternatively, the larvae might be cannibalic, with the first to hatch in an <b>ootheca</b> eating any wasp eggs subsequently deposited.|$|E
