40|$|Abstract — The goal of {{this work}} is to detect {{pairwise}} primi-tive interactions in groups for social interaction analysis in real environments. We propose a system that extracts locations and head poses of people from videos captured in an unconstrained environment, namely a research lab. Our system is designed to work with realistic data capturing natural human interactions. An efficient tracking method based <b>on</b> <b>Chamfer</b> matching finds the head and shoulder silhouettes of people in real-time, and a head orientation classifier estimates their head poses. The location, relative distance and head orientation of people capture the use of space by individuals and their interactive behavioral patterns which are inferred with a probabilistic model. We present quantitative evaluation and experimental results of our system, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach on challenging real-world data. I...|$|E

The chamfer metrics are selected to minimize an approximation error. In this paper, a new approach is developed to find optimal chamfer local distances. This new approach gives smaller approximation error than found in previous work, is easier to visualize, and can be easily extended to chamfer metrics that use large neighborhoods. I. Introduction The distance transform has been applied in many image analysis tasks. It is used for shape analysis, feature detection, skeletonization, segmentation and multiscale morphological filtering [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Since the computational cost of the exact Euclidean distance transform is relatively high, several fast algorithms {{have been developed to}} approximate it [4], [5].

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a detailed study of mechanical fasteners which were designed to facilitate robotic assembly of structures. Design requirements for robotic structural assembly were developed, taking into account structural properties and overall system design, and four candidate fasteners were designed to meet them. These fasteners were built and evaluated in the laboratory, and the Hammer-Head joint was chosen as superior overall. It had a high reliability of fastening under misalignments of 2. 54 mm (0. 1 in) and 3 deg, the highest end fixity (2. 18), the simplest end effector, an integral capture guide, good visual verification, and the lightest weight (782 g, 1. 72 lb). The study found that a good design should incorporate <b>chamfers</b> sliding <b>on</b> <b>chamfers,</b> cylinders sliding <b>on</b> <b>chamfers,</b> and hard surface finishes on sliding surfaces. The study also comments on robot flexibility, sag, hysteresis, thermal expansion, and friction which were observed during the testing...|$|R

Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and linear support vector machines (linSVM) are used as expert classifiers. Experiments are performed on a unique real-world multimodality dataset captured from a moving vehicle in urban traffic. This dataset has been made public for research purposes.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a multi-leaf {{alignment}} frame-work based <b>on</b> <b>Chamfer</b> matching {{to study the}} problem of leaf alignment from fluorescence images of plants, which will provide a leaf-level analysis of photosynthetic activi-ties. Different from the naive procedure of aligning leaves iteratively using the Chamfer distance, the new algorithm aims {{to find the best}} alignment of multiple leaves simultane-ously in an input image. We formulate an optimization prob-lem of an objective function with three terms: the average of chamfer distances of aligned leaves, the number of leaves, and the difference between the synthesized mask by the leaf candidates and the original image mask. Gradient descent is used to minimize our objective function. A quantitative evaluation framework is also formulated to test the perfor-mance of our algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-leaf alignment optimization performs sub-stantially better than the baseline of the Chamfer matching algorithm in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} {{successfully}} climb challenging staircases that consist of many steps and contain difficult parts, humanoid robots need to accurately determine their pose. In this paper, we present {{an approach that}} fuses the robot’s observations from a 2 D laser scanner, a monocular camera, an inertial measurement unit, and joint encoders in order to localize the robot within a given 3 D model of the environment. We develop an extension to standard Monte Carlo localization (MCL) that draws particles from an improved proposal distribution to obtain highly accurate pose estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a new observation model based <b>on</b> <b>chamfer</b> matching between edges in camera images and the environment model. We thoroughly evaluate our localization approach and compare it to previous techniques in real-world experiments with a Nao humanoid. The results show that our approach significantly improves the localization accuracy and leads to a considerably more robust robot behavior. Our improved proposal in combination with chamfer matching can be generally applied to improve a range-based pose estimate by a consistent matching of lines obtained from vision. I...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Marginal fit {{is valued}} {{as one of}} the most {{important}} criteria for the clinical quality and success of all-ceramic crowns. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the marginal fit of Lava Zirconia crown-copings <b>on</b> <b>chamfer</b> and shoulder preparations. METHODS: Two acrylic model teeth were selected to simulate the clinical preparations: one molar was prepared with a chamfer finish line (C) and one premolar was prepared with a rounded shoulder finish line (RS). Each resin model was duplicated 10 times using silicon-based impression material and poured in type IV dental stone for the fabrication of working dies. A total of 20 copings were divided into two groups (n = 10 for each finish line). Fifty measuring locations were chosen randomly along the margin on the dies and the gap width - vertical marginal discrepancy - was measured under a light microscope with a magnification of x 100. Measurements were made without cementation. The mean marginal gap widths and standard deviations were calculated and a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for different types of preparations in order to detect differences (α = 0. 05). RESULTS: The mean marginal gap was 30 ± 3 μm for the C group and 28 ± 4 μm for the RS group. The one-way ANOVA showed no statistical significant difference between the two groups (P = 0. 23). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the marginal discrepancies were all within the clinical acceptable standard set at 120 μm. Chamfer and shoulder preparations did not show differences regarding the gap dimension. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Bur design is an easily selected parameter before natural tooth preparation. Both tested finish lines are able to help clinicians in obtaining acceptable marginal fit values for the investigated zirconia copings...|$|E
40|$|For over 100 years, {{piston rings}} {{have been used}} in the {{internal}} combustion engine to create, during operation, a seal between the cylinder wall and the piston (Figure 1). In operation, the heat generated on the top ring, will cause the piston to deform and tilt. To accommodate with this effect, designers have improved the performance ring by applying a chamfer to the contact face of the ring to reduce the concentration of stress on the ring when the piston tilts (Figure 1). It can be found that the piston ring coatings (MoS 2 based) can lose structural integrity and state of the art rings incorporate a chamfer as shown in Figure 2 a, is to chamfer the coating on the ring contact face up to the substrate material. In the current design the coatings covers the full length of the chamfer which can lead to excessive stress concentration in A (Figure 2). This paper examines the effect of the contact chamfer and proposes a new solution to relieve active stress from the performance ring. Use of COMSOL Multiphysics: In operation, the piston ring is surrounded by gas acting on it, using effect of chamfer design has been considered using Love's equation in conjunction with Stone's equation for force ad Miler's equation for gas pressure modeling. Dimensional changes on the piston due to changes in thermodynamic and tilt created during BDC to TDC cycle generates stress concentration on A. Structural mechanic bloc from COMSOL has been used for the simulation where variables defined from (Love 1929; Mittler and Mierbach 2009; Neuber and Federhofer 1951; Stone and Ball 2004) equations. The chamfer geometry was controlled through variable inputs such as coating thickness, ring thickness, distance from the ring angle ring to cylinder to incorporate the tilt. The simulation has considered variables such as position, time to impact during contact between the cylinder liner and the piston ring coating. To better represents the two surfaces contacting a multiple meshing procedures. These procedures allows for the shearing process to simulate at 10, 000 rpm. COMSOL has enabled to generate a single simulation considering aspects mentioned above. Results: The results of this simulation confirmed ISO 6622 - 1 on dimensions for ring contact chamfer (Figure 4). When engine operate at 6, 000 to 12, 000 rpm localized high stresses are found on the contact chamfer face of the ring. With a new proposed designed (Figure 2 b) the concentrated stress at this point is reduced. Conclusion: The piston ring will go through several thermal dynamic changes inducing structural damage to the component. The present methodology has been to use to reduce highly localized stresses <b>on</b> <b>chamfer</b> placed on the contact face by reducing its dimension. This design alteration may runs in conjunction with Love's theory of elasticity...|$|E
