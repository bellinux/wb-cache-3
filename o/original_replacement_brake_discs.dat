30|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>discs</b> are an {{important}} component found in almost all moving vehicles. Safety and reliability are crucial for braking systems. Several types of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> used in rail vehicles are mainly divided into two groups: axle-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> and wheel-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> There are also other designs, like separate <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> axles and end-axle-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>discs</b> are usually made from grey cast iron, nodular cast iron or steel, depending on the loads to which they will be subjected. The use of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> prevents {{the surface of the}} rolling wheel itself from braking and thus increases the lifespan of and reduces stress on the wheels. Divided <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> were developed to facilitate <b>replacement</b> of the <b>brake</b> <b>discs,</b> making the process less time consuming and less expensive, as it eliminates the need to disassemble the entire axle assembly. Disassembly of the axle can cause other problems as well, since all of the parts, like the wheels and bearings, are press fit onto the axle, and disassembly risks damaging them.|$|R

40|$|During braking, heat is {{generated}} due to frictional {{contact between the}} brake pads and the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> (rotor) of a vehicle. At elevated temperatures, brake fade may occur, leading to potentially catastrophic brake failure in a vehicle. The heat-dissipating characteristic of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> is a function both of the physical design of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> and also the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> material. This research focuses {{on the effect of}} <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> design, in particular, how the surface temperature is affected by increasing the surface area of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc’s</b> ventilated channel. The surface temperature of a newly developed <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> with a wire woven porous ventilated channel (the design of which is not part of this research) will be compared to existing commercially available designs, and the parameters governing transient thermal response for solid, ventilated, and porous <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> during extended <b>braking</b> will be identified and compared. The results of this research reveal that the thermal capacity of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> determines the initial rate of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> temperature increase (T), resulting in initial temperatures being T(solid disc) T(pin-finned disc) >T(WBD disc) due to the increased convective surface area and addition of forced convection in the ventilated channels.

40|$|Design of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> {{geometry}} {{for a given}} <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> material {{provides an}} opportunity for improvement in the fatigue life of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> High thermomechanical loads at braking lead to substantial local plastification and also induce tensile residual stresses in certain areas of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> This contributes to shortening of the fatigue life of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> by possible initiation and growth of cracks. In the present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and applied. <b>Brake</b> <b>disc</b> performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model for grey cast iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine. The thermal loading consists of consecutive severe braking cycles at a constant brake power and a constant speed, with cooling between the brake cycles. Based on a previous experimental study, three different assumptions are made regarding the spatial distribution of the thermal load at braking. A standard commercial <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> made from grey cast iron having straight vanes is used as the reference case. Geometrical modifications are introduced in the ventilation arrangement using a design-of-experiments approach, studying both straight cooling vanes and different pillar layouts. A preliminary assessment of the fatigue life of the <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> is carried out.

40|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the automotive industry since it concerns directly with safety. In order to develop proper heat ventilation a wide range of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been designed. Different types of physical <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> geometries, as front- and back-vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs,</b> affect the heat ventilation directly. This is a vital factor of the brake’s capability. We recognized the importance of this circumstance and therefore attempted to create a test to investigate the temperature gradient of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> in order to evaluate the coefficients of heat convection. The coefficients were modified by the change of temperature distribution in both <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> under the forced heat convection in steady state conditions. However, the heat radiation value does not take into account that the heat convection is dominated by the physical geometry of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc.</b> To set up the experimental test for investigating the heat transfer by convection the JASO C 406 standard is adopted. The experimental results in terms of heat convection coefficients are used in the numerical simulation via the finite element method in order to study the temperature diffusion and heat ventilation of front and back-vented <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> Conse-quently, the experimental results reveal that the overall heat convection coefficients of the front-vented <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> are higher than these of the back-vented one. In other words the simulation yields that the front-vented <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> allows stronger heat ventilation than its compared object, leading to larger temperature differences between outboard and inboard rotors, resulting in more thermal stress.

Two of the divided rail freight <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> are mounted on each axle. With the aid of numerical analysis, the thermal dissipation properties of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> were optimised and ventilation losses were reduced, and the numerical results were compared with experimental results. A one-way fluid–structure interaction analysis was performed. A computational fluid dynamic model of a divided rail freight <b>brake</b> <b>disc,</b> used to predict air flow properties and heat convection, was incorporated into a finite element model of the disc and {{used to evaluate the}} temperature of the disc.

40|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{commonly}} used in motorcycles, passenger cars, commercial vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles, passenger trains and landing gears of airplanes. Depending on the application, {{a wide variety of}} <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been developed, with a multitude of designs, geometries and materials. The <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> materials used for heavy-duty vehicles are still mostly based on traditional grey cast iron, due to its favourable performance and low cost. Gradual improvements of the thermal and mechanical properties of grey cast iron for production of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> have been introduced over the years through fine-tuning of the alloying elements. Nevertheless, because of a material behaviour that comprises non-linear elasticity and non-symmetric yield stress in tension and compression, the mechanical properties of grey cast iron are not as well established as those of steel or aluminium alloys. The subject of the present work is {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms that control the life of cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> In the end, the aim is an enhanced vehicle performance and reduced maintenance costs of heavy-duty vehicles. First, a state of the art survey has been carried out with a review of <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> technology and mechanisms related to <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> life. Second, full-scale brake dynamometer experiments have been carried out and analysed, with <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> made from eight different grey cast iron alloys, at controlled torque, speed and cooling conditions. Crack propagation and disc temperatures have been studied. Disc temperatures were recorded by use of a thermocamera and embedded thermocouples. Detailed analyses were performed on temperature data to clarify characteristics of the tested <b>brake</b> <b>discs.</b> The main phenomena influencing the life of <b>brake</b> <b>discs</b> were identified, and the spatial fixation of bands and/or hot spots was found to have a major impact on disc life. Third, a constitutive model useful for grey cast iron was implemented for use with a commercial finite element software. The model was calibrated for temperatures relevant for braking applications using dedicated isothermal tests and, finally, validated against monotonic tensile tests, isothermal fatigue tests and thermomechanical fatigue tests. Fourth, a parametric study was performed to explore potential improvements of the cooling channels of a <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> design when considering an established fatigue criterion.

Finally the temperature distribution and its variation of the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> were analyzed in detail based on the simulation results. Huge total weight of a 220 t mining dump truck with full loaded and few numbers of axles and discs lead to the <b>brake</b> <b>disc</b> loading greatly and absorbing a large sum of energy on per unit area.
