40|$|A glow {{discharge}} (GD) ion source {{has been developed}} {{to work within the}} high magnetic field of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer. Characteri- zation of this source revealed that the <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>voltage,</b> pressure, and current are significantly lower than those for normal {{glow discharge}}s. The sputter rate was lowered to 1 / 30 th of that found with a normal glow discharge source operated external to the high magnetic field region. Operation of the GD source closer to the FTICR analyzer cell than with previous experimental designs resulted in improved ion transport efficiency.

40|$|To use density {{functional}} theory (DFT) to seek improved catalysts for {{the oxygen}} reduction reaction (ORR) in a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, {{we developed a}} systematic way to handle the barriers of electron transfer reactions (e. g., H^+ + e^– + O_(ad) → OH_(ad)) within the DFT framework. We report applications of this new method to determining the dependence for the barriers of various ORR reaction steps on the operating electrochemical potential for the Pt-catalyzed fuel cell. This method is used to estimate the optimum operating potential. In the Article, we show how to estimate the change in efficiency from changes in the reaction barriers. On {{the basis of our}} mechanism and calculated barriers, the <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> for the ORR on Pt is found to be 0. 68 V/NHE, which is close to the standard operating voltage of ~ 0. 8 V/NHE, validating this analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a generic model suitable for emulating Photovoltaic (PV) system characteristics in order to study its impacts on the performance power networks. This model can accurately emulate the dynamic behaviour of the PV system, including the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller. A new method to emulate the MPPT controller based on the Lambert ω function is introduced. This method can accurately determine the PV array <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> point without the need for measuring the output power. This makes the techniques suitable for practical implementation, as the response is fast and does not involves the oscillations usually associated with the Perturbation and Observation (P&O) MPPT. It also provides improved performance in low solar irradiance conditions, as compared with conventional MPPT methods. The proposed emulator is easy to implement in computer modelling of power systems. This model is implemented in Matlab/Simulink Software package and its performance is analysed and presented in this paper...|$|E

It could {{be shown that}} DB 38 is efficiently degraded by glow plasma under <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> parameters (<b>voltage</b> of 600 V, electrode distance of 10 mm, initial solution pH 3), and 95. 7 % of DB 38 in the solution containing 100 mg L- 1 DB 38 could be removed within 15 min at a degradation rate of 0. 116 min(- 1). DB 38 degradation kinetics obeyed the first-order law. Fe 2 +, Fe 3 + and Mn 2 + significantly increased the DB 38 degradation rate constant (k). The catalytic effect of transition metal addition followed the descending order of Fe 2 + >> Fe 3 + > Mn 2 +. The free radical scavengers catechol and ascorbic acid significantly hindered DB 38 degradation rate revealing that a free radical chain mechanism is involved in degradation. Catechol hindered DB 38 degradation more than ascorbic acid because catechol had a much higher hydroxyl radical scavenging rate constant than ascorbic acid...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2018 The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) bans all nuclear {{explosion}} {{tests for}} military or civilian purposes. The International Monitoring System (IMS) {{was established to}} verify compliance with the treaty. It consists of several monitoring stations that detect: seismic activities, hydrocoustic activities, infrasound waves, and radionuclide particles and noble gases. Radioxenon detection provides the most robust evidence of a nuclear weapon test. There are four radioxenon isotopes of interest: 131 mXe (t 1 / 2 = 11. 93 days), 133 mXe (t 1 / 2 = 2. 19 days), 133 Xe (t 1 / 2 = 5. 25 days) and 135 Xe (t 1 / 2 = 0. 38 days). All of these radioxenons emit beta and gamma radiation in coincidence or conversion electrons and X-rays in coincidence during their decay process. In this research, a new radioxenon detection system was developed based on Si and CZT detectors. The system is made of the “PIPSBox” silicon gas cell recently developed by Canberra to detect beta and conversion electrons, and two coplanar CZT detectors to detect X-rays and gamma rays. The PIPSBox silicon gas cell offers many advantages such as: (1) increasing the frequency of air sampling at IMS stations because memory effect {{does not affect the}} PIPSBox gas cell like it does with plastic gas cells currently used at IMS stations, (2) reducing the Minimum Detectable Concentration (MDC) for radioxenons due to better energy resolution of silicon, and minimal background interference from previous measurements. The detection system was simulated using MCNP 6 and was characterized by 131 mXe to determine <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>voltages,</b> proper gain, and the length of the coincidence window. Pulse waveforms of the silicon and CZT detectors were analyzed using two digital pulse processors: DPP 2 and DPP 8. DPP 2 is a two-channel digital pulse processor with a 200 MHz sampling frequency and a 12 -bit ADC resolution. DPP 8 is an 8 -channel, 125 MHz digital signal processor with a 14 -bit ADC resolution. A coincidence firmware was implemented in the on-board FPGA to identify specific coincidences events between silicon and CZT detectors to generate 2 D spectra for the four radioxenons of interest.

40|$|The {{electrical}} output (power, current, and voltage) of flat plate solar arrays changes constantly, due primarily {{to changes in}} cell temperature and irradiance level. As a result, array loads such as dc-to-ac power conditioners must be capable of accommodating widely varying input levels while maintaining operation {{at or near the}} maximum power point of the array. The array operating characteristics and extreme output limits necessary for the systematic design of array load interfaces under a wide variety of climatic conditions are studied.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of radioactive decay, radioactive decay rates have consistently shown to be constant. Recently, groups of researchers {{around the world have}} noticed variation in the decay rates of different radioactive isotopes, while other groups have noticed no such effect. If the variation is truly varying decay rates, this would imply groundbreaking new physics and would have implications for practices such as carbon dating. More sophisticated experiments are required to determine if the variations are truly new physics or systematic effects inherent to nuclear decay experiments. We are building an experiment where activity data from various radioactive sources will be taken with NaI(Tl) detectors at different places around the world (Purdue University, Nationaal Instituut voor Kernfysica en Hoge-Energiefysica [NIKHEF], University of Zurich, one more to be decided). Previous studies have not used our data acquisition methods which will allow for a richer analysis to check for time variations. At this point, all components have been acquired and construction of the experiment is underway. I have performed several tests on our new sodium iodide detectors and used the results to determine the <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>voltage</b> test. This test will be performed on each of the detectors to determine the voltage at which each one should be operated. Currently I am performing more tests to determine the amount of lead shielding needed between each detector.

40|$|The {{renewable}} energy {{will be an}} increasingly important part of power generation in the new millennium. Photovoltaic (PV) systems produce DC electricity when sunlight shines on the PV array, requiring little maintenance, and emitting no noise, among others. Day-by –day the energy demand is increasing and thus {{the need for a}} renewable source that will not harm the environment are of prime importance. The proposed model uses basic circuit equation of the photovoltaic solar cells including the effects of solar irradiation and temperature changes. The DC-DC converter is used for boosting a low voltage of the PV array up to the high dc bus voltage, which is not less than grid voltage level. A DC-DC converter performs the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). In photovoltaic systems for getting the maximum power we use MPPT techniques. In these methods open circuit voltage method is one, which is based on the observation that the voltage of the maximum power point is always close to a fixed percentage of the open circuit voltage. This technique uses only 76 % of the open circuit voltage as the <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>voltage.</b> The Perturb and Observe (P&O) method operates by periodically perturbing (i. e. incrementing or decrementing) the array terminal voltage or current and comparing the PV output power with that of the previous perturbation cycle. The proposed Perturb and Observe control algorithm is a software programme with a self-tuning function which adjusts the array reference voltage and step size of the voltage to achieve maximum power point. The validity of the photo voltaic module with P & O method allows better performance of MPPT due to variation of both power and voltage. This work is proposed to be carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{temperature}} profile of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma packed-bed reactor was monitored using a single 1550 nm fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor with sensitivity of 10. 8 pm/°C. The FBG was embedded at {{the midpoint of}} the reactor which was packed with barium titanate (BaTiO 3) pellets. Four types of carrier gas for plasma generation were manipulated with different applied voltages for each gas in order to investigate the behaviour of the {{temperature profile}}s of non-thermal plasma (NTP).

The reactor temperature for helium carrier gas revealed the lowest, approximately 77 °C. Reactor temperature profiles for each type of gas is different due to the gas composition and breakdown voltage behaviour.

40|$|Robust {{design has}} been widely {{recognized}} as a leading method in reducing variability and improving quality. Most of the engineering statistics literature mainly focuses on finding "point estimates" of the <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> conditions for robust design.

Although this point estimation procedure is important for continuous quality improvement, the immediate question is "how accurate are these <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> conditions?"

40|$|Thesis {{presented}} in ful lment {{of the requirements}} for the degree of Magister Technologiae in Electrical Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 The power system is essentially {{one of the most}} critical subsystems to any satellite, without some form of power system a satellite would simply cease to function. The research within these pages investigates the areas pertaining to satellite power systems with the main focus towards the CubeSat platform. The end objective of this research was the development of a reliable analogue based switch-mode power system for a CubeSat. The research began with an investigation into the CubeSat platform, the space environment and a basic overview of a satellite and its systems. The research then focussed on satellite power systems, focussing primarily on satellite power system topologies and switch-mode power systems. Various components and concepts surrounding the satellite power system were investigate and included the photovoltaic (PV) solar cell, batteries, satellite power system topologies, protection concepts and typical CubeSat power systems. The nal part of the literature review included research into typical CubeSat power systems. The space environment complicates the design of satellite systems. The developed electrical power system harnessed electrical power from a PV solar panel by means of a fractional opencircuit voltage (FOCV) based maximum power point tracker (MPPT) with the use of a SEPIC DC-DC converter. The use of a SEPIC DC-DC converter allowed the system to operate at a greater e ciency than could be expected from linear designs. The requirement for an e cient system was important as the heat generated by the power system could bring rise to dissipation issues, resulting in over-heating of various components. The design took into account component sizing, as larger components would be more prone to damage during the high accelerations and vibrations associated with being launched into space. The use of a MPPT allowed the power system to better utilise the available PV solar panel power, by maintaining the PV solar panel near its <b>optimum</b> <b>operating</b> <b>voltage.</b> The design slid between MPPT and voltage regulation to harness as much power as possible while not over-charging the Lithium polymer battery. The power system consisted of battery under-voltage protection as well as over-current protection for the attached payloads and satellite subsystems. The SEPIC DC-DC converter was selected over other SMPS topologies, as this topology could be used in a 1 U and 3 U CubeSat with a wide variety of PV solar panel cell con gurations. The bene ts of this SMPS topology are due to the SEPIC DC-DC converter's ability to produce an output voltage greater than, less than or equal to the input voltage (National Semiconductor, 2008; Texas Instruments, 2008 a). This, along with the operation of the FOCV based MPPT, allowed the power system to be very exible. The designed FOCV based MPPT could be pre-set to di ering PV solar cell technologies due to the adjustable ratio between the maximum power point voltage, Vmpp, and the open-circuit voltage, Voc of the PV solar panel. It was decided not to select a Buck or Boost DC-DC converter based power system as this would limit the exibility of the system. Additionally, the SEPIC DC-DC converter brings with it the ability to isolate the input and output voltage upon shut down. This isolation is due to the SEPIC DC-DC converter's coupling capacitor and this topologies operation as described by National Semiconductor (2008) and Texas Instruments (2008 a). The prototype was versatile allowing a wide variety of PV solar cell technologies to be used. The wide operating voltage of the prototype allowed the design to be connected to a series or parallel combination of solar cells with an operating voltage of 3 V to 20 V. The power handling capability of the prototype per solar panel channel allows the design to be applied to a 1 U or 3 U CubeSat given that the channel did not exceed 10 W. All components of the prototype operated without fault, e ectively charging the Li-poly battery safely while protecting payloads and subsystems. The SEPIC DC-DC converter utilised by the MPPT achieved an e ciency of 71 % under full load and with an input voltage of 10 V...|$|E
