5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{with the}} {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> music, hip-hop social dancing emerged from breaking and the funk styles into different forms. Dances from the 1990s {{such as the}} Running Man, the Worm, and the Cabbage Patch entered the mainstream and became fad dances. After the millennium, newer social dances such as the Cha Cha Slide and the Dougie also caught on and became very popular.|$|E

5|$|The {{dominance}} of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop was supplanted in the late-2000s, {{largely due to}} the mainstream success <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> artists such as Kanye West. The outcome of a highly publicized sales competition between the simultaneous release of his and gangsta rapper 50 Cent's third studio albums, Graduation and Curtis respectively, has since been accredited to the decline. The competition resulted in record-breaking sales performances by both albums and West outsold 50 Cent, selling nearly a million copies of Graduation in the first week alone. Industry observers remark that West's victory over 50 Cent proved that rap music did not have to conform to gangsta-rap conventions in order to be commercially successful. West effectively paved the way for a new wave <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> artists, including Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, who did not follow the hardcore-gangster mold and became platinum-selling artists.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop,</b> and used the sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of foreign music styles have been popularized in Madagascar, {{including}} French chanson performed by artists such as Poopy, reggae, gospel music, and pop rock performed by bands such as Green and AmbondronA. Jazz has been popularized by artists such as Nicolas Vatomanga. Malagasy hip hop broke into the mainstream in the mid-nineties and has since skyrocketed to popularity through artists such as Da Hopp and 18,3. More recently bands like Oladad are experimenting with the fusion <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> and traditional Malagasy musical styles and instruments.|$|E

5|$|Dancers in the United Kingdom {{have had}} success in hip-hop theater. In 2006, hip-hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show Pied Piper. In 2008, Into the Hoods {{became the first}} hip-hop theater show to perform in London's West End. It {{eventually}} {{went on to become}} the West End's longest running dance show ever. According to Clemente, the future <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> dance is in theater; he believes it is necessary for the dance to make this transition in order for it to be legitimized as an art form.|$|E
5|$|The History <b>of</b> <b>Hip-Hop</b> dance {{encompasses}} {{the people and}} events since the late 1960s that {{have contributed to the}} development of the early hip-hop dance moves, such as uprock, breaking, locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping. Black Americans and Latino Americans created uprock and breaking in New York City. Black Americans in California created locking, roboting, boogaloo, and popping—collectively referred to as the funk styles. All of these dance styles are different stylistically. They share common ground in their street origins and in their improvisational nature.|$|E
5|$|The commercialization <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> dance {{continued}} into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as The Grind, Planet B-Boy, Rize, StreetDance 3D, America's Best Dance Crew, Saigon Electric, the Step Up film series, and The LXD, a web series. Though the dance is established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods {{which has led to}} the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin, turfing, jerkin', and krumping.|$|E

5|$|Untitled (stylized as untitled) is {{the debut}} EP by Los Angeles, California rapper Hodgy Beats, member <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> {{collective}} Odd Future. It {{was released on}} February 24, 2012. It is Hodgy Beats' first solo release since his 2009 debut mixtape, The Dena Tape. Announced on February 20, 2012, the EP was released on the 25th of the same month. The project features production by Juicy J, The Alchemist and Flying Lotus. Lyrically the record deals with thoughts about self-reflection, the contemplation of death, and a struggle with drugs. The EP received mostly positive reviews from music critics.|$|E
5|$|While {{breaking}} {{was developing}} in New York, other styles of dance were developing in California. Unlike breaking, the funk styles—which {{originated in the}} 1970s in California—were not originally hip-hop dance styles: they were danced to funk music rather than hip-hop music, {{and they were not}} associated with the other cultural pillars <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> (DJing, graffiti writing, and MCing). The funk styles are actually slightly older than breaking due to fact that boogaloo and locking were developed in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990s {{and into}} the early 2000s pop music {{consisted}} mostly of a combination of pop-hip hop and R pop, including a number of boy bands. Notable female singers also cemented their status in American and worldwide popular music, such as Beyoncé (with her solo career and as lead singer of Destiny's Child), Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift. Also notable was the influence <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> producers on popular music in the mid-late 2000s, including the Neptunes and Timbaland, who made the sounds first heard on Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds and Nelly Furtado's Loose imitated throughout popular radio with artists Madonna, Akon and Lady Gaga. In the late 2000s into the early 2010s, pop music began to move towards being heavily influenced by the European electronic dance music scene, taking root in the college crowd through producers like David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Swedish House Mafia and Skrillex.|$|E
5|$|Hip Hop International (HHI) {{was founded}} in 2002 in the United States by Howard and Karen Schwartz. There are two {{categories}} of competitions: World Battles and World Hip Hop Dance Championship. Within the World Battles category, there are four titles including three-on-three breaking champions, one-on-one popping champion, one-on-one locking champion, and one-on-one all styles (freestyle) champion. The World Hip Hop Dance Championship is for hip-hop crews. There are four divisions: junior (ages 7–12), varsity (12–18), adult (18+), and mega crew (all ages). Each crew must have at least five {{but not more than}} nine people (mega crew must have 15–40) and must perform a routine that showcases three styles <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> dance. For the 2009 competition, there were 120 crews representing 30 countries. HHI also created the USA Hip Hop Dance Championship and the television show America's Best Dance Crew.|$|E

Based on his buzz at the time, numerous New York-based producers were eager to work with him and went to Power House Studios with Nas. Among those producers was DJ Premier, recognized at the time for his raw, aggressive production with jazz-based samples and heavy scratching, and for his work with rapper Guru as a part <b>of</b> <b>hip-hop</b> duo Gang Starr. After his production on Lord Finesse & DJ Mike Smooth's Funky Technician (1990) and Jeru the Damaja's The Sun Rises in the East (1994), Premier began recording exclusively at D Studios in New York City, before working with Nas on Illmatic.|$|E
