500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 May the theatre was packed. Gustav Linor reported, [...] "Never... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the {{stairways}} and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear". The evening began with Les Sylphides, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles. The Rite followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew in a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in [...] "Augurs of Spring". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, [...] "it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky." [...] Marie Rambert, who was working {{as an assistant to}} Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage. In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into [...] "a terrific uproar" [...] which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers. The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got carried away with excitement, and [...] "began to beat rhythmically <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head", though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first, his own emotion being so great.|$|E
2500|$|Curtis {{was married}} six times. His first wife was actress Janet Leigh, {{to whom he}} was married from 1951 to 1962, and with whom he fathered actresses Kelly and Jamie Lee. [...] "For a while, we were Hollywood's golden couple," [...] he said. [...] "I was very {{dedicated}} and devoted to Janet, and <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> trade, but in her eyes that goldenness started to wear off. I realized that whatever I was, I wasn't enough for Janet. That hurt me a lot and broke my heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{revealed}} afterwards that Suárez had written {{as part of}} his defence that [...] "I lost my balance, making my body unstable and falling <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> opponent. At that moment, I hit my face against the player, leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth". Chiellini said he hoped FIFA would reduce the suspension that had been imposed. Uruguay captain Diego Lugano claimed the ban was [...] "barbarity" [...] and [...] "a breach of human rights", while the AUF described it as [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "severe", and claimed that it [...] "feels like Uruguay has been thrown out of the World Cup". Suárez showed contrition after the ban was given, saying [...] "I deeply regret what occurred", and vowed to never bite anybody again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Rollo," [...] said Waldron, [...] "I am {{glad you}} have come. I {{want you to}} sit <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> trunk with me, and make it shut down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would tie {{my clothes}} in a tight bundle <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head," [...] said Hake. [...] "Many a time have I crossed the streams <b>of</b> <b>my</b> native land in this manner." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yet, dear L., I had time, <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mule for musing {{upon how}} melancholy {{a thing is}} success. Whilst failure inspirits a man, {{attainment}} reads the sad prosy lesson that all our glories ...|$|R
2500|$|Families {{were further}} angered after a May 20, 2014 black-tie, VIP {{cocktail}} party for donors at the museum. Among the 60 attendees were former mayor Michael Bloomberg {{and representatives of}} Condé Nast. Family members objected to a party near unidentified remains; the sister of victim Robert Shay, Jr. tweeted, [...] "Did you enjoy having drinks <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brother's grave last night?" [...] Shay {{and dozens of other}} visitors were angered that first responders were turned away from the museum the previous day while staff prepared for the party. She said, [...] "I am outraged that I can't visit my brother's final resting place without an appointment but people like Mike Bloomberg can wine and dine there whenever they want. This memorial and museum is sacred ground and last night it was desecrated." [...] A retired FDNY fire marshal said, [...] "You don't have cocktail parties at a cemetery." [...] A mid-2014 proposal to open a Danny Meyer restaurant in the museum was criticized.|$|E
2500|$|A {{great deal}} of {{attention}} was paid to Palin's physical appearance during the 2008 elections. [...] According to Vogue magazine, [...] "Besides being telegenic, [...] had a tough-girl Alaskan résumé that most politicians could only dream of—the protein her family eats comes from fish she has pulled out of the ocean with her own hands and caribou she has shot." [...] Others were quick to point out striking resemblances of Palin to actress Tina Fey, who would impersonate her on Saturday Night Live, and Peggy Hill, a character on Fox Network's cartoon series King of the Hill. [...] Regarding her appearance, Palin has said, [...] "I've been taken aback by the nasty criticism about my appearance. [...] I wish they'd stick with the issues instead of discussing my black go-go boots. [...] A reporter once asked me about it during the campaign, and I assured him I was trying to be as frumpy as I could by wearing my hair <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head and these schoolmarm glasses." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wyllard smiled grimly. [...] "And I've carried this rifle a week <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> other load. You can't shoot when you're dead played out." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. M, You {{go for the}} ring. R'clect it'll be <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{right-hand}} little ringer, {{and just}} be careful how you draw it off, because I shall have the Verger's fees somewhere in my glove.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll find a bump <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head, father, {{the size}} of a cocoa-nut. That's what knocked the senses out o' me, but the blood and brains belong to the bear. I lay no claim to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless my soul!" [...] {{said the}} Professor with the elderly manner {{that he could}} never {{disconnect}} from his bleached beard and parchment face. [...] "God bless my soul! I seemed to fancy that something fell <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hat!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{touch the}} things in the tray," [...] she cried, nervously. [...] "I never saw such a boy. This morning he {{actually}} packed books <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> best tea-gown." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am happy}} about that," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "but <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{happiness}} came a sorrow. I {{just came from}} Edith's apartment. She died while I was there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pick up my {{head and}} place it <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> legs," [...] {{continued}} the Prince; [...] "then, with my eyes and your feet, we can hunt around until we find the rest of me." ...|$|E
60|$|But this is {{very likely}} only plebeian envy, and I dare say, if I were a lovely duchess of the realm, I would ride in a coach-and-six, with a coronet <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bonnet and a robe of velvet and ermine even in the dog-days.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you can feel, you know. You can {{put your}} hand <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head. I mustn't speak, you know; but I'm sure I shall laugh; and then you must guess that it's Marian." [...] That was her idea of playing blindman's buff {{according}} to the strict rigour of the game.|$|R
60|$|The tears stole {{into her}} eyes as she spoke. And the enormity of those tidings, coming as they did <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dejection, benumbed me. All they meant was yet far away from my grasp, but the one supreme result that was first up to me brought me near to fainting in my weakness.|$|R
6000|$|He {{saved me}} from the cattle an' He saved {{me from the}} sea, [...] For they found me 'tween two drownded ones where the roll had landed [...] me-- [...] An' a four-inch crack <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head, as crazy as could be.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{was young}}... once. I was young twelve years ago, and I had hair <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head, and my stomach was lean as a runner's, and the longest day was none {{too long for}} me. I was a husky back there in '98. You {{remember}} me, Milner. You knew me then. Wasn't I a pretty good bit of all right?" ...|$|E
60|$|All at once I got up {{and rushed}} to Sue's room. I lighted the gas, rummaged, and went to work. I piled my hair <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head, pinned it there, and thrust a long silver dagger through it to hold a couple of pale white roses she had left on her table. Then I put on her last winter's party dress. It was such a pretty pale yellow thing, with touches of black lace, and it didn't matter about its being a little old-fashioned, since it fitted me like a glove. Finally I stepped {{back and looked at}} myself.|$|E
5000|$|Meryem Polat: [...] "They {{started in}} the morning, burning all the houses, and {{continued}} into the afternoon. A child was burned in a boiler. They sacked everything. We were in {{the water in the}} cellar, above us were wooden boards. The boards were burning and falling <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> us. <b>My</b> house was reduced to ashes. We were with eight people in the cellar; they did not see us and left." ...|$|R
5000|$|Capitals {{general manager}} David Poile said, [...] "John Druce was not <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> list - anybody's list - {{to come through}} the way he did. He came out of nowhere to be the hero." [...] Poile added, [...] "He was not a top player in junior, not a top player in the minors. This is not only a good story today, but a good story for years to come." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jourgensen told Billboard {{that he had}} [...] "...other {{things to}} do. I just started a label (13th Planet Records), and I want to sign some bands and really build it up like I did with WaxTrax in the '80s, not just a vanity label. I think it's time, and I'll be leaving <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> game instead <b>of</b> hanging on too long and doing crappy Aerosmith and Rolling Stones albums thirty years later." ...|$|R
60|$|This oar, {{which had}} proved so {{serviceable}} {{to me in}} my destitute situation, and which now contained a record of my own fate and that of my shipmates, I spared no pains to preserve. No longer did I risk it in knocking seals on the head. Instead, I equipped myself with a stone club, some three feet in length and of suitable diameter, which occupied an even month in the fashioning. Also, to secure the oar from the weather (for I used it in mild breezes as a flagstaff <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pyramid from which to fly a flag I made me from one of my precious shirts) I contrived for it a covering of well-cured sealskins.|$|E
6000|$|All my free American blood boiled. All my liberty-loving {{ancestors}} clamored in me. [...] "What do you mean?" [...] I demanded. You see, I {{wanted an}} explanation. And I got it. Bang! His club came down <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head, and I was reeling backward like a drunken man, the curious {{faces of the}} onlookers billowing {{up and down like}} the waves of the sea, my precious book falling from under my arm into the dirt, the bull advancing with the club ready for another blow. And in that dizzy moment I had a vision. I saw that club descending many times upon my head; I saw myself, bloody and battered and hard-looking, in a police-court; I heard a charge of disorderly conduct, profane language, resisting an officer, and a few other things, read by a clerk; and I saw myself across in Blackwell's Island. Oh, I knew the game. I lost all interest in explanations. I didn't stop to pick up my precious, unread book. I turned and ran. I was pretty sick, but I ran. And run I shall, to my dying day, whenever a bull begins to explain with a club.|$|E
6000|$|... "And when I {{reminded}} him," [...] said Hyde, weeping, [...] "that it was <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{ranch and}} that he was trespassing, he had the infernal meanness to ask me why didn't I stay on my ranch and hold possession when I see him a-coming! Why didn't I stay on it, the blathering lunatic--by George, when I heard that racket and looked up that hill it was just like the whole world was a-ripping and a-tearing down that mountain side --splinters, and cord-wood, thunder and lightning, hail and snow, odds and ends of hay stacks, and awful clouds of dust!--trees going end over end in the air, rocks as big as a house jumping 'bout a thousand feet high and busting into ten million pieces, cattle turned inside out and a-coming head on with their tails hanging out between their teeth!--and {{in the midst of all}} that wrack and destruction sot that cussed Morgan on his gate-post, a-wondering why I didn't stay and hold possession! Laws bless me, I just took one glimpse, General, and lit out'n the county in three jumps exactly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] cried Turnbull, {{advancing}} on him {{swiftly and}} with animated gestures, [...] "why does teething hurt? Why do growing pains hurt? Why are measles catching? Why does a rose have thorns? Why do rhinoceroses have horns? Why is the horn <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the nose? Why haven't I a horn <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> nose, eh?" [...] And he struck {{the bridge of}} his nose smartly with his forefinger to indicate the place of the omission and then wagged the finger menacingly at the Creator.|$|R
6000|$|... "Naturally, {{living as}} I do almost <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> one. <b>My</b> library, which I {{will show you}} presently, {{contains}} many interesting works on the subject. But come, if you have finished we will ascend the Peak of Rakata and I will introduce you to my sunshine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At present Mrs. Fitzpiers {{can lead}} the doctor as your mis'ess could lead you," [...] the hollow-turner remarked. [...] "She's got him quite tame. But how long 'twill last I can't say. I {{happened}} to be setting a wire <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> garden one night when he met her {{on the other side}} of the hedge; and the way she queened it, and fenced, and kept that poor feller at a distance, was enough to freeze yer blood. I should never have supposed it of such a girl." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{lay back}} in her chair, {{regarding}} me, her lips slightly parted. All at once the full flavour of her, the superfine quality was revealed after years of blindness.--Nor can I describe the sudden rebellion, the revulsion that I experienced. Hambleton Durrett! It was an outrage, a sacrilege! I got up, and {{put my hand on}} the mantel. Nancy remained motionless, inert, her head lying back against the chair. Could it be that she were enjoying my discomfiture? There is no need to confess that I knew next to nothing of women; had I been less excited, I might have made the discovery that I still regarded them sentimentally. Certain romantic axioms concerning them, garnered from Victorian literature, passed current in my mind for wisdom; and one of these declared that they were prone to remain true to an early love. Did Nancy still care for me? The query, coming as it did <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> emotion, brought with it a strange and overwhelming perplexity. Did I really care for her? The many years during which I had practised the habit of caution began to exert an inhibiting pressure. Here was a situation, an opportunity suddenly thrust upon me which might never return, and which I was utterly unprepared to meet. Would I be happy with Nancy, after all? Her expression was still enigmatic.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could give}} up {{everything}} without a pang, I think, {{to a person}} I could trust, I could respect." [...] The girl heard her voice tremble under the effort to show nothing but {{what she wanted to}} show, and felt the sincerity of her implication that the piety most real to her was to be on one's knees before one's high standard. [...] "The best things here, as you know, are the things your father and I collected, things all that we worked for and waited for and suffered for. Yes," [...] cried Mrs. Gereth, with a fine freedom of fancy, [...] "there are things in the house that we almost starved for! They were our religion, they were our life, they were us! And now they're only me--except that they're also you, thank God, a little, you dear!" [...] she continued, suddenly inflicting on Fleda a kiss apparently intended to knock her into position. [...] "There isn't one of them I don't know and love--yes, as one remembers and cherishes the happiest moments of one's life. Blindfold, in the dark, with the brush of a finger, I could tell one from another. They're living things to me; they know me, they return the touch of my hand. But I could let them all go, since I have to, so strangely, to another affection, another conscience. There's a care they want, there's a sympathy that draws out their beauty. Rather than make them over to a woman ignorant and vulgar, I think I'd deface them with my own hands. Can't you see me, Fleda, and wouldn't you do it yourself?"--she appealed to her companion with glittering eyes. [...] "I couldn't bear the thought of such a woman here--I couldn't. I don't know what she'd do; she'd be sure to invent some deviltry, if it should be only to bring in her own little belongings and horrors. The world is full of cheap gimcracks, in this awful age, and they're thrust in at one at every turn. They'd be thrust in here, <b>on</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> treasures, my own. Who would save them for me--I ask you who would?" [...] and she turned again to Fleda with a dry, strained smile. Her handsome, high-nosed, excited face might have been that of Don Quixote tilting at a windmill. Drawn into the eddy of this outpouring, the girl, scared and embarrassed, laughed off her exposure; but only to feel herself more passionately caught up and, as it seemed to her, thrust down the fine open mouth (it showed such perfect teeth) with which poor Owen's slow cerebration gaped. [...] "You would, of course--only you, in all the world, because you know, you feel, as I do myself, what's good and true and pure." [...] No severity of the moral law could have taken a higher tone in this implication of the young lady who had not the only virtue Mrs. Gereth actively esteemed. [...] "You would replace me, you would watch over them, you would keep the place right," [...] she austerely pursued, [...] "and with you here--yes, with you, I believe I might rest, at last, in my grave!" [...] She threw herself on Fleda's neck, and before Fleda, horribly shamed, could shake her off, had burst into tears which couldn't have been explained, but which might perhaps have been understood.|$|E

6000|$|I was {{interrupted}} no {{more in the}} business of preparing for the birthday dinner till {{it was time for me}} to smarten myself up for receiving the company. Just as I had got my white waistcoat on, Penelope presented herself at my toilet, on pretence of brushing what little hair I have got left, and improving the tie <b>of</b> <b>my</b> white cravat. My girl was in high spirits, and I saw she had something to say to me. She gave me a kiss <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bald head, and whispered, [...] "News for you, father!

60|$|I saw Abraham Lincoln {{often the}} four years {{following}} that date. He changed rapidly and much during his Presidency--but this scene, and him in it, are indelibly stamp'd upon my recollection. As I sat <b>on</b> the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> omnibus, and had {{a good view of}} him, the thought, dim and inchoate then, has since come out clear enough, that four sorts of genius, four mighty and primal hands, will be needed to the complete limning of this man's future portrait--the eyes and brains and finger-touch of Plutarch and Eschylus and Michel Angelo, assisted by Rabelais.|$|R
