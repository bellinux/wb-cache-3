5|$|The dogs of {{all these}} islands were short, and their sizes vary {{from that of a}} lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and their hair rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy <b>of</b> <b>strangers</b> to a degree of aversion.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary <b>of</b> <b>strangers,</b> even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E

5|$|At age 11, Cassidy began {{singing and}} playing guitar in a Washington-area band called Easy Street. This band {{performed}} {{in a variety of}} styles at weddings, corporate parties, and pubs. Due to her shyness, she struggled with performing in front <b>of</b> <b>strangers.</b> While a student at Bowie High School, she sang with a local band called Stonehenge. During the summer of 1983, Cassidy sang and played guitar six days a week at the theme park Wild World. Her younger brother Dan, a fiddler, was also a member of this working band. She enrolled in art classes at Prince George's Community College but dropped out after finding them unhelpful.|$|E

The Kaqchikel {{continued}} their wars against the K'iche' kingdom over the following decade. The Aztec emperor Moctezuma II sent messengers to the Kaqchikel in 1510, warning <b>of</b> <b>strangers</b> in the Caribbean.

5|$|Rumours <b>of</b> <b>strangers</b> on the Atlantic coast reached Chiapas {{long before}} the {{physical}} presence of Spaniards in the region. This was followed by messengers from the Aztec emperor, Moctezuma II, to the K'iche' Maya of the Guatemalan Highlands, warning them to prepare for war against the Spanish intruders. This was soon followed by news that the great Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the conquistadores. A mixed embassy that included Chiapanecas, K'iche's and Kaqchikel Maya visited Hernan Cortés in the recently conquered Aztec capital, and were well received.|$|E

40|$|Stranger {{harassment}} {{is defined as}} gender based harassment in public spaces. Despite its frequency and its detrimental consequences, research has barely begun to address this phenomenon. Stranger {{harassment is}} in the eye of the beholder. Gender differences and contextual factors are decisive for its interpretation (Fairchild, 2010; Rotundo, Nguyen and Sackett, 2001). The aim of this study is to estimate contextual factors <b>of</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment and more precisely to examine the influence of gender identities and gender roles on perception and tolerance <b>of</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment within a population of young women and men aged 18 - 35. Two methods of data collection are used, a paper questionnaire and an on-line questionnaire. The sample should include more than 600 subjects. Participants are surveyed regarding their global life satisfaction (Satisfaction With Life Scale, Diener et al., 1985), personal experiences <b>of</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment (Sexual Experience Questionnaire, Fairchild, 2010) and the context of occurrence and the consequences of those experiences on several aspects of their life. Acceptation and tolerance of sexual harassment (Sexual Harassment Attitude Scale, Mazer et Percival, 1989), identification to gender roles (short French version of Bem Sex-Roles Inventory, Fontayne et al., 2000) and experiences of sexual victimization are also addressed. Results will provide us an overview <b>of</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment and its occurrence. Some risk factors may be identified, as experiences of sexual victimization that may influence tolerance <b>of</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment. Furthermore, the influence of gender roles and gender identities may be crucial for the understanding <b>of</b> <b>stranger</b> harassment as a gender based behaviorPeer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group <b>of</b> <b>Strangers</b> founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. They looked at the eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E
5|$|Thirty episodes <b>of</b> <b>Strangers</b> with Candy were made, which {{aired on}} Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000.

Colbert reprised his role for a film adaptation, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006. The film received mixed reviews. Colbert also co-wrote the screenplay with Sedaris and Dinello.|$|E

5|$|Based in Yokohama, Farsari {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with E. A. Sargent. Their firm, Sargent, Farsari & Co., dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan. The creator of these photographs remains unknown, but Farsari was the maker of {{at least some of}} the maps, notably of Miyanoshita (in the Hakone resort area) and Yokohama. After his partnership with Sargent ended, the company, now A. Farsari & Co., published successive editions of Keeling's Guide to Japan and Farsari himself wrote and published Japanese Words and Phrases for the Use <b>of</b> <b>Strangers.</b> The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers, having produced its first guidebook to Japan by July 1880.|$|E
5|$|Before the Spanish conquest, Chiapas was {{inhabited}} {{by a variety}} of indigenous peoples, including the Zoques, various Maya peoples, such as the Lakandon Ch'ol and the Tzotzil, and an unidentified group referred to as the Chiapanecas. Soconusco had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire, centred in Valley of Mexico, and paid the Aztecs tribute. News <b>of</b> <b>strangers</b> first arrived in the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew the Aztec Empire. In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Cristóbal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comitán, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave-raiding rights.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Larter {{made her}} film {{debut in the}} coming-of-age dramedy Varsity Blues, which re-united her with Dawson's Creek star James Van Der Beek and close friend Amy Smart. Smart had persuaded Larter to {{audition}} for the movie, in which she played Darcy Sears, a love interest {{for one of the}} main characters. Varsity Blues drew a domestic box office gross of US$53 million. Also in 1999, she made supporting appearances in the teen comedies Giving It Up and Drive Me Crazy, and starred in the remake House on Haunted Hill which was made for around US$20 million. The horror film, following a group <b>of</b> <b>strangers</b> invited to a party at an abandoned asylum, was panned by critics, but grossed US$15 million on its opening weekend and went on to earn over US$40 million overall.|$|E

5|$|In their unmodified wild state, red foxes are {{generally}} unsuitable as pets. Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning {{people during the}} spring period, though {{it is unlikely that}} vixens would abandon their young. Actual orphans are rare, and the ones that are adopted are likely kits that simply strayed from their den site. Kits require almost constant supervision; when still suckling, they require milk at four-hour intervals day and night. Once weaned, they may become destructive to leather objects, furniture and electric cables. Though generally friendly toward people when young, captive red foxes become fearful of humans, save for their handlers, once they reach 10 weeks of age. They maintain their wild counterpart's strong instinct of concealment, and may pose a threat to domestic birds, even when well fed. Although suspicious <b>of</b> <b>strangers,</b> they can form bonds with cats and dogs, even ones bred for fox hunting. Practical uses for tame foxes are few, though they can be encouraged to kill rats and mice in granaries. Tame foxes were once used to draw ducks close to hunting blinds.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was {{his account}} of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second {{appearing}} in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes <b>of</b> <b>strangers</b> wherever he went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and {{on the basis of these}} details, some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London. On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.|$|E

5|$|The Childhood Of Jack Harkaway is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from S. Bracebridge Hemyng's Jack Harkaway story series by Lloyd Lonergan, the film depicts {{the life of the}} title character. Given to the care <b>of</b> <b>strangers</b> after his birth, Jack grows up and is sent to a school at age 12. After being severely and unjustly punished by the schoolmaster, Jack runs away and comes across two thieves plotting a robbery. Jack hurries to the house and warns the mistress of the planned robbery. The robbery is foiled and the lady of the house is very grateful, but Jack's schoolmaster and his guardian arrive to take him back. She recognizes the guardian as the man who forced her to turn over Jack and turns them out of the house. The film's cast and production credits are unknown. The film was released on December 23, 1910, it was met with favorable reviews and saw a wide national release. In 1988, a severely deteriorated nitrate print of the film was known to exist and it was likely transferred to the Library of Congress archives in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary <b>of</b> <b>strangers.</b> Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E
