5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.|$|E
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
5|$|The Shanhua Temple {{was first}} founded during the Kaiyuan {{period of the}} Tang Dynasty (713-741) under the {{patronage}} of emperor Xuanzong, at which time it {{was known as the}} Kaiyuan Temple. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty during the Five Dynasties period (906-960), the temple underwent a name change and was known as Da Pu’ensi. During this chaotic time, out of ten buildings at the temple, <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four escaped destruction. After the takeover by the Liao Dynasty in 960, the temple assumed its present configuration.|$|E

5|$|Football-themed {{stories were}} {{a staple of}} British comics for boys from the 1950s onwards, and Roy of the Rovers was the most popular. To keep the strip exciting, Melchester was almost every year either {{competing}} for major honours or struggling against relegation to a lower division; a normal, uneventful season of mid-table mediocrity was unknown at Melchester Rovers. The strip followed {{the structure of the}} actual English football season, thus there were several months each year in summer when there was no league football. By far the most common summer storyline saw Melchester touring a fictional country in an exotic part of the world, often South America, where they would invariably be kidnapped and held to ransom. The average reader probably stayed with the comic regularly for <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four years, therefore storylines were sometimes recycled; during the first ten years of his playing career, Roy was kidnapped at least four times. Roy also made numerous appearances for England, depicted playing alongside actual players such as Malcolm Macdonald and Trevor Francis.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} other Protestant denominations, the Church {{recognises}} two sacraments: Baptism and Holy Communion (the Lord's Supper). The Church baptises both believing adults {{and the children}} of Christian families. Communion in the Church of Scotland today is open to Christians of whatever denomination, without precondition. Communion services are usually taken fairly seriously in the Church; traditionally, a congregation held <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four per year, although practice now greatly varies between congregations. In some congregations communion is celebrated once a month.|$|E

25|$|Cadland was a brown horse {{standing}} 15.3 hands high bred by {{his owner}} the Duke of Rutland. His dam was the Duke's highly successful racemare Sorcery, who won The Oaks in 1811 {{and several other}} important races. As a broodmare, however, {{she had been a}} disappointment and had been barren for two years before being sent to a cheap and undistinguished stallion named Andrew in 1824. Andrew, a well-bred but not particularly successful racehorse, had attracted little attention as a sire, and was covering at a fee of one guinea when Sorcery was one of <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four Thoroughbred mares sent to him in the year of Cadland's conception.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} supporting some {{deviations from the}} standard regimen when treating pulmonary TB. Sputum culture positive patients who are smear negative {{at the start of}} treatment do well with only 4 months of treatment (this has not been validated for HIV-positive patients); and sputum culture negative patients do well on only 3 months of treatment (possibly because some of these patients never had TB at all). It is unwise to treat patients for <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four months, but all TB physicians will have patients who stop their treatment early (for whatever reason), and it can be re-assuring to know that sometimes retreatment is unnecessary. Elderly patients who are already taking a large number of tablets may be offered 9HR, omitting PZA which is the bulkiest part of the regimen.|$|E
25|$|The blade {{itself is}} customarily {{divided into three}} {{sections}} for leverage in different offensive and defensive techniques. The tip of the blade is the jiànfeng, meant for stabbing, slashing, and quick percussive cuts. The jiànfeng typically curves smoothly to a point, though in the Ming period sharply angled points were common. Some antiques have rounded points, though these are likely the result of wear. The middle section is the zhongren or middle edge, and is used {{for a variety of}} offensive and defensive actions: cleaving cuts, draw cuts, and deflections. The section of blade closest to the guard is called the jiàngen or root, and is mainly used for defensive actions; on some late period jian, the base of the blade was made into an unsharpened ricasso. These sections are not necessarily of the same length, with the jiànfeng being <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four inches long.|$|E

25|$|The Halifax Ambulance Team with Richardson in charge, records, circa. 1918, {{that the}} first and second teams of the Halifax Borough Police Ambulance Teams and the prizes, 'of which there are many', they had won during the summer months. A range of other trophies had been won by individuals. Later, in the yard of the Police Station at Harrison Road, policemen from the newly {{increased}} Mounted Section posed for a photograph. There were seven Constables wearing a white sash and gaiters, two Sergeants, two Inspectors and the Chief Constable. (Wearing gaiters and spurs.) Before the War there were <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four mounted men. All the horses were stabled in the yard which was big enough for them and motor cars as well as Police parades. The mounted section lasted until 1944, when the number were reduced to four again, the last horses were named Pilot, Portia, Peter and Paul.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 Labour {{returned}} {{to power and}} introduced the Social Contract which implemented a voluntary incomes policy, {{with the backing of}} many left wing union leaders such as Hugh Scanlon and Jack Jones. This period also saw {{an increase in the number}} of full-time union convenors, and these factors along with an increase in unemployment have been blamed by Tony Cliff and the SWP for a drastic fall in union militancy. In 1974 the IS was ambitious and optimistic expecting to double the number of its factory branches over the next year. In practice they declined swiftly from 38 in 1974 to <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four by 1976. When the firefighters went on strike in 1977 against the Social Contract the IS was unable to deliver any significant solidarity. The national rank and file movement fell apart. In 1976 the SWP decided to stand in parliamentary by-elections but the results were very poor and the original idea of standing in 60 seats at the next election was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Penniman {{must have}} had {{abundant}} opportunity to know Allen’s character. It would seem that she turned against the Toryism of her step-father and her own British ancestry, to sympathize with the settlers in their struggle for freedom and for statehood. But though she doubtless admired Ethan Allen's bravery, {{it is said that}} she was repelled by his rough manners and his tincture of infidelity, and possibly by his family of children, and hesitated for some time before yielding to his wooing. However, after their marriage she had great influence over him though she could not entirely cure him of the convivial habits common to the period. This is illustrated by the story of his watch which she insisted must be found every morning hanging on a certain nail as evidence that he had returned home the night before in a condition to make connection between the nail and the ring of his watch. In the spring of 1787, the Allens removed to Burlington, Vermont he having purchased the farm later known as the Van Ness farm north of the city, still later converted into Ethan Allen Park. They spent the first few months in the family of a Mr. Collins at “The Bay,” as the little settlement on the Lake was called, where there were then <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four families. Here, their younger son Hannibal was born.|$|E

500|$|Casualty reports made by {{both sides}} varied; {{historian}} Charles Arnade notes {{that all of the}} numbers reported are probably unreliable. [...] Moore's report listed only two men killed, while Zúñiga in his report claimed that more than 60 of the English force were killed. [...] Zúñiga claimed <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four killed and 20 wounded for the Spanish contingent, none of which were caused by English cannon fire.|$|E

She highlighted the [...] "immersive experience" [...] of Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) as the principal influence for creating a body work that would mean [...] "people would hear things differently and [...] actually be able to see the whole vision of the album".|$|E

500|$|On August 18, 1997, {{four days}} before {{shooting}} on the episode began, NBC censors provided 17 pages of notes to Yoshimura requiring changes regarding violence and language. A typical Homicide: Life on the Street episode usually results in <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four pages. Yoshimura made several modifications {{with the help of}} his writing assistant Joy Lusco, a future writer on Simon's HBO series The Wire. The changes included removing several instances of the words [...] "ass" [...] and [...] "bitch" [...] from the script. Lange's line, [...] "Why am I even saying the son of a bitch's name?" [...] was changed to [...] "Why am I even saying the twerp's name?", and his line, [...] "Go find another train and throw your miserable stupid ass in front of it" [...] was changed to [...] "throw yourself in front of it".|$|E
500|$|Verity {{earned the}} respect of Bradman, {{generally}} regarded as the greatest batsman to have played cricket, and enjoyed bowling at him. Bradman described Verity as a great cricketer and wrote that throughout their respective careers, he [...] "grew {{more and more to}} respect [...] both as a gentleman and as a player." [...] Robertson-Glasgow thought that Verity was [...] "one of <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four bowlers who came to the battle with Bradman on not unequal terms". During the 17 Tests in which they faced each other, Verity dismissed Bradman eight times, more than any other bowler. Robertson-Glasgow believed that, but for Verity, Bradman would have averaged over 150 in Tests instead of his actual batting average. In all first-class cricket, Verity dismissed Bradman 10 times in total, on two occasions twice in the same game. Only Clarrie Grimmett equalled 10 first-class dismissals of Bradman. However, Bradman once said: [...] "I think I know all about Clarrie (Grimmett), but with Hedley I am never sure. You see, there's no breaking-point with him." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 September, the Australian advance {{continued}} as the 2/9th {{moved up the}} coast {{either side of the}} coastal track. After about one hour, the advance company struck a Japanese defensive position at Goroni. Throughout the day the Australians worked to outflank the position before launching an attack at 3:15pm. During this action, one of the 2/9th's sections was held up by fire from three Japanese machine gun positions. Corporal John French ordered {{the other members of the}} section to take cover before he attacked and destroyed two of the machine guns with grenades. French then attacked the third position with his Thompson submachine gun. The Japanese firing ceased and the Australian section advanced to find that the machine gunners had been killed and that French had died in front of the third position. He was [...] awarded the Victoria Cross for his [...] "cool courage and disregard of his own personal safety" [...] which [...] "saved members of his section from heavy casualties and was responsible for the successful conclusion of the attack". By the end of the 4th, the Japanese force included only 50 fully fit soldiers; all the other surviving troops were either incapacitated or could only offer token resistance. In addition, the commanders of all the Japanese companies had been killed and <b>only</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four platoon leaders remained.|$|E
