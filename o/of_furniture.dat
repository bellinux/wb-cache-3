The Great Bookcase was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the 1862 International Exhibition. Later pieces, such as the Crocker Dressing Table and the Golden Bed, and its accompanying Vita Nuova Washstand, were made specifically for the house. John Betjeman located the Narcissus Washstand in a junk shop in Lincoln {{and gave it to}} Evelyn Waugh, a fellow enthusiast for Victorian art and architecture, who featured it in his 1957 novel, The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold.

5|$|The {{businessman}} and politician William Smith was appointed Lord Warden in 1891, but died in Walmer Castle {{during his first}} visit here in October of that year.

The government carried out the plan after Smith's death, protecting almost 70 pieces <b>of</b> <b>furniture</b> and 50 artworks at the castle and forbidding them being moved from the castle without the Secretary of State for War's approval. Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the Marquess of Salisbury, became the next Lord Warden; with adequate legal protection now in place, the 3rd Duke of Wellington suggested returning his grandfather's possessions to the castle, but Lady Salisbury declined the offer.|$|E

The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.

5|$|Utica's {{location}} on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution. Utica's economy centered around the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>furniture,</b> heavy machinery, textiles and lumber. The combined effects of the Embargo Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry. Like other upstate New York cities, mills in Utica processed cotton from the Deep South, a slave society. Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton.|$|E

50|$|China has a {{long history}} <b>of</b> furniture-making. <b>Furniture</b> from the Ming and Qing periods in many ways {{represent}} the culmination of Chinese furniture-making skills, and they have various different features. Ming furniture features simple, smooth, and flowing lines, and plain and elegant ornamentation, fully bringing out the special qualities <b>of</b> frame-structure <b>furniture.</b> Influenced by China's burgeoning foreign trade and advanced craftsmanship techniques, <b>furniture</b> <b>of</b> the Qing Dynasty period turned to rich and intricate ornamentation, along with coordinated engraved designs. Because of the high level of development <b>of</b> Chinese <b>furniture</b> in the Ming and Qing dynasties, most Chinese furniture design today follows in the tradition from these two periods.|$|R
