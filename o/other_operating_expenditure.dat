40|$|New semi-autonomus {{public bodies}} will be {{established}} in 2001. The bodies are called the Independent Administrative Corporations (IACs) which implement the public services {{in accordance with the}} middle term strategic plan. IACs have a discretionary power in allocating the operating fund into their operating activities, while the capital expenditures are basically regulated by their ministers in charge and the Finance Minister. Also their accountings adopt an accrual based standard. However, the finance guidelines for lACs have some significant problems. First, the financial behavior might be little affected through accrual accounting, since budgeting and allocation of resources are implemented in a cash based style as before. Second, their autonomy on operation would be largely restrained by the limitation in which they have not a mandate for capital expenditures; the quality of public services is influenced by capital expenditures or standards <b>other</b> than <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures.</b> In this regard, two possible alternatives in budgeting and accounting are indicated...|$|R

Increases {{in the minimum wage}} are shown to have a significant negative effect on the enrollment rates of 16 - and 17 -year-old males and 17 -year-old females. The empirical estimates imply that a 50 cent increase in the hourly minimum wage causes a 0. 7 percentage point fall in the percent of 16 - and 17 -year-olds enrolled in school (a decline that, in Ontario, would amount to more than 1, 700 students). The results also indicate that lower student-teacher ratios, better paid teachers, more administrative spending, increased spending on instructional supplies, and increases in <b>other</b> school board <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures</b> do not have a systematic effect on enrollment rates. ...|$|R

5000|$|Although details vary across regimes, {{the most}} common {{approach}} to creating incentives to reduce expenditure {{is to use a}} regulatory period consisting of many years. The allowed revenue is set once {{at the beginning of the}} regulatory period and there is no clawback of over-spend or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period - thereby allowing the regulated firm to keep some or all of the cost savings it makes during the regulatory period. The <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> input to the building block model is usually based closely on the observed <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> at the end of the previous regulatory period. This approach ensures reasonably strong incentives to reduce <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the early years of a regulatory period but can, in principle, lead to weak incentives to reduce <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the later years of a regulatory period. One way to solve this problem is to base the <b>operating</b> <b>expenditure</b> not just on a single [...] "test year" [...] of the previous regulatory period but on the average of the previous years. In practice this problem is, instead, often addressed with some form of [...] "efficiency carry-over" [...] or [...] "efficiency benefit sharing" [...] scheme.|$|R
40|$|Basic public {{education}} is still largely {{the responsibility of}} the central government, delivered through the Department of Education (DepEd), notwithstanding the devolution of many basic services to local government units (LGUs). However, LGUs do provide supplementary funding support to public basic education because they have access to a sustainable source of financial resources that are earmarked for the basic education subsector, the Special Education Fund (SEF). The SEF comes from an additional one percent tax on real property that LGUs are mandated to impose and collect by virtue of Republic Act 7160 otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. The resources that LGUs provide to the basic education sector from their general fund are quite significant at 7 percent of total general government spending on basic education in 2001 - 2008. Thus, the LGUs are considered major partners of the national government in the delivery of basic education services. In this light, the study examines the management of the SEF in terms of collection, allocation, and utilization in order to maximize LGUs' support for the Education for All (EFA) initiative and to promote a more equitable allocation of resources for basic education. However, there are significant disparities in per pupil SEF spending across LGUs of different income classes and in different regions. LGUs in urban areas (i. e., cities and the large municipalities) where property values are high tend to have larger tax bases. These disparities have significant implications on the ability of the LGUs to provide additional support to the basic education sector. In terms of spending priorities, some of the major findings of the study include: (i) maintenance and <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>expenditures</b> captured the biggest chunk of the total SEF spending of all LGUs in the aggregate (40 %) while capital outlays and personal services garnered an average of 32 percent and 29 percent of LGUs total SEF spending in 2001 - 2008; (ii) repair/maintenance and construction of school buildings tops the list of SEF spending priorities in the sample Provincial School Boards (PSBs) and the sample City School Boards (CSBs); and (iii) relatively large portions (20 %- 50 %) of the SEF are set aside for sports and other co-curricular activities and programs of the DepEd. The findings of the study highlight the need to improve the governance of Local School Boards (LSBs). Related to this, the measures proposed include: (i) clearer guidelines on preparation of the LSB budget, (ii) the establishment of needs-based criteria in allocating SEF across schools to ensure its efficient and effective use, and (iii) institutionalization of greater transparency between DepEd and LGUs in terms of reporting of resources that schools receive from the DepEd budget, on the one hand, and actual SEF collections and its utilization during the budget year, on the other hand, in order to foster better working relationship in the LSB...|$|R
