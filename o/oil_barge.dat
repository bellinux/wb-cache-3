5|$|Despite {{the close}} {{passage of the}} storm to the Florida Keys, damage in the area was light and {{amounted}} to $175,000. Of this, $125,000 was attributed to structural damage. Hurricane-force winds in the archipelago only lasted 15minutes and gale-force winds occurred over a 5hour span. The brevity of damaging winds limited {{the effects of the}} storm. Most damage was constrained to downed trees, signs, and power poles. Two trailers were overturned, however, and an <b>oil</b> <b>barge</b> sank in the Key West Harbor. Two people drowned after their shrimp boat was destroyed. In and around the Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park, Royal Palms, and Royal Poincianas were defoliated by the hurricane's winds. Downed trees and power lines in Collier County temporarily left many customers without phone and electrical service. Residents in nearby Lee Cypress stated that the effects from Isbell were worse than Hurricane Donna which struck the region as a Category4 in September 1960.|$|E

After burning 17 hours, the barge's mooring lines gave way and the barge began to drift. William S. Grattans crew {{attempted}} to attach tow lines to the drifting barge but it struck a dock at an oil company where the empty oil tanker B.B. McColl was moored. The fumes on the B.B. McColl ignited causing an explosion and fire that engulfed William S. Grattan. Captain Thomas Hylant along with his crew abandoned ship and swam through the flames to shore. Chief Engineer Thomas Lynch of William S. Grattan lost his life and seven other crew members were injured. The unattended boilers on William S. Grattan soon ran dry and exploded, leaving the ship burned out and heavily damaged.|$|E

40|$|Vessel traffic {{places the}} {{sensitive}} environmental, natural, and cultural resources of Washington’s outer coast {{at risk of}} oil or hazardous materials spills. In 1995, International Maritime Organization established the Area to be Avoided off the Washington Coast (ATBA) to reduce this risk. Annual estimates of vessel compliance with the ATBA suggest that tugs towing <b>oil</b> and chemical <b>barges</b> have lower compliance rates than other types of vessel, but these compliance estimates have been contested. This project investigated {{some of the issues}} that have led to criticism of existing tug compliance estimates and examined several factors that could be related to observed cases of noncompliance. Analysis of vessel traffic and weather data from 2005 showed that: 1) the compliance rate for tugs towing <b>oil</b> <b>barges</b> increases by 8 % to 91 % and the compliance rate for tugs towing chemical barges increases by 21 % to 57 % when empty barge transits through the ATBA are treated as compliant instead of noncompliant; 2) most tugs towing laden <b>oil</b> <b>barges</b> through the ATBA did not pass deeper than one nautical mile into the Area while tugs towing laden chemical barges through the ATBA all passed deeper than one and a quarter nautical miles into the Area; 3) a large portion of transits involved tugs calling at ports on the Columbia River; 4) there is inconclusive evidence of an association between tug passage through the ATBA and use of the Two-Way Route in the Strait of Juan de Fuca; 5) there is virtually no evidence of an association between tug compliance and weather; and 6) most tugs inbound for the Strait of Juan de Fuca were towing empty barges. A review of incident and accident data showed that, between 1994 and 2006, an average of one incident or accident involving a tug towing an <b>oil</b> or chemical <b>barge</b> occurred off the outer coast each year. These findings should help guide decisions about prioritizing spill prevention efforts along Washington’s northern outer coast...|$|R
