40|$|Scientists in many fields {{have the}} common and basic need of {{dimensionality}} reduction: visualizing the underlying {{structure of the}} massive multivariate data in a low-dimensional space. However, many dimensionality reduction methods confront the so-called "crowding problem" that clusters tend to overlap {{with each other in}} the embedding. Previously, researchers expect to avoid that problem and seek to make clusters maximally separated in the embedding. However, the proposed in-tree (IT) based method, called IT-map, allows clusters in the embedding to be locally <b>overlapped,</b> while <b>seeking</b> to make them distinguishable by some small yet key parts. IT-map provides a simple, effective and novel solution to cluster-preserving mapping, which makes it possible to cluster the original data points interactively and thus should be of general meaning in science and engineering.

40|$|Abstract — Multistatic radar is {{used for}} target {{detection}} and tracking in buildings and rooms. Target detection and tracking relies on accurate knowledge of the excess delay of the multipath component which travels from the transmitter, to the target, {{and then to the}} receiver. If the environment creates many multipath components, individual ultra-wideband (UWB) impulses <b>overlap.</b> We <b>seek</b> to accurately estimate a target’s excess delay by considering the difference between the channel impulse response (CIR) and a known CIR of the static environment as a hidden Markov model (HMM). Experimental CIRs are used to test the performance of this model, as well as energy detection. The RMSE from applying a HMM was 2. 7 ns and 2. 8 ns and from applying energy detection was 5. 3 ns and 5. 2 ns for two experimental setups. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} explores whether 4 year old {{children}} have abstract syntactic representations {{and if so}} whether they are facilitated by repetition of lexical items. A lexical boost, elicited by repetition, {{has been shown to}} facilitate the magnitude of priming (Pickering & Branigan, 1998) in adults, whilst being subject to rapid decay (Hartsuiker, Bernolet, Schoonbaert, Speybroeck & Vanderelst, 2008). By replicating the ‘snap game’ priming paradigm of Branigan, McLean and Jones (2005) we demonstrate that children possess limited abstract representations of active and passive transitive constructions. By manipulating lag and lexical <b>overlap</b> we <b>seek</b> to demonstrate both the persistence of syntactic priming, and rapid decay of the lexical boost, in children. The results presented add to the literature which suggests that children’s acquisition of language proceeds by way of a multi-faceted approach which draws on both abstract syntactic representations and lexical items. This convergent approach integrates theoretical underpinnings from universal grammar (Chomsky, 1959) and usage based accounts of acquisition (Tomasello, 2000) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} an empirical analysis of US inward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) with particular reference {{to the role of}} skilled labour. The theoretical foundations of the analysis are rooted in OLI theory and, in particular, its locational aspects. However, the empirical techniques employed are e more commonly associated with factor proportions theory. Thus, the contribution of the paper is partly methodological in applying such techniques to the determinants of inward FDI. The paper also produces evidence that US inward FDI is focused on skill intensive economic activities, using multiple categories of skilled labour. It also finds that strategic asset seeking behaviour focused on skilled labour <b>overlaps</b> with efficiency <b>seeking</b> behaviour linked to productivity change, export activity and market seeking behaviour...|$|R

Principles of green infrastructure such as multifunctionality, the multi-scale approach and connectivity show correspondences with landscape planning elements. However, some differences are apparent. The objective {{of this paper is to}} determine whether the main aims of these two frameworks <b>overlap.</b> It also <b>seeks</b> to deduce what benefits from ecosystem services could be provided by integrating the green infrastructure approach into the German landscape planning system. The results show that the green infrastructure concept is not well-known in German planning practice, although its principles are generally implemented through traditional landscape planning. Nevertheless, green infrastructure could act as a supplementary approach to current landscape planning practices by improving public acceptance and strengthening the social focus of the current landscape planning system...|$|R
40|$|How do {{small firms}} in {{different}} sectors collaborate to innovate? A {{possible explanation is}} that of network structural holes and their bridging (Burt, 1992). Conversely, Stark (2009) argues that solely bridging or brokering does not necessarily lead to the generation of new knowledge, and that successful innovations occur rather via folded diversity, that is, where two firms have some shared membership as well as distinct cognitive diversity. But what happens when cognitively diverse firms without the advantage of <b>overlapping</b> membership nevertheless <b>seek</b> to co-create an innovation to mutual commercial advantage? Using Leximancer we built semantic network maps for three interventions in which small digital creative firms each formed new knowledge with a group from one of three other sectors: education, mining and manufacturing. We argue the semantic enabling of the interventions acted as both a broker and a “structural fold”, enabling social legitimation and a shared language that made innovation possible...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we seek to}} {{accomplish}} two main tasks. The first is {{to lay out the}} different theoretical approaches to understanding the concept of competitiveness as it applies at the spatial level of city regions. We provide a definition of what the concept means at this level. We then examine the different but sometimes <b>overlapping</b> theories that <b>seek</b> to explain what makes city regional economies competitive. These include export base, increasing returns, knowledge and innovation, cluster and cultural economy theories. The second task is to understand the roles of different concepts of proximity in these theories. Here we make a broad distinction between spatial nearness, organizational interactions and cultural proximity. We conclude that all three of these play significant roles in the competitiveness of city economies with the most competitive successfully combining geographically local assets with knowledge and information from other places. compétitivité urbaine, proximité, théorie, city competitiveness, proximity, theory...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a {{framework}} on which discussions on integrity should be based, which is needed because integrity seems to have become a ‘container concept’: too many things are attributed to the concept. In order to provide some clarity in the debate this thesis describes four different views on integrity that have widely influenced the debate, namely the views as presented by Frankfurt, Williams, Korsgaard, and Calhoun. Besides describing these accounts of integrity this thesis analyses them and <b>seeks</b> <b>overlap</b> in the different theories. The three points where the different theories meet are the components that each discussion on integrity should at all times involve and thus form the framework on which further ideas can be based. The thesis does not contain a new and comprehensive definition of integrity but shows which components should at least {{be included in the}} concept of integrity...|$|R
40|$|The {{common law}} engages with social media {{in a manner}} that <b>overlaps</b> with defamation: <b>seeking</b> to balance the {{competing}} interests of free speech and protection of reputation. Employment law prompts a question as to how the law on this topic is developing. Adjudication of the concept of business reputation is the comparative focal point. Canadian employment law is developing a balance between protecting business reputation and workers’ free speech (though there are issues arising therein). In the UK, however, the term has been more of a blunt tool. As a result, a juxtaposition has arisen: speech in traditional media is better protected than that of workers using virtual social platforms. Using the contrasting case law as an example, the argument pursued here is that law must develop {{in a manner that}} establishes scope for remarks by workers on user-generated content platforms while protecting business reputation. To permit discipline for any form of social media remark would be inconsistent with the spirit of twenty-first century defamation law that has expanded protection for speech...|$|R
40|$|While {{scholarship}} on educational change has long accepted that disruptions {{to the status}} quo are {{an essential part of the}} change process, disruption has never been more central to planned change than it is in the current political context in the USA, where legislation has mandated school closure, reconstitution, and turnaround as required remedies for schools failing to produce annual student achievement gains required by government. We are also unfortunately hampered by the imprecise language that surrounds complexity- based theories of educational change. Words such as perturbance, turbulence, and disruption all have gained currency lately, but meanings are unclear and <b>overlapping.</b> This essay <b>seeks</b> to lend some clarity to the debate by defining turbulence as the perception of forces in an organizational environment with the potential to disrupt current modes of operation. This is distinguished from perturbance which is defined as the social process of actors coming together to adjust organizational practice to fit with the changing environmental context. The case is argued that sensible reformers ought to be fostering perturbance while minimizing the harmful consequences of excessive turbulence...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} discovering overlapping communities in networks which we model as generalizations of Graph Packing problems with <b>overlap.</b> We <b>seek</b> a collection S' ⊆S consisting of at least k sets subject to certain disjointness restrictions. In the r-Set Packing with t-Membership, each element of U belongs to at most t sets of S' while in t-Overlap each pair of sets in S' overlaps in at most t elements. Each set of S has at most r elements. Similarly, both of our graph packing problems seek a collection K of at least k subgraphs in a graph G each isomorphic to a graph H ∈H. In H-Packing with t-Membership, each vertex of G belongs to at most t subgraphs of K while in t-Overlap each pair of subgraphs in K overlaps in at most t vertices. Each member of H has at most r vertices and m edges. We show NP-Completeness results {{for all of our}} packing problems and we give a dichotomy result for the H-Packing with t-Membership problem analogous to the Kirkpatrick and Hell Kirk 78. We reduce the r-Set Packing with t-Membership to a problem kernel with O((r+ 1) ^r k^r) elements while we achieve a kernel with O(r^r k^r-t- 1) elements for the r-Set Packing with t-Overlap. In addition, we reduce the H-Packing with t-Membership and its edge version to problem kernels with O((r+ 1) ^r k^r) and O((m+ 1) ^m k^m) vertices, respectively. On the other hand, we achieve kernels with O(r^r k^r-t- 1) and O(m^m k^m-t- 1) vertices for the H-Packing with t-Overlap and its edge version, respectively. In all cases, k is the input parameter while t, r, and m are constants. Comment: 25 pages, 24 references, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Is {{behavioral}} engagement {{a distinct}} and useful construct? It {{is not surprising}} that employee engagement is a popular idea. A workplace where enthusiastic team members devote extra effort to innovation, cooperate with each other, and adapt effectively to change is an enticing picture for managers and employees alike. It makes sense to describe such employees as engaged with their work. But is it useful to propose that there is a distinct form a behavior- termed “behavioral engagement ” in the focal article- that can and should be distinguished from other forms of behavior? We suggest not. Over the past 20 years, there has been a proliferation of partially <b>overlapping</b> constructs that <b>seek</b> to explain different forms of work behavior that are important for organizational success. Although the specific behaviors described by these constructs are important, researchers have noted the lack of a framework for integrating the diverse range of performance constructs that now exist (Rotundo & Sackett, 2002). The focal article introduces “behavioral engagement ” as another such construct. Unfortunately, we believe this approach will add to the number of performance constructs without overcoming the barriers to a better conceptual integration among the constructs.

40|$|This paper reinterprets a child’s {{right to}} an open future as based on values other than autonomy. The paper {{identifies}} two goods that parents sometimes undermine when shaping their children’s values: authenticity and identification. It argues that these can be recognized as primary goods by both liberals and by fundamentalists. The paper then shows how we might re-conceptualize the {{right to an}} open future as protecting authenticity and identification rather than autonomy. As a running example, the paper considers ultra-Orthodox Jews in Israel who deny their sons secular education beyond an elementary school level. If their sons do not remain religious as adults, they cannot easily survive in secular world. The fundamentalist parents think they had no duty to facilitate their child’s secular future. They {{see no reason to}} protect their child’s autonomy (which they do not value) or to prepare their child for a life that conflicts with their values. This paper provides one response to their concerns. Following a political-liberal project of <b>seeking</b> <b>overlapping</b> consensus, it tries to base demands that children be prepared for varied futures on values that reasonable fundamentalists can embrace...|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: Transgressions/Transformations: Literature and BeyondIn {{this paper}} I will {{consider}} the trope of ancestral and ghostly guidance in Pacific theatre, specifically {{the way in which}} it shapes and directs acts and movements of transgression. Ostensibly, the very regularity with which spectral figures appear on the scene and disrupt characters’ schemes, through restorative humor, benign admonition or possessive intrusion, suggests conformity with values of tradition and community centered on the family, values that seem at odds with modernity. The central question then is whether this structural and thematic convention, if not merely gratifying a nostalgic longing, can amount to more than the realization of a general expectation of transgression in literature (defamiliarization authenticating aesthetic experience) and particularly in theatre (alienation challenging realism), and if so, in what ways it might be said to open literature (in the theatre), transgressively, onto the world of the everyday. Noting how the presence of ghostly guides and guardians in a range of plays from across the Pacific brings into view a liminal space (with past and present <b>overlapping),</b> I will <b>seek</b> to identify movements in word and action (spanning text, production and performance) shaped by moments of return and release that turn audiences, in the present, toward a time to come...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{several ways}} to diversify the field of Information Flow Control. At {{the heart of the}} field lie on one hand {{policies}} for describing limitations on information dependencies induced by a program, {{and on the other hand}} mechanisms to enforce such policies. We aim to improve the current state of the art by pointing out areas where current policy definitions and enforcement mechanisms fall short in terms of providing information confidentiality and integrity. We identify that integrity properties often must go beyond simple data dependencies, and provide a notion of generalized invariants for describing certain program correctness properties and show their enforcement can be incorporated in a standard monitor for Information Flow Control. For confidentiality, we show that termination insensitive security definitions may not be appropriate when programs can be invoked multiple times by an attacker, and suggest an improvement to type-based enforcement that extends the security definition to the multirun case. Furthermore, we <b>seek</b> <b>overlaps</b> between Information Flow Control and other fields. We explore the application of capability systems to enforce Information Flow Control policies, with positive results. We also study how tracking of data dependencies can be applied to improve the programming model for Differential Privacy, a framework providing strong theoretical guarantees regarding privacy preserving use of data...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} five decades, public, private and nonprofit {{entities}} have implemented a range of targeted neighborhood revitalization strategies designed to tackle the challenges associated with concentrated poverty. These efforts have included urban renewal programs, loans and grants motivated by the Community Reinvestment Act, housing redevelopment through HOPE VI, Empowerment Zones, New Markets Tax Credit investments, as well as foundation-led comprehensive community initiatives and local nonprofit ventures. The most ambitious of these initiatives have aimed to concentrate multiple investments in both infrastructure and human capital in a single neighborhood.; At their core, these comprehensive initiatives try to tackle long-standing disparities in housing, employment, education, and health caused by public policy decisions, market forces and failures, and patterns of discrimination. Yet overcoming these inequalities {{has proven to be}} difficult. In some cases, place-based initiatives have led to measurable improvements; in others, efforts have struggled, failing to significantly “move the needle” on the challenges associated with deeply entrenched neighborhood poverty.; Despite these mixed-outcomes, place-based strategies are receiving increased attention and funding from both the public and private sector. The Obama Administration has explicitly endorsed place-based policy, and has launched an evaluation of existing federal place-based policies in an effort to identify areas of <b>overlap</b> and to <b>seek</b> avenues for interagency coordination. Additionally, the administration has budgeted for a new cohort of place-based anti-poverty programs.

Tanzania’s forest plantation area covers more than 250, 000 ha and it is estimated that, forest plantations in Tanzania hold about 8. 8 million tons of carbon, and 15. 9 tons Carbon/ha which corresponds to Co 2 e 58. 2 tons/ha. Climatic change incidences have repeatedly altered ecosystem balance and function in unpredictable ways. Cited examples, some with cost implications; include: Cypress aphid infestations in Cupressuslusitanica and other genera in the Cupressaceae family in the late 1980 s. Recent insect pest outbreak in a 500 ha Pinuspatula stand at Itimbo West, Sao Hill. In the 2000 s, P. patula needle browning has been observed at Shume and Meru Plantations, while in Rungwe District the species is progressively becoming invasive and growing well at higher altitudes in the Mount Rungwe crater. Late flushing and flowering has been observed in teak plantations in Longuza, and in Eucalypts stands at Malya. Weed growth rate in plantations seems to be intensifying. It is expected that these stressors will most likely intensify as the climate changes. It is proposed that management for adaptation has to focus on maintaining/restoring forest health, and has to <b>seek</b> <b>overlap</b> areas with management for mitigation, and both need uphold cognizance {{of the concept of}} sustainable forest management (SFM) as their core objective.

The writer was interested in observing the reality show {{because it was a}} new kind of entertainment program which showed the competition among those who came from various business environment to win as the apprentice. This reality show was divided into two kinds of situation, that is, informal and formal. The writer tried to investigate the interruption and overlap that occurred in the conversation of the show based on each situation. The main theories were from Zimmerman and West (1975), Wardhaugh (1985), and Tannen (1990). This research was a descriptive qualitative research. The writer got the data from the utterances from 10 episodes of the show that she transcribed herself. From her analysis, she found that the candidates and other parties in the show tended to interrupt others rather than to overlap them. Moreover, she found the same reasons of interruption and <b>overlap,</b> such as <b>seeking</b> clarification, correcting, rejecting, completing, showing annoyance and urgency. There were several reasons that could not be included into Wardhaugh?s theory and the writer decided to include them into other reasons. The other reasons that occurred were giving suggestion, showing agreement, and concluding. The most frequent reason of interruption among the candidates in informal situation was completing while clarification was found mostly in formal situation. While the reason of overlap that occurred most frequently in formal situation was correcting, and in informal situation rejecting was the most frequent one. The only reason that did not occur was asking for help. Finally, the writer concluded that interruption happened because every party in the show tried to dominate and control the topic of the conversation...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. PURPOSE. This thesis takes a contextualised stakeholder approach to exploring alignment between organizational talent management and individual career development. The contribution and nature of career conversations {{as an opportunity for}} alignment is considered. DESIGN. This qualitative study was conducted in two phases. Phase one involved semi-structured interviews with Human Resources and Organizational Development professionals (n = 30). Phase two involved semi-structured interviews using career narratives with line managers and individuals from five case study organizations which were also involved in phase 1 (n = 40). Data were analysed thematically by stakeholder group and within each case study. LIMITATIONS. The sample used within the study were not selected to be representative. The conversations described by participants may not be representative of all of the conversations they have experienced. The case study organizations were all UK based. FINDINGS. For most HR professionals, talent management was driven by organizational goals with little reference to individual needs, hence, alignment was not a priority for them. In contrast, individuals and line managers described a commitment to <b>seeking</b> <b>overlap</b> between organizational and individual goals, with some line managers describing their role as brokers. Career conversations were seen by all stakeholders as an important part of talent management and career development, with {{the potential to be a}} vehicle for alignment. Detailed analysis of the career conversations described by individuals identified a broad range of helpful conversations, the majority of which took place informally. Additional categories of career shaper (from Bosley et al, 2009) were also identified as collaborators and catalysts. A variety of contextual features were found to influence the enactment of talent management and career development. These were summarised as a contextual map indicating local, organisational and environmental dynamics. ORIGINALITY/VALUE. The research reinforced the value of taking a contextualised perspective of both organizational talent and individual career (e. g. Cohen et al 2004; Sparrow, 2014). It also captured the voices of different stakeholder groups (e. g. Collings, 2014; Thunnissen et al, 2013) ...|$|R
40|$|Resurgence {{refers to}} the reappearance of an {{extinguished}} operant behavior when reinforcement for an alternative behavior is also discontinued. It is especially relevant to the reappearance of problem behavior because many behavioral interventions discontinue reinforcement for aberrant behavior while simultaneously reinforcing an appropriate response. Existing information about the neuropharmacology of resurgence is scarce, but suggests <b>overlap</b> between drug <b>seeking</b> observed in the resurgence model and drug seeking observed in the more widely studied reinstatement and renewal models. The aim of this dissertation was to explore additional neural systems relevant to reinstatement and renewal preparations within a resurgence paradigm to assess further overlap. The neuropharmacology of resurgence was examined in two studies via administration of two drugs that have proven effective in blocking drug seeking in reinstatement and renewal preparations. In two experiments, rats earned food pellets for pressing a target lever in Phase I. In Phase II, lever pressing no longer produced food, but food was delivered contingent on an alterative nose poke response. Finally in Phase III, neither response produced food deliveries. Prior to these Phase III sessions, separate groups of rats were injected with 0, 50, or 100 mcg/kg of the dopamine D- 2 receptor antagonist raclopride in Experiment 1 or 0, 20, or 40 mcg/kg of alpha- 2 agonist clonidine in Experiment 2. Both doses of raclopride were effective in blocking resurgence, but there was strong evidence that the higher dose did so via motor rather than motivational impairment. Furthermore, the lower dose significantly suppressed the alternative nose poke, which suggests motor impairment, as well. Only the higher dose of clonidine blocked resurgence, but did so with no evidence of motor impairment. Raclopride significantly impacted extinction of the alternative poke at both doses tested, whereas clonidine had no effect at either dose. The {{results of the present}} studies provide additional information about the neuropharmacology of resurgence, as well as additional evidence of overlap between resurgence, reinstatement, and renewal. The present results may also have implications regarding underlying neural mechanisms and for pharmacotherapies to attenuate relapse when alternative sources of reinforcement are thinned or discontinued...|$|R

The human-tiger {{conflict}} {{has become a}} major threat to long-term tiger survival and well being of local people living around tiger reserves. Mitigation of this conflict is considered most critical in multiple use forested areas where tiger ecological needs and human livelihood needs <b>overlap.</b> My thesis <b>seeks</b> {{to gain a better understanding}} of this conflict. I investigated ecological and sociological aspects of man-eating cases in and around Chitwan National Park Nepal, with an ultimate aim of guiding mitigation policies and management. Additionally, I investigated the impact of grazing restrictions on livestock husbandry practices, and also evaluated the people's perceptions and tolerance towards tigers in Madi Valley, within the Chitwan National Park. I obtained three decades of man-eating cases (1979 - 2006), each case was re-examined by visiting victim's families, or person present at the time of the incidents. Likewise, tiger's responsible for killing these people were also re-investigated by visiting Park veterinarian and zoo records. The site of each human kill and tiger removal was visited to measure habitat conditions when kills were made and where man-eating tigers occurred. A total of 36 tigers killed 88 people from 1979 - 2006. The trend of human loss increased from an average of 1. 21 persons per year prior to 1997 to 7. 22 per year since 1998. The rising trend is due to primarily increasing number of people killed in the buffer zones surrounding the Park. I classified the sex, age classes, condition of man-eating tigers, and also evaluated prey base at kill sites, and aggressiveness of tigers when people came to remove victims for cremation. Nearly half of the people killed were grass/fodder cutters. In chapter 3 the impact of grazing restriction on livestock husbandry practices is examined. Household survey data and secondary information measured the impact of changing access policies. Households needed to reduce their holdings of unproductive livestock and to switch to stall feeding. Higher stall feeding required local people to gather more fodder and increased human activities in the recovering forest may contribute to increase man-eating. In chapter 4 local people's beliefs about the importance of tiger and their tolerance levels is assessed from head of the household surveys. The value and tolerance levels are analyzed based on household demographics, resource use, and interaction with tigers. Local people highly value but only have moderate tolerance for tigers. Higher valuing and tolerance for tiger were significantly influenced by household's wealth. Furthermore, poor people were found to live closer to forest, use more forest resources, have high livestock depredation resulting in lower valuing and tolerance levels for tigers. To mitigate the conflict I recommend radio-collaring problem tigers (particularly in the buffer zone) to collect tigers behavioral and movement patterns to create 'no go' zone, continue long term tiger monitoring program by extending the cooperation of the local communities, implement a tiger conservation awareness to educate local people on tiger biology, and improve compensation program to increase local tolerance towards tiger...|$|R
