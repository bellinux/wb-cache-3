5000|$|The <b>Orange</b> Cup <b>Moth,</b> Pseudanapaea transvestita, is {{a species}} of moth of the Limacodidae family. It {{is found in the}} east of Australia.|$|R
50|$|Nascia acutellus, the {{streaked}} <b>orange</b> <b>moth,</b> is a moth in the Crambidae family. It {{was described}} by Walker in 1866. It is found in North America, {{where it has been}} recorded from Nova Scotia to Florida, west to Texas and north to Nebraska, Michigan and Ontario. It was also reported from Colorado. The habitat consists of wet grassy areas with sedges.|$|E
50|$|Thaumatotibia (Cryptophlebia) leucotreta, {{commonly}} known as the false codling moth, <b>orange</b> <b>moth,</b> citrus codling moth or orange codling moth, is a moth in the Tortricidae family under the order of Lepidoptera. Larvae of the moth feed {{on a wide range of}} crops from cotton and macadamia nuts to Citrus species. The larvae have a less selective diet than the codling moth, which feeds primarily on temperate fruit crops.|$|E
50|$|The frosted <b>orange</b> <b>moth</b> (Gortyna flavago) is a moth of the Noctuidae family {{which is}} found in Europe, Armenia, Syria and east through the Palearctic to western Siberia. It has also been {{recorded}} in Algeria. The frosted orange is a night-flying species with orange and brown speckled wings allow for perfect camouflage against autumn leaves in the daytime. It is attracted to light and does not come to flowers, and its larva inhabit the stems and roots of the species' food plants.|$|E
50|$|Adoxophyes fasciculana, {{the bell}} <b>moth</b> or <b>orange</b> tip <b>moth,</b> is a moth of the Tortricidae family. It was {{described}} from the Moluccas {{and is also}} known from Vietnam, Australia and the Pacific Islands.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Orange</b> Mint <b>Moth</b> or Orange-spotted Pyrausta (Pyrausta orphisalis) is {{a species}} of moth of the Crambidae family. It is found from Newfoundland west to British Columbia, south to Florida and New Mexico.|$|R
40|$|A {{resident}} {{population of the}} yellow-headed fireworm, Acleris minuta (Robinson) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), is established in the commercial nurseries of southwestern Iowa. This species sporadically reaches pest status causing considerable damage to rosaceous and ericaceous plantings;A conceptual life system model has been constructed to explain the bionomics of A. minuta populations. The conceptual model consists of an ovipositional subsystem, a developmental subsystem for larval instars 1 - 4, a developmental subsystem for larval instars 5, 6, 2 ̆ 6 7 under a summer and winter color morph scheme, and an overwintering subsystem;Acleris minuta is a multivoltine pest with 4 discrete generations in southwestern Iowa. The adult moths are seasonally dimorphic. Adults from the first 3 generations emerge as <b>orange</b> <b>moths,</b> while adults from the fourth generation emerge as gray <b>moths.</b> <b>Orange</b> <b>moths</b> are capable of mating on day 1 post emergence between the hours of 0500 - 0800 CDST. Gray moths which emerge in the fall are not capable of mating even if environmental conditions are favorable. Apparently, {{both males and females}} overwinter and mate in the spring;Larval development proceeds through 5 stadia, 6 stadia, or 7 stadia. Reduced growth rates caused by nutrient deficiencies and other adverse environmental conditions increase the frequencies of supernumerary molts. The 6 and 7 instar modes of development are more prevalent during the fourth generation;Laboratory and ecological life tables have been constructed. Ten species of parasitoids caused significant mortality during 1977 and 1978...|$|R
50|$|Dichomeris citrifoliella, the <b>orange</b> webworm <b>moth,</b> is a moth in the Gelechiidae family. It was {{described}} by Chambers in 1880. It is found in North America, {{where it has been}} recorded from Michigan and Wisconsin to Florida and Texas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Orange</b> Sallow <b>Moth</b> or Aureolaria Seed Borer (Rhodoecia aurantiago) is {{a species}} of moth of the Noctuidae family. It has a {{scattered}} distribution from southern Maine and the hills around Boston, Massachusetts, west across southern Ontario to south-western Wisconsin and Missouri, south into Florida and Texas.|$|R
50|$|Loboschiza koenigiana, the <b>orange</b> tortricid <b>moth</b> or leaf webber, is {{a species}} of moth of the Tortricidae family. It {{is found in the}} United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Burma, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia (Java), New Guinea, Australia (Queensland), the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan and Korea.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{steeply sloping}} hill, {{which is a}} fine example of grazed chalk {{grassland}} in the southern Buckinghamshire Chilterns. There is a wide variety of plants, some of which provide food for the larvae of important butterflies on the site. Two butterflies are rare, the silver spotted skipper [...] and the Adonis blue. Another rare invertebrate is the <b>orange</b> clearwing <b>moth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fifehead Wood {{provides}} the light <b>orange</b> underwing <b>moth</b> (Archiearis notha) with its sole Dorset residence. The site {{also has a}} large variety of butterflies, such as the white admiral (Limenitis camilla) and the purple hairstreak (Neozephyrus quercus).Breeding populations of several different birds inhabit Fifehead Wood. Grey heron and great spotted woodpeckers may be spotted,and treecreepers can also be observed spiraling within the habitat, as they ascend tree trunks in a progression of small hops.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flowers of}} Monarda bradburiana produce copious {{quantities}} of nectar and are attractive to bumblebees and other long-tongued bees, butterflies, hummingbird moths, beeflies and hummingbirds. Pollen is harvested by halictid bees which cannot reach the nectar, and a specialist pollinator is Doufourea monardae, {{a small black}} bee. This is a food plant for the caterpillars of the hermit sphinx, the gray marvel, the <b>orange</b> mint <b>moth</b> and the raspberry pyrausta moth. Herbivorous mammals tend to avoid the foliage, perhaps because it has an odour of oregano.|$|R
50|$|The adult moth has black wings {{with white}} {{markings}} {{on both the}} forewings and hindwings. The forewings have two white spots that are more elongated while the hindwing only has a single spot near to the centre; the wingspan is 35-45 mm. The thorax and abdomen of the moth are black with bands of <b>orange.</b> The magpie <b>moth</b> is diurnal which, coupled with its colourful markings means it is often mistaken for a butterfly. It is most active from September to June in the mornings and evenings {{where it can be}} seen flying over the tops of host plants.|$|R
