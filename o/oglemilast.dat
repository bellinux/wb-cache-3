40|$|PDE 4 inhibitors {{have been}} in {{development}} as a novel anti-inflammatory therapy since the 1980 s with asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) being primary indications. Despite initial optimism, none have yet reached the market. In most cases, the development of PDE 4 inhibitors of various structural classes, including cilomilast, filaminast, lirimilast, piclamilast, tofimilast, AWD- 12 - 281 (aka GSK 842470), CDP 840, CI- 1018, D- 4418, IC 485, L- 826, 141, SCH 351391 and V 11294 A has been discontinued due to lack of efficacy. A primary problem is the low therapeutic ratio of these compounds, which severely limits the dose that can be given. Indeed, for many of these compounds {{it is likely that the}} maximum tolerated dose is either sub-therapeutic or at the very bottom of the efficacy dose-response curve. Therefore, the challenge is to overcome this limitation. It is, therefore, encouraging that many â€˜new(er) ' PDE 4 inhibitors in development are reported to have an improved therapeutic window including tetomilast, <b>oglemilast,</b> apremilast, ONO 6126, IPL- 512602 and IPL- 455903 (aka HT- 0712), although the basis for their superior tolerability has not been disclosed. In addition, other approaches are possible that may allow the anti-inflammatory activity of PDE inhibitors to be realized. Accordingly, this Commentary endorses the view of Spina (2008), published in the current issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, that the therapeutic utility of PDE 4 inhibitors to suppress inflammation still remains a viable concept...|$|E
