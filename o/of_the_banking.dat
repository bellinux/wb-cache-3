5|$|Rome had {{no central}} bank, and {{regulation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> system was minimal. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits.

Seneca assumes that anyone involved in commerce needs access to credit.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of inner-shelf circulation along the central Oregon coast during the 2004 upwelling season is described using a 70 -km-long array <b>of</b> moorings along <b>the</b> 15 -m isobath. Circulation at three stations located onshore of a submarine bank differed {{from that of a}} station north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> despite <b>the</b> relatively uniform wind forcing and inner-shelf bathymetry present. During upwelling-favorable winds, strong southward alongshelf flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> no alongshelf flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> and increasing southward flow occurred onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> During downwelling-favorable winds, strong northward flow occurred in the inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> while weak flow occurred north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These alongshelf differences in inner-shelf circulation were due to <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> which isolated <b>the</b> inner shelf onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> from <b>the</b> regional upwelling circulation that was evident at the northernmost station. As a result, circulation onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was driven primarily by local wind forcing, while flow north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> was only partially driven by local winds. A secondary mode of variability, attributed to <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional upwelling jet due to remote forcings, contributed <b>the</b> bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variability observed north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> With <b>the</b> time-dependent wind forcing present, acceleration was an important term in the depth-averaged alongshelf momentum equation at all stations. During upwelling, bottom stress and acceleration opposed the wind stress north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> while bottom stress was weaker onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> where <b>the</b> across-shelf momentum flux and the alongshelf pressure gradient balanced <b>the</b> residual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceleration and stresses. During downwelling, waters onshore <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> surged northward at magnitudes much larger than that found north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b> These spatial variations developed as the season progressed and the regional upwelling circulation intensified, explaining known variations in growth and recruitment of nearshore invertebrate species...|$|R
5|$|In December 2001, {{a series}} of deposit runs began to have a severe impact on the health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> system, leading the Argentine {{authorities}} to impose a partial deposit freeze. With Argentina no longer {{in compliance with the}} conditions of the expanded IMF-supported program, the IMF decided to suspend disbursements.

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed.

5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground. There were teething problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E
5|$|Juárez Celman's {{administration}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in the ratio of debt to GDP {{toward the end of his}} tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring, a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure. The crisis was caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which ultimately led to the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> system. The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid).

5|$|The {{effect of}} declining {{interest}} rates, combined with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>banking</b> system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no liquid market for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E
