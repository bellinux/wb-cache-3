5|$|With the {{situation}} in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning {{to take advantage of}} the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941. By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, massing forces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> border.|$|E

5|$|Bormann and Himmler shared {{responsibility}} for the Volkssturm (people's militia), which drafted all remaining able-bodied men aged 16 to 60 into a last-ditch militia founded on 18 October 1944. Poorly equipped and trained, the men were sent to fight on the eastern front, where nearly 175,000 of them were killed without having any discernible impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> advance.|$|E

5|$|At the ten-minute mark, Sinden {{noticed that}} <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had changed their style, playing defence {{to protect the}} lead, rather than pressing. However, <b>the</b> {{strategy}} back-fired <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> <b>The</b> change in tactics gave the Canadians more chances to score and Cournoyer scored to even it up.|$|R

5|$|The early 19th-century {{zoologist}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{suggested the}} inheritance of acquired characteristics {{as a mechanism}} for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing transmutation of species. This theory, Lamarckism, was an influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> biologist Trofim Lysenko's antagonism to mainstream genetic theory {{as late as the}} mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal did {{not mention}} either of these events—or Kohlrautz's part in them—when testifying to American {{investigators}} in May 1945, or in an affidavit he made in August 1954 about his wartime persecutions, and researcher Guy Walters questions their authenticity. Wiesenthal variously reported that Kohlrautz was killed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Front in 1944 or in the Battle of Berlin on 19 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|According to The Economist, Apollo {{succeeded in}} {{accomplishing}} President Kennedy's goal of taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union in the Space Race, and beat it by accomplishing a singular and significant achievement, and thereby showcased {{the superiority of}} the capitalistic, free-market system as represented by the US. The publication noted the irony that in order to achieve the goal, the program required the organization of tremendous public resources within a vast, centralized government bureaucracy.|$|E
500|$|By mid-1944, {{the region}} was {{occupied}} by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Red Army. [...] Polish partisans disbanded or went underground, as {{did most of the}} Ukrainians. [...] Both would increasingly concentrate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> as their primary enemy– and both would ultimately fail.|$|R

50|$|The {{aerial warfare}} in the Winter War was the aerial {{aspect of the}} Winter War between Finland and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union from 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940. While <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> air forces greatly outnumbered the Finnish Air Force, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> bombing {{campaign}} was largely ineffective, and Finnish pilots and antiaircraft gunners inflicted significant losses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b>|$|R
5|$|Agagianian was {{elevated}} to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII. He was Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) from 1958 to 1970. A theological liberal, linguist, and an authority <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, {{he served as}} one of the four moderators at the Second Vatican Council and was twice considered a serious papal candidate, during the conclaves of 1958 and 1963.|$|E
5|$|Although Timoshenko's forces {{successfully}} regrouped on 21 May, {{he ordered}} a withdrawal of Army Group Kotenko {{by the end of}} 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted to fend off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> flanks and finally forcing them to collapse.|$|E
5|$|Cho was {{dispatched}} by the Soviet {{authorities to}} liberated Korea when the Red Army entered in 1945. By that time, he had substantial experience with Soviet literature and literature administration. The Soviets hoped that Cho would shape the cultural {{institutions of the}} new state based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> model. For the Soviets, the move was successful and Cho did not only that but also significantly developed socialist realism as it would become {{the driving force of}} North Korean literature and arts.|$|E
50|$|From 13 September <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> begun {{their own}} airdrop raids with supplies, and dropped about 55 tons in total. The drops {{continued}} until 28 September. Since <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> airmen did not equip the containers with parachutes, {{the majority of}} recovered packages were damaged.|$|R
50|$|Throughout his career, Ginzburg {{advocated}} nonviolent resistance. He {{believed in}} exposing {{human rights abuses}} by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and pressuring the government to follow its own laws. He {{made an effort to}} smuggle his writings abroad in order to increase external pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b>|$|R

5|$|Gierek government's growing {{difficulties}} led also {{to increased}} dependence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, including tight {{economic cooperation and}} displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The constitution, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after protests by intellectuals and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.|$|E
5|$|In late 1938, another PanzerI {{was sent}} to the Armament Factory of Seville in order to mount a 45mm gun, {{captured}} from a Soviet tank (a T-26 or BT-5). A second was sent sometime later in order to exchange the original armament for a 37-millimeter Maklen anti-tank gun, which had been deployed to Asturias in late 1936 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> ship A. Andreiev. It remains unknown to what extent these trials and adaptations were completed, although it is safe to assume neither adaptation was successful beyond the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{during the}} 1930s, the {{diplomatic}} climate between Finland and the Soviet Union gradually improved. From the 1920s, the Soviet Union had offered different non-aggression pacts with Finland {{but they were}} all rejected. Now the offer was renewed as part of a series of agreements with the countries <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's western border. In 1932, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Finland, re-affirmed in 1934 for ten years.|$|E
25|$|Many {{nationalist}} partisans {{persisted in}} the hope that Cold War hostilities between the West, which never formally recognized <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> occupation, and <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union might escalate to an armed conflict in which Lithuania would be liberated. This never materialized, many of the surviving former partisans remained bitter that the West did not take <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> militarily.|$|R
5000|$|A Soviet-style [...] "constitution" [...] was {{introduced}} illegally, not having {{been subjected to}} referendum {{as required by the}} third Constitution, by a Soviet-backed puppet government on 25 August 1940. It was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1936 <b>Soviet</b> constitution. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> Estonian 1940 constitution was replaced by another constitution in 1978, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1977 <b>Soviet</b> constitution.|$|R
50|$|The {{next day}} the advance resumed, with the {{division}} capturing Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2 in heavy fighting against <b>Soviet</b> Paratroops of <b>the</b> 9th Guards Airborne Division. <b>On</b> 12 July, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> threw <b>the</b> 5th Guards Tank Army into a counterattack near Prokhorovka. Two tank corps faced the LSSAH, hitting the Germans around Oktiabr'skii State Farm and Hill 252.2. In the ensuing fighting, the Germans inflicted heavy casualties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> counterattack had stalled the German advance, and the division was forced to fall back to Oktiabr'skii. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> 5th Guards Tank Army lost 300 tanks destroyed and further 300 damaged on 12 July. Fighting continued the next day, but the focus of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> attack had then shifted to <b>the</b> Totenkopf, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left of the LSSAH.|$|R
5|$|On 23 August 1941, the 9th Army {{began its}} assault <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> {{forces in the}} Velikiye Luki area. Wilcke claimed two aerial {{victories}} while supporting these operations. III. Gruppe began returning to Germany in early October 1941. The air elements left the Soviet Union on 4 October, while the ground units were transported back by train to Mannheim on 13 October. Since 22 June 1941, III. Gruppe had claimed 769 aerial victories {{for the loss of}} 6 pilots killed, 7 missing in action, 2 captured and 12 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Polish October, {{also known}} as October 1956, Polish thaw, or Gomułka's thaw, marked {{a change in the}} {{politics}} of Poland {{in the second half of}} 1956. Some social scientists term it the Polish October Revolution, which, while less dramatic than the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, may have had an even deeper impact on the Eastern Bloc and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's relationship to its satellite states in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{military}} historian Grigoriy Krivosheyev, who {{based his}} figures <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> archives, {{is considered by}} historian David Glantz as the most reliable source for Soviet casualty figures. His figures are supported by historian Karl-Heinz Frieser. Krivosheyev calculated total Soviet losses during the German offensive as 177,877 casualties. The Central Front suffered 15,336 irrecoverable casualties and 18,561 medical casualties, {{for a total of}} 33,897 casualties. The Voronezh Front suffered 27,542 irrecoverable casualties and 46,350 medical casualties, for a total of 73,892. The Steppe Front suffered 27,452 irrecoverable casualties and 42,606 medical casualties, for a total of 70,085.|$|E

50|$|The German {{army group}} {{reported}} inflicting heavy losses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets.</b> However, in <b>the</b> absence of heavy weaponry and a near {{total lack of}} air support, total German casualties in Courland were heavy as well, and estimated to be over 150,000.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{the game}} is always consistent: Inflicting as much damage as {{possible}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> in <b>the</b> Norwegian Sea, thus allowing safe passage to supply convoys coming from America and preventing amphibious forces from conquering Norway and Iceland.|$|R
5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E
5|$|As the German Sixth Army was encircled in Stalingrad, the Red Army {{undertook}} {{a series of}} wider attacks against the rest of Army Group South. These culminated on 2 January 1943 when the Red Army launched Operation Star and Operation Gallop, which between January and early February broke German defenses {{and led to the}} Soviet recapture of Kharkov, Belgorod, Kursk, as well as Voroshilovgrad and Izium. The Soviet victories caused participating Soviet units to over-extend themselves. Freed on 2 February by the surrender of the German Sixth Army the Red Army's Central Front turned its attention west and on 25 February expanded its offensive against both Army Group South and Army Group Center. Months of continuous operations, however, had taken a heavy toll <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> forces and some divisions were reduced to 1,000–2,000 combat effective soldiers. On 19 February, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein launched his Kharkov counterstrike, using the fresh II SS Panzer Corps and two panzer armies.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{flies to}} Imperial Iran (Persia) to investigate. Gorner owns {{factories}} and produces legitimate pharmaceuticals, however MI6 suspects he has other motives. During Bond's investigation he identifies Gorner {{due to a}} deformity of his hand, and establishes Gorner's complicity in a scheme to not only flood Europe with cheap drugs but also to launch a two-pronged terrorist attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, whose retaliation will subsequently devastate the UK. The attack is to be made using a stolen British airliner, earlier hijacked over Iraqi airspace, and an ekranoplan. Bond is assisted in his investigation by Scarlett Papava (whose twin sister Poppy is under Gorner's emotional spell), Darius Alizadeh (the local head of station), JD Silver (an in-situ agent), and Felix Leiter.|$|E
