Downstream of Route 35 are several marinas, although since both the bridge at Route 35 {{and that at}} County Route 6 have a low <b>clearance,</b> <b>vessels</b> with masts must remain downstream of County Route 6.

40|$|Abstract. Guide ways of ultra-precision {{machine tools}} always have {{sufficient}} stiffness and guiding precision. But guide way rails deformation caused by {{oil film pressure}} and slider offset lead to <b>oil</b> film <b>clearance</b> change which affects static stiffness and guiding precision. An inside-slider hydrostatic guide way is designed, and its static characteristics are analyzed. As a result, the effect of slider offset on stiffness and guiding precisions is obtained. A FE model of guide way is established. An elastomer of virtual material properties is used to simulate oil film, so {{that the relationship between}} <b>oil</b> film <b>clearance</b> and pressure can be represented in a certain range. Static stiffness and guiding precision are obtained considering deformation of rails...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the prognostic significance of pathologic factors {{in patients with}} primary locally advanced rectal cancer treated prospectively with preoperative radiotherapy. From 1992 to 1998, 104 patients with rectal cancer of grades T 3 or T 4 and any N underwent preoperative radiotherapy followed by surgical resection. Survival curves were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Cor-relation of outcome with clinicopathologic variables (pathologic tu-mor and lymph node staging, histology, radial resection margin [RRM], <b>clearance,</b> <b>vessel</b> involvement, and tumor regression grade [TRG], quantitated in 5 grades) was evaluated using the Cox propor-tional hazards model. None of the patients achieved a histologically confirmed complete pathologic response, but 79 % of the patients showed partial tumor regression (TRG 2 â€“ 4) and 21 % did not show any tumor regression (TRG 5). Among the tumors, 22 % were of a mucinous type. The RRM was free of tumor in 76 % of the surgica...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the influence of (i) protein type, (ii) protein content, and (iii) viscosity of o/w emulsions on the deposition and <b>clearance</b> of oral <b>oil</b> coatings and after-feel perception. Oil fraction (moil/cm 2 tongue) and after-feel perception differed considerably between emulsions which do not flocculate under in mouth conditions (Na-caseinate) and emulsions which flocculate under in mouth conditions (lysozyme). The irreversible flocculation of lysozyme stabilized emulsions caused slower <b>oil</b> <b>clearance</b> from the tongue surface compared to emulsions stabilized with Na-caseinate. Protein content had a negative relation with oil fraction for lysozyme stabilized emulsions and no relation for Na-caseinate stabilized emulsions immediately after expectoration. Viscosity differences did not affect oil fraction, although the presence of thickener decreased deposition of oil on tongue. We conclude that after-feel perception of o/w emulsions is complex and depends on the deposited oil fraction, the behavior of proteins in mouth, and thickeners...|$|R

5000|$|In 1977, the Maritime Command {{recommended}} structure {{based on}} a fleet consisting of 24 destroyers and frigates, three submarines, three support ships, 36 long range patrol aircraft and 45 maritime helicopters. Despite a realistic fleet structure at the time, the Progressive Conservative minority government led by Joe Clark offered an expensive vision. The Conservative party wanted an expensive fleet structure consisting of 16 destroyers and frigates, 20 submarines, 13 minesweeping vessels, 12 fast attack craft, three escort merchant vessels, 36 long range patrol aircraft, 45 maritime helicopters and 84 shore-based attack aircraft. In 1984, DND requested a revision during the [...] "Capabilities Planning Guide", which included a largely status quo fleet consisting of a 24 destroyers and frigates, four submarines, 12 mine <b>clearance</b> <b>vessels,</b> three support ships, 18 long range patrol aircraft, 18 medium range patrol aircraft and an unspecified number of maritime helicopters.

40|$|The Internet service {{attributes}} desired by shippers were examined {{as well as}} a model that seeks to explain the intention of shippers to use Internet services in liner shipping. Using data collected from a survey of a group of shippers in Taiwan, the relationships among the constructs in the model were tested, namely: Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, security and use intention. The results suggest that shippers perceive tracing {{to be the most important}} service attribute of Internet services, followed by checking for customs <b>clearance,</b> <b>vessel</b> schedules and electronic document services. The findings indicate that perceived ease of use is the major factor affecting the intention of shippers to use Internet services, and that perceived ease of use has a strong positive effect on perceived usefulness. The results also indicate that security has a positive effect on a shipper's perception of ease of use. However, the influence of security on use intention and perceived usefulness was not supported in this study. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings on the intention of shippers to use Internet services in liner shipping are discussed. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

[...] On September 24, 1884, the Governing Committee of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) sent notices to Stock Exchange members who were also New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board members, stating that according to Stock Exchange rules, membership could not be retained in both. At a meeting held on December 10, 1884, the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board amended its constitution. The amendment limited membership to 2,000, with members above an initial 1,700 required to pay a $2,000 initiation fee. In late December 1884, the president of the New-York Petroleum Exchange and Stock Board L. H. Smith issued key facts. Among them, membership was listed at 1,004 at the time, with plans to increase the building fund to potentially build a building to accommodate the exchange.
