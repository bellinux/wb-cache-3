50|$|Engineers in India {{are showing}} renewed {{interest}} in the organic moderated and cooled reactor. Currently, India's reactors are almost exclusively pressurized heavy water reactors similar to Canadian Deuterium-Uranium CANDU reactors. While the CANDU design has the distinct advantage {{of being able to}} be refueled online, it has several drawbacks because of increased system complexity. Due to the significant possibility for cost reduction using a low-pressure design, the Heavy Water Organic Cooled Reactor is again being studied as an alternative. It is believed that an <b>organic</b> <b>coolant</b> purification system can be developed to handle the decomposition of the <b>organic</b> <b>coolant,</b> and research has begun to this effect.|$|E
50|$|Though this {{reactor type}} {{has been the}} subject of {{extensive}} study, no large power plants using <b>organic</b> <b>coolant</b> have been built. Canada operated a 60 MWe heavy water organic cooled reactor from 1965 to 1985. A 45.5 MWe demonstration reactor was operated for a brief period in Piqua, Ohio and was the only power reactor of its kind ever constructed in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The special {{study group}} was {{activated}} by a charter letter from Sub-Section Managers of Pile Technology on June 20, 1956. The principal objectives were: {{to collect the}} information which is presently available for new reactor design and to determine what information should be developed; to make a guess at pile variables; and to point out development programs which must be pursued to achieve a detailed design start in two years. The study was restricted to graphite moderated reactors with H{sub 2 } 0, D{sub 2 } 0, and <b>organic</b> <b>coolants.</b> The program was to determine technical feasibility only and detailed economic considerations {{were not to be}} included. This report presents the conclusions of the group and some of the reasoning behind these conclusions...|$|R
50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>coolant</b> has poor heat {{transfer}} qualities {{with respect to}} light water or liquid metal, also used as a coolant in some reactors. The {{heat transfer}} coefficient can be improved by nucleate boiling (as in boiling water reactors); however, this further increases fouling due to the decomposition of the fluid. Finned cladding on the fuel elements would help improve heat transfer but would also considerably increase {{the cost of the}} fuel.|$|E
50|$|The organic moderated {{and cooled}} reactor (OCR) {{was an early}} power-reactor concept studied in the {{formative}} years of nuclear power by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and others around the world. The concept reactor was very similar to light-water reactors (LWRs) in fuel element and reactor core design, but used hydrocarbon as a coolant and neutron moderator instead of water. The hot <b>organic</b> <b>coolant</b> was pumped through secondary heat exchangers to boil water and generate steam to run a turbogenerator. As in LWRs, the fuel could be slightly enriched uranium dioxide, though other fuel types were considered.|$|E
50|$|The reactor had {{vertical}} fuel channels, was cooled by {{an organic}} liquid (an oil) rather than water. The neutrons were moderated by cool heavy {{water in a}} large calandria vessel surrounding the fuel channels. The reactor did not use conventional control rods, but relied on control {{of the level of}} the heavy water moderator to adjust the power output. The reactor could be shut down quickly (SCRAM) by rapid dumping of the moderator. The organic liquid, called OS-84, that was selected as a coolant in WR-1 is a mixture of terphenyls treated catalytically with hydrogen to produce 40 percent saturated hydrocarbons. The terphenyls are petrochemical derivatives that were readily available and were already in use as heat transfer media. Using an <b>organic</b> <b>coolant</b> meant the reactor was run at low operating pressures, and had very low corrosion rates. The low corrosion rates allowed it to use metallic uranium and uranium carbide fuels, which corrode in water. The metallic fuel conducts heat better, so that a higher power core could be used in the same space.|$|E
5000|$|The ZED-2 is a {{low-power}} (200 W), tank-type (3.36 meter diameter, 3.35 meter high), heavy-water moderated reactor {{capable of}} a peak flux of 109 [...] n/cm².s. Seven special Zirconium-alloy fuel assemblies are used and reactor control is via moderator level adjustment. Liquid (light or heavy water) and gas (CO2) coolants can be used and be heated to 300°C at 8.6 MPa while the heavy water moderator can be heated or cooled independently of the coolant in the Zr assemblies. ZED-2 has also been used for definitive studies {{of the effects of}} heavy water and alternative ordinary (light) water and <b>organic</b> <b>coolants.</b> Sufficient CANFLEX (43-element) bundles are being built containing SEU fuel to provide “full-core” simulation for the Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) project.|$|R
40|$|Machine {{coolants}} {{are used}} in machining equipment including lathes, grinders, saws and drills. The purpose of coolants is to wash away machinery debris {{in the form of}} metal fines, lubricate, and disperse heat between the part and the machine tool. An effective coolant prolongs tool life and protects against part rejection, commonly due to scoring or scorching. Traditionally, coolants have a very short effective life in the machine, often times being disposed of as frequently as once per week. The cause of coolant degradation is primarily due to the effects of bacteria, which thrive in the <b>organic</b> rich <b>coolant</b> environment. Bacteria in this environment reproduce at a logarithmic rate, destroying the coolant desirable aspects and causing potential worker health risks {{associated with the use of}} biocides to control the bacteria. The strategy described in this paper has effectively controlled bacterial activity without the use of biocides, avoided disposal of a hazardous waste, and has extend ed coolant life indefinitely. The Machine Coolant Management Strategy employed a combination of filtration, heavy lubricating oil removal, and aeration, which maintained the coolant peak performance without the use of biocides. In FY 96, the Laboratory generated and disposed of 19, 880 kg of coolants from 9 separate sites at a cost of $ 145 K. The single largest generator was the main machine shop producing an average 14, 000 kg annually. However, in FY 97, the waste generation for the main machine shop dropped to 4, 000 kg after the implementation of the zero waste strategy. It is expected that this value will be further reduced in FY 98...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and contribute to a better understanding of cutting process characteristics using the proposed RBD Palm Olein-based organic mixed coolant. Design/methodology/approach - In this research, refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) Palm Olein is selected as the base oil for <b>organic</b> <b>coolant</b> and mixed coolant (base oil mixed with chemicals) to compare with the cutting performance of industrial water-soluble chemical (inorganic) coolant. Using coated carbide tool, JIS SS 400 Mild Steel was tested in milling process. At fixed spindle speed, the relations between feed rate and depth of cut (DOC) on cutting temperature and surface roughness were investigated. Also, the dynamic viscosity, specific heat capacity and pH level for each coolant are taken into consideration. Findings - As predicted, cutting fluid with lower viscosity removes more heat. The cutting temperature increased with increasing feed rate and DOC. However, surface roughness increased with increasing feed rate but decreased with increasing DOC. From the data gathered, the proposed RBD Palm Olein-based organic mixed coolant showed better heat removal properties than <b>organic</b> <b>coolant</b> and it produced a far better machined surface than inorganic coolant. Originality/value - Overall, the proposed organic mixed coolant has shown great potential to be a good cutting fluid when balance between cooling properties and lubricity, and consistent quality of cutting fluids are sought to produce environmental friendly quality workpiece...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{advanced}} reactor concepts {{have been proposed}} to replace light water reactors ever since their establishment as the dominant technology for nuclear energy production. While most designs seek to improve cost competitiveness and safety, the implausibility of doing so with affordable materials or existing nuclear fuel infrastructure reduces the possibility of near-term deployment, especially in developing countries. The organic nuclear concept, first explored in the 1950 s, offers an attractive alternative to {{advanced reactor}} designs being considered. The advent of high temperature fluids, along with advances in hydrocracking and reforming technologies driven by {{the oil and gas}} industries, make the organic concept even more viable today. We present a simple, cost-effective, and safe small modular nuclear reactor for offshore underwater deployment. The core is moderated by graphite, zirconium hydride, and organic fluid while cooled by the organic fluid. The <b>organic</b> <b>coolant</b> enables operation near atmospheric pressure and use of plain carbon steel for the reactor tank and primary coolant piping system. The core is designed to mitigate the coolant degradation seen in early organic reactors. Overall, the design provides a power density of 40  kW/L, while reducing the reactor hull size by 40 % compared with a pressurized water reactor while significantly reducing capital plant costs...|$|E
