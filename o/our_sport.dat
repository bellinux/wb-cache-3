Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing <b>our</b> <b>sport,</b> I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to <b>our</b> <b>sport</b> and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E

[...] American team alternate Chris Plys said [...] "They didn't make a mockery of the sport, which is nice. Curling catches a lot of abuse." ...|$|E

40|$|The year 2012 {{provided}} an opportunity to celebrate sporting history during the year when London staged that most historical of international sporting events, the Olympic Games. However, the Department for Culture, Media, and Sport, and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) made no reference to sporting history within official documentation, {{and there was no}} mention of sport in the Cultural Olympiad programme. This paper aims to understand the role of the Sports Heritage Network in exploring England's sporting heritage, despite being excluded from the official planning of the London 2012 Olympic Games. This affiliation of museums and archives with an interest in England's sporting past recognised the potential of the 2012 Olympic Games and established a community exhibition programme, <b>Our</b> <b>Sporting</b> Life, which aligned with LOCOG's aims and objectives. This paper evaluates the outputs and outcomes of <b>Our</b> <b>Sporting</b> Life and aims to understand why it was not supported financially or integrated into the official Cultural Olympiad programme. The data collection for <b>Our</b> <b>Sporting</b> Life is analysed and critiqued, and the impact of the programme is considered using the Generic Learning Outcomes and the Generic Social Outcomes frameworks. <b>Our</b> <b>Sporting</b> Life delivered over a hundred exhibitions and reached over one million people, with outcomes that included increasing knowledge and understanding, and strengthening public life. It provides an off-the-shelf methodology for future major sporting events and, as such, its omission from the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad can be regarded a lost opportunity...|$|R

History has shown that professional sports cannot afford to become split. It is absolutely vital that international cricket remains the pinnacle of the sport and that we ensure the best players are playing." ...|$|E

[...] "I think some people perceive surfing as just a lifestyle sport. This will be my sixth year competing professionally on the World Tour, and to be involved in something like this goes to show that we do fine-tune our bodies in order to be as strong as we can when we enter the water. During the offseason, I train three to five days a week, and then I train every day in the water. Depending on the way the swell is -- because <b>our</b> <b>sport</b> is based on Mother Nature -- when the waves are good, I surf probably six hours a day." ...|$|E

[...] Perurena also highlighted the innovative technologies that debuted on the competition and made the broadcast more enjoyable. His view was shared by Italian Canoe Federation president Luciano Buonfiglio, who stated that [...] "for the member countries of the international federation, Szeged has been a very good occasion, in the best way, to showcase <b>our</b> <b>sport</b> on the international stage.

UEFA president Michel Platini said, [...] "Football brings people together. In a continent so proud of its cultural diversity, football offers a common language. It helps to integrate different communities. At its best, <b>our</b> <b>sport</b> conveys some of Europe's basic values: the rule of law, respect for others, freedom of expression, teamwork and solidarity. I feel very proud that UEFA has been able to organise this special match." [...] Meanwhile, Bobby Charlton commented, [...] "The history of Manchester United is tied up with that of Europe.

Lang openly admitted that his team was considering going on strike if the lockout was not resolved. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers responded by saying, [...] "First of all, I've got to do something that the NFL is not going to do: I have to apologize to the fans. <b>Our</b> <b>sport</b> is a multi-billion dollar machine, generated by people who pay good money to come watch us play. The product on the field is not being complemented by an appropriate set of officials. The games are getting out of control." [...] Green Bay head coach Mike McCarthy later stated he had been informed that Jennings had intercepted the pass.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} East Asian, and Asian tennis player ever, Li {{has become one of}} the most well-known and marketable athletes in the world. In 2013, Li appeared on the cover of Time magazine, which named her to its annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World; Li being one of only four athletes to be named on the list. Former world No. 1 Chris Evert writes: [...] "Tennis has exploded in China. The country now has some 15 million tennis players; 116 million watched Li win the French Open. That kind of exposure is crucial to <b>our</b> <b>sport,</b> and it never would have happened without Li. At tournaments, I've seen her charm the crowds. When she smiles, everyone melts. She's just such a breath of fresh air. Her friendly on-court demeanour as well as her hilariously-witty post-match interviews brings a smile to everyone's face." [...] Li also appeared on the cover of 26 May 2014 edition of Time magazine, which featured an article titled [...] "The Passion of Li Na", in which author Hannah Beech described Li as a world class sports idol, inspiring millions of Chinese people to regard her as an icon of pursuing independent character and freedom of thought. In 2012, Forbes listed Li as No. 85 in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. Li, along with the fellow tennis players Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, were the only three female athletes who cracked the Top 100 earning list. Li was ranked No. 5 and No.8 on the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list in 2012 and 2014 respectively. Li is affectionately called [...] "Big Sister Na" [...] (娜姐, pinyin: Nàjiě) among Chinese communities and is considered a [...] "strong, unbending and unyielding" [...] role model. She has not only become a household name across China but a global icon, with her Sina Weibo microblogging having over 23 million followers as of October 2014. Her perceived rebelliousness, exemplified by the rose tattoo on her chest and her previous run-ins with government sports programs, also helped boost her popularity. On 15 April 2015, Li received the Laureus Academy Exceptional Achievement award at the Laureus World Sports Awards held in Shanghai. She was also a nominee for the Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year award, alongside Serena Williams.|$|E
