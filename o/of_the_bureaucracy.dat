5|$|The {{affair with}} Sejanus {{and the final}} years of treason trials {{permanently}} damaged Tiberius' image and reputation. After Sejanus's fall, Tiberius' withdrawal from Rome was complete; the empire continued to run under the inertia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> established by Augustus, rather than through the leadership of the Princeps. Suetonius records that he became paranoid, and {{spent a great deal of}} time brooding over the death of his son. Meanwhile, during this period a short invasion by Parthia, incursions by tribes from Dacia and from across the Rhine by several Germanic tribes occurred.|$|E

2500|$|The Reunification Congress also {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} on [...] "The Sino-Soviet Conflict {{and the situation}} in the USSR and the other workers' states". The resolution noted <b>the</b> declining authority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kremlin both inside the Communist parties and with anti-imperialist movements such as those in Cuba and Algeria. It viewed 'de-Stalinisation' as a defensive liberalisation by <b>the</b> <b>bureaucracy.</b> <b>The</b> Sino-Soviet split was viewed as reflecting [...] "the different needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureaucracies</b> headed by <b>the</b> two leaderships (...).

[...] Pablo's tendency had drawn more optimistic conclusions about <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> de-Stalinisation. It presented a counter-resolution, but only won minority support along with some places on the International Executive Committee: it publicly broke with the International a year later, claiming that Pablo had been ousted.|$|R

25|$|Catherine, {{throughout}} her long reign, took many lovers, often elevating them to high positions {{for as long}} as they held her interest, and then pensioning them off with gifts of serfs and large estates. The percentage of state money spent on the court increased from 10.4% in 1767 to 11.4% in 1781 to 13.5% in 1795. Catherine gave away 66,000 serfs from 1762–72, 202,000 from 1773–93, and 100,000 in one day: 18 August 1795. Just as the church supported her, hoping to get their land back, Catherine bought the support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureaucracy.</b> From 19 April 1764, any bureaucrat holding the same rank for seven years or more was instantly promoted.

25|$|An {{important}} feature of the Bourbon Reforms was that they ended the significant amount of local control that was a characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> under the Habsburgs, especially through the sale of offices. The Bourbons sought {{a return to the}} monarchical ideal of having those not directly connected with local elites as administrators, who in theory should be disinterested, staff the higher echelons of regional government. In practice this meant that there was a concerted effort to appoint mostly peninsulares, usually military men with long records of service (as opposed to the Habsburg preference for prelates), who were willing to move around the global empire. The intendancies were one new office that could be staffed with peninsulares, but throughout the 18th century significant gains were made in the numbers of governors-captain generals, audiencia judges and bishops, in addition to other posts, who were Spanish-born.|$|E

In Bavaria, the Reichswehr toppled the Social Democratic state government and replaced it with the right-wing regime of Gustav Ritter von Kahr. In the rest of the Reich, the commanders of the Wehrkreise did not declare for or against Kapp but were not neutral and most sympathised more or less openly with the putschists. The upper echelons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bureaucracy</b> were still dominated by those who had risen to their positions under the Empire and most were sympathetic to the coup, whilst remaining outwardly neutral and biding their time.
