These distractions may have prevented Louis from supporting Ecgberht. In this view, the withdrawal of Frankish influence would have left East Anglia, Mercia and Wessex to find a balance of power not dependent on outside aid.|$|E

5|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces.

5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>factors</b> contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E
