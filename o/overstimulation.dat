25|$|Infants cry {{as a form}} {{of basic}} instinctive communication. A crying infant may be trying to express a variety of {{feelings}} including hunger, discomfort, <b>overstimulation,</b> boredom, wanting something, or loneliness.|$|E
25|$|Hyperhydrosis, hypotension, burning eyes, {{increased}} appetite, {{changes in}} libido, hallucinations, faintness, nystagmus, vomiting, pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, nightmares, palpitation and paradoxical reactions including restlessness, aggression, violence, <b>overstimulation</b> and agitation have been reported, but are rare (less than 0.5%).|$|E
25|$|Relative {{insensitivity}} to lidocaine is genetic. In hypokalemic sensory <b>overstimulation,</b> relative insensitivity to lidocaine {{has been}} described in people who also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In dental anaesthesia, a relative insensitivity to lidocaine can occur for anatomical reasons due to unexpected positions of nerves. Some people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are insensitive to lidocaine.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{once the}} {{condemned}} person {{was attached to}} the chair, various cycles (differing in voltage and duration) of alternating current would be passed through the individual's body, in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs (including the brain). The first, more powerful, jolt of electric current is intended to pass through the head and cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death. The second, less powerful, jolt is intended to cause fatal damage to the vital organs. Death may also be caused by electrical <b>overstimulation</b> of the heart.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic factors {{refer to}} injury {{mechanisms}} that occur within the rotator cuff itself. The principal is a degenerative-microtrauma model, which supposes that age-related tendon damage compounded by chronic microtrauma results in partial tendon tears that then develop into full rotator cuff tears. As {{a result of}} repetitive microtrauma {{in the setting of}} a degenerative rotator cuff tendon, inflammatory mediators alter the local environment, and oxidative stress induces tenocyte apoptosis causing further rotator cuff tendon degeneration. A neural theory also exists that suggests neural <b>overstimulation</b> leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells and may also contribute to tendon degeneration.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to a psychoactive {{substance}} can cause {{changes in the}} structure and functioning of neurons, as the nervous system tries to re-establish the homeostasis disrupted {{by the presence of}} the drug (see also, neuroplasticity). Exposure to antagonists for a particular neurotransmitter can increase the number of receptors for that neurotransmitter or the receptors themselves may become more responsive to neurotransmitters; this is called sensitization. Conversely, <b>overstimulation</b> of receptors for a particular neurotransmitter may cause a decrease in both number and sensitivity of these receptors, a process called desensitization or tolerance. Sensitization and desensitization are more likely to occur with long-term exposure, although they may occur after only a single exposure. These processes are thought {{to play a role in}} drug dependence and addiction. Physical dependence on antidepressants or anxiolytics may result in worse depression or anxiety, respectively, as withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, because clinical depression (also called major depressive disorder) is often referred to simply as depression, antidepressants are often requested by and prescribed for patients who are depressed, but not clinically depressed.|$|E
500|$|Glutamate is an {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter of {{the nervous}} system, although excessive amounts in the brain can lead to cell death through a process called excitotoxicity which consists of the <b>overstimulation</b> of glutamate receptors. Excitotoxicity occurs not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also in other neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. Memantine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist first used as an anti-influenza agent. It acts on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors and inhibiting their <b>overstimulation</b> by glutamate. Memantine {{has been shown to}} have a small benefit in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Reported adverse events with memantine are infrequent and mild, including hallucinations, confusion, dizziness, headache and fatigue. The combination of memantine and donepezil {{has been shown to be}} [...] "of statistically significant but clinically marginal effectiveness".|$|E
500|$|In the Cedillo case, {{her family}} claimed that Michelle was normal until {{receiving}} her vaccines, {{as evidenced by}} a number of videos of her between the age of 6 and 8 months. They also argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines degraded her immune system, which made it possible for the measles virus to infect her and cause autism and the other health problems from which she suffers, which include inflammatory bowel disease, glaucoma and epilepsy. The evidence presented for this consisted primarily of the detection of measles virus in Michelle Cedillo's GI tract. According to the testimony of Marcel Kinsbourne, a pediatric neurologist and {{professor of psychology at the}} New School, the vaccine strain of measles virus caused autism by [...] "...infect the gut and enter the brain, causing dysfunction of astrocytes and other brain cells, which in turn provokes high levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, causing a state of <b>overstimulation</b> which manifests itself in the symptoms of autism." ...|$|E
500|$|Serotonin is a {{neurotransmitter}} {{involved in}} multiple states including aggression, pain, sleep, appetite, anxiety, depression, migraine, and vomiting. In humans {{the effects of}} excess serotonin were first noted in 1960 in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and tryptophan. The syndrome is caused by increased serotonin in the central nervous system. It was originally suspected that agonism of 5-HT1A receptors in central grey nuclei and the medulla {{was responsible for the}} development of the syndrome. Further study has determined that <b>overstimulation</b> of primarily the 5-HT2A receptors appears to contribute substantially to the condition. The 5-HT1A receptor may still contribute through a pharmacodynamic interaction in which increased synaptic concentrations of a serotonin agonist saturate all receptor subtypes. Additionally, noradrenergic CNS hyperactivity may play a role as CNS norepinephrine concentrations are increased in serotonin syndrome and levels appear to correlate with the clinical outcome. Other neurotransmitters may also play a role; NMDA receptor antagonists and GABA have been suggested as affecting the development of the syndrome. [...] Serotonin toxicity is more pronounced following supra-therapeutic doses and overdoses, and they merge in a continuum with the toxic effects of overdose.|$|E
2500|$|This {{results in}} a major {{decrease}} in axonal sodium channels, which are necessary for action potential propagation. [...] If the stimulation continues, eventually the neuron will stop transmitting action potentials and will die. Neuronal death due to <b>overstimulation</b> is called excitotoxicity.|$|E
2500|$|... mir-126 {{increases}} the immune response to certain antigens resulting in <b>overstimulation</b> {{of the immune}} system and allergic asthma. T Helper 2 Cells are affected by mir-126 through a complicated interaction pathway, an increase in mir-126 results in an increase of the response of T Helper 2 Cells.|$|E
2500|$|Fatigue is {{a normal}} result of working, mental stress, <b>overstimulation</b> and understimulation, jet lag or active recreation, depression, boredom, disease and lack of sleep. It may also have {{chemical}} causes, such as poisoning or mineral or vitamin [...] deficiencies. Chronic blood loss frequently results in fatigue, as do other conditions that cause anemia. Fatigue is different from drowsiness, where a patient feels that sleep is required. Fatigue {{is a normal}} response to physical exertion or stress, but {{can also be a}} sign of a physical disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Gina Sepre of E! Online {{praised the}} {{performance}} saying, [...] "When Adele {{took the stage}} to perform her understatedly stripped-down and hugely impactful performance of 'Someone Like You,' there were no pyrotechnics, no acrobatics, no lavender hair, and no autotune. And guess what? We didn't miss it. There may be hope yet for MTV to remember just what the 'M' in their name actually stands for." [...] Writing about the performance, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound concluded that [...] "Someone like You", [...] "highlighted the power a bare-bones, booming performance can have in netting people's attention. Simple {{is not a bad}} word, pop music." [...] Giving the performance an A+, Lindsey Ward of Jam! said: [...] "When I learned British chart-topper Adele would be performing at Sunday's awards I thought, 'Whew – at least we're guaranteed five solid, meaningful minutes of quality music television'. I was right; her frill-free performance of breakup ballad Someone Like You was just that." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the performance calling it [...] "one of the best performances of the show." [...] Another writer of the same publication gave the performance a grade of A+ and wrote: [...] "It takes a real super power to make the seizure-inducing lasers stop, and that power's name is Adele. The broadcast temporarily abandoned its frantic mission of nonstop <b>overstimulation,</b> bowing to the 23-year-old English soulstress's soaring, nearly a cappella (well done, subtle piano man) rendition of her heart-wrecking ballad [...] "Someone Like You." [...] In a modest black dress and with a few spare hand movements, she delivered all the shock and awe of a million-watt showstopper. Who needs special effects, when God gave you your own? Even Britney Spears looked like she had to fix her mascara when it was all over." ...|$|E
60|$|It was one {{of those}} {{dramatic}} moments for which my friend existed. It would be an overstatement {{to say that he was}} shocked or even excited by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long <b>overstimulation.</b> Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution.|$|E
50|$|T. Berry Brazelton has {{suggested}} that <b>overstimulation</b> may be a contributing factor to infant crying and that periods of active crying might serve the purpose of discharging <b>overstimulation</b> and helping the baby’s nervous system regain homeostasis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overstimulation</b> {{from drugs}} such as caffeine, {{digitalis}} and catecholamines.|$|E
50|$|Sensory {{overload}} {{can result}} from the <b>overstimulation</b> {{of any of the}} senses.|$|E
50|$|The {{health effects}} {{associated}} with organophosphate poisoning {{are a result}} of excess acetylcholine (ACh) present at different nerves and receptors in the body because acetylcholinesterase is blocked. Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes <b>overstimulation</b> of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes <b>overstimulation</b> of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system.|$|E
50|$|In {{people with}} hypokalemic sensory <b>overstimulation,</b> {{lidocaine}} {{is not very}} effective, but articaine works well.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, βARK is a {{negative}} feedback enzyme that will prevent <b>overstimulation</b> of the β-adrenergic receptor.|$|E
5000|$|Movement: motion {{sickness}} (which {{is caused by}} <b>overstimulation</b> of the labyrinthine canals of the ear) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Overstimulation</b> of nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors in {{the central}} nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic <b>overstimulation</b> due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.|$|E
50|$|Interacting {{with nature}} {{can have a}} {{restorative}} effect on attention/focus levels, through providing the brain a break from <b>overstimulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Researchers have {{described}} a treatable inherited sensory <b>overstimulation</b> disorder that meets diagnostic criteria for both {{attention deficit disorder}} and sensory integration dysfunction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{symptoms}} {{mentioned above}} are the external {{signs of the}} physiological response to cochlear <b>overstimulation.</b> Here are some elements of this response: ...|$|E
50|$|Kv channel {{blocking}} dendrotoxins, {{and thus}} possibly also kalicludines, {{often lead to}} <b>overstimulation</b> of the cholinergic system, and subsequently to neuromuscular block and cardiovascular depression.|$|E
50|$|Individuals with {{neurological}} {{conditions like}} autism or intellectual disability may {{be prone to}} <b>overstimulation</b> and suffer sensory overload at levels of stimulus that others find unexceptional.|$|E
50|$|Hyperammonemia {{is one of}} the {{metabolic}} derangements that contribute to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause swelling of astrocytes and stimulation of NMDA-receptors in the brain. <b>Overstimulation</b> of NMDA-receptors induces excitotoxicity.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that long-term <b>overstimulation</b> can result eventually in a phenomenon called [...] "adrenal exhaustion" [...] over time, {{but this is}} neither medically accepted nor proven at this time.|$|E
5000|$|Central {{nervous system}} effects like <b>overstimulation,</b> restlessness, nervousness, insomnia, tremor, {{dizziness}} and headache; there are rare reports of euphoria followed by fatigue and depression, and very rarely, psychotic episodes and hallucinations.|$|E
50|$|Binasal {{occlusion}} is used {{in treatment}} of patients with sensory deficits due to complications of traumatic brain injury or having had a stroke, as well as patients with diplopia, esotropia, convergence excess, divergence insufficiency, or visual <b>overstimulation.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{behavioral}} {{symptoms are}} similar to those of an amphetamine, cocaine or caffeine overdose. <b>Overstimulation</b> of the central nervous system results in a state of hyperkinetic movement and unpredictable mental status including mania, rage and suicidal behavior.|$|E
50|$|Central {{nervous system}} {{disorders}} {{can lead to}} increased sympathetic tone and/or catecholamine release, which lead to cardiac <b>overstimulation.</b> This is seen in subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and (generalized) seizures (in patients with epilepsy or eclampsia, for example).|$|E
50|$|A {{prolonged}} dark {{adaptation of}} three hours or more, leads to disappearance of this unusual discoloration {{and the appearance}} of a normal reddish appearance. This is known as the Mizuo-Nakamura phenomena and is thought to be caused by the <b>overstimulation</b> of rod cells.|$|E
