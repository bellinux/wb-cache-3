For what can we conceive of that first Eden which we might not yet win back, if we chose? It was a place full of flowers, we say. Well: the flowers are always striving to grow wherever we suffer them; and the fairer, the closer. There may, indeed, have been a Fall of Flowers, as a Fall of Man; but assuredly creatures such as we are can now fancy nothing lovelier than roses and lilies, which would grow for us side by side, leaf <b>overlapping</b> <b>leaf,</b> till the Earth was white and red with them, if we cared to have it so. And Paradise was full of pleasant shades and fruitful avenues. Well: what hinders us from covering {{as much of the}} world as we like with pleasant shade, and pure blossom, and goodly fruit? Who forbids its valleys to be covered over with corn till they laugh and sing? Who prevents its dark forests, ghostly and uninhabitable, from being changed into infinite orchards, wreathing the hills with frail-floreted snow, far away to the half-lighted horizon of April, and flushing the face of all the autumnal earth with glow of clustered food? But Paradise was a place of peace, we say, and all the animals were gentle servants to us. Well: the world would yet be a place of peace if we were all peacemakers, and gentle service should we have of its creatures if we gave them gentle mastery. But so long as we make sport of slaying bird and beast, so long as we choose to contend rather with our fellows than with our faults, and make battlefield of our meadows instead of pasture--so long, truly, the Flaming Sword will still turn every way, and the gates of Eden remain barred close enough, till we have sheathed the sharper flame of our own passions, and broken down the closer gates of our own hearts.|$|E

Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB) is responsible for the monitoring the quality of rubber to maintain a successful rubber clone breeding program. One of the important factors that affect the quality of raw rubber is the clonal origin of the rubber tree. Currently, clone inspectors classify the rubber tree clones manually using leaf features. There are several features such as leaf tip, leaf base to identify the type of clone. An automated clone classification process is needed to facilitate the inspection process. This research focuses on extracting one of the features for identifying clones which are <b>overlapping</b> <b>leaf</b> features. The challenge of <b>overlapping</b> <b>leaf</b> identification is the similarity of the intensity levels. However, it can be classified using shape and angle of leaves. Therefore, a new feature extraction framework is required to extract shape and angle features.

The proposed method able to detect edge, ridge, and blob features and identify angle between petioles of overlapping leaves. This study identified that angle degrees of the overlapping leaves are in the range between 30 ° and 55 ° while angle degrees of non-overlapping leaves are in the range between 55 ° and 90 °. In order to validate the result, the identification method has been tested with fifty rubber leaf images that comprise of both overlapping and non-overlapping features images.

50|$|Two major {{advantages}} of cloverleaves {{are that they}} require only one bridge (between the main perpendicular routes) which makes such junctions inexpensive as long as land is plentiful, and that they often do not require any traffic signals to operate.

This prototype exploits the potential of smart materials to significantly improve the performance of existing aircraft engines by introducing new inherent capabilities for shape control, vibration damping, noise reduction, health monitoring, and flow manipulation. The novel design employs two different smart materials, a shape-memory alloy and magnetorheological fluids, to reduce the nozzle area by up to 30 percent. The prototype of the variable-area fan nozzle implements an <b>overlapping</b> spring <b>leaf</b> assembly to simplify the initial design and to provide ease of structural control. A single bundle of shape memory alloy wire actuators is used to reduce the nozzle geometry. The nozzle is subsequently held in the reduced-area configuration by using magnetorheological fluid brakes. This prototype uses the inherent advantages of shape memory alloys in providing large induced strains and of magnetorheological fluids in generating large resistive forces. In addition, the spring leaf design also functions as a return spring, once the magnetorheological fluid brakes are released, to help force the shape memory alloy wires to return to their original position. A computerized real-time control system uses the derivative-gain and proportional-gain algorithms to operate the system. This design represents a novel approach to the active control of high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines.

40|$|Most supertree {{algorithms}} combine {{collections of}} rooted phylogenetic trees with <b>overlapping</b> <b>leaf</b> sets {{into a single}} rooted phylogenetic tree (for example, see [1, 4, 6, 7]). Implicit {{in all of these}} algorithms is that the leaves of all the input trees represent species of the same taxonomic rank.

The result of such an amalgamation may mean that, in addition to all of the leafs being labelled, some of the interior vertices are also labelled. In this chapter, we describe a supertree algorithm for 'rooted semi-labelled trees'. A rooted semi-labelled tree is more general than a rooted phylogenetic tree in that not only are its leaves labelled, but some of its interior vertices may also be labelled. For our purposes, an interior vertex label corresponds to a taxa at a higher rank than any of its descendants.

40|$|Abstract: There {{are many}} ways to combine rooted phylogenetic trees with <b>overlapping</b> <b>leaf</b> sets into a single “supertree”. The most widely used method is MRP (matrix {{representation}} with parsimony analysis), but other direct methods have been developed recently. However, all these methods utilize typically only the discrete topology of the input trees and ignore other information that might be available. Based, for example, on fossil data or molecular dating techniques, this information includes whether one particular divergence event occurred earlier or later than another, and actual time estimates for divergence events. The ability to include such information in supertree construction could allow for more accurate dating of certain species divergences. This is a topical problem in recent biological literature. In this chapter, we describe a way to incorporate divergence time information in a fast and exact supertree algorithm that extends the classic BUILD algorithm. The approach is somewhat flexible in that it allows any combination of relative and/or absolute divergence times. In addition to this extension, the last section of this chapter consists of applications of BUILD to problems in phylogenetics that are, in general, computationally challenging...|$|E

In PAE, by taking the complex <b>leaf</b> <b>overlap</b> problem into consideration, the area of every plant is measured from top-view images in four steps. Given the abundant measurements obtained with PAE, in the second module GMA, a nonlinear growth model is applied to generate growth curves, followed by functional data analysis. Results: Experimental results on model plant Arabidopsis thaliana show that, compared to an existing approach, HPGA reduces the error rate of measuring plant area by half. The application of HPGA on the cfq mutant plants under fluctuating light reveals the correlation between low photosynthetic rates and small plant area (compared to wild type), which raises a hypothesis that knocking out cfq changes {{the sensitivity of the}} energy distribution under fluctuating light conditions to repress leaf growth. Availability: HPGA is available a...|$|R
40|$|Disease causing fungi {{are a major}} {{potential}} threat to yield in both organic and conventional cereal production, and generally several different species of pathogenic fungi are found together on the same plants in the field. This PhD thesis concludes that interaction between different fungal species may influence total disease levels and often via negative effects, such that less disease is observed where several diseases occur together relative where they are found individually. 	Such potential interaction effects have often been ignored in the past, as plant diseases have traditionally been studied as single independent events. The thesis provides an important review of available literature on the subject; which considers the theoretical background for analysing foliar disease interactions as well as previously published data on disease interactions. Difficulties in distinguishing different types of interaction, mainly different types of competition are emphasized. In a specific study, the thesis considers the barley diseases scald (caused by Rhynchosporium secalis) and net blotch (caused by Drechslera teres). 	Aiming to understand how diseases interact in the field, it is further concluded that increased focus {{should be placed on}} considering the dynamics of the plant growth along with the epidemiological development. This is pointed out by observations of antagonism between scald and net blotch on individual leaves and further via a simulation model. The model shows that differences in pathogen dispersal rates between vertical leaf layers of the plant and the <b>overlap</b> of <b>leaf</b> layers over time are important for competitive outcome from two fungal competitors. 	Detailed disease observations on individual leaves provide insight into understanding interplay between disease severity and plant senescence. This level of detail does not, though, give a better description of yield loss from disease, relative to the generally used plot assessment, where disease severities are determined as averages over the crop. 	 	The work presented in the PhD thesis is relevant for all who work with foliar pathogens. Optimal disease control and plant breeding is based on knowledge of factors determining epidemic development and hence interactions between simultaneously developing pathogens must be considered...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{growth is}} a dynamic process, and the precise course of events during early plant {{development}} is of major interest for plant research. In this work, we investigate the growth of rosette plants by processing time-lapse videos of growing plants, where we use Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) as a model plant. In each frame of the video sequences, potential leaves are detected using a leaf-shape model. These detections are prone to errors due to the complex shape of plants and their changing appearance in the image, depending on leaf movement, leaf growth, and illumination conditions. To cope with this problem, we employ a novel graph-based tracking algorithm which can bridge gaps in the sequence by linking leaf detections {{across a range of}} neighboring frames. We use the <b>overlap</b> of fitted <b>leaf</b> models as a pairwise similarity measure, and forbid graph edges that would link leaf detections within a single frame. We tested the method on a set of tobacco-plant growth sequences, and could track the first leaves of the plant, including partially or temporarily occluded ones, along complete sequences, demonstrating the applicability of the method to automatic plant growth analysis. All seedlings displayed approximately the same growth behavior, and a characteristic growth signature was found. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
