500|$|When Newton {{received}} his MA {{and became a}} Fellow of the [...] "College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity" [...] in 1667, he made the commitment that [...] "I will either set Theology {{as the object of}} my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [...] arrives, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> resign from the college." [...] Up till this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the thirty-nine articles, the basis of Church of England doctrine.|$|E
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} years of peace, the old army commander remained a tireless instructor of his now legendary Hussar regiment. In his {{last years of}} life, Zieten alternated between Berlin, where he {{bought a house in}} 1763 on Kochstrasse No. 6162. and on his property at Wustrau, where he devoted himself mainly to charity. At the same time, he worked with great care to improve his property. He enjoyed the special trust of Frederick, who frequently visited [...] "his old father Zieten." [...] In one visit with the King, at Sanssouci, after a long conversation, the King ordered a chair to be placed on which he invited the 85-year-old man to sit. Despite his infirmities, Zieten refused to sit {{in the presence of the}} monarch; the King said: [...] "Sit down, Zieten, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> go away." ...|$|E

500|$|The men of {{the three}} regiments {{nevertheless}} faced daunting fire as they charged toward the cut. The 6th Wisconsin's American flag went down {{at least three times}} during the charge. At one point Dawes took up the fallen flag before it was seized from him by a corporal of the color guard. As the Union line neared the Confederates, its flanks became folded back and it took on the appearance of an inverted V. When the Union men reached the railroad cut, vicious hand-to-hand and bayonet fighting broke out. They were able to pour enfilading fire from both ends of the cut, and many Confederates considered surrender. Colonel Dawes took the initiative by shouting [...] "Where is the colonel of this regiment?" [...] Major John Blair of the 2nd Mississippi stood up and responded, [...] "Who are you?" [...] Dawes replied, [...] "I command this regiment. Surrender <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> fire." [...] Dawes later described what happened next: ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson was {{not happy}} at James Selby's, and after about five years, both {{he and his brother}} ran away. Selby responded by placing a reward for their return: [...] "Ten Dollars Reward. Ran away from the subscriber, two {{apprentice}} boys, legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson... to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> give the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone." [...] The brothers went to Carthage, North Carolina, where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months. Fearing he would be arrested and returned to Raleigh, Johnson moved to Laurens, South Carolina. He found work quickly, met his first love, Mary Wood, and made her a quilt as a gift. However, she rejected his marriage proposal. [...] He returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but could not come to terms with Selby. Unable to stay in Raleigh, where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby, he decided to move west.|$|E

2500|$|However, among Jews who are {{inclined}} toward spiritualism {{it is common}} to refer to trance mediumship as [...] "prophecy," [...] a [...] "vision," [...] or a [...] "dream," [...] and to cite as a counter-text the verse from Numbers 12:6 in which God says, [...] "Hear my words: If there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a vision, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> speak to him in a dream." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following his conversion, Miller's Deist friends soon {{challenged}} him {{to justify his}} newfound faith. He did so by examining the Bible closely, declaring to one friend [...] "If he would give me time, I would harmonize all these apparent contradictions to my own satisfaction, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> be a Deist still." [...] Miller commenced with Genesis 1:1, studying each verse and not moving on until he felt the meaning was clear. In this way he became convinced firstly, that postmillennialism was unbiblical; and secondly, that the time of Christ's Second Coming was revealed in Bible prophecy.|$|E
2500|$|As a young {{lieutenant}} colonel, he {{was made}} {{the commander of the}} Airborne Brigade in 1954 and was based in Saigon. Towards the end of the May 1955 Battle for Saigon, in which Prime Minister Diệm asserted his rule over the State of Vietnam by defeating the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate, some of Diệm's supporters tried to move against some generals whom they accused of questionable loyalty. When he heard that three top generals, including Nguyễn Văn Vy, were being detained in the palace by one of the factions backing Prime Minister Diệm, Trí telephoned and threatened them: [...] "Free the generals in one half-hour <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> destroy the palace and everything inside it." ...|$|E

Parker admired her intellect but found the {{intimidation}} of her rhetoric, [...] "go my way <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> ruin you," [...] unmanageable. Carlos Montezuma described {{her as a}} [...] "cyclone", moving from one issue to another, wanting to do everything [...] "without considering the consequences." [...] However, Rev. Sherman Coolidge remembered her differently. Recalling {{the first time he}} heard her speak, Coolidge said, [...] "tears came to his eyes to realize that we had a woman of brilliance among us and to think of the great good she could do for the Indian people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swanson was chagrined at {{the notion}} of {{submitting}} to a screen test, saying she had [...] "made twenty films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?" [...] Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, [...] "Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount." [...] In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, [...] "If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> personally shoot you." [...] His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000. In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, [...] "There was a lot of Norma in her, you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 04:21 on 9 April, Eriksen {{gave the}} Main Battery guns {{the order to}} fire at the lead ship of the unknown {{flotilla}} forcing its way towards Oslo. Upon giving the command, Eriksen was questioned. He responded with his now famous response; [...] "Either I will be decorated <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> be court martialled, Fire!" [...] Two rounds from the [...] Krupp guns Moses and Aron engaged the German cruiser [...] at [...] range. The two Norwegian guns had been loaded with live, [...] high-explosive shells; firing them [...] "in anger" [...] {{was a violation of}} the pre-war Norwegian rules of engagement which dictated warning shots be fired first, as had been the case at Oslofjord Fortress further down the fjord. Colonel Eriksen later explained his decision by alluding {{to the fact that the}} German naval force already had forced their way past the Oslofjord Fortress' forts and had received both warning shots and live rounds from these more outlying coastal fortifications. As the vessels had continued up the fjord toward the capital, Eriksen was of the opinion that he had the right to consider them enemy warships and to engage them as such.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Hungerford {{made the}} right choice in {{breaking}} professional ties with George W. Patterson Jr., who took over as the President of the Geo. Washington Bank. On November 2, 1868, Patterson left work, placing his eighteen-year-old teller, George Eaton, in charge of the bank. Some time after three o'clock, a man came in and announced that he was a government detective there to arrest Eaton and Patterson for counterfeiting money. Eaton managed to lock the vault before being handcuffed. The so-called detective placed a revolver to Eaton's head and said to him: [...] "Young man, you may as well know my business at once. I want the money of this bank <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> blow your brains out." [...] Eaton told him to go ahead and a struggle ensued. The two compromised and Eaton, who was still in handcuffs, allowed the man to escape in exchange for his life. Eaton ran around Corning until he eventually found Patterson. By then, of course, the would-be robber escaped. Patterson offered a $100 reward for the assailant's arrest. Patterson was fortunate that he did not find his bank vault empty upon his return.|$|E
2500|$|Police also {{discovered}} several documents on Talcott's body.

[...] The note read, [...] "Friday, P.M. -- I will give you until tomorrow morning before you leave the house to withdraw from this case <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> introduce [...] damaging evidence of six years ago." [...] Talcott's brother-in-law, George E. Repp, told police that he believed the note was Talcott's effort to record a threat made by Mrs. Talcott. [...] Repp described an angry encounter at the Talcott residence:"Talcott, in writing the threat, was but quoting the words of his own wife.
