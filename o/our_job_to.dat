The Uniformed Firefighters Association initially supported it, but withdrew when the connection to the Church of Scientology was revealed. Firefighter Union President Patrick Bahnken said his members' lives had benefited from the program, {{and that it had}} involved no religious rhetoric. Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon of the FDNY told The New York Times, [...] "while we are aware some members of the department have availed themselves of the program, we in no way endorse it." [...] Officials at the department raised concerns that firefighters were giving up existing medications in order to take part. The department's deputy chief medical officer Dr. David Prezant said, [...] "It's not <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> say you can't go.

On 1 October, Portugal's UN Ambassador José Filipe Moraes Cabral echoed the statement of Angola at the same meeting.|$|E

She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?

500|$|By 2009, {{approximately}} 40 {{women were}} on the chapter's active evangelism team, and they had given pink Bibles {{to most of the}} strippers in San Diego County. They paired these Bibles with other gifts including lip gloss, necklaces, and lotions in order to pique the strippers' interest. In August 2010, Brown went to Warsaw, Ohio, to briefly join forces with Anny Donewald, a former stripper and founder of Eve's Angels, an organization similar to JC's Girls. Together, Brown and Donewald negotiated a peace accord between women working at a strip club and members of a local church who had been picketing the club for four years. The strippers had been counter-protesting by dancing in bikinis in front of the church during Sunday services while Tommy George, the club's owner, played music from his car. Brown and Donewald spoke at the church, urging them to stop protesting at the strip club and saying, [...] "It's not <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> tell these women that it's time to get out of there...Just love them. Let the Holy Spirit draw them out." [...] Brown and Donewald also visited the strip club and spoke with the strippers, two of whom became Christians while continuing to work at the club. The peace accord received much publicity, but the church's members, led by their pastor Bill Dunfee, resumed picketing once Brown had returned to San Diego. George and his club's strippers returned to their counter-protesting.|$|E

After a campaign which cost over $11,000 and was managed by Grover Norquist, Abramoff won the election. His chief competitor, Amy Moritz was persuaded to drop out.

During his recent period of command in the Northern Territory, Herring had relieved both his brigadiers, replacing them with younger and better educated officers, {{one of whom was}} Dougherty, an officer in whom he had great confidence. Herring believed that his decision to replace Potts with Dougherty, who would command the 21st Brigade {{for the rest of the}} war, was the right one.

2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks.

2500|$|On August 8, 2013, Lavabit, a Texas-based secure email service {{provider}} reportedly used by Snowden, abruptly {{announced it was}} shutting down operations after nearly 10 years of business. The owner, Ladar Levison, posted a statement online saying he would rather {{go out of business}} than [...] "become complicit in crimes against the American people." [...] He also said that he was barred by law from disclosing what he had experienced over the preceding 6 weeks, and that he was appealing the case in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Multiple sources speculated that the timing of the statement suggested that Lavabit had been targeted by the US government in its pursuit of information about Snowden. The following day, a similar email service, Silent Circle, preemptively shut down in order to [...] "prevent spying". Snowden said about the Lavabit closure, [...] "Ladar Levison and his team suspended the operations of their 10-year-old business rather than violate the Constitutional rights of their roughly 400,000 users. The President, Congress, and the Courts have forgotten that the costs of bad policy are always borne by ordinary citizens, and it is <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> remind them that there are limits to what we will pay."

2500|$|A {{total of}} {{thirteen}} supervising animators from Walt Disney Animation Studios and Disney-MGM Studios {{were responsible for}} establishing the personalities and setting {{the tone for the}} first film's main characters. The animation team studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the earlier film Bambi. The animation of the characters counted with supervision by wildlife experts such as Jim Fowler, who visited the studio on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other jungle inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel. He taught them how lions greet one another by gently butting heads, and show affection by placing one's head under the other's chin, mannerisms that can be appreciated in Simba and Nala's encounter during the song [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight". Fowler also talked about how they protect themselves by lying on their backs and using their claws to ward off attackers, and how they fight rivals by rising on their hind legs. Screenwriter Irene Mecchi joined the directing team to help in the character development process as well as to define each character's personality. Story head Brenda Chapman, gave insight to the challenge of the characters and the story by stating [...] "It was <b>our</b> <b>job</b> <b>to</b> make the main character likeable and sympathetic. It was also challenging to make the environment and characters interesting. In real life, lions basically sleep, eat and have no props." ...|$|E
