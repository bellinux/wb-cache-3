Two displays in Bratislava are {{next to one}} another at Esterházy Palace (Esterházyho palác,Eszterházy palota) and the Water Barracks (Vodné kasárne,Vizikaszárnya) on the Danube riverfront in the Old Town. The Bratislava City Gallery, founded in 1961, is the second-largest Slovak gallery of its kind. The gallery offers permanent displays at Pálffy Palace (Pálffyho palác,Pálffy palota) and Mirbach Palace (Mirbachov palác,Mirbach palota), in the Old Town.

5|$|Valérie is repulsed by her ugly {{husband and}} has gone five years without kissing him. She {{explains}} bluntly that her {{position as a}} married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Valérie jockeys for position between Hulot and Montés (while also sleeping with Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers' devotion, and this wickedness– not to mention her gruesome demise– has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of Balzac's morality tale.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{argument}} against the poison theory {{is the fact that}} twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander. In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance. Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> plausible cause. Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{the players and the}} nature of the rules are common {{subjects}} of debate with every edition. It continued to cause confusion until 2013 when it was clarified that the CLT20 rules state the players are free to choose their team. However, for a player named in an IPL team's squad, he would have to forego 20% of his salary to choose another team. The IPL <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> lucrative salaries and is the only tournament to have a clause relating to the CLT20 in its contracts. As a result, players are unlikely to choose against their IPL teams. For non-IPL teams wanting to keep their players, not only would they be forfeiting the compensation fee, some have felt the need to offer their players compensation in an attempt to sway their decision.|$|E
500|$|The Fire Emblem {{series has}} been {{described}} by its developers as an [...] "RPG simulation", combining tactical simulation gameplay with the plot and character development of a role-playing game, creating a sense of connection with characters in the field not present in previous tactical games. Battles in the Fire Emblem series play out on a grid-based map, with the player controlling a set number of characters across maps tied to both the game's story and optional side stories. Each character has a specific character class, giving them set abilities and affecting how far they can move across the field. Some character classes have innate skills unique to them, and each character has its own class and stats. Depending on the series entry, a character's class can be changed or upgraded with or without special items. During battle, each character gains experience points by performing actions, such as attacking an enemy, healing an ally, and slaying a foe (which typically <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> experience points). When a certain level is reached, the character levels up, and new skill points are awarded randomly to a character's attributes, be they the character's maximum health, agility or strength. The more a character is used in battle, the more experience that character gains.|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, Cooper hosted Saturday Night Live {{with musical}} guest TV on the Radio, portraying actor Christian Bale in one skit. Later that year, he {{appeared}} in a supporting role in the film He's Just Not That Into You. Cooper's breakthrough role came in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, {{one of the three}} friends—alongside Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis—to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with no memory of the previous night and the bachelor missing. The Hangover was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing R-rated films in the United States. The New York Times A. O. Scott wrote: [...] "Mr. Cooper... <b>offers</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." [...] For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th Hollywood Film Festival and his first nomination for MTV Movie Awards—Best Comedic Performance. The newspaper The Daily Telegraph opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into [...] "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with Shave: [...] "It's the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it's not like I sit back with a cigar on Monday morning and go through the scripts that have been offered." ...|$|E
