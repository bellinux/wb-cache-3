40|$|The ceramic {{welding process}} is a unique hot repair {{technique}} for refractory linings in industrial equipments. This process consists of projecting a weld mix in powder {{by means of a}} current of oxygen or oxygen/air onto the refractory surface to be restored. The weld mix content refractory particles chemically compatible with the refractory to be repaired and a solid combustible (oxidizable fine particles, metallic and/or non metallic) as exotermic agent. When the combustible particles ignites at contact with the hot face (1000 - 1500 °C), an exotermic reaction with oxygen occurs developing temperatures of the order of 2000 - 2500 °C. The heat generated from this reaction is enough to melt the surface to be repaired and allowing a very close bond to be formed between the repaired area and the deposited material. There are limited data in literature about ceramic welding and the larger part of the information is protected by patents. Several differences between the available patents were detected. In this work, the principal aspects of researches about ceramic welding that had been relieved are present, including results and conclusions from a study accomplished about ceramic welding (design and set up of a test in laboratory, and evaluation of the reparations) for the reparation of silica bricks employed to build coke ovens. El proceso de soldadura cerámica es un atractivo método para la reparación en caliente de revestimientos refractarios de equipamientos industriales. Consiste en la proyección a alta temperatura de una mezcla de soldadura en polvo mediante una corriente rica en oxígeno sobre el material refractario dañado. La mezcla contiene agregados refractarios gruesos compatibles con el sustrato a reparar y un combustible sólido (finas partículas <b>oxidables,</b> metálicas y/o no metálicas) que actúa como agente exotérmico en el proceso. Cuando las partículas combustibles impactan en la superficie caliente del sustrato (1000 - 1500 °C), reaccionan con el oxígeno liberando calor y alcanzando localmente temperaturas de 2000 - 2500 ºC. Estas temperaturas producen la fusión parcial tanto del sustrato como de la carga de soldadura formándose una unión cerámica entre ambos. Existe muy escasa bibliografía sobre el tema y la mayor parte de la información está protegida por patentes, existiendo ciertas discrepancias entre las disponibles. En este trabajo se presentan los principales aspectos de las investigaciones sobre el tema que han sido relevadas, incluyendo resultados y conclusiones de un estudio desarrollado sobre soldadura cerámica a escala laboratorio para la reparación de ladrillos de sílice de uso siderúrgico...|$|R

The goal was to propose methodology for using the soil magnetic parameters for accessing soil properties and their spatial distribution within agricultural areas affected by water erosion. Methodology includes: choice of sampling design for target area (optimized based on other auxiliary data) and soil sampling (topsoil), soil sample processing (drying, grinding, sieving, etc.), method of magnetic susceptibility measurements (using Bartington MS 2 and Kappametr SM 400) and procedure to calibrate models of predicting soil properties from soil magnetic properties. Prediction of the <b>oxidable</b> organic carbon from the mass specific magnetic susceptibility determined in the laboratory is shown here {{as an example of}} practical application of this methodology for soil properties assessment in certain soil types.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{localization}} of hyaluronic acid (HA) {{and the distribution of}} glycoproteins in the gastrointestinal system of adult Hyla orientalis. Histochemical analysis of the gastrointestinal system in H. orientalis showed that mucous content included glycogene and/or <b>oxidable</b> dioles [periodic acid/Schiff (PAS) +], neutral or acid-rich (PAS/AB pH 2. 5 +), sialic acid residues (KOH/PAS+) and acid sulphate [Aldehyde fuchsin (AF) +] glycoproteins. However the mucus content was not the same in stomach, small and large intestine. The mucus content of stomach included only glycogene and/or <b>oxidable</b> dioles and sialic acid residues. Besides these histochemical methods, the localization of HA was detected using biotinylated hyaluronic acid binding protein labeled with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). In the extracellular matrix of the submucosa, the reaction for HA was evident. Since HA was located in submucosa beneath the epithelial layer of gastrointestinal system, it has a significant role in hydric balance, and essential to provide the gastrointestinal system integrity and functionality. According to biometric results, there were statistical differences between small and large intestine in terms of the amount of material stained positive with PAS/AB, PAS, KOH/PAS and AF/AB.

40|$|A {{biogeochemical}} {{study was}} carried out to assess the influence of vehicular traffic on heavy element contamination in soil and accumulation in earthworms in the urban area of Siena (Italy). Total contents of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, U e Zn and their distribution in extractable, reducible, <b>oxidable</b> and residual fractions were determined in soil samples collected in urban, peri-urban, green-urban and non-urban sites of Siena municipality. Heavy element concentrations were also measured in Nicodrilus caliginosus (Savigny) earthworm specimens collected in the soil sampling sites. The aim of study was: i) to assess the influence of vehicular traffic on heavy element distribution in soil; ii) to define the heavy element mobility in soil and potential bioavailability in relation to contamination level; iii) to establish {{the relationship between the}} heavy element content and fractionation in soil and their uptake by earthworms. Analytical data indicated that vehicular traffic affected the distribution of Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn in soil, with the highest total contents in urban and peri-urban soils. Based on the enrichment factor, Pb and Sb were the main soil contaminants. The heavy element fractionation in soil highlighted that Cd was the most mobile element being largely in the extractable (bioavailable) fraction. Pb was mainly associated with the reducible and residual fractions, and Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Sb, U e Zn with the residual fraction. Contamination due to vehicular circulation caused variation in the distribution of the traffic-related heavy elements in soil fractions. Anthropogenic Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn were accumulated in the extractable, reducible and <b>oxidable</b> soil fractions with difference in partitioning related to the affinity of the element for organic complexation and non-specific and specific adsorption. Concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn in earthworms showed a distribution pattern similar to that in soil, suggesting that soil contamination affected the accumulation of the traffic-related heavy elements in earthworms. The fractionation of these heavy elements in soil ruled their uptake by earthworms. The absorption of Cd, Pb, Sb and Zn by earthworms mostly depended on the extractable fraction, whereas the <b>oxidable</b> soil fraction influenced Cu uptake...|$|E

The reaction {{was started by}} the photolysis of 2, 2 '-azobis (2 -amidino propane) {{in order to minimize}} the dependence of the initiation rate with temperature. Both positive and negative activation energies were obtained for the rate of the oxidation, depending on the amount of <b>oxidable</b> lipid (20 % or 50 % mol:mol) and the temperature range considered. Changes in the rigidity of the liposomes elicited by temperature were assessed by measuring the generalized polarization of 6 -dodecanoyl- 2 (dimethylamino naphthalene), Laurdan.

30|$|Unsaturated {{aliphatic}} hydrocarbons (alkenes) {{can be found}} in nature as gaseous and volatile compounds. Examples are the plant hormone ethene, isoprene from foliage and various monoterpenes as main components in plant oils (Abeles et al. [1992]; Primrose [1979]; Rasmussen [1970]). Alkenes have received some attention as <b>oxidable</b> substrates for microorganisms. Investigations about the metabolism of hexadec- 1 -ene in Y. lipolytica indicated the formation of the corresponding ω-unsaturated primary and secondary alcohols and the respective fatty acids by oxidation of the saturated end of this alkene. Moreover the oxidation of the double bond resulted in the conversion to 1, 2 -epoxyhexadecane, hexadecane- 1 -ol, hexadecane- 2 -ol, 2 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acid and hexadecane- 1, 2 -diol. The latter was converted to the 2 -hydroxy acid and after that oxidatively decarboxylated to the one carbon atom shortened fatty acid (Bruyn [1954]; Klug [1969]; Klug and Markovetz [1967], [1968]; Stewart et al. [1960]).|$|E
30|$|Certainly, it {{is clear}} that the fuel for ball lightning—in the form of aerosol {{submicron}} and nanoparticles—can only be made inside the local air volume with an initial deficiency of oxidizers. As is well known, such a local temporary deficiency of oxidizers can be spontaneously achieved by various means. For example, it can be achieved with the help of local “burning” oxidizers inside a confined space due to the substantial excess vapour of the future nanoparticle ball lightning fuel. Another probable means for the local temporary neutralization of the influence of atmospheric oxidizers during ball lightning formation is the accidental simultaneous process of the generation of a reducing atmosphere of additional gas reductants—hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulphide etc. This essential requirement of nanotechnology of metals—the presence of an inert or reducing atmosphere at the manufacture of <b>oxidable</b> nanoparticles—is completely applicable to the technology of nanoparticle ball lightning [5].|$|E

The original C/C material consisted of an ex-PAN preform densified by CVI. Friction tests cycles consisted {{of a large number}} of identical braking strokes with experimental parameters corresponding to taxiing. Temperature-programmed desorption spectra of CO 2, CO and H 2 O present similarities with those published in the literature for a wide variety of oxidized activated carbons. However the amount of oxygen expressed per unit surface is generally higher for debris than for oxidized activated carbons. The formation of the corresponding oxygen groups is attributed to the mecanochemical actions (rupture, oxidation, and compaction) that carbon debris undergoes on sliding surfaces before being ejected from the disc/disc contact. In addition, temperature-programmed oxidation of debris under diluted oxygen showed that they are much more <b>oxidable</b> than the original C/C material...|$|E

High concentrations of catechin can be found in green tea, red wine, chocolate and fruits. Consumption of catechins has been associated with beneficial effects including antioxidant activity, blood vessels expansion, decreased LDL oxidation, and reduced susceptibility to various cancer types. Natural catechin is very unstable and easily <b>oxidable,</b> but pharmacokinetics profiles of this drug could be easily modified by exploiting recent advances in the nanomedicine field. Specifically, two different nanoformulations were tested: gelatine-catechin conjugates and gelatine-catechin coniugates incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNT). Melanoma is a very aggressive cancer and a leading cause of death due to its highly metastatic ability. We investigated inhibitory effects of different catechin formulations on the invasive potential of human melanoma A 375 cells by performing cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and cell invasion assays.

The oxygen atoms produced by plasma dissociation promote decrease of nitrogen, carbon and hydrogen content of the film but are not able to form oxygenated nitrogen compounds. The results are in agreement with a deposition mechanism composed of different gas-gas and gas-surface reactions as previously found for tetraethoxysilane. The main difference is that in the present work the homogeneous activation reaction of unreacted compound by means of oxygen atoms is important even when the oxygen content of the feed is low.

40|$|Shallow {{tropical}} integrated culture ponds in the Pearl River Delta, China, {{have been}} found to stratify almost daily, with high organic loadings and dense algal growth. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration is super-saturated in the epilimnion and is under 2 mg/l in the hypolimnion (> 1 m). The compensation depth corresponds to twice the Secchi disk depth ranging from 50 to 80 cm. As a result, little or no net oxygen is produced in the hypolimnion (> 1 m). The low DO concentration in the hypolimnion causes organic materials, such as unused organic wastes and senescent algae cells, to be incompletely oxidized, since the rate of oxygen consumption by <b>oxidable</b> matter in water is dependent on the dissolved oxygen concentration in water. This material becomes the source of hypolimnetic oxygen deficits (HOD) which can drive whole pond DO to a dangerously low level, should sudden destratification occur. An improved estimate of hypolimnetic oxygen deficits is introduced in this article, and the advantages of this method are discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxidable</b> POC, at two {{stations}} in the Cananéia estuary, {{was found to be}} largely dependent upon the smallest size POC. The correlation factors between POC and the numerical abundance of cells, heterotrofic particles and bacteria, in each of the size categories studied, were generally low and non-significant for both stations, with a few exceptions. At St. I the number of heterotrophic particles seems to account for some of the POC variation over the year. At St. II, the only significant correlation found was between the number of the largest and intermediate size classes bacteria and the equivalent size classes POC. At this station the importance of the detritus component is suggested. The differences found between the stations, concerning the numerical contribution of cells, particles and bacteria to total POC, have been attributed to the differential hydrodynamic conditions acting upon material coming from land, due to diverse location of the stations. Sampling date and the collection of different water masses have also been considered as factors that may greatly affect the relationships studied...|$|E

Arsenic and selenium were absorbed and accumulated in fly ash during the combustion process of coal, but would be released into the environment again when/if fly ash was disposed. To better understand the mobility and bioavailability of arsenic and selenium in fly ash, one sequential extraction procedure was applied to characterize the species of As and Se. Both in fly ash were divided into 5 fractions: water extractable fraction (F 1), acid soluble fraction (F 2), reducible fraction (F 3), <b>oxidable</b> fraction (F 4) and residual fraction (F 5). The fly ash samples from both the conventional pulverized coal (PC) and the circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustor were analyzed. The results demonstrated that 71 - 84 % of As and about 96 % of Se {{were present in the}} extractable fractions (F 1 +F 2 +F 3 +F 4) indicating that both in fly ash from coal-fired power plants have high mobility and bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnzymatic glucose sensors {{are based}} on the amperometric {{detection}} of an <b>oxidable</b> species generated during the oxydation of glucose by glucose oxidase. This measurement usually requires a working electrode (anode), an auxiliary electrode (cathode), and a reference electrode, the function of the latter being to keep constant the working potential of the anode, which is responsible for current generation. However, in the needle-type glucose sensors proposed so far, the reference electrode is missing, and its function is performed by the auxiliary electrode. We investigated, in vitro and in vivo in rats, the ability of several cathode-needle materials to behave as a reference electrode in two-electrode glucose sensors, i. e., to present a stable auxiliary electrode potential. In vitro, when glucose concentration was raised from 0 to 30 mM, the auxiliary potential of both gold-and silver-coated sensors presented a cathodic drift, whereas that of silver/silver chloride-coated sensors remained stable. In vivo, during insulin-induced hypoglycemia (5. 9 - 2. 4 mM), the auxiliary potentials of all sensors remained stable, whereas during glucose infusion (mean blood glucose concentration 11. 2 mM), the auxiliary potentials of both gold-and silver-coated sensors presented an anodic drift, whereas those of silver/silver chloride-coated sensors remained stable...|$|E

We have tested the interactions between these soil animal groups, plants and soil in several experiments: In two laboratory and two field experiments earthworms positively affected growth of late successional plants (Arrhenatherum elatius, Agrostis capillaris, Centaurea jacea, Festuca rubra, Plantago lanceolata, Lotus corniculatus, and Trifolium spp.), during the laboratory experiments a decrease in soil pH and increase in microbial respiration, <b>oxidable</b> C, total N, and exchangeable P, K, and Ca content was detected in presence of earthworms. In a laboratory experiment earthworms also negatively affected germination of small seeds in comparison with large seeds.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the KomiSens project was to combine gas-sensors of various technologies {{as well as the}} further development of evaluation methods. By combining a gas-sensor manufactured in micro-structure technology with a gas-sensor made in conventional technology, an integrated sensor for reducible and <b>oxidable</b> gases was developed. The double-sensor thus developed can be utilized to regulate the air-quality of vehicle cabins and buildings, and is a definate improvement compared to other systems in currently in existence. By combining the adsorber materials and gas-sensors, the detectable level of individual gases was improved by more than two orders of quantities. This opens up whole new fields of application that were not covered with use of gas-sensors without appropriate methods. By using neuronal networks, a swift projection of the sensor signals was achieved.

At nanometer scale, Si NPs in colloidal form exhibit visible photoluminescence (PL) with a high quantum yield because of the confinement effect which partly overcomes the indirect band gap and which can be tuned by the NP size [4 – 6]. However, PL from oxidized Si QDs has low radiative rates and is not spectrally tunable [7]. H-terminated Si QDs have spectrally tunable PL but also low radiative rates and are chemically unstable and easily <b>oxidable</b> [7, 8]. Dedicated surface engineering such as alkyl chains by organic capping involving a carbon surface termination has led recently to bright luminescent Si NPs [9 – 13]. These NPs have stable surface passivation due to the strong covalent Si-C bond preventing photo-oxidation and aggregation in solution [14]. This allows also versatile (bio)functionalization [15]. They are nontoxic [16] and show bright photo-stable blue-green PL with fast decay for 2 - to 3 -nm size [17, 18].|$|E
40|$|International audienceOxygen is {{not only}} one of life's {{essential}} elements but also a source of protein damage, mutagenesis, and ageing. Many proteome adaptations have been proposed to tackle such stresses and we assessed them using comparative genomics in a phylogenetic context. First, we find that aerobiosis is a trait with important phylogenetic inertia but that oxygen content in proteins is not. Instead, oxygen content {{is close to the}} expected values given the nucleotide composition. Accordingly, we find no evidence of oxygen being a scarce resource for protein synthesis even among anaerobes. Second, we searched for counterselection of amino acids more prone to oxidation among aerobes. Only cysteine follows the expected trend, whereas tryptophan follows the inverse one. When analyzing composition in the context of protein structures and residue accessibility, we find that all <b>oxidable</b> residues are avoided at the surface of proteins. Yet, there is no difference between aerobes and anaerobes in this respect, and the effect might be explained by the hydrophobicity of these residues. Third, we revisited the hypothesis that atmospheric enrichment in molecular oxygen {{led to the development of}} the communication capabilities of eukaryotes. With a larger data set and adequate controls, we confirm the trend of longer oxygen-rich outer domains in transmembrane proteins of eukaryotes. Yet, we find no significant association between oxygen concentration in the environment and this trait within prokaryotes, suggesting that this difference is clade specific and independent of oxygen availability. We find that genes involved in cellular responses to oxygen are much more frequent among aerobes, and we suggest that they erase most expected differences in terms of proteome composition between organisms facing high and low oxygen concentrations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{there have been several}} terroristic attacks with improvised {{explosive}} devices (IED) that have raised the need for new instrumentation, for homeland security applications, to obtain a reliable and effective fight against terrorism. Public transportation has been around for about 150 years, but terroristic attacks against buses, trains, subways, etc., is a relatively recent phenomenon [1]. Since 1970, transportation has been an increasingly attractive target for terrorists. Most of the attacks to transport infrastructures take place in countries where public transportation is the primary way to move. Terrorists prefer to execute a smaller-scale attack with certainty of success rather than a complex and demanding operation to cause massive death and destruction. [1]. Many commonly available materials, such as fertilizer, gunpowder, and hydrogen peroxide, can be used as explosives and other materials, such as nails, glass, or metal fragments, can be used {{to increase the amount of}} shrapnel propelled by the explosion. The majority of substances that are classified as chemical explosives generally contain oxygen, nitrogen and <b>oxidable</b> elements such as carbon and hydrogen [2]. The most common functional group in military explosives is NO 2. That functionality can be attached to oxygen (ONO 2) in the nitrate esters (PETN), to carbon (C-NO 2) in the nitroarenes (TNT) and nitroalkanes (Nitromethane), and to nitrogen (N-NO 2) as in the nitramines (RDX). Some organic peroxides, such as TATP and HMTD, are popular amongst terrorists because they are powerful initiators that can be easily prepared from easily available ingredients. Azides are also powerful primary explosives commonly used as initiators (commercial detonators) in civilian and military operations, therefore they could be potentially used by terrorists as initiators for IEDs...|$|E
40|$|As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn {{concentrations}} were determined in two earthworm species (Allolobophora rosea and Nicodrilus caliginosus) from a mining and industrial area in northern Kosovo and {{compared with their}} contents in the bulk soil and the main soil fractions. Earthworm specimens were collected at fifteen sites located at different distances from a Pb–Zn smelter along a gradient of decreasing contamination. Individuals of A. rosea and N. caliginosus showed similar tissue levels of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn, suggesting that earthworm species belonging to the same eco-physiological group have a similar propensity to uptake and bioaccumulate heavy elements. Cd, Pb, Sb and Zn concentrations in both earthworm species were positively correlated with the respective total soil contents and generally decreased with distance from the smelter. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) revealed that Cd and Zn were the only elements bioaccumulated by earthworms. The rank order of BAF values for both species was as follows: Cd > > Zn > > Cu > As = Pb = Sb. The absorption of Cd, Pb, Sb and Zn by earthworms mostly depended on the extractable, reducible and <b>oxidable</b> soil fractions, suggesting that the intestine is likely the most important uptake route. The extractable soil fraction constantly influenced the uptake of these heavy elements, whereas the reducible fraction was important mainly for Pb and Zn. The water soluble fraction had an important role especially for the most mobile heavy elements such as Cd and Zn, suggesting that dermal uptake is not negligible. As a whole, the analytical data indicate that soil fractionation patterns influence the uptake of heavy elements by earthworms, and the extractable fraction is a good predictor of heavy element bioavailability to these invertebrates in soil...|$|E

In foods, lipid oxidation is a degradation regarding the unsaturated fatty acids that react with oxygen through several mechanisms such as chemical autoxidation, action of lipoxigenases, photoxidation, and others. Autoxidation is the main oxidation process and proceed via initiation, propagation, and termination steps leading to the hydroperoxide formation. Hydroperoxides could degraded into low molecular weigh compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketons, acids and other low reactive compounds that negatively influence quality, nutritional value and shelf life of foods. Antioxidants are known to act at different levels of the lipid oxidation. They may act in several ways: they can decrease the oxygen concentration, intercept the singlet oxygen, slow the initiation step by scavenging the first free radicals, break the reaction chain to prevent the hydrogen subtraction, and decompose primary products of oxidation into non-radical products. This work reports the results of two studies on the phenolic fraction and potential antioxidant activity of virgin olive oils and red wines produced in Apulia region. Oils were extracted from olives produced at Cerignola and Torremaggiore using a two phase continuous system. Results showed a different phenolic composition of the oils and a good linear correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Wines were produced from Primitivo grapes pickled at the so-called technological maturity in a vineyard located at Manduria (Taranto). Nine different maceration techniques were applied. Results showed that the addition of tannins from skins and seeds and the saign&eacute;e allowed to obtain high phenolic concentrations in wines. Among the methods used to assess the antioxidant activity, &beta;-carotene seems to be effective...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a geochemical study {{focusing}} on the partitioning of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn in soils of the Kosovska Mitrovica mining area in northern Kosovo. The main objective was to define the element mobility in soil and potential bioavailability in relation to soil contamination levels. The Kosovska Mitrovica area {{is one of the main}} industrial sites in the former Yugoslavia and a world-class mining district in Europe. Extensive and locally very marked contamination mainly by Pb, Zn, Cd and Sb was found in soils, with the highest concentrations measured close to the Zvecan smelter. The study of As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn partitioning in the water soluble, extractable with 0. 11 M acetic acid, reducible, <b>oxidable</b> and residual fractions of soils revealed that Pb was mainly associated with the reducible fraction, Cd with the extractable and reducible fractions, and As, Cu, Sb and Zn with the residual fraction. Heavy element fractionation in contaminated soils was influenced by the presence of owner mineralogical phases related to the emissions of the Zvecan smelter and to materials windborne from mining and industrial dumps, as well as originated by in situ processes. The order of mobility of these heavy elements in contaminated soils resulted as follows: Cd ≫ Zn ≫ Pb ≫ Sb > As > Cu. Anthropogenic amounts of heavy elements were distributed in all soil fractions, with the most relevant enrichments in the extractable and reducible ones. Anthropogenic inputs were responsible for some deviations from natural fractionation, mainly for Pb, Zn and Cd. A significant amount of Cd, Pb and Zn in contaminated soils was rather mobile, which suggests that these elements can be readily available to plants and soil organisms...|$|E
40|$|The cation {{exchange}} capacity (CEC) {{is the most important}} soil physicochemical property with respect to mineral nutrients retention and bioavailability. Its use spreads, as a reference in qualifying soil fertility standards. It is well established that soil CEC originates from two major components: clay minerals and organic matter (OM). A multiple regression analysis was performed in order to estimate the mean contribution of clay and OM to the CEC of surface horizon of soils from three Belgian natural regions: Famenne,Ardenne and the Jurassic Region. The main characteristics of these soils are listed in table 1. The clay-CEC statistical estimates are then compared with the results of a direct method described by Addiscott (1970); the analytical procedure is as follows: the exchange sites are saturated with calcium, which is desorbed from non-organic sites by potassium fluoride; organically-bound calcium is not desorbed due to high affinity of organic sites for that ion. Clay and OM-CEC estimates provide good approximations of CEC for the Jurassic Region and Famenne soils (Table 2). The best predictor of Ardenne soils CEC is OM alone. Mean OM-CEC is estimated about at 300 meq/ 100 g of <b>oxidable</b> carbon, and does not differ from one region to another. Mean clay-CEC estimates are 38, 33 and 43 meq/ 100 g of clay for Famenne, Ardenne and the Jurassic Region, respectively (Table 2). The significant difference between Ardenne and the Jurassic Region can be explained on the basis of mineralogical data: high CEC smectites are found in most of the Jurassic Region soils, whereas they are not in Ardenne. Addiscott CEC measurements resulted in mean clay-CEC of 39, 39 and 51 meq/ 100 g of clay for Famenne, Ardenne and the Jurassic Region, respectively (Table 3). These values do not conflict with statistical estimates...|$|E

Los objetivos de este trabajo son cuantificar esos gradientes, en un establecimiento de Tornquist (provincia de Buenos Aires) y evaluar la sensibilidad de distintos índices de calidad edáfica. En un sector plano se seleccionaron tres posiciones: 1) bajo el alambradro («alambre»); 2) a 3 - 4 m del alambrado («borde») y 3) a 15 m del perímetro («interior»). En cada una se extrajeron tres muestras compuestas, a dos profundidades 0 - 6 y 0 - 12 cm. Se efectuaron los siguientes análisis: pH; fósforo extraíble (P BK); boro extraíble (Bext), nitrógeno orgánico total (Not), potasio (Kint), calcio (Ca int) y magnesio intercambiables (Mg int). Se determinó carbono orgánico (CO), <b>oxidable</b> con distintas concentraciones de ácido sulfúrico y CO total (COT), por combustión seca. Se calcularon fracciones de CO de oxidabilidad creciente. El P BK fue la determinación química más variable. Las profundidades analizadas tuvieron menor impacto sobre las determinaciones que las posiciones, aún con cuatro años previos bajo siembra directa. El pH, Ca int y Mg int no disminuyeron por uso agrícola, confirmando su estabilidad en los sistemas mixtos del SO bonaerense. Algunos de los índices más sensibles a los efectos estudiados (P BK, CO fácilmente <b>oxidable)</b> estuvieron asociados positivamente. Se registraron pérdidas de 43 y 490 kg ha- 1 de P BK y de Kint, en la profundidad de 0 - 12 cm, correspondiendo, el 84 % y el 71 % a los primeros seis cm. El COT disminuyó en un tercio en «interior». La tasa de oxidación del CO fue significativamente mayor para «alambre» a 0 - 6 cm. El factor de oxidación para el método Walkley y Black estándar fue de 0, 82 para «interior» y 0, 90 para «alambre» y «borde». Soil cultivation produces negative {{soil fertility}} gradients {{from under the}} fence towards {{the center of a}} field, impacting distinctly the first cm of the arable layer. The objectives of this work are to quantify these gradients, in an establishment of Tornquist (province of Buenos Aires) and to evaluate the sensitivity of different soil quality indices. Three positions were selected in a field: 1) below the wire fence («alambre»); 2) 3 - 4 m from the fence («borde») and 3) 15 m from the fence («interior»). In each position, three composite samples were extracted, at two depths 0 - 6 and 0 - 12 cm. Soil samples were tested for pH; extractable phosphorus (P BK) and boron (Bext), total organic nitrogen (Not), exchangeable potassium (Kint), calcium (Ca int) and magnesium (Mg int). Determinations of organic carbon (CO) included total CO (COT) by dry combustion and oxidizable carbon (COX) by Walkley and Black (W-B). Fractions of CO of increasing oxidability were calculated from determinations using different concentrations of sulfuric acid. P BK was the most variable soil test. The analyzed depths had a smaller impact on the variables than the positions, even after four years under no-till. pH, Ca int and Mg int did not decrease with agricultural use, confirming their stability in mixed systems of southwestern Buenos Aires. Some of the most sensitive indices (PBK, easily oxidizable CO) were positively associated. Losses of 43 and 490 kg ha- 1 of P BK and Kint were estimated for the depth of 0 - 12 cm, representing 84 % and 71 % in the first six cm, respectively. COT diminished in one third in «interior». The rate of CO oxidation was significantly greater for «alambre» at 0 - 6 cm. The oxidation factor for W-B was of 0. 82 «for interior» and 0. 90 for «alambre» and «borde»...|$|E

40|$|Los biosólidos, son materiales orgánicos, provenientes del {{tratamiento de aguas residuales}} domésticas e industriales y su disposición final es uno de los principales problemas. El depósito en rellenos sanitarios, la incineración y la aplicación en suelos, son los principales métodos de disposición; los dos primeros son costosos, mientras que el último ha tenido aceptación {{debido a}} que puede ser usado como abono orgánico en cultivos y mejorar la fertilidad de suelos degradados, pero se pueden generar problemas de contaminación. En este estudio se evaluó el efecto de la aplicación de biosólidos en el crecimiento de Jacaranda mimosifolia (Gualanday) y en las condiciones físicas y químicas de un suelo degradado. En invernadero, se sembraron plántulas, utilizando un diseño completamente al azar con cuatro tratamientos y diez repeticiones. Los tratamientos correspondieron a contenidos de materia orgánica en la mezcla suelo-biosólido de 0 %, 2 %, 4 % y 8 %. Se muestreó mensualmente la sobrevivencia, altura, diámetro del tallo y número de hojas, y la biomasa seca al final del experimento. Se realizaron análisis físicos y químicos del suelo, al inicio del estudio y a los tres meses. Los análisis químicos incluyeron pH, carbono orgánico <b>oxidable,</b> Al, Ca, Mg, K, CICE, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, P, S, B, NO 3 -, NH 4 +; y los análisis físicos estabilidad de agregados, densidad aparente, densidad real y retención de humedad. El análisis estadístico se realizó entre tratamientos por cada mes, mediante análisis de varianza y pruebas de comparación de medias (Duncan, 95 % nivel de confianza). Los tratamientos con 4 % y 8 % de materia orgánica, afectaron negativamente el crecimiento de J. mimosifolia, debido posiblemente a la alta concentración de nutrientes y metales pesados hallados en el suelo, lo que pudo generar toxicidad, antagonismo y/o sinergismo. Las condiciones físicas se favorecieron al adicionar biosólidos, aumentándose la estabilidad de agregados y la retención de humedad, y disminuyéndose la densidad aparente y densidad real. The biosolids are organic materials, derived from {{wastewater}} treatment of domestic and industrial sewage. One of the main problems of wastewater treatment plants is the final destination of the biosolids. Their deposit in sanitary fillers, the incineration and land application are the main methods of dispose; the first two methods are expensive, while the last one, is gaining acceptance, because the biosolids are a resource that can be used as supplementary organic fertilizer. Furthermore, land application of biosolids can help to improve declined soil fertility in degraded soils, but it can be generated contamination problems. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of biosolids application on the growth of Jacaranda mimosifolia (Gualanday) and the changes on physical and chemical conditions of a degraded soil. This arboreal specie was planted in a degraded soil amended with biosolids, and was grown in a greenhouse. The treatments corresponded to contents of organic matter in the mixture (soil-biosolid) of 0 %, 2 %, 4 % and 8 %, in a completely randomized design with four treatments and ten replications. Monthly samplings were realized to get information about the variables: survival, height and diameter of stem, and number of leaves. The dry biomass was evaluated {{at the end of the}} study. The physical and chemical analyses were made at the beginning of the experiment and three months later. The chemical analyses included pH, <b>oxidable</b> organic carbon, Al, Ca, Mg, K, CICE, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, P, S, B, NO 3 -, NH 4 +, and the physical analyses included aggregate stability, bulk density, real density and water retention. The statistical analysis between treatments was realized every month, by analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test, using a 95 % confidence level. The treatment with a 2 % of organic matter was not affected the plant growth and was similar with the untreated control. The treatments with a 4 % and 8 % of organic matter caused a lower survival, a lower growth in height, diameter, and lesser number of leaves and a lower production of biomass. The high concentration of nutrients found on the soil, probably generated toxicity, antagonism and/or synergism problems. The physical soil properties were favored with the addition of biosolids, possibly for its organic matter contents, appearing an increase in the aggregate stability and the humidity retention, and a diminution of the bulk density and the real density...|$|E
30|$|Among {{the various}} {{conducting}} polymers, films of PPY and derivatives have good conductivity, selectivity, stability, and efficient polymerization at neutral pH [6]. Enzymes and, in particular, oxidases, have been preferentially {{chosen for the}} entrapment in PPY matrices, but other biomolecules are also potential targets. In general, glucose oxidase (GOx) is selected as a model enzyme due to its low cost, stability, and practical utility. The oxidases act by oxidizing the substrate and then returning to their original active state by transferring electrons to molecular oxygen, so the final products of these enzymes are the oxidized form of the substrate and, as a side product, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Both the measurement of oxygen consumption and H 2 O 2 production can provide information about the concentration of the enzyme substrate (glucose). Methods based on the measurement of H 2 O 2 have been greatly preferred {{in the recent years}} to those based on the reduction of oxygen. However, a great drawback in this approach is represented by the high overpotential needed for H 2 O 2 oxidation (greater than + 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode). At this relatively high potential, there may be interferences from other <b>oxidable</b> species such as ascorbic acid, uric acid, and acetaminophen. One of the most common ways to overcome this problem has been the use of another enzyme, namely, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) which catalyzes the reduction of H 2 O 2 and allows the direct electron transfer between its active site and the electrode surface [7]. This approach, although exhibiting good sensitivity and accuracy, suffers from some important shortcomings such as high cost, low stability, and the limited binding of HRP to solid surfaces. For this reason, the electrochemical inorganic mediators [8], able to catalyze the oxidation or reduction of hydrogen peroxide, have been preferred to HRP and have been used for the assembling of oxidase-based biosensors. This results in a decrease of the applied potential and the consequent avoidance of many electrochemical interferences. In this perspective, Prussian blue (PB), which has high electrocatalytic activity, stability, and selectivity for H 2 O 2 electroreduction, has been extensively studied and used for H 2 O 2 detection [9].|$|E
