5|$|Several biographies {{have been}} written about the Waldorf, {{including}} Edward Hungerford's Story of the Waldorf (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1925) and Horace Sutton's Confessions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Hotel: The Waldorf-Astoria (New York: Henry Holt, 1953).|$|E
5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> jury on March 23, 1925. She told the grand jury that she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when there were not enough funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing. Wise was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 during {{construction}} of the Durley Hill Cemetery, the remains <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, {{construction of the}} cemetery went ahead, {{and the majority of}} the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, Michael Aisner, the race's then PR director, {{bought the}} race for one dollar from Siegel, and with his blessing took the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> event to Peter Coors, the beer impresario.|$|R

5|$|In the 2005 elections, Angela Merkel {{became the}} first female Chancellor of Germany as the leader <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> coalition. In 2009 the German {{government}} approved a €50billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{made her}} {{debut in the}} main draw <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Slam at the 2002 Australian Open, where, as a qualifier, she reached the second round before losing to 16th seed Iroda Tulyaganova. However, she {{previously}} lost in the qualifying rounds of both the 2001 French Open and 2001 Wimbledon.|$|E
5|$|Robson had direct {{entry to}} the main draw of the 2012 US Open from her WTA ranking, where she {{defeated}} Samantha Crawford in the first round. In the second round she defeated former US Open Champion Kim Clijsters in Clijsters' final singles match before her retirement. Robson consequently reached the third round <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Slam tournament {{for the first time}} in her career and joined Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams, Amélie Mauresmo and Justine Henin as one of the only six people to beat Clijsters at the US Open championships, and the first player to beat her there since 2003. She followed up her performance with her first victory over a top ten player, beating 9th seed Li Na in the third round in three sets. Robson became the first female British tennis player to reach this stage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Slam tournament since Samantha Smith reached the fourth round of Wimbledon 14 years previously, but she was defeated by defending champion Stosur, ending her best run at a Grand Slam tournament to date.|$|E

5|$|The Mall, a {{ceremonial}} approach {{route to the}} palace, was designed by SirAston Webb and completed in 1911 as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> memorial to Queen Victoria.

This route {{is used by the}} cavalcades and motorcades of visiting heads of state, and by the royal family on state occasions such as the annual Trooping the Colour.|$|E
5|$|The government's first witness, U.S. Attorneys' Office clerk Gordon Morgan {{testified that}} Glasser had {{suggested}} that Sidney S.

Another prosecution witness, illegal distillery landlord William F. Workman, testified that Capone-affiliated Louis Schiavone had posted approximately $1,000,000 in bail bonds.|$|E
5|$|American {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst bought {{parts of}} the monastery in 1931 {{with the intention of}} using its stones in the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> and fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades. These stones are now in various locations around California: the old church portal was erected at the University of San Francisco, and the chapter house was reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, California. Other stones are serving as simple decorative elements in Golden Gate Park's botanical garden. To support the chapter house project, a line of Belgian-style beers was produced by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company under the Ovila Abbey brand.|$|E

5|$|Author Michael Occleshaw {{made the}} claim in his 1995 book The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor that Tatiana {{might have been}} rescued and transported to England, where she married a British officer and lived under the name Larissa Tudor. Occleshaw based this claim on {{studying}} the diaries of the British agent Richard Meinertzhagen, who hinted at the successful liberation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Duchess, allegedly Tatiana. However, historians discount this claim. Survival stories persist because two bodies were missing from the mass grave found in the forest outside Yekaterinburg and exhumed in 1991. Those bodies were identified as Tsarevich Alexei {{and one of the}} four grand duchesses, generally thought by Russians to be Grand Duchess Maria and by Americans to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. Most historians believe that all of the Romanovs, including Tatiana, were assassinated at Ekaterinburg.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's vision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad {{station on the}} National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E
5|$|Robson was {{the first}} British woman since Samantha Smith at Wimbledon in 1998 to reach the fourth round <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Slam tournament, doing so at the 2012 US Open and the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. She won a silver medal in the mixed doubles at the 2012 London Olympics playing with Andy Murray, with whom she also reached the 2010 Hopman Cup final. At the 2012 Guangzhou Women's Open, Robson became the first British woman since Jo Durie in 1990 to reach a WTA main-tour final, where she lost to Hsieh Su-wei. Robson was named WTA Newcomer of the Year for 2012 and reached a career high singles ranking of world No. 27 on 8 July 2013.|$|E
50|$|Stories of the Holocaust were a myth {{initially}} {{created by}} the Allies of World War II to demonize Germans, Jews having spread this myth as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grander</b> plot intended to enable the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Jewish homeland in Palestine, and now to garner continuing support {{for the state of}} Israel.|$|R

5|$|The Great Depression {{provided}} a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable {{to stem the}} tide of extremism, and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology. The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government. The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 percent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} months of 2011 {{represented}} a significant breakthrough for Raonic, as he rose from No. 156 {{at the beginning of}} January to No. 37 by the end of February. In doing so, he became the highest-ranked Canadian male ever. He began this climb by qualifying for the Australian Open main draw. His first round victory over Björn Phau marked his first victory in a main draw Grand Slam match. In the second round, he defeated No. 22 seed Llodra, becoming the first Canadian man in 10 years to reach the third round <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Slam singles tournament. With his career-first victory over a top10 player (Mikhail Youzhny) in the third round, he became the first qualifier to make the fourth round of a major since Marcelo Filippini at the 1999 French Open.|$|E
5|$|The idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> Shakespeare edition was {{conceived}} {{at a dinner}} at Josiah Boydell’s home in November 1786. The guest list itself is evidence of Boydell’s extensive connections in the artistic world: Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king and painter; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, an engineer. Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby. Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell's, {{he was the one}} to seize and pursue it. He wanted to use the edition to facilitate the development of a British school of history painting.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of semifinals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty-two. A children's {{version of the}} competition, Lilla Melodifestivalen, also began that year. Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as schlager music, are so prevalent that the festival is {{sometimes referred to as}} Schlagerfestivalen ("The schlager festival") by the Swedish media. However, other styles of music such as rap, reggae, and glam rock have made an appearance since the event's expansion. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> final in Stockholm has attracted substantial tourism to the city.|$|E
5|$|Youzhny {{has reached}} the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams, as of 2013 only 11 other active players have managed to do the same.

While chiefly a singles player, Youzhny {{has reached the}} quarterfinals <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> slam in doubles twice, at the 2006 US Open and the 2014 Australian Open. He debuted within the top 10 in January 2008, but ended the year as a top 10 player for {{the only time in}} his career in 2010. As of 2013, Youzhny is third most successful Russian tennis player in history if considering match wins only, trailing behind Nikolay Davydenko and Yevgeny Kafelnikov.|$|E
