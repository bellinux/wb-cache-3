40|$|Inspired by infant development, {{we propose}} a three staged {{developmental}} framework for an anthropomorphic robot manipulator. In the first stage, the robot is initialized {{with a basic}} reach-and- enclose-on-contact movement capability, and discovers a set of behavior primitives by exploring its movement parameter space. In the next stage, the robot exercises the discovered behaviors on different objects, and learns the caused effects; effectively building a library of affordances and associated predictors. Finally, in the third stage, the learned structures and predictors are used to bootstrap complex imitation and action learning {{with the help of}} a cooperative tutor. The main contribution of this paper is the realization of an integrated developmental system where the structures emerging from the sensorimotor experience of an interacting real robot are used as the <b>sole</b> building <b>blocks</b> of the subsequent stages that generate increasingly more complex cognitive capabilities. The proposed framework includes a number of common features with infant sensorimotor development. Furthermore, the findings obtained from the self-exploration and motionese guided human-robot interaction experiments allow us to reason about the underlying mechanisms of simple-to-complex sensorimotor skill progression in human infants.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{barriers}} of dry soil {{on the ability}} of Formosan subterranean termites, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae), to construct tunnels and find food was evaluated. Termite movement and wood consumption in a three–chambered apparatus were compared between treatments with dry soil in the center container and treatments where the soil in the center container was moist. When a wood block was located in the release container, termites fed significantly more on that block, regardless of treatment or soil type. In the treatment with dry clay, none of the termites tunneled through the dry clay barrier to reach the distal container. When termites had to tunnel through a barrier of dry sand, topsoil, or clay to reach the <b>sole</b> wood <b>block,</b> there was no effect on wood consumption for the sand treatment, but there was significantly less feeding on wood in the treatments with dry topsoil or clay. When foraging arenas had a section of dry sand in the center, the dry sand significantly reduced tunneling in the distal section after 3 days, but not after 10 days. There was a highly significant effect {{on the ability of}} termites to colonize food located in dry sand. Only one feeding station located in dry sand was colonized by termites, compared with 11 feeding stations located in moist sand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} sampled-analog rank-order filter (ROF) {{architecture}} of complexity (2). It yields a very compact structure because the devices used are essentially of minimum geometry. Its <b>sole</b> active building <b>block</b> being the simple CMOS inverter, the circuit exhibits an excellent low-voltage compatibility. Furthermore, it can support a rail-to-rail common-mode input range. It is inherently fast due to fully parallel signal processing and speed {{is expected to}} increase with technological scaling {{at the same rate as}} purely digital circuitry. Finally, it supports full pro-grammability of the rank by means of an analog reference voltage. The ROF is based on a pair of multiple-winners-take-all (mWTA) circuits and a set of AND gates. The paper includes a description of the architecture and a detailed analysis of the mWTA. Most relevant design issues are addressed and experimental results obtained from a fabricated ROF are presented.

40|$|The Fe isotope {{composition}} of ordinary chondrites and their constituent chondrules, metal and sulphide grains have been systematically investigated. Bulk chondrites fall within a restricted isotopic range of 1 ‰ (- 0. 84 ‰ to 0. 21 ‰ {{relative to the}} IRMM- 14 Fe standard). Fe isotope compositions do not vary systematically with the very large differences in total Fe concentration, or oxidation state, of the H, L, and LL chondrite classes. Similarly, the Fe isotope compositions of chondrules {{do not appear to}} be determined by the H, L or LL classification of their host chondrite. This may support an origin of the three ordinary chondrite groups from variable accretion of identical Fe-bearing precursors. A close relationship between isotopic composition and redistribution of Fe during metamorphism on ordinary chondrite parent bodies was identified; the largest variations in chondrule compositions were found in chondrites of the lowest petrologic types. The clear link between element redistribution and isotopic composition has implications for many other non-traditional isotope systems (e. g. Mg, Si, Ca, Cr). Isotopic compositions of chondrules may also be determined by their melting history; porphyritic chondrules exhibit a wide range in isotope compositions whereas barred olivine and radial pyroxene chondrules are generally isotopically heavier than the ordinary chondrite mean. Very large chondrules preserve the greatest heterogeneity of Fe isotopes. The mean Fe isotope {{composition of}} bulk ordinary chondrites was found to be - 0. 06 ‰ (± 0. 12 ‰ 2 SD); this is isotopically lighter than the terrestrial mean composition and all other published non-chondritic meteorite suites e. g. lunar and Martian samples, eucrites, pallasites, and irons. Ordinary chondrites, though the most common meteorites found on Earth today, were not the <b>sole</b> building <b>blocks</b> of the terrestrial planets. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A novel monolithic, pre-fabricated, fully {{functional}} film {{made of a}} nanostructured free-standing {{layer is}} presented for a new and competitive class of easy-to-assemble flexible supercapacitors whose design is in-between the all solid state and the traditional liquid electrolyte. The film is made of two vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotube (VANT) electrodes that store ions, embedded-in, and monolithically interspaced by a solution of microcrystalline cellulose in a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte (1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate-EMIM Ac). The fine tuning of VANTs length and electrolyte/cellulose amount leads, in a <b>sole</b> and continuous <b>block,</b> to ions storage and physical separation between the electrodes without the need of the additional separator layer that is typically used in supercapacitors. Thus, physical discontinuities that can induce disturbances to ions mobility, are fully eliminated significantly reducing the equivalent series resistance and increasing the knee frequency, hence outclassing the best supercapacitors based on VANTs and non-aqueous electrolytes. The excellent electrochemical response can also be addressed to the chosen electrolyte that, {{not only has the}} advantage of leading to a significantly simpler and more affordable fabrication procedure, but has higher ionic conductivity, lower viscosity and higher ions mobility than other electrolytes capable of dissolving cellulose...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays on the Internet, {{there is}} a huge and growing expanse of unsought traffic like phishing, spam and {{distributed}} access denied service attacks. To solve this problem we can generally filter unsought traffic on routers based on the source IP addresses. Since the boundless number of existing filters in routers now are aggregation used in practice: a <b>sole</b> filter and <b>block</b> defines a variety of IP addresses. Consequently blocking of all (unsought and desired) traffic caused from hosts with IP addresses in that range. Here, a set of algorithms is been established that specified a blacklist containing the source IP addresses of unsought traffic and a limitation on the number of sieving, build a set of sieving rules that enhance the interchange between the unsought and valid traffic is blocked and permits furtive distribution amongst a group of members with Multiprotocol label switching(MPLS). Furthermore, to illustrate that precise good when applied to realistic sharing of causes of unsought traffic, that is said to exhibit space and time elements clustering. But it is exclusive to block valid traffic from the prefix filtering. We will show how to choose optimal prefix to filter for different situations, attacking political entrepreneurs. I...|$|R
40|$|The South Virgin Mountains and Grand Wash trough {{comprise}} a mid-Miocene normal fault system {{that defines the}} boundary between the unextended Colorado Plateau to the east and highly extended crust of the central Basin and Range province to the west. In the upper 3 km of the crust, the system developed in subhorizontal cratonic strata in the foreland of the Cordilleran fold and thrust system. The rugged topography and lack of vegetation of the area afford exceptional three-dimensional exposures. Compact stratigraphy and well-defined prefaulting configuration of the rocks permitted a detailed reconstruction of the system. Reconstruction of cross sections based on more than 300 km 2 of detailed mapping at a scale of 1 : 12   000 shows that the fault system accommodated more than 15 km of roughly east-west–directed Miocene extension. Extension was initially accommodated on moderately to steeply dipping listric normal faults. As the early faults and fault blocks tilted, steeply to moderately dipping faults initiated within the fault <b>blocks,</b> <b>soling</b> into the early faults. Some of the early faults were active at dips of < 20 °. Isostatically driven tilting is superimposed on tilting due to active slip and domino-style rotation of the fault blocks. Collectively these processes rotated originally steeply dipping faults to horizontal orientations. The kinematics are inconsistent with the widely accepted view that many near-horizontal normal faults were rotated to their present orientations by later, crosscutting normal faults. However, reexamination of other areas suggests that the evolutionary sequence seen in the South Virgin Mountains may, in fact, be widely applicable...|$|R
40|$|A thermodynamic, model-based, {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{relative}} performance of methanol and dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis systems using CO- and CO 2 -based syngas feeds. The upstream production {{of a range of}} syngas feed compositions was simulated using CO 2 and H 2 O as the <b>sole</b> chemical building <b>blocks,</b> a requirement motivated by the increasing constraints on permissible CO 2 emissions and the successful adaptation by some industrial methanol plants to the direct utilisation of CO 2. The objective was to establish whether the energy requirements and CO 2 emissions associated with upstream conversion of CO 2 to CO were justified by increased productivity in the methanol/DME systems. In {{the first part of the}} study, the performance of four systems was evaluated and compared in terms of energy efficiency and CO 2 conversion: (1) methanol synthesis system, (2) direct DME synthesis system, (3) two-step DME synthesis system with an interposed syngas separation step between the methanol production reactor and methanol dehydration reactor and (4) two-step DME synthesis system with no separation step between the two reactors. Based on equilibrium yields at 250 °C and 50 bar, the direct DME synthesis system was found to exhibit the highest energy conversion efficiencies with both CO 2 - and CO-based syngas. Although this system demonstrated the lowest CO 2 emissions per methanol equivalent product with a CO-based feed, the benefits were offset by emissions associated with the upstream conversion of H 2 O and CO 2 to H 2 and CO, evaluated in the second part of the study. It was determined that CO 2 could be utilised directly in the direct DME synthesis route, whereas upstream conversion of CO 2 to CO was necessary to achieve effective yields in the methanol/two-step DME systems. CO-based syngas production via high temperature co-electrolysis of H 2 O and CO 2, or alternatively high temperature CO 2 electrolysis coupled with the water–gas shift process, was identified as the best technology based on energy consumption and CO 2 utilisation...|$|R
