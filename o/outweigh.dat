5|$|Linezolid is in U.S. {{pregnancy}} category C, meaning {{there have}} been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal studies have shown mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may <b>outweigh</b> its risks. It also passes into breast milk, although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to <b>outweigh</b> any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be assessed for {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to <b>outweigh</b> potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.|$|E

5|$|Problems for the Portuguese arose almost {{immediately}} when the offensive {{coincided with the}} beginning of the monsoon season, creating additional logistical difficulties. Not only were the Portuguese soldiers badly equipped, but there was very poor cooperation, if any at all, between the FAP and the army. Thus, the army lacked close air support from the FAP. Mounting Portuguese casualties began to <b>outweigh</b> FRELIMO casualties, leading to further political intervention from Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the financial benefits from the recreational value of the reserve <b>outweigh</b> the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5|$|The final {{consideration}} is cost: {{how much will}} a particular defensive strategy cost a plant in energy and materials? This is particularly important, as energy spent on defense cannot be used for other functions, such as reproduction and growth. The optimal defense hypothesis predicts that plants will allocate more energy towards defense when the benefits of protection <b>outweigh</b> the costs, specifically in situations where there is high herbivore pressure.|$|E

No one likes an unnecessary fight, especially not one with as formidable an opponent as Justice Scalia.|$|E
5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they <b>outweigh</b> the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis and accompanying recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit. A 2013 study estimated that changes to the health system had been responsible for {{about a quarter of the}} recent reduction in inflation. Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to <b>outweigh</b> the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E

5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become {{increasingly}} concerned about the welfare of farm animals. Possible measures of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans <b>outweigh</b> the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally <b>outweigh</b> the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to <b>outweigh</b> the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E

5|$|The only {{common side}} effect of {{warfarin}} is bleeding. The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite (a typically yearly rate of 1-3% has been reported) and any benefit needs to <b>outweigh</b> this risk when warfarin is considered. All types of bleeding occur more commonly, but the most severe ones are those involving the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage/hemorrhagic stroke) and the spinal cord. Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range (due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions). This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4.5.|$|E
5|$|The red-throated loon breeds {{primarily}} in the Arctic regions of northern Eurasia and North America (generally north of 50°N latitude), and winters in northern coastal waters, sometimes in groups of considerable size. More than 4,400 spend the winter in a loose concentration on {{the eastern part of}} the German Bight, for example. Unlike other loons, it regularly uses very small freshwater lakes as breeding sites. Its small size renders it more versatile, but it is less able to feed on deeper prey. The increase in size and diversity of the remaining species of loons suggests that the benefits of larger size <b>outweigh</b> the limitations.|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing {{the relocation of}} an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would <b>outweigh</b> the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort Yukon, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. The Tundra Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly {{in opposition to the}} project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of small installations, {{convenience}} may <b>outweigh</b> cost. There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed. By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E
5|$|Most {{animals are}} euthanized after {{being used in}} an experiment. Sources of {{laboratory}} animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while a minority {{are caught in the}} wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms and the environment. Animal rights and some animal welfare organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs <b>outweigh</b> the benefits, or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza <b>outweigh</b> the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
