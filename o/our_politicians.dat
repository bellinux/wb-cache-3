It's because Mitt Romney, who is telling people he's an opponent of same-sex marriage, forced the justices of the peace and others to perform same-sex marriage, all on his own, with no authorization or requirement from the court.

For Elvenking, fantasy themes are used [...] "as a metaphor to cover deeper meanings."

There’s always suspicion about Taiwan’s aid in this country despite the fine sounding intentions under which it is given. [...] <b>Our</b> <b>politicians</b> undoubtedly exploit Taiwan’s need to keep Solomon Islands {{as one of the}} nations recognising it as a country in its own right. But there should be no doubts about this week’s launch of the Taiwan Medical Centre at the National Referral Hospital. This is tangible, beneficial and transparent help. It underscores Taiwan’s role as a true, democratic friend of Solomon Islands. May there be more such help given this way." ...|$|E

The whole country saw {{that there is no}} opposition whatsoever in Moldova — neither anti-Communist, nor anti-Voronin. There is only opposition to the state." [...] The President also commented on the displaying of Romanian flags: [...] "What happened yesterday brought indelible shame on <b>our</b> <b>politicians,</b> on the whole of our democracy. The entire Moldovan nation witnessed the greatest humiliation of its own sovereignty and its own democracy when the state standards were ripped from the flagpoles of Parliament and the President's Office and replaced with the flags of Romania."

For example, I analyzed the statements of <b>our</b> <b>politician</b> Tomio Okamura and reactions to his statements. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} explore how (and whether) the issue of Romani holocaust is included in the school curriculum. In the second part of my work I focused on common knowledge about this topic in schools.

For this reason it is essential for <b>our</b> <b>politician</b> to search an alternate of Hartal. The research also provides information about financial losses in Hartal days in Bangladesh. The Research identifies a disappointing fact that Hartal imposes a large cost on the economy. The study is to identify the measure areas where basically Hartal affects negatively.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} hyperbolic discounting into politics. In <b>our</b> model, <b>politicians</b> act {{according to}} the preferences of voters {{in order to be}} re-elected. As voters' preferences are dynamically inconsistent, the political process results in an allocation of the public budget that is distorted towards consumption ex- penditures. We show that this inefficiency is mitigated when the influence of bureaucrats who favour an excessive supply of public goods is taken into ac- count. Finally, we derive a positive relationship between the optimal level of a bureaucracy's influence and the relevance of long-term investments in a given policy area.
