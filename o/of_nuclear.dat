5|$|After the {{discovery}} of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011, IUPAC asked {{the discovery}} team at the JINR to suggest permanent names for those two elements. The Dubna team chose to name element 114 flerovium (symbol Fl), after the Russian Flerov Laboratory <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Reactions (FLNR), named after the Soviet physicist Georgy Flyorov (also spelled Flerov); earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour Flyorov. In accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers IUPAC officially named flerovium after the Flerov Laboratory <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Reactions (an older name for the JINR), not after Flyorov himself. Flyorov is known for writing to Stalin in April 1942 and pointing out the silence in scientific journals in the field <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> fission in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Flyorov deduced that this research must have become classified information in those countries. Flyorov's work and urgings {{led to the development}} of the USSR's own atomic bomb project.|$|E

40|$|The {{qualitative}} and quantitative lipid composition <b>of</b> nuclei and <b>nuclear</b> membranes from pig and rat liver were determined. These determinations were compared with the corresponding data obtained for microsomes from the same material after similar treatments.

The phospholipid pattern <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes in general is widely identical in both species. As a striking difference in the lipid composition, however, a fourfold increase of esterified cholesterol in the nuclear membranes was found. In a quantitative approach the ratio of total surface area <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> lipids to the total surface area <b>of</b> the <b>nuclear</b> envelope membranes was calculated as being 3. 6, a value which fairly approximates the requirements of a bimolecular lipid leaflet model...|$|R
