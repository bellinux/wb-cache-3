25|$|In {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{of the road}} at {{the southern edge of}} Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the argillaceous (clayey) Kellaways sand, {{it was found that the}} construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and <b>over-filling</b> them with gravel ballast so as to form kerbs. Coarse sand was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather friable Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p.23.) Again, the use is north of the source.|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the link between}} descriptive representation and substantive representation: do female legislators, in sharing a common gender identity, promote public policies that improve women's rights and citizens' wellbeing? Mexico and Argentina are ideal case studies. Both countries have gender quota laws, compelling political parties to nominate thirty percent women to closed candidate lists. The countries vary, however, on the proportions of female legislators elected and on institutional support for gender policy. Mexico under- fills its quota, but formalizes women's representation through a Bicameral Commission on Equity and Gender. Argentina, by contrast, <b>over-fills</b> its quota, but lacks those institutional mechanisms that legitimate the development of gender policy. I use quantitative and qualitative data to compare female legislators' and male legislators' interventions throughout the policy process. This data includes an original dataset of bill introduction and bill passage, debate transcripts and policy proposals, over 50 interviews with male and female legislators in both countries, and case studies of successful reforms. I consider constituent demands, as expressed through public opinion, and whether these demands link to legislators' agenda setting initiatives. Next, I determine the frequency of bill introduction across policy areas, and compare this statistic to the frequency of legislative success. Finally, I analyze the implementation of successful policies, to evaluate whether or not material benefits reach female constituents. This dissertation {{is located at the}} intersection of the comparative politics literature on legislatures and policymaking, on the one hand, and women and politics, on the other. I find that female legislators, more than male legislators, advocate for policies dealing with health, minority rights, and women's rights; I further find {{that the vast majority of}} female legislators adopt progressive positions on women's roles and opportunities. Most importantly, I conclude that legislative institutions and practices [...] namely gender commissions and women's caucuses- -contribute significantly to whether or not the substantive representation of women unfold...|$|R
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to <b>over-fill</b> the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|R
40|$|Co-rotating twin-screw {{extruders}} {{are unique}} and versatile machines {{that are used}} widely in the plastics and food processing industries. Due to {{the large number of}} operating variables and design parameters available for manipulation and the complex interactions between them, it cannot be claimed that these extruders are currently being optimally utilised. The most significant improvement to the field of twin-screw extrusion would be through the provision of a generally applicable dynamic process model that is both computationally inexpensive and accurate. This would enable product design, process optimisation and process controller design to be performed cheaply and more thoroughly on a computer than can currently be achieved through experimental trials. This thesis is divided into three parts: dynamic modelling, measurement and control. The first part outlines the development of a dynamic model of the extrusion process which satisfies the above mentioned criteria. The dynamic model predicts quasi- 3 D spatial profiles of the degree of fill, pressure, temperature, specific mechanical energy input and concentrations of inert and reacting species in the extruder. The individual material transport models which constitute the dynamic model are examined closely for their accuracy and computational efficiency by comparing candidate models amongst themselves and against full 3 D finite volume flow models. Several new modelling approaches are proposed {{in the course of this}} investigation. The dynamic model achieves a high degree of simplicity and flexibility by assuming a slight compressibility in the process material, allowing the pressure to be calculated directly from the degree of <b>over-fill</b> in each model element using an equation of state. Comparison of the model predictions with dynamic temperature, pressure and residence time distribution data from an extrusion cooking process indicates a good predictive capability. The model can perform dynamic step-change calculations for typical screw configurations in approximately 30 seconds on a 600 MHz Pentium 3 personal computer. The second part of this thesis relates to the measurement of product quality attributes of extruded materials. A digital image processing technique for measuring the bubble size distribution in extruded foams from cross sectional images is presented. It is recognised that this is an important product quality attribute, though difficult to measure accurately with existing techniques. The present technique is demonstrated on several different products. A simulation study of the formation mechanism of polymer foams is also performed. The measurement of product quality attributes such as bulk density and hardness in a manner suitable for automatic control is also addressed. This is achieved through the development of an acoustic sensor for inferring product attributes using the sounds emanating from the product as it leaves the extruder. This method is found to have good prediction ability on unseen data. The third and final part of this thesis relates to the automatic control of product quality attributes using multivariable model predictive controllers based on both direct and indirect control strategies. In the given case study, indirect control strategies, which seek to regulate the product quality attributes through the control of secondary process indicators such as temperature and pressure, are found to cause greater deviations in product quality than taking no corrective control action at all. Conversely, direct control strategies are shown to give tight control over the product quality attributes, provided that appropriate product quality sensors or inferential estimation techniques are available...|$|R

50|$|In the Song dynasty (960-1279) {{more than}} a hundred higher level {{examinations}} were held. Officials selected through the exams became dominant in the bureaucracy. Theoretically, the examinations were open to adult Chinese (at least in terms of literacy) males, with some restrictions, as, in parallel was the opportunity to become a high-ranking government official. This included even individuals from the occupied northern territories. Many individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination. Examples include Wang Anshi, who proposed reforms to make the exams more practical, and Zhu Xi, whose interpretations of the Four Classics became the orthodox Neo-Confucianism which dominated later dynasties. Two other prominent successful entries into politics through the examination system were Su Shi and his brother Su Zhe: both of whom became political opponents of Wang Anshi. Indeed, one of the major objectives of the examination system was to promote diversity of viewpoints and to avoid <b>over-filling</b> of offices with individuals of particular political or partisan alignment, as might occur with alternative, more biased methods, which could allow for active recruitment.

5000|$|The canal was {{designed}} for tub-boats which were 26 by 6.5 ft. The inclines at Thornfalcon, Wrantage and Ilminster were double-acting inclines, consisting of two parallel tracks, each containing a six-wheeled caisson, in which the boats floated. A chain linked the two caissons together, passing round a horizontal drum situated {{at the top of}} the incline. Power for the movement of the boats was provided by <b>over-filling</b> the top caisson, the extra weight causing that caisson to descend and the other to rise. Because the majority of traffic passed up the canal, and a boat displaces its own weight in water (Archimedes' principle), considerably more water passed down the incline than up it. However, the system was still more economical than using locks, and a large new Chard Reservoir supplied the necessary water. The incline at Chard Common was quite different, consisting of a single track, with the tub-boats being carried on a cradle with four wheels. Power was supplied by a Whitelaw and Stirrat water turbine, with a 25 ft head, which used [...] of water per minute. Boats were raised 86 ft in a wheeled cradle up a slope of 1:10. The cradle was attached to the turbine by a substantial wire rope, after breakages of the original rope.

40|$|Nowadays {{more and}} more {{engineering}} structures are constructed on soft soils of low strength. High compressibility, low permeability and liability to secondary compression of these soils can result in long-term settlements and a menace with critical situations when the construction deadlines are tough. To cope with these problems several technologies have recently been developed in the embankment construction practice. Staged construction, <b>over-filling,</b> vertical drainage, stone columns, dynamic compaction — all of them often combined successfully with geosynthetics — are preferred to the previously predominant technology of soil replacement. Nevertheless, common design methods often do not balance properly the structural modeling, computation, economical and construction aspects. This is why a correct design may become a subject of reconsideration and modification in specific circumstances. There remains a room for innovative approaches, when conventional solutions are used.

40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} (CHF) holds {{millions}} {{in the grip}} of an endless cycle of decreased cardiac output and degenerative remodeling, often with little hope of recovery. Diastolic dysfunction, or failure of the heart to properly fill, is a contributing factor to all cases of CHF and is the sole cause of many cases. By storing energy during systole that can be released during diastole, the addition of a diastolic recoil component to an existing systolic support device could aid in inducing restorative remodeling and, thus, interrupt the downward spiral of heart failure. In this study we use an indicator of diastolic function-the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) -to demonstrate in vitro the ability of a prototype device to positively impact the entire heart cycle. The support device alone shifts the EDPVR of a model heart towards smaller volumes. When the diastolic recoil component is employed, the EDPVR is shifted towards lower pressures at low volumes, indicating stiffer diastolic recoil. We conclude the device provides bi-phasic support of our model heart, constraining <b>over-filling</b> of the ventricles and augmenting ventricular recoil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{simplified}} {{finite element}} model of the human lumbar intervertebral disc was utilized for understanding nucleus pulposus implant mechanics. The model {{was used to assess}} the effect of nucleus implant parameter variations on the resulting compressive biomechanics of the lumbar anterior column unit. The effects of nucleus implant material (modulus and Poisson’s ratio) and geometrical (height and diameter) parameters on the mechanical behavior of the disc were investigated. The model predicted that variations in implant modulus contribute less to the compressive disc mechanics compared to the implant geometrical parameters, for the ranges examined. It was concluded that some threshold exists for the nucleus implant modulus, below which little variations in load–displacement behavior were shown. Compressive biomechanics were highly affected by implant volume (under-filling the nucleus cavity, line-to-line fit, or <b>over-filling</b> the nucleus cavity) with a greater restoration of compressive mechanics observed with the over-filled implant design. This work indicated the effect of nucleus implant parameter variations on the compressive mechanics of the human lumbar intervertebral disc and importance of the ‘‘fit and fill’ ’ effect of the nuclear cavity in the restoration of the human intervertebral disc mechanics in compression. These findings may have clinical significance for nucleus implant design. ' 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biome...|$|E

Soil Sci. 89 : 671 - 676. Indirect subsurface drip irrigation (ISDI) {{is a method}} of increasing the irrigation water use efficiency of drip irrigation without the need to bury irrigation tubes and wet the soil surface. A major problem of ISDI is the mismatch between emitter discharge rate and water-conducting device dimension, which will result in <b>over-filling</b> of application water. In this paper, we propose to use the steady-state principle of Coll stant-head well permeameter (CHWP) to quantify the relationship between emitter discharge rate and water-conducting device dimension For ISDI. CHWP tests and ISDI tests were carried out in a 300 in 2 winter wheat fallow to verify its feasibility. The steady-state characteristic of these two methods was also studied using long-term infiltration. Results indicate that the equilibration time (110 min) in the ISDI tests was greater than that in the CHWP tests (30 min). The steady ponded depth in ISDI had a smaller variation than the steady water discharge rate in the CHWP. When using the steady-state principle of CHWP to design ISDI systems, there was significant linear correlation between predicted and measured ponded depth values (R(2) = 0. 8379). The soil field-saturated hydraulic conductivity calculated by these two tests was approximately equal. These results demonstrate that the steady-state principle of CHWP {{could be used to}} select appropriate irrigation systems for ISDI, and ISDI provides another technique to obtain the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} {{regarding the}} refuelling process {{in order to}} prevent over-heating and <b>over-filling</b> significantly influence fuelling station design and have a strong impact on potential fuelling performance. Consequently, refuelling station costs, reliability, and performance can be substantially improved by working on the way these requirements are formulated, in order to achieve shorter fuelling duration with a simpler process and less cooling. Two potential optimization opportunities where extensively investigated {{in the course of the}} EU funded HyTransfer project: (i) Application of the temperature limits to the tank material rather than to the gas inside the tank, (ii) Specification of the average delivery temperature rather than of the delivery temperature profile. Multiple research activities were carried out to this end. New models of various types were developed for predicting both the gas and material temperature inside a vessel during filling and defueling. An experimental programme involving 82 filling and emptying tests of instrumented Type 4 and Type 3 vessels was performed for validating these models. New methods were developed and applied for determining the value of the gas-to-wall heat transfer coefficient from the temperature measurements. The balance of heat transferred from the gas to the liner and to the bosses in a type 4 vessel was reconstructed. CFD simulation was performed for analysing temperature disparities, and the thermal stratification observed in certain filling conditions reproduced. Criteria on gas injection conditions were identified for ensuring gas temperature homogeneity, a key assumption made by fuelling protocols. The temperature variations in the wall material were studied for future investigation of less conservative definitions of the maximum acceptable temperature in Hot Case situations. The effect of changing the delivery temperature profiles without changing the average delivery temperature was analysed. JRC. C. 1 -Energy Storag...|$|E

The point of feed is the upstream {{end of one of}} the sub-basins within the tailings pond, the West Area # 1. The tailings deposit forms an aggrading alluvial fan within each sub-basin. Projections of tailings deposition rates within the West Area # 1 indicate an imminent <b>over-filling</b> at {{the upper end of the}} basin. This premature filling, which threatens to reduce the lifetime of the tailings pond below design expectations, is the result of slopes in the upper part of the deposit which are steeper than anticipated at the time of basin design. st. Anthony Falls Laboratory, University of Minnesota, under contract from Barr Engineering, has undertaken a combined field, experimental, and theoretical study of the dynamics of tailings-basin sedimentation, with a particular focus on the physical controls (i. e., water discharge, sediment load, and sediment size distribution) on upper fan slope. This study has provided the tools necessary to evaluate the relative effectiveness of several tailings management schemes intended to alleviate the problem. The tools were developed in two stages. In Stage 1, the analysis was restricted to West Area # 1 due to the availability of specific data pertaining to that area. The results for Stage 1 were based on the assumption that all future tailings would be stored in West Area # 1. The assumption was made for illustrative purposes only. The results of the calculation allow, however, for inferences concerning the performance of the entire pond. In Stage 2, a numerical model was developed to describe filling of the entire basin. The model allows for the testing of a variety of schemes for tailings management. Hibbing Taconite Compan...|$|E
40|$|Neuronal ER Ca 2 + {{release is}} {{regulated}} by inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (IP 3 R and RyR), and disruptions in neuronal ER Ca 2 + signaling are implicated in neurodegenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer’s (AD). Previously, we demonstrated that an AD-linked presenilin 1 mutation (PS 1 M 146 V) leads to exaggerated ER Ca 2 + responses in cortical neurons (Stutzmann et al., 2004). However, transgenic PS 1 M 146 V mice do not develop the characteristic AD markers of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau. Here we characterize Ca 2 + signals in a triple transgenic (3 xTg-AD) mouse expressing mutant PS 1, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau that does develop AD histopathology at older ages (Oddo et al., 2003). Cortical brain slices were studied by whole-cell patch clamp, flash photorelease of IP 3 and 2 -photon imaging. IP 3 -evoked Ca 2 + signals were> 2 -fold larger in pyramidal neurons of 3 xTg-AD mice than in age-matched (4 - 8 week) controls; but were comparable to PS 1 M 146 V mice. This enhancement arose largely through recruitment of RyR, {{and we found that}} IP 3 R and RyR colocalized in Layer V neurons. Application of caffeine and CPA demonstrated that the ER contains larger Ca 2 + stores in the AD-Tg mice. We conclude that PS 1 M 146 V causes exaggerated ER-Ca 2 + responses, but that APP and tau mutations do not add appreciably to this effect. The exaggerated Ca 2 + signals are evident in young mice well before development of plaques and tangles, and result from <b>over-filling</b> of ER-Ca 2 + stores and recruitment of RyR.
