40|$|An in-line {{chemical}} gas sensor {{was proposed}} and experimentally demonstrated {{using a new}} C-type fiber and a Ge-doped ring defect photonic crystal fiber (PCF). The C-type fiber segment served as a compact gas inlet/outlet directly spliced to PCF, which overcame previous limitations in packaging and dynamic responses. C-type fiber was prepared by optimizing drawing process for a silica tube with an <b>open</b> slot. <b>Splicing</b> conditions for SMF/C-type fiber and PCF/C-type fiber were experimentally established to provide an all-fiber sensor unit. To enhance the sensitivity and light coupling efficiency we used a special PCF with Ge-doped ring defect to further enhance the sensitivity and gas flow rate. Sensing capability of the proposed sensor was investigated experimentally by detecting acetylene absorption lines...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we first give a one-move version of Markov's braid theorem for knot isotopy in S 3 that sharpens the {{classical}} theorem. Then a relative version of Markov's theorem concerning a fixed braided portion in the knot. We also prove an analogue of Markov's theorem for knot isotopy in knot complements. Finally we extend this last result {{to prove a}} Markov theorem for links in an arbitrary orientable 3 [...] manifold. 1 Overview According to Birman [3], Markov [13] originally stated his braid equivalence theorem using three braid moves; later there was another brief announcement of an improved version of Markov's theorem by Weinberg [23] consisting of the two well-known braid-equivalence moves: conjugation in the braid groups and the `stabilizing' or `Markov' moves (M [...] moves). Our first main result is a one-move Markov theorem which we now state. An L [...] move on a braid consists of cutting one arc of the braid <b>open</b> and <b>splicing</b> into the broken strand new strands {{to the top and}} b [...] ...|$|R

The sustained and (for Méliès) atypically serene scene of a church bell ringing also functions as a symbol, readable as a communal ritual of peace seen through a gently nostalgic lens. Special effects used in the film include stage machinery (for the church bell and the Christmas tree that <b>opens</b> up), substitution <b>splices,</b> and dissolves, which are used partially to help connect adjacent spaces, such as the inside of a church followed by the inside of its bell tower.|$|R
40|$|Controlling RNA <b>splicing</b> <b>opens</b> up {{possibilities}} for the synthetic biologist. The Tetrahymena ribozyme is a model group I self-splicing ribozyme that {{has been shown to}} be useful in synthetic circuits. To create additional splicing ribozymes that can function in synthetic circuits, we generated synthetic ribozyme variants by rationally mutating the Tetrahymena ribozyme. We present an alignment visualization for the ribozyme termed as structure information diagram that is similar to a sequence logo but with alignment data mapped on to secondary structure information. Using the alignment data and known biochemical information about the Tetrahymena ribozyme, we designed synthetic ribozymes with different primary sequences without altering the secondary structure. One synthetic ribozyme with 110 nt mutated retained 12 % splicing efficiency in vivo. The results indicate that our biochemical understanding of the ribozyme is accurate enough to engineer a family of active splicing ribozymes with similar secondary structure but different primary sequences...|$|R
40|$|In eukaryotes, genes {{consist in}} coding {{sequences}} (exons) interspersed with non-coding ones (introns). The regulation of alternative inclusion/exclusion of exons, {{or part of}} exons, during the maturation of the pre-mRNA into mRNA (alternative splicing) allows a dramatic increase of the protein versus the gene repertoire. In a number of cases, alternative splicing decision generates proteins with distinct, sometimes opposite, functions from a given gene. Angiogenesis {{is the process of}} vascularisation in physiological conditions and a series of pathologies, including cancer where it favours tumour progression and dissemination of metastasis. In this issue, we discuss some key examples showing how alternative splicing may induce a switch from anti-angiogenic to pro-angiogenic functions and reciprocally. For some of these splicing events, the molecular mechanisms that trigger alternative splicing toward one or the other direction start to be elucidated. The emergence of strategies enabling to regulate alternative <b>splicing</b> <b>opens</b> new routes for anti-angiogenic therapies. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The HTLV- 1 singly <b>spliced</b> <b>open</b> {{reading frame}} I protein, p 12 I, is highly {{unstable}} {{and appears to}} be necessary for persistent infection in rabbits. Here we demonstrate that p 12 I forms dimers through two putative leucine zipper domains and that its stability is augmented by specific proteasome inhibitors. p 12 I is ubiquitylated, and mutations of its unique carboxy-terminus lysine residue to an arginine greatly enhance its stability. Interestingly, analysis of 53 independent HTLV- 1 strains revealed that the natural p 12 I alleles found in ex vivo samples of tropical spastic paraparesis-HTLV- 1 -associated myelopathy patients contain a Lys at position 88 in some cases, whereas arginine is consistently found at position 88 in HTLV- 1 strains from all adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) cases and healthy carriers studied. This apparent segregation of different alleles in tropical spastic paraparesis-HTLV-associated myelopathy and ATLL or healthy carriers may be relevant in vivo, since p 12 I binds the interleukin- 2 receptor β and γc chains, raising the possibility that the two natural alleles might affect differently the regulation of these molecules...|$|R
40|$|In {{parallel}} to the genetic code for protein synthesis, a second layer of information is embedded in all RNA transcripts {{in the form of}} RNA structure. RNA structure influences practically every step in the gene expression program 1. Yet the nature of most RNA structures or effects of sequence variation on structure are not known. Here we report the initial landscape and variation of RNA secondary structures (RSS) in a human family Trio, providing a comprehensive RSS map of human coding and noncoding RNAs. We identify unique RSS signatures that demarcate <b>open</b> reading frames, <b>splicing</b> junctions, and define authentic microRNA binding sites. Comparison of native deproteinized RNA isolated from cells versus refolded purified RNA suggests {{that the majority of the}} RSS information is encoded within RNA sequence. Over 1900 transcribed single nucleotide variants (~ 15 % of all transcribed SNVs) alter local RNA structure. We discover simple sequence and spacing rules that determine the ability of point mutations to impact RSS. Selective depletion of RiboSNitches versus structurally synonymous variants at precise locations suggests selection for specific RNA shapes at thousands of sites, including 3 ’UTRs, binding sites of miRNAs and RNA binding proteins genome-wide. These results highlight the potentially broa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Objective of any {{industry}} {{is to reduce}} the production and maintenance cost to enhance the quality of product for consumer needs. The production loss due to machine breakdown has made a critical factor in modern industries. Today, with the developments of special purpose and sophisticated machines and equipments will cost more and there downtime is more expensive. Therefore there is a necessity to reduce the cost of production without affecting the quality of the product. Predictive maintenance is a more condition-based maintenance approach which is based on measuring of the equipment condition in order to assess the equipment failure during production. Preventive maintenance is a planned maintenance schedule aimed to prevent breakdowns and failures. The primary goal of preventive maintenance is to prevent the failure of equipment before actually it occurs. Splicing is an important process in tube production. It is the process of joining the tube open ends to form a closed loop. Splicing must be performed as efficiently as possible, since <b>splice</b> <b>open</b> faults contributes major rejections of tube. Hence it required to prevent such tube defects to increase the production of quality tubes. The main objective of this to study breakdown details of splicing processes, equipment reliability, availability, failure rate were calculated based on root causes for the breakdowns using brainstorming technique...|$|R
40|$|Equine {{adenovirus}} 2 (EAdV- 2) {{is one of}} two serotypes {{of adenoviruses}} known to infect equines. Initial studies did not associate EAdV- 2 infections with any specific clinical syndromes, although more recent evidence suggests that EAdV- 2 may be associated with clinical and subclinical gastrointestinal infections of foals and adults respectively. In contrast, Equine adenovirus 1 is well recognised as a pathogen associated with upper respiratory tract infections of horses. In this study the complete genome sequence of EAdV- 2 is reported. As expected, genes common to the adenoviruses were identified. Phylogenetic reconstructions using selected EAdV- 2 genes confirmed the classification of this virus within the Mastadenovirus genus, and supported the hypothesis that EAdV- 2 and EAdV- 1 have evolved from separate lineages within the adenoviruses. One <b>spliced</b> <b>open</b> reading frame was identified that encoded for a polypeptide with high similarity to the pIX and E 1 b_ 55 K adenovirus homologues and was designated pIX_E 1 b_ 55 K. In addition to this fused version of E 1 b_ 55 K, a separate E 1 b_ 55 K encoding gene was also identified. These polypeptides do not appear to have evolved from a gene duplication event as the fused and unfused E 1 b_ 55 K were most similar to E 1 b_ 55 K homologues from the Atadenovirus and Mastadenovirus genera respectively. The {{results of this study suggest}} that EAdV- 2 has an unusual evolutionary history that warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the identification of}} a murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) G protein-coupled receptor (GCR) homolog. This open reading frame (M 33) is most closely related to, and collinear with, human cytomegalovirus UL 33, and homologs are also present in human herpesvirus 6 and 7 (U 12 for both viruses). Conserved counterparts in the sequenced alpha- or gammaherpesviruses have not been identified to date, suggesting that these genes encode proteins which are important for the biological characteristics of betaherpesviruses. We have detected transcripts for both UL 33 and M 33 as early as 3 or 4 h postinfection, and these reappear at late times. In addition, we have identified N-terminal splicing for both the UL 33 and M 33 RNA transcripts. For both <b>open</b> reading frames, <b>splicing</b> results in the introduction of amino acids which are highly conserved among known GCRs. To characterise {{the function of the}} M 33 in the natural host, two independent MCMV recombinant viruses were prepared, each of which possesses an M 33 open reading frame which has been disrupted with the beta-galactosidase gene. While the recombinant M 33 null viruses showed no phenotypic differences in replication from wild-type MCMV in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts in vitro, they showed severely restricted growth in the salivary glands of infected mice. These data suggest that M 33 {{plays an important role in}} vivo, in particular in the dissemination to or replication in the salivary gland, and provide the first evidence for the function of a viral GCR homolog in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Mutations in the cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 gene (CDKL 5) {{have been}} {{described}} in girls with Rett-like features and early-onset epileptic encephalopathy including infantile spasms. To date, with more than 80 reported cases, the phenotype of CDKL 5 -related encephalopathy is better defined. The main features consist of early-onset seizures starting before 5 months of age, severe mental retardation with absent speech and Rett-like features such as hand stereotypies and deceleration of head growth. On the other hand, neuro-vegetative signs and developmental regression are rare in CDKL 5 mutation patients. The CDKL 5 gene encodes a serine threonine kinase protein which {{is characterized by a}} catalytic domain and a long C-terminal extension involved in the regulation of the catalytic activity of CDKL 5 and in the sub-nuclear localization of the protein. To our knowledge, more than 70 different point mutations {{have been described}} including missense mutations within the catalytic domain, nonsense mutations causing the premature termination of the protein distributed in the entire <b>open</b> reading frame, <b>splice</b> variants, and frameshift mutations. Additionally, CDKL 5 mutations have recently been described in 7 males with a more severe epileptic encephalopathy and a worse outcome compared to female patients. Finally, about 23 male and female patients have been identified with gross rearrangements encompassing {{all or part of the}} CDKL 5 gene, with a phenotype reminiscent of CDKL 5 -related encephalopathy combined with dysmorphic features. Even if recent data clearly indicate that CDKL 5 plays an important role in brain function, the protein remains largely uncharacterized. Phenotype-genotype correlation is additionally hampered by the relatively small number of patients described...|$|R
40|$|Arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs) {{catalyse}} the N-acetylation of arylamines, arylhydroxylamines and arylhydrazines {{with the}} acetyl group being transferred from acetylCoenzyme A. As {{a result of}} many recent advances in NAT research {{there have been many}} recent reviews and the present paper gives a flavour of the excitement in the field. The NATs, which are cytosolic, were early examples of pharmacogenetic variation. Polymorphism in isoniazid inactivation resulting in slow acetylation was subsequently found to be due to SNPs in the gene encoding the human isoenzyme NAT 2. There are two polymorphic genes (NAT 1 and NAT 2) encoded with a third pseudogene (NATP) at human 8 p 21. 3. The gene structure of NAT 1 and NAT 2, with a single (NAT 2) or multiple (NAT 1) distant non-coding exons showing tissue specific <b>splicing,</b> <b>opens</b> possibilities for effects of polymorphisms outside the single coding exon. In humans, the substrate specificities of NAT 1 and NAT 2 are overlapping but distinct. The NAT 2 isoenzyme, predominantly in liver and gut, acetylates sulphamethazine and arylhydrazine compounds. Slow acetylators are at increased risk of toxicity, e. g. isoniazid induced neurotoxicity and hydralazine-induced lupus. The human NAT 1 isoenzyme is also polymorphic. It is expressed in many tissues, particularly in oestrogen receptor positive breast cancers. Human NAT 1 has an endogenous role in acetylation of a folate catabolite with in vivo evidence from transgenic mice lacking the equivalent gene. For nomenclature see [URL] the website maintained by David Hein. NAT homologues have been identified by bioinformatics analyses in zebrafish and these sequences are described, although the proteins have not yet been characterized. The first NAT crystallographic structure from Salmonella typhimurium identified the mechanism of acetyl transfer via a catalytic triad of Cys, His and Asp residues each essential for activity in all NATs. NATs from mycobacteria aided in identifying the substrate binding site and the acetylCoA binding pocket. Studies on the eukaryotic enzymes by NMR and crystallography have facilitated understanding substrate specificities of human NAT 1 (5 -aminosalicylate and p-aminobenzoic acid) and human NAT 2 (sulphamethazine). The effect of "slow acetylator" SNPs in the coding region predominantly act through creating unstable protein that aggregates intracellularly prior to ubiquitination and degradation...|$|R
