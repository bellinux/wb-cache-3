Moreover, trajectories and streamlines coincide in steady-state conditions, and the pairs of adjectives tangential/normal and streamwise/cross-stream become interchangeable. An atmospheric flow in which the tangential acceleration is not negligible is called allisobaric.|$|E

In another study, taurine intake was estimated to be generally less than 200mg/day, even in individuals eating a high-meat diet. According to another study, taurine consumption was estimated to vary between 40 and 400mg/day.|$|E

25|$|Since 2000 {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} has undertaken an international media and lobbying campaign to promote nuclear power {{as a solution to}} the greenhouse effect and climate change. Nuclear power, the industry says, emits no <b>or</b> <b>negligible</b> amounts of carbon dioxide. Anti-nuclear groups respond by saying that only reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide emissions. All other stages of the nuclear fuel chain – mining, milling, transport, fuel fabrication, enrichment, reactor construction, decommissioning and waste management – use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|The most {{apparent}} distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) {{is a history}} of alcohol use or abuse. Thus, in patients who have no <b>or</b> <b>negligible</b> alcohol use, the diagnosis is unlikely to be alcoholic hepatitis. However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis especially if there is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.|$|E

25|$|Spironolactone and its {{metabolite}} canrenone {{are highly}} plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. Spironolactone is bound equivalently to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein, while canrenone is bound only to albumin. Spironolactone and its metabolite 7α-thiospironolactone show very low <b>or</b> <b>negligible</b> affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In accordance, {{a study of}} high-dosage spironolactone treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), suggesting that spironolactone does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins. This is in contradiction with widespread statements that spironolactone increases free estradiol levels by displacing estradiol from SHBG.|$|E
25|$|As {{the column}} rises into less dense {{surrounding}} air, {{it will eventually}} reach an altitude where the hot, rising air is of the same density as the surrounding cooler air. In this neutral buoyancy region, the erupted material will then no longer rise through convection, but solely through any upward momentum which it has. This is called the umbrella region, and is usually marked by the column spreading out sideways. The eruptive material and the surrounding cool air has the same density {{at the base of}} the umbrella region, and the top is marked by the maximum height which momentum carries the material upward. Because the speeds are very low <b>or</b> <b>negligible</b> in this region it is often distorted by stratospheric winds.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{propellant}} is ignited, {{the higher}} pressure gases are bled out through vents (or ports) at reduced pressure {{to a much}} larger low pressure chamber to push the projectile forward. With the High-Low System a weapon can be designed with reduced <b>or</b> <b>negligible</b> recoil. [...] The High-Low System also allows {{the weight of the}} weapon and its ammunition to be significantly reduced. Manufacturing cost and production time are drastically lower than for standard cannon or other small-arm weapon systems firing a projectile of the same size and weight. It has a far more efficient use of the propellant, unlike earlier recoilless weapons, where most of the propellant is expended {{to the rear of the}} weapon to counter the recoil of the projectile being fired.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011 an IOM {{committee}} {{concluded a}} serum 25(OH)D level of 20ng/ml (50nmol/L) {{is needed for}} bone and overall health. The dietary reference intakes for vitamin D are chosen with a margin of safety and 'overshoot' the targeted serum value to ensure the specified levels of intake achieve the desired serum 25(OH)D levels in almost all persons. No contributions to serum 25(OH)D level are assumed from sun exposure and the recommendations are fully applicable to people with dark skin <b>or</b> <b>negligible</b> exposure to sunlight. The Institute found serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 30ng/ml (75nmol/L) are [...] "not consistently associated with increased benefit". Serum 25(OH)D levels above 50ng/ml (125nmol/L) may be cause for concern. However, some people with serum 25(OH)D between 30 and 50ng/ml (75nmol/L-125nmol/L) will also have inadequate vitamin D.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to two of}} his students, what marked out all of Caird's {{work was}} an erudite, crisp writing style, a wry humour, {{and an ability to}} turn old {{questions}} on their heads by posing them in new and memorable ways. [...] "Combining a penetrative knowledge of both Testaments with a rare fastidiousness with words, Caird analysed his texts in a way which for many set a new standard for the field. These traits, coupled with a fertility of imagination and an almost poetic approach to complex theological issues, produced a potent brew which any who took even a small draught were not likely to forget"." [...] His literary ability was outstanding [...] [...] [...] his clear, crisp sentences say more in a few words than some scholars manage in several pages. A slim volume from Caird, easily mistaken for a slight <b>or</b> <b>negligible</b> work, is likely to be an explosive charge, packed with pithy wisdom".|$|E
2500|$|Roman {{beliefs about}} an afterlife varied, and are known mostly for the educated elite who {{expressed}} their views {{in terms of}} their chosen philosophy. The traditional care of the dead, however, and the perpetuation after death of their status in life were part of the most archaic practices of Roman religion. Ancient votive deposits to the noble dead of Latium and Rome suggest elaborate and costly funeral offerings and banquets in the company of the deceased, an expectation of afterlife and their association with the gods. As Roman society developed, its Republican nobility tended to invest less in spectacular funerals and extravagant housing for their dead, and more on monumental endowments to the community, such as the donation of a temple or public building whose donor was commemorated by his statue and inscribed name.
