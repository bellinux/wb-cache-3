UNRET explores schedules in decreasing order of resource usage. For each theoretical resource usage, both the unrolling degree of the loop (K) and the initiation interval of the schedule (II) are analitically computed by using new and effective methods. Next, the loop is unrolled K times and data dependences are successively retimed {{in order to find}} a valid schedule with II cycles. The effectiveness of UNRET has been proven by presenting results on different benchmarks.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were to {{determine}} the relative amplitudes of intragastric motor responses evoked by different vagal branches and to establish whether the effects of acute or chronic vagotomy could be predicted from these data. Intragastric pressure responses to electrical stimulation of the vagus were measured in urethane-anaesthetised ferrets and acute or chronic vagotomies were performed. The results show that the left and right cervical vagi were equipotential and fully <b>overlaped</b> each other. Their contributions to the dorsal trunk were equipotential and fully overlapping and so were their contributions to the ventral trunk. The dorsal trunk was more effective than the ventral trunk and there was total functional overlap between these two trunks. Vagal evoked gastric motor responses of the ferret are apparently organised in a different way from vagally induced acid secretion or hormone release in the cat. Acute removal of a trunk led to a reduction in evoked responses that was not linear function of the effect of stimulation of that trunk. In contrast, chronic removal caused a relative increase in evoked responses that ws inversely related to the decrease caused by acute removal. The implications of total functional overlap and neuromuscular reorganisation after chronic vagotomy are discussed...|$|R

A total of 1, 024 respondents were recruited during 2003 and 2004. A number of phenotypic measurements were made for each respondent, supplemented with the genealogical information and genotypes (microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNP). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 48 % using ATP III definition (38 % for men and 56 % for women), and 58 % using IDF definition (46 % for men and 66 % for women). Age-standardised prevalence using ATP III was 33 % (26 % for men and 40 % for women), while IDF definition yielded the age-standardised prevalence of 42 % (33 % for men and 50 % for women). Definitions <b>overlaped</b> in 86 % of all cases. While bivariate analysis revealed numerous associations, mixed model results yielded significant association of metabolic syndrome with age, gender, HOMA index, insulin, tPA, uric acid, fibrinogen and cortisol. Individual genome-wide heterozygosity was inversely associated with the metabolic syndrome odds. Metabolic syndrome heritability was 34 % when ATP III definition was used, and 43 % for IDF definition, but environmental contribution to the metabolic syndrome variance was higher; percent of explained variance was 51 % for ATP III and 56 % for IDF definition. Genome-wide analysis implied four SNPs, two of which were significantly associated with metabolic syndrome in the logistic regression model (rs 3881953 was also associated with waist circumference, and rs 10511595 was associated with serum glucose level).

In this paper the overall pattern of response to L-T 4 replacement therapy was studied {{in a group of}} 19 children with CH diagnosed by neonatal screening (10 with hypoplastic/aplastic thyroid disease, group H/A, 9 with gland ectopy, group E) who were followed-up for 60 +/- 27 months (mean perpendicular-to SD). With 1 exception serum T 4 at diagnosis was > 2 -mu-g/dl in children of group E and normal (> 0. 5 - 5 -mu-U/ml) > elevated TSH (> 5 -mu-U/ml). TSH levels less-than-or-equal-to 5 -mu-U/ml) were associated with FT 4 values in the upper half of the normal range (54 % of observations) or even higher (46 %). Elevation of serum FT 4 alone with FT 3 values in the normal range did not result in clinical thyrotoxicosis, alteration of growth or premature craniosynostosis. Mean L-T 4 doses (mu-g/kg BW/day) administered to CH children were: 7. 0 +/- 1. 6 between 1 and 6 months; 5. 2 +/- 0. 9 between 6 and 12 months; 4. 0 +/- 0. 6 between 1 e 5 yr; 3. 4 +/- 0. 6 over 6 yr. In general, the mean L-T 4 doses given to children showing low, normal or elevated TSH were widely <b>overlaped.</b> Growth in weight and height was normal, no significant difference being observed in children of group H/A vs. those of group E. Mental development was within the normal range, but at age 12 months children in group H/A had significantly lower DQ scores than those in group E, and at age 3 yr both groups of CH children had significantly lower IQ scores than unaffected controls. In conclusion: i) in children with CH serum TSH can be suppressed to normal or even subnormal concentrations provided that enough L-T 4 is given to maintain FT 4 in the upper half of the normal range or slightly higher; ii) sporadic elevations of TSH during treatment could be attributed to: failure to reassess the dose of L-T 4 followingthe infant's rapid gain in weight, lack of compliance, malabsorption of the drug, misunderstanding of prescription; iii) neuropsychological development was within the normal range of tests; however, the absence of functioning thyroid tissue, as shown by low T 4 at diagnosis and by negative radioisotope imaging, was a risk factor for lower mental scores...|$|R

40|$|The {{transcription}} factor engrailed 1 (En 1) {{is essential in}} mdDA neuron maintenance, both during embryonic development and adulthood. The overall aims of this thesis were to unravel the function of En 1, at a molecular level, in mdDA neuron development and to determine its relationship to canonical Wnt signalling during the specification of these neurons. We have disclosed the downstream cascades of En 1 both in a dopaminergic cell line and in vivo (in the midbrain). The analysis of these data provides evidence that En 1 is crucial for the induction of dopaminergic identity in mdDA neurons, {{being involved in the}} regulation of key mdDA genes, like Th, Aadc and Ahd 2. Furthermore, we have unravelled the mechanism behind this regulation: En 1 might be part of the Nurr 1 transcriptional complex. We describe the interaction between En 1 and the Nurr 1 co-repressor Psf. Moreover, we show that En 1 uses the same transcriptional mechanism in vivo as Nurr 1 does on the Th promoter – i. e., En 1 requires the release of HDAC-mediated repression for Th transcription to occur. These data suggest that En 1 might be part of the Nurr 1 transcriptional complex driving mdDA neuron specification. Wnt signaling is critical for proper brain development, including the mdDA system. However, it was not clear whether its activity <b>overlaped</b> with mdDA differentiation in later stages of midbrain development. We address this problem and demonstrate that canonical Wnt signaling is active in the midbrain mainly in the progenitor- and Nurr 1 -expression domains, while its activity is substantially reduced as development progresses. In addition, considering the known interaction between En 1 and Wnt signaling in early development, we investigated whether En 1 and canonical Wnt signalling might interact during mdDA neuron specification. We show that, around this developmental stage, the En 1 mutant midbrain presents reduced ?-catenin activity, implicating En 1 as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling. Furthermore, En 1 and Nurr 1 both interact with ?-catenin in vivo, leading to the hypothesis that ?-catenin, Nurr 1 and En 1 might be in a complex which could play a relevant role in early mdDA differentiation. Overall, our data contribute considerably to {{a deeper understanding of the}} mdDA system development, especially on how terminal differentiation in mdDA neurons is induced. Hopefully this knowledge will contribute to future improvement of cell replacement therapy in PD, whereby the specific differentiation of a stem cell into a DA neuronal phenotype is accomplished...|$|R

Çalışmada öncelikli olarak distopyanın yararlandığı anlatılar incelenmiştir. Bu anlatılara bakılırken, distopyanın bilimkurgu ile kurduğu ilişkiden yararlanılmıştır. Distopyanın doğuşunda önemli bir rol oynayan bilimkurgu, distopyanın daha iyi anlaşılabilmesi ve distopya bilimkurgu arasındaki farkın vurgulanabilmesi için tezde bilimkurgu tarihini bu bağlamda incelenmiştir. Distopyanın edebiyat ve sinemada içerisindeki var oluşu, bilimkurgu tarihinin sürekliliği içerisinde değerlendirilmiştir. Bu bağlamda ilk olarak bilimkurgu edebiyatının ve distopya edebiyatının tarihsel gelişim süreçlerine bakılmıştır. Edebiyat ile kurulan ilişki, distopyanın sinema ile buluşmasındaki ilk basamaktır.

Tez çalışmasında, distopyanın mekan ile olan birlikteliği göz önünde bulundurularak, distopik filmler üzerinden bir mekan okuması yapılır. Mekan okumasının yapıldığı distopik filmler seçilirken, bilimkurgu sineması tarihi içersindeki kırılmalara bakılmıştır. Seçilen filmlerin deşifresi, distopyanın temel bileşenleri olarak ele alınan, zaman ve mekan kavramları üzerinden yapılmıştır. Filmlerin deşifresinin sonucunda, bu bileşenleri oluşturan mekansal elemanlar belirlenmiştir. Bu sayede distopik mekan kurgusu tariflenmiştir. Tezin ikinci bölümünde, tariflenen bu kurgu ve distopik mekanı oluşturan bileşenlerden yola çıkılarak, kentsel bir okuma yapılmıştır. Bu kentsel okuma için belirlenen saha çalışması Taksim - Maslak aksı üzerinde gerçekleştirilir. Çalışmada aks üzerinde yer alan yapıların, kent ve özne ile olan ilişkileri incelenmiştir. Yapılan incelemelerle kentte var olan distopik mekanlar, bileşenleri doğrultusunda deşifre edilip, sınıflandırılmıştır. Bu çalışma sonucunda, İstanbul kentindeki kimi distopik mekanlar açığa çıkarılmış ve kentin distopik kurgusuna dair bir kesit sunulmuştur. The {{relationship}} between dystopia and architecture {{is the main}} motivation of the thesis. Crtitizing the daily situations through a future fiction makes dystopia didactic and critizing. This critical way of thinking in dystopia mostly express its foresight in literature and cinema. Especially throught cinema dystopia makes such critics by using space. Dystopia literaly means bad place. It warns humans by creating a future fiction. Those fictions show the worst and the most desperate conditions of human life. Each dystopia is didactic for society through a future threatment. Instead of showing the future dystopia defines more its own term. It is a brutal critic of a daily life. It aims to show the default {{of the system and}} people to be aware. As a reason of that reading cities through dystopia could help us to criticize space and could bring an alternative way of thinking in architectural field. Nowadays daily life of cities are under control of capitalism. Capitalism as a system gets its power from consumption. Consumption could stay alive by production. More production means more consumption which makes capitalism stronger. As a reason of that we could say speed is the most important tool of the capitalist system. Therefore technology which increases the speed, is the best supporter of capitalism. Since technology got in our daily lifes, cityscapes and architectural presentations started to change. New architectural presentations bring us a new perception of space and a new dimensions. Cityscapes change faster by technology. Those demolitions are not letting subject to have a {{relationship between}} cities. This situation starts to make subject to lose its role in cities. The thesis aims to read dytopian spaces in İstanbul and analyse the effects of the system in urban space and urban life. As a reason of that first of all, the dystopian presentations were examined in this work. The relationship between dystopia and science fiction was disgussed while looking at those dystopian work. To understand better the difference between science fiction and dystopia, and also to understand how dystopia exists, science fiction was also examined in this study. The existence of dystopia was disgussed through the history of science fiction literature and cinema. In this case first this study looks at the development of dystopian literature throught history of science fiction literature. Because literature is the first steps which connects dystopia to cinema. On the other hand literature is the first presentation of the dystopia that is why to understand better the dystopian concept, literature used as a first step. In the next part the existence of dystopia in cinema was examined. Because of creating a strong connection between dystopia and architecture, cinema has a very important place. The critics of dystopia is mostly projected by space because space is the most important tool of dystopia while telling the problems of daily life. Because of having this relationship between space and dystopia in cinema, this study reads spaces throught dystopian movies. The main item which effect choosing the dystopian movies in thesis is the breaking points in history of science fiction movies. As a result of this attitude the dystopian movies were selected. After this selection space in those dytopian movies which are Metropolis (1927), Things to Come (1936), Fahrenheit 451 (1966), Clockwork Orange (1971), Blade Runner (1982), 1984 (1984), Brazil (1985) and La Antena (2007) were analysed. According to that the main components of dystopian movies are time and space. That’s why those movies were examined through time and space. This study gives the elements which creates the dystopian space. The first component of dystopian movies “space” defined as grotesque space in this study. To understand better the concept of grotesque, first the development of grotesque is examined. This examination shows how grotesque was transformed from being a figurative presentation to space. In this case, Robert Wilson’s art works which are the first examples of grotesque space, are analysed to define the space better. Later on those tools which Robert Wilson uses, are searched in dystopian movies. At the end of analysing eight choosen dystopian movies, different elements are found to create grotesque space. Those physical elements are used to build up the cinematographic atmosphere in the movies. However those tools also produce a new perception of space. By the datas while analysing dystopian movies this relationship between subject and space is also examined. All those datas classified in a scheme as a dystopian city guide. The second component of dystopian movies “time” defined as retro future in this study. Time in dystopian fiction has a multi layered structure. The dialectic juxtaposition of future and primitive forms in space, breaks the chronology of time. Time doesn’t run in a linear order of past present and future. The course of the movie combines each seperated element of time and creates a new form. This is offers a phenomological blury to time which defined as retro future. Retro future occurs the main fiction of dystopia and helps to build a grotesque space. The elements of space which makes time vague is examined and classified {{at the end of this}} part. The classification also consist of the perception of subject. Those datas which creates retro future are summed up in a scheme to use as a dystopian city guide. In the second part of the thesis, Istanbul as a city was read by the definition of dystopian space and by the element of it. For this case study the area which is selected is the axis between Taksim and Maslak. This axis is also a kind of chronological development of Istanbul. The deconstruction of the city starts from Taksim and the historical process continues on this present axis. That’s why this axis has multi layers. Those layers <b>overlaped</b> and creates phenomenological spaces. This case study also decompose them to analyse and recombine them as a dystopian fiction. The elements which creates the dystopian space used as a filter while doing this study. The physical elements of space are used to find the dystopian spaces in this axis. The effects of dystopian spaces on subject examined through those datas in the city. The varibles of city depend on the dystopian space and the constant datas <b>overlaped.</b> This superposition shows the “how dystopian spaces could exists in daily life?” This case study creates a dystopian mapping of the choosen axis. Analysing the city through dystopia creates a dystopian fiction of Istanbul. On the other hand it shows dystopia is not a future projection or just a fiction. Dystopia is inside the space and each city contains its own dystopia. In this sense it claims that searching for dystopian spaces in cities and analysing them would raise awareness of the people. Capitalist cities makes buildings to loose their identy. This occurs a gap between the subject and perception of space in urban space. This study aims to shows those gaps by analysing the dynamics of dystopian space. To solve the problem of nowadays daily life in cities, the fisrt step is defining them. Lack of relationship betwen space and subject makes collective memory faded. However by showing the default of this connection could prevent collective memory from being lost. In this sense dystopia by its nature offers to show the problems of daily life of its term and warn people for future threats. If we read the didactics of dystopia through space and urban space, it could shows us the dynamics and critics of daily life. However dystopia is not prevision, it is an actual analyse. This analyse in the study is taken as a section of a city. It could diversify, recreate or overlap. The different and new relations of the dystopian city readings could offer new way of thinking in design process while raising the awareness of the subject. Considering all those reasons dystopia as a concept is a very helpful for architecture. This study claims that dystopian way of reading spaces could create a new desinging process, a new perceptions of space and a reproduction of space. This is possible by analysing the daily life of cities and finding the gaps in urbans spaces because each space include its own dystopia. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 İnşaat mühendisliği açısından düzenli bir taşıyıcı sistem her zaman arzu edilse de genellikle mimari kaygılar vb. nedenlerle uygulamada düzensiz taşıyıcı sistemlere sık sık rastlanmaktadır. Taşıyıcı sistem düzensizlikleri, yönetmelikler tarafından sınırlandırılmış ve düzensiz binalar için oluşabilecek olumsuzlukların etkisini azaltmak için birtakım yaptırımlar getirilmiştir. Bu düzensizliklerin taşıyıcı sistem üzerindeki olumsuz etkisini araştırmak amacıyla DBYBHY 2007 ’nin düşey doğrultuda düzensizlik durumları arasında gösterdiği ve uygulanmasına izin vermediği, kolonların konsol kirişlere oturtulması durumu sunulan bu çalışmada karşılaştırmalı olarak incelenmiştir. Bu incelemede, konsola kolon oturan çerçeve türünden düzensiz bir taşıyıcı sistem ile konsol kirişleri olan düzenli bir çerçeve, son yıllarda sıkça dile getirilen performansa dayalı tasarımın temelini oluşturan doğrusal olmayan hesap yöntemlerinden statik itme analizi ve zaman tanım alanında hesap yöntemi kullanılarak irdelenmiş ve analiz sonuçları karşılaştırılmıştır. Zaman tanım alanında hesap yönteminde kullanılacak olan üç adet deprem kaydı ilgili zemin sınıfı dikkate alınarak oluşturulan tasarım spektrumuna göre benzeştirilmiştir. Sunulan bu çalışmada statik itme analizi ile zaman tanım alanında doğrusal olmayan analiz sonuçları da karşılaştırılmıştır. Ayrıca düşey doğrultuda düzensiz olan taşıyıcı sistem için zemin kat yüksekliği bir parametre olarak belirlenmiş ve zemin kat yüksekliği değiştirilerek bunun doğrusal elastik olmayan analiz sonuçlarına etkisi incelenmiştir. Bu çalışma neticesinde, düşey doğrultuda düzensiz olan taşıyıcı sistemin yatay yük kapasitesinde, düzenli yapıya kıyasla ciddi bir azalma olduğu gözlenmiştir. Taşıyıcı sistemde eleman esas alınarak yapılan değerlendirmeler sonucunda düzensiz taşıyıcı sistemde daha büyük elastik ötesi şekil değiştirmelere talep oluştuğu görülmüştür. Ayrıca düzensiz taşıyıcı sistemde karşılaştırma kriteri olan zemin kat yüksekliği arttıkça deprem tarafından talep edilen tepe yer değiştirmesi artarken taşıyıcı sistemin yatay yük kapasitesinde önemli azalma tespit edilmiştir. When a seismic ground motion occurs, {{the most}} {{important}} factor of serious damages and destructions in building is not obey the rules of current codes. Selecting a suitable carrier system at the architectural project is one of {{the most important}} tasks of engineers. To create a good carrier system is also required to have a good architectural project. Because of mistakes in building structural system, the use of the unsuitable material for the Project, poor workmanship and inadequate controls when building under construction, it is not difficult to guess our existing buildings will not show the desired performance under earthquake force. Analysis of the natural disasters that occured over the world, earthquakes cause losses of lives and property. It is {{the most important factor}} of large losses of life and property that structures built by people not has sufficient strenght to offer adequate protection againts earthquakes. Even if time and place of an earthquake is known in advance by the latest technological developments in the near future, earthquake resistant design of our buildings is required. And also thanks to the advances made in the field of civil engineering works building behaviors will interpret better and more realistic solutions will be created. The codes of earthquake is the most significant resource that can be used to build an earthquake – resistant building. According to their geographical location, their geological and sesimic characteristics that apply within the territory and local ground conditions, countries prepare regulations that includes the rules which must be followed during building design. For this purpose, The Ministry of Public works and settlement in Turkey prepare The Regulations of Buildings that will be built in Seismic Zone 2007. Seismic loads generate the most inconvenient internal forces of the structural elements. There are different methods of calculating the force of earthquakes affecting on buildings. These are called seismic load calculation methods. After determining the essential one of the methods for our system, the force of earthquakes and its distribution over structural elements must be calculated in the way the chosen method requires. Determining the suitable methods for structures are given in Turkish seismic code. Three alternative seismic load calculation methods are presented by the seismic code. “Equivalent Seismic Load Method”, “Modal Superposition Method”, and Time Increment Methods” are indicated for seismic load calculations in our seismic code. Equivalent Seismic Load Method is a widespread seismic load calculation method and it can be found in many seismic codes in the world. In Mode Superposition Method, the maximum internal forces and displacements are obtained by the calculation of the maximum contributions of each adequate vibration modes that combined statisticly. In Tıme Increment Methods, in order to investigate the structural behavior of the building under seismic loading, an earthquake is assigned to the building as lateral load and the time history analysis is carried out. To take place within the framework of the principles of earthquake – resistant design the loads on the structure should be transferred from slabs to beams, from beams to columns, from columns to foundation by the shortest path. Consequently slabs should be seated to beams, it should be pay attention to beams are continuous, two sides of beams should be supported, columns should be seated to columns, column axes and beams axes should be <b>overlaped</b> and it is prevented the vertical discontinuity. Among all important factors that affect the behavior of the earthquake, it is also important that structural system is whether regular or irregular. Due to irregularities in the structural system, forces that may entangle in structure can’t be transferred in structure to foundation in short path and will be cause poor regions on the system. A large number of existing buildings in Turkey and other countries, built according to design codes of the 70 s and 90 s shows that many of them behave poorly and have insufficient seismic safety. Importance of determination of earthquake performance of existing structures which is constructed using linear elastic method has improved. In addition to that, retrofit of unsafe structures is another subject which becomes a trend all around the world. This case contributed to the emergence of displacement – based design criteria. Because of preferring Non-linear analysis methods in the thesis, to handle more realistic behavior of the structure and analysis the developments in the field of civil engineering. In Civil Engineering, the arrangement of regular structural system is important; actually in practice, it is not possible due to some problems like architectural concerns etc. Structural system irregularities are limited by codes and some rules are set to minimize the negative effects on behavior of buildings which have irregular structural system. In this study it is examined comparatively the negative impact of these irregularities on the structural system that nonsitting the cantilever beams to columns due to “DBYBHY 2007 ” in the vertical direction shown by the cases of irregularity and does not allow the application of these columns. And also two types of structural systems those irregular frameworks which columns supporting on cantilevers and regular frameworks which have cantilever beams are compared after examining and analyzing with the methods that static pushover analysis and time history analysis which form the basis of performance based design, mentioned frequently in recent years. The static pushover analysis is becoming a popular methods for seismic performance evaluation of existing and new structures. The expectation is that the pushover analysis will provide adequate information on seismic demands imposed by the design ground motion on the structural system. Time history analysis is another seismic calculation method for existing and new structures in our seismic code. The method makes use of earthquakes acceleration – time records that occured previously or similar artificial records which constituted. In the thesis, three earthquake records which will be used in time history analysis simulated to design spectrum as taking notice of related soil class. In the present study, the static pushover analysis and non-linear time history analysis results are compared. Furthermore, the ground floor height defined as a parameter for irregular structural system in the vertical direction and by changing the height of ground floor height, the effect of linear, inelastic analyze results are investigated. According to this study, the decrease of horizontal load capacity is observed when the building have irregular structural systems which in vertical direction in comparison regular structural system. In a structural system, as a result of the evaluations bases on the element, it is seen that an irregular system needs more inelastic deformations. Besides, it is determined when the ground floor height – the comparison parameter of irregular structural system – rises; it is observed that a significant decrease in horizontal load capacity while an increase the peak displacement that demanded by earthquake.
