It instructed the IEC to construct several new power stations and encouraged private investment in the generation sector. By 2015, the IEC's share of total nationwide installed electric generation capacity had fallen to about 75%, with the company then possessing an installed generation capacity of about 13.6 gigawatts (GW). Since 2010, Independent Power Producers have constructed three new gas-fired combined cycle power stations with a total generation capacity of about 2.2 GW, while various industrial concerns constructed <b>on-premises</b> cogeneration facilities with a total electricity output of about 1 GW, and which are licensed by the electric authority to sell surplus electricity to the national grid at competitive rates.

40|$|Abstract—The hosting {{of large}} <b>on-premise</b> {{computational}} resources is common practice. Cloud Computing offers a promising, alternative infrastructure for using scalable on-demand off-premise resources. However, outsourcing whole applications {{is not a}} cost optimal solution in some scenarios, because the already existing <b>on-premise</b> resources are not considered. A flexible integration of additional resources from the cloud to compensate a shortage of suitable <b>on-premise</b> resources is a tradeoff between costs and efficiency. This paper provides a light-weight approach that focuses on seamlessly enabling cloud resources for workflow-based applications without requiring installing a rather complex software stack. The approach is evaluated by running an example workflow. Keywords-cloud economics; dynamic resource allocation; cloud computing; cross-cloud workflows; on-demand computing model; service oriented architecture; workflow; workflow orchestration. I...|$|R

These systems are usually set up as <b>on-premise</b> systems, usually as a part of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in large organizations. Latest developments in the cloud technology field has enabled Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) - or cloud-based HR systems, and their usage is proving to be a viable alternative to <b>on-premise</b> HR systems. Organizations are motivated to move their HR systems to cloud in order to benefit from new technology, reduce IT costs and standardize their HR processes. In-cloud HR systems differ from <b>on-premise</b> systems in many aspects including their implementation methodology, costs involved, the IT and HR skills needed to implement and maintain these systems...|$|R

50|$|With <b>on-premises</b> software, the {{customer}} manages and purchases the application. <b>On-premises</b> software has some advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage of <b>on-premises</b> is the higher {{cost of the}} software, along with maintenance. Customization is also needed for some who use additional processes outside of the normal {{out of the box}} solution. Time is also a factor. Many <b>on-premises</b> software implementations take longer - along with numerous testing and training sessions. The overall advantage of <b>on-premises</b> software relates to overall return on investment. Using the application for three to five years becomes more cost-effective. Another advantage may depend on the amount of data. With on-demand, certain volume restrictions hold, but with <b>on-premises,</b> data restrictions are based on the storage size of local hardware.|$|E
