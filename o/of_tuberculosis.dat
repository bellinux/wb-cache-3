5|$|The M. {{tuberculosis}} complex (MTBC) {{includes four}} other TB-causing mycobacteria: M. bovis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. microti. M. africanum is not widespread, {{but it is}} a significant cause <b>of</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in parts of Africa. M. bovis was once a common cause <b>of</b> <b>tuberculosis,</b> but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare and seems to be limited to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E

40|$|Mycobacterium <b>tuberculosis,</b> {{the agent}} <b>of</b> human <b>tuberculosis</b> has {{developed}} different virulence mechanisms and virulence-associated tools during its evolution {{to survive and}} multiply inside the host.

Through the construction and use <b>of</b> an M. <b>tuberculosis</b> H 37 Rv PLC-null mutant (ΔPLC) and control strains, we found that PLCs <b>of</b> M. <b>tuberculosis</b> were not required for induction of phagosomal rupture and only showed marginal, if any, impact on virulence <b>of</b> M. <b>tuberculosis</b> in the cellular and mouse infection models used in this study. In contrast, we found that PLC-encoding genes were strongly upregulated under phosphate starvation and that PLC-proficient M. tuberculosis strains survived better than ΔPLC mutants under conditions where phosphatidylcholine served as sole phosphate source, opening new perspectives for studies on the role of PLCs in the lifecycle <b>of</b> M. <b>tuberculosis...</b>|$|R
