25|$|Furthermore, recent {{immigrants}} to Taiwan from Mainland China, mostly from marriages and undocumented migrants, {{are not considered}} waishengren, but make up a separate social category. Although the numbers <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> thought of as small and insignificant by most Taiwanese, it has been pointed out that {{recent immigrants}} from Mainland China and their children actually make up a larger population in Taiwan than Taiwanese aborigines.|$|E
25|$|Embrun is {{a bedroom}} community: a {{majority}} of the population works in nearby Ottawa and commutes into the city on a daily basis. A large proportion <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> people with post-secondary education who work in the Canadian civil service or Ottawa's large high-tech sector. This has been the case since the mid-20th century. Prior to then, agriculture employed the majority of the community's population.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia {{has one of}} the world's largest {{overseas}} Indian {{and overseas}} Chinese populations. Most Indians migrated to Malaysia as plantation labourers under British rule. They are a significant minority ethnic group, making up 8% of the Malaysian population. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> Tamil-speaking. They have retained their languages and religion — 88% of ethnic Indians in Malaysia identify as Hindus. A minority number of the population are Sikhs and Muslims.|$|E

25|$|Many Israeli Jews {{emigrated to}} the United States {{throughout}} {{the period of the}} declaration of the state of Israel and until today. Today, the descendants <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> known as Israeli-Americans. The 2000 Census counted 106,839 Israeli Americans. It is estimated that 400,000–800,000 Israeli Jews have immigrated to the United States since the 1950s, though this number remains a contested figure, since many Israelis are originally from other countries and may list their origin countries when arriving in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery County, {{north of}} Houston, is a Republican stronghold, {{supported}} by voters in affluent communities on Lake Conroe and in The Woodlands. Rural {{residents of the}} county, though primarily lower- and middle-class, {{tend to be very}} socially conservative and also have a substantial Republican following. However, the city of Conroe proper, the county seat, tends to lean Democratic. Although The Woodlands is home to many corporate transplants from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, who tend to be of a more liberal persuasion, most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> not U.S. citizens, thus have little impact on the voting trends of the county.|$|E
25|$|People have asked, so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E

25|$|The Tohono O’odham, still {{referred}} to as the Pápago by Spanish speakers, have inhabited the most arid areas of the state, and are mostly found in Caborca, Puerto Peñasco, Sáric, Altar and Plutarco Elías Calles in the north of the state. However, most people of this ethnicity now live in neighboring Arizona. The Tohono O’odham have as a principle deity the “Older Brother,” who dominates the forces of nature. Among their most important rituals is one called the Vikita, which occurs in July, with dances and song to encourage rainfall during the area’s short rainy season. In July, during the full moon, a dance called the Cu-cu is performed, which is to ask for favors from Mother Nature so {{that there will be no}} drought and the later harvests will be abundant. The dance is performed during a large festival with brings together not only the Tohono O’odham from Sonora, but from Arizona and California as well. The feast day of Francis of Assisi is also important. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> known as skilled carpenters, making furniture as well as delicate figures of wood. There are also craftspeople who make ceramics and baskets, especially a type of basket called a “corita.”.|$|E
500|$|Several {{witnesses}} were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution.

500|$|This has {{resulted}} in several offenders being sent back to prison after breaching licence conditions. Since the unit was launched in 2006 more than 900 people have been filmed by the unit. Not all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> suspects in crime however, people can be filmed if they are thought to associate with prolific offenders or {{if they have been}} stopped in an area of high crime under suspicious circumstances. Kieran Walsh, a civil liberties lawyer, said the unit's work [...] "could have implications" [...] for the force under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to privacy. He believes that filming must be a [...] "proportionate and reasonable" [...] response to a crime and that this {{does not appear to be}} the case as people are being targeted over what they might do in the future. It is uncertain as to how long data collected by the unit is to be kept but GMP currently anticipate it will be stored for 5years.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{praise from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club called the episode {{one of the}} [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] of the series and cited it {{as an example of}} the series' subtle shift [...] "from a collection of monster tales to something more akin to an attempt to explain the dark underbelly of America’s obsession with pulp narratives." [...] He ultimately concluded that [...] "Field Trip" [...] showed [...] "how the series would never be as good as its best seasons again, but could still be remarkably effective." [...] In a subsequent review, VanDerWerff awarded the episode an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "one of my favorite episodes of The X-Files sixth season" [...] due to its analysis of what Mulder and Scully each desire from the world, and the fact that the episode argues that the [...] "mysteries can only be solved if both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> working to solve them." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five. The two positively compared the episode to the episode [...] "Bad Blood", noting that the episode [...] " [...] a retread of those 'Bad Blood' themes". Furthermore, however, Shearman and Pearson noted that, [...] " [...] not merely poking fun at the conventions of the long running sci-fi show, but inviting its audience to question the truths around us we take for granted".|$|E
2500|$|... {{substantial}} unofficial and unauthorized {{movements of}} {{people must be}} expected, and these will require considerable force to prevent, for the patience {{of many of the}} persons involved is, and in my opinion with justification, nearing the breaking point. It cannot be overemphasized that many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> now desperate, that they have become accustomed under German rule to employ every possible means to reach their end, and that the fear of death does not restrain them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{uncontrolled}} {{influx of}} foreigners created significant anxiety in government circles. Particularly, the British Government feared {{the presence of}} spies and Jacobin agents disguised as refugees in the country. J. W. Bruges, secretary of the Foreign Office, wrote to Lord Grenville on 14 September: [...] "By what I can learn, the majority <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> of a suspicious description, and very likely either to do mischief of [...] their own accord, or to be fit [...] tools [...] of [...] those [...] who [...] may [...] be [...] desirous of creating [...] confusion". Additionally, the newspapers during {{the latter part of}} 1792 emphasized strong public suspicions of [...] "Frenchmen in England" [...] and demanded that high control and security measures be placed onto Britain.|$|E
5000|$|The Portuguese also {{encountered}} another fierce warrior people, {{this time}} further south beyond the Kwanza River. The actual name <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>was</b> Imbangala. The origins <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> still debated, {{but they are}} also believed to have immigrated from the Lunda Empire, rejecting that state's political changes. [...] The Imbangala were known to be notoriously cruel and also ritually cannibalistic. They were used to good effect as mercenary elements in the Portuguese army during its conquest of Angola. Once introduced into central Angola, the Imbangala settled there, forming the kingdom of Kasanje on the Kwango River.|$|R

2500|$|According to Jan Edling, {{a former}} trade-unionist, {{the actual number}} of {{unemployed}} is far higher, and those figures are being suppressed by both the government and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. In Edling's report he added that a further 3% of Swedes were occupied in state-organised job schemes, not in the private sector. He also claimed a further 700,000 Swedes are either on long-term sick leave or in early retirement. Edling asks how many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> in fact unemployed. According to his report, the [...] "actual unemployment" [...] rate hovers near 20%. Some critics disagree with this concept of [...] "actual" [...] unemployment, also termed [...] "broad unemployment", since they do not see e.g. students who rather want a job, people on sick leave and military conscripts as [...] "unemployed".|$|E
