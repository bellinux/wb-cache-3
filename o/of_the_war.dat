[...] Despite their small size, they demonstrated impressive resilience and strength; they are the only small nation to be given their own chapter in <b>the</b> Strategies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Warring</b> States.|$|R

5|$|The pre-battle {{sacrifice}} {{is incompatible with}} {{the first and second}} boons, but the cults have their own explanations. The self-sacrifice prior to the war is incompatible with dying a heroic death during the war and both are incompatible with living to see the full duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> The Kuttantavar cult resolves the first dilemma, holding that Aravan's body reconfigured itself after the sacrifice and that Aravan went on to die a heroic death on the eighth day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> The Kuttantavar cult are not overly concerned about the second boon of Aravan's continued observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> On the other hand, the Draupadi cult are not overly concerned about the first boon of the heroic death; they resolve the second dilemma, regarding Aravan's continued observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> holding that Aravan was able to watch the entire war through the eyes of his severed head. A third view harmonizes all the boons, holding that Aravan's body reconstituted after the sacrifice; he then fought heroically until being decapitated on the eighth day, observing the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> through the eyes of his severed head.|$|E
