Providence students organized a protest march. A group of faculty members of the school wrote a petition in which they charged that Esolen's writings contained repeated [...] "racist, xenophobic, misogynist, homophobic and religiously chauvinist statements." [...] The Rev. Brian Shanley, O.P., President of Providence College, publicly distanced himself from Esolen's statements by claiming [...] "that he speaks only for himself." [...] Meanwhile, Robert P. George, a conservative Catholic professor at Esolen's alma mater, Princeton University, defended him. He argued that students and faculty members who disagree with him [...] "should respond in the currency of academic discourse—reasons, evidence, arguments—not by attempting to isolate, stigmatize, and marginalize him for stating dissenting opinions." ...|$|E

[...] Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.|$|E
