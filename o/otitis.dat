5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute <b>otitis</b> media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute <b>otitis</b> media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in <b>otitis</b> media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infantsâ€™ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute <b>otitis</b> media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
5|$|As a {{treatment}} for <b>otitis</b> externa, {{it is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. <b>Otitis</b> externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause <b>otitis</b> externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans and Inuit {{are more}} likely to be {{infected}} with colds and develop complications such as <b>otitis</b> media than Caucasians. This may be explained by issues such as poverty and overcrowding rather than by ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is <b>otitis</b> externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by <b>otitis</b> media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
5|$|Preclinical {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} effects of MFGM-derived bioactive components on brain structure and function, intestinal development, and immune defense. Similarly, pediatric clinical trials have reported beneficial effects on cognitive and immune outcomes. In populations ranging from premature infants to preschool-age children, dietary supplementation with MFGM or its components {{has been associated with}} improvements in cognition and behavior, gut and oral bacterial composition, fever incidence, and infectious outcomes including diarrhea and <b>otitis</b> media.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory <b>Otitis</b> Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as <b>otitis</b> externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute <b>otitis</b> media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of <b>otitis</b> externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as <b>otitis</b> media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
25|$|Children with {{recurrent}} {{episodes of}} acute <b>otitis</b> media {{and those with}} <b>otitis</b> media with effusion or chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> media have higher risks of developing conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Globally approximately 141nbsp&million people have mild hearing loss due to <b>otitis</b> media (2.1% of the population). This {{is more common in}} males (2.3%) than females (1.8%).|$|E
25|$|Periods of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} from <b>otitis</b> media may have a detrimental effect on speech development in children. Some studies have linked <b>otitis</b> media to learning problems, attention disorders, and problems with social adaptation. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that patients with <b>otitis</b> media have more depression/anxiety-related disorders compared to individuals with normal hearing. Once the infections resolve and hearing thresholds return to normal, childhood <b>otitis</b> media may still cause minor and irreversible damage to the middle ear and cochlea.|$|E
25|$|Ear pain is the {{predominant}} complaint {{and the only}} symptom {{directly related to the}} severity of acute external <b>otitis.</b> Unlike other forms of ear infections, the pain of acute external <b>otitis</b> is worsened when the outer ear is touched or pulled gently. Pushing the tragus, the tablike portion of the auricle that projects out {{just in front of the}} ear canal opening, also typically causes pain in this condition as to be diagnostic of external <b>otitis</b> on physical examination. People may also experience ear discharge and itchiness. When enough swelling and discharge in the ear canal is present to block the opening, external <b>otitis</b> may cause temporary conductive hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Pneumococcal {{conjugate}} vaccines (PCV) {{in early}} infancy, decreases {{the risk of}} acute <b>otitis</b> media in healthy infants. PCV is recommended for all children, and, if implemented broadly, PCV {{would have a significant}} public health benefit. Influenza vaccine is recommended annually for all children. PCV does not appear to decrease the risk of <b>otitis</b> media when given to high-risk infants or for older children who have previously experienced <b>otitis</b> media.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{there was}} {{considerable}} interest {{in the role of}} chronic <b>Otitis</b> media (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and literacy problems. <b>Otitis</b> media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period. Consistent with this, in a sample of young children with chronic ear infections recruited from a hospital otolargyngology department, increased rates of auditory difficulties were found later in childhood. However, this kind of study will suffer from sampling bias because children with <b>otitis</b> media {{will be more likely to}} be referred to hospital departments if they are experiencing developmental difficulties. Compared with hospital studies, epidemiological studies, which assesses a whole population for <b>otitis</b> media and then evaluate outcomes, have found much weaker evidence for long-term impacts of <b>otitis</b> media on language outcomes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> {{media is}} a group of {{inflammatory}} diseases of the middle ear. The two main types are acute <b>otitis</b> media (AOM) and <b>otitis</b> media with effusion (OME). AOM is an infection of abrupt onset that usually presents with ear pain. In young children this may result in pulling at the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep. Decreased eating and a fever may also be present. OME is typically not associated with symptoms. Occasionally a feeling of fullness is described. It is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear for more than three months. Chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> media (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation of greater than two weeks that results in episodes of discharge from the ear. It may be a complication of acute <b>otitis</b> media. Pain is rarely present. All three may be associated with hearing loss. The hearing loss in OME, due to its chronic nature, may affect a child's ability to learn.|$|E
25|$|Complications {{of acute}} <b>otitis</b> media {{consists}} of perforation {{of the ear}} drum, infection of the mastoid space behind the ear (mastoiditis), and more rarely intracranial complications can occur, such as bacterial meningitis, brain abscess, or dural sinus thrombosis. It is estimated that each year 21,000 people die due to complications of <b>otitis</b> media.|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> externa {{responds}} well to treatment, but complications {{may occur}} {{if it is}} not treated. Individuals with underlying diabetes, disorders of the immune system, or history of radiation therapy {{to the base of the}} skull are more likely to develop complications, including malignant <b>otitis</b> externa. In these individuals, rapid examination by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat physician) is very important.|$|E
25|$|Avoid {{inserting}} anything {{into the}} ear canal: use of cotton buds or swabs {{is the most}} common event leading to acute <b>otitis</b> externa.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{does not}} support zinc supplementation {{as an effort to}} reduce <b>otitis</b> rates except maybe in those with severe {{malnutrition}} such as marasmus.|$|E
25|$|For {{bilateral}} acute <b>otitis</b> {{media in}} infants younger than 24 months of age, without severe signs and symptoms, antibiotics should be prescribed.|$|E
25|$|Oral and topical pain killers are {{effective}} {{to treat the}} pain caused by <b>otitis</b> media. Oral agents include ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and opiates. Topical agents shown to be effective include antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops. Decongestants and antihistamines, either nasal or oral, are not recommended {{due to the lack}} of benefit and concerns regarding side effects. Half of cases of ear pain in children resolve without treatment in three days and 90% resolve in seven or eight days. The use of steroids is not supported by the evidence for acute <b>otitis</b> media.|$|E
25|$|Acute <b>otitis</b> media {{caused by}} H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. Azithromycin is not, however, a {{first-line}} agent for this condition. Amoxicillin or another beta lactam antibiotic is generally preferred.|$|E
25|$|Adhesive <b>otitis</b> media {{occurs when}} a thin {{retracted}} ear drum becomes sucked into the middle-ear space and stuck (i.e., adherent) to the ossicles and other bones of the middle ear.|$|E
25|$|Amoxicillin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of infections, including acute <b>otitis</b> media, streptococcal pharyngitis, pneumonia, skin infections, urinary tract infections, Salmonella infections, Lyme disease, and chlamydia infections.|$|E
25|$|Burow's {{solution}} {{is a very}} effective remedy against both bacterial and fungal external <b>otitis.</b> This is a buffered mixture of aluminum sulfate and acetic acid, and is available without prescription in the United States.|$|E
25|$|A {{treatment}} {{option for}} chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> media with discharge is topical antibiotics. A Cochrane review found that topical quinolone antibiotics can improve discharge better than oral antibiotics. Safety {{is not really}} clear.|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> externa may be acute (lasting {{less than}} six weeks) or chronic (lasting more than three months). Acute cases are {{typically}} due to bacterial infection, and chronic cases are often due to allergies and autoimmune disorders. Risk factors for acute cases include swimming, minor trauma from cleaning, using hearing aids and ear plugs, and other skin problems, such as psoriasis and dermatitis. People with diabetes {{are at risk of}} a severe form of malignant <b>otitis</b> externa. Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. Culturing the ear canal may be useful in chronic or severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Facial nerve {{disorders}} may {{stem from}} a myriad of contributing factors: Bellâ€™s palsy, injury resulting from surgical error, trauma to the temporal bone, <b>otitis</b> media, multiple sclerosis, mumps, chicken pox, and other conditions.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{solutions}} for the ear canal include acidifying and drying agents, used either singly or in combination. When the ear canal skin is inflamed from the acute <b>otitis</b> externa, the use of dilute acetic acid may be painful.|$|E
25|$|An {{option for}} severe acute <b>otitis</b> media in which analgesics are not {{controlling}} ear pain is {{to perform a}} tympanocentesis, i.e., needle aspiration through the tympanic membrane to relieve the ear pain and to identify the causative organism(s).|$|E
25|$|Cefalexin {{can treat}} {{a number of}} {{bacterial}} infections including: <b>otitis</b> media, streptococcal pharyngitis, bone and joint infections, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. It {{may be used to}} prevent bacterial endocarditis. It can also be used for the prevention of recurrent urinary-tract infections.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} is usually done under general anesthesia. Risks {{of the procedures}} include mastoiditis, <b>otitis</b> media (acute or with effusion), shifting of the implanted device requiring a second procedure, damage to the facial nerve, damage to the chorda tympani, and wound infections.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{symptoms}} of external <b>otitis</b> lead many people to attempt {{to clean out the}} ear canal (or scratch it) with slim implements, self-cleaning attempts generally lead to additional traumas of the injured skin, so rapid worsening of the condition often occurs.|$|E
