5|$|Coarse or {{carpet wool}} sheep are {{those with a}} medium to long length wool of {{characteristic}} coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> sheep are attempting to use {{a few of these}} traditional breeds for alternative purposes.

5|$|Poison dart frogs are {{an example}} of an aposematic organism. Their bright {{coloration}} advertises unpalatability to potential predators. Aposematism is currently thought to have originated at least four times within the poison dart family according to phylogenetic trees, and dendrobatid frogs have since undergone dramatic divergences – both interspecific and intraspecific – in their aposematic coloration. This is surprising given the frequency-dependent nature <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> defense mechanism.|$|E

5|$|The theory <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{supernova}} {{is similar}} to that of novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface explosion that does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a massive star as its core implodes.|$|E
5|$|Type Ia supernovae, {{that involve}} helium {{accretion}} {{by a white}} dwarf, have been proposed to be a channel for transformation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> stellar remnant. In this scenario, the carbon detonation produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf, expelling just {{a small part of}} its mass as ejecta, but produces an asymmetric explosion that kicks the star, often known as a zombie star, to high speeds of a hypervelocity star. The matter processed in the failed detonation is re-accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as iron falling to its core where it accumulates. These iron-core white dwarfs would be smaller than the carbon-oxygen kind of similar mass and would cool and crystallize faster than those.|$|E
30|$|Roads with curvatures {{increase}} {{the probability of}} crashes, which is so rational.

The results also show that in the vicinity of junctions like intersections, squares or ramps, the odds <b>of</b> encountering <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> crash reduces. These places are most likely crowded with heavy traffic which diminishes the odds <b>of</b> experiencing <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> crash.

5|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees {{can be seen}} in {{some simple}} types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{operations}} are remunerated activities which {{fall within the}} ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector. Public transport {{operations are}} non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than airline travel. Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> operation is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport. Aerial work is a small but {{important component of the}} commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as surveying, crop spraying, and emergency services work (air ambulance and police).|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate {{all the way through the}} bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside to the inside of the cell. The most common class <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the history of the Universe.

The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
