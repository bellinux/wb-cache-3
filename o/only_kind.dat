Cycle rickshaws in Bangladesh {{are also}} more {{convenient}} than the other public modes of transports in the country namely auto rickshaws, cabs and buses. They are mostly convertible, decorated, rickshaws with folding hoods and are the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of vehicles that can be driven in many neighborhoods of the city with narrow streets and lanes. However, increasing traffic congestion and the resulting collisions {{have led to the}} banning of rickshaws on many major streets in the city. Urban employment in Bangladesh also largely depend on cycle rickshaws. Because of inflation and unemployment in the rural areas, people from villages crowd in the cities to become rickshaw drivers locally called the riksha-wala (রিকশাওয়ালা).|$|E

500|$|Citing {{from both}} {{pornography}} and literature—including The Kreutzer Sonata, Madame Bovary, and Dracula—Dworkin argued that depictions of intercourse in mainstream {{art and culture}} consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of [...] "real" [...] sex, portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms, portrayed the violence or invasiveness as central to its eroticism, and often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the [...] "carnal" [...] woman. She argued {{that this kind of}} depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of [...] "occupation" [...] that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status as women.|$|E

It's a big budget shoot, the kind we don't see that much of anymore." [...] Jason Lipshutz of the magazine Billboard praised the video with its [...] "crystal-clear" [...] shots of the concert and the [...] "hazy" [...] shots of Lee running through New York. Nicole James of MTV Buzzyworthy simply said [...] "rock videos + themes = the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of math I like" [...] referring to the music video for [...] "What You Want".

He further found CCTV effects and concluded that Lee was [...] "looking for some love to infect" [...] while running through Brooklyn streets.|$|E

This species can adapt to surprisingly small prey where it is the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> available and to large prey where it is abundant. Eurasian eagle-owls feed most commonly on small mammals in the [...] weight range, although nearly 45% of the prey species recorded have an average adult body mass of less than [...] Usually 55-80% of the food of eagle-owls is mammalian.|$|E
2500|$|Many times an {{individual}} has a physical sickness {{and goes to the}} physician for help. But is that the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of sickness there is? Kierkegaard was interested in spiritual sickness called sin and the expectancy of forgiveness which are both Christian categories. We [...] "must want to understand the forgiveness of sins-and then despair of understanding it." [...] Later, in The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard writes of the sin of despairing over one's sin and the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins. Robert L. Perkins from Mercer University published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to fear and wonder within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.|$|E

John Mecklin claimed that the White House put [...] "direct, relentless, table-hammering pressure on Diem such as the United States had seldom before attempted with a sovereign, friendly government". Trueheart went on {{to admit that the}} US was well aware of the generals' actions. He said that there were loyalty issues of publicly supporting a government while knowing that a coup was underway, but that it was [...] "greatly offset by the feeling that we had been had by these people". Colby agreed with his colleagues that Richardson's removal was a major factor, regarding it as [...] "a policy decision just to indicate the end of a close relationship with Nhu". Richardson was close to Diem and the CIA provided both technical assistance and financing to Nhu's Special Forces. Trueheart insisted that Richardson had to be recalled so that Lodge could show that he spoke for the White House. Trueheart commented [...] "This was a clear signal, the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of really believable signal he could give".|$|E
2500|$|Since the Commonwealth {{introduced}} the Marriage Act Cth. 1961, marriage laws in Australia have {{been regarded as}} an exclusive Commonwealth power. The precise rights of states and territories with respect to creating state-based same-sex marriage laws have been complicated since the Howard Government amendment to the Marriage Act in 2004 to define marriage as the exclusive union of one man and one woman, {{to the exclusion of}} all others. In their December 2013 ruling striking down the ACT's same-sex marriage law, the High Court effectively determined that all laws with respect to marriage were an exclusive power of the Commonwealth and that no state or territory law legalising same-sex marriage or creating any type of marriage could operate concurrently with the federal Marriage Act; [...] "the kind of marriage provided for by the [...] Act is the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of marriage that may be formed or recognised in Australia". As a result, the only possible method for same-sex marriage legalisation to occur in Australia is via legislation passed into law by the Federal Parliament only.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s, Crick became {{concerned}} with {{the origins of the}} genetic code. In 1966, Crick took the place of Leslie Orgel at a meeting where Orgel was to talk about the origin of life. Crick speculated about possible stages by which an initially simple code with a few amino acid types might have evolved into the more complex code used by existing organisms. At that time, everyone thought of proteins as the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> of enzymes, and ribozymes had not yet been found. Many molecular biologists were puzzled by the problem of the origin of a protein replicating system that is as complex as that which exists in organisms currently inhabiting Earth. In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from molecules may have been a very rare event in the universe, but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using space travel technology, a process they called [...] "directed panspermia". In a retrospective article, Crick and Orgel noted that they had been overly pessimistic about the chances of abiogenesis on Earth when they had assumed that some kind of self-replicating protein system was the molecular origin of life.|$|E
