5|$|In North American waters, the finetooth shark {{is common}} and found from North Carolina to the {{northern}} Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> very occasionally straying {{as far north as}} New York. In Central and South American waters, it is rare, but may occur more widely than presently known, having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana, infrequently from the Caribbean Sea, and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina. The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks (C. brevipinna).|$|E

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the western Atlantic Ocean, from Chesapeake Bay southward through the Florida Keys, the northern Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> the Greater and Lesser Antilles; on rare occasions it is found as far north as New Jersey and Massachusetts, as far south as Venezuela, and as far west as Mexico.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm formed on October 15, and {{passed through the}} southern Bahamas. It crossed the Florida Straits, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) on October 20, after entering the eastern Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> turning towards the north. It curved northeastward and made landfall at Cedar Key, Florida. After pushing inland, the storm stalled and weakened to a tropical depression on October 21 before dissipating fully the next day.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, {{an increase in}} the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.|$|E
5|$|At landfall, Fern had {{weakened}} to {{a strong}} tropical storm as it moved further inland. Because the center of Fern was elongated, it {{was still able to}} receive moisture from the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> as a result, weakening was slow. Between September 10 and September 11, Fern bypassed Corpus Christi, Texas, before dissipating as a tropical depression after crossing the Rio Grande into northern Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 7th century Nahuan {{speakers}} rose {{to power}} in central Mexico. The people of the Toltec culture of Tula, which was active in central Mexico around the 10th century, {{are thought to have}} been Nahuatl speakers. By the 11th century, Nahuatl speakers were dominant in the Valley <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> far beyond, with settlements including Azcapotzalco, Colhuacan and Cholula rising to prominence. Nahua migrations into the region from the north continued into the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream {{was at least}} {{partly responsible for the}} widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E

5|$|On July 24, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa and tracked westward. The wave entered the Caribbean on July 29 and gained in organization and convection, and organized into Tropical Storm Barry on August 3.

5|$|On June 1, a {{tropical}} depression formed off western Cuba from an organized cloud system. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> <b>and</b> strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category1 hurricane, {{one of the}} earliest hurricanes of June, and the earliest date for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto then quickly weakened into {{a tropical}} storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto {{is an example of a}} storm to enter the Gulf <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> <b>and</b> dissipating while never make landfall, which is an unusual event.|$|E
