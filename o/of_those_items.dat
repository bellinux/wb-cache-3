They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>items</b> or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to a nest. Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, {{the last}} {{original}} novel in the series, begins directly {{after the events}} of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. To ensure their own safety {{as well as that of}} their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes her parents' memories. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learns details about an ancient prophecy about the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly grant that person to be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>items,</b> and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives – he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.|$|E

[...] The army suffered from {{a general lack of}} supplies, but wagons and horses were in particularly short supply, and the earl discovered that his quartermasters were profiteering on the provisioning <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>items.</b> [...] The methods by which horses were acquired also served to alienate their Loyalist friends, since the quartermasters were sometimes indiscriminate, seizing horses from Patriots and Loyalists alike. [...] His supply lines were also continually harassed, particularly by Francis Marion. [...] In November he ordered Tarleton out to capture Marion; the two commanders successfully maneuvered themselves out of entrapments laid by the other. [...] Tarleton eventually returned to Cornwallis, reporting that Marion's force had been broken up; several days later, Marion resumed his guerrilla war.|$|E

2500|$|Random selection, when {{narrowly}} {{associated with}} a simple random sample, is a method of selecting items (often called units) from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>items</b> in the population. [...] For example, with a bowl containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue marbles, a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability 1/10. [...] Note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue. [...] In situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable, a random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen. [...] That is, if the selection process is such that each member of a population, of say research subjects, has the same probability of being chosen then we can say the selection process is random.|$|E

"We {{doubt that}} the village's {{restriction}} on the manner of marketing appreciably limits Flipside's communication of information—with one obvious and telling exception," [...] Marshall wrote.

[...] "If that activity is deemed 'speech,' then it is speech proposing an illegal transaction, which a government may regulate or ban entirely."

30|$|Following the {{procedure}} used in studies like PISA or PIAAC (OECD 2012; 2013), <b>those</b> <b>item</b> parameters that {{showed no significant}} difference for the German and Austrian sample were constrained to be equal for both groups. As the test was primarily developed for prospective teachers at German universities, the Austrian item parameters are estimated again with fixed item parameters according to the values <b>of</b> Germany for <b>those</b> <b>item</b> parameters with no significant logit difference. This procedure leads to the estimation of Austrian-specific <b>item</b> parameters for <b>those</b> <b>items</b> with significant relative difference and enables a reduction of potential bias due to deviations.|$|R
2500|$|Ford {{imported}} all of {{its first}} generation Transit Connect models as passenger vehicles by including rear windows, rear seats, and rear seatbelts. The vehicles are exported from Turkey on cargo ships owned by Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics (WWL), arrive in Baltimore, and are converted back into light trucks at WWL's Vehicle Services Americas Inc. facility by replacing rear windows with metal panels and removing the rear seats and seatbelts. The removed parts are not shipped back to Turkey for reuse, but shredded and recycled in Ohio. The process exploits the loophole in the customs definition of a light truck: as cargo does not need seats with seat belts or rear windows, presence <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>items</b> automatically qualifies the vehicle as a passenger vehicle and exempts the vehicle from light truck status. The process costs Ford hundreds of dollars per van but saves thousands in taxes. Chrysler has announced it will introduce the Ram ProMaster City, an Americanised version of the Fiat Doblò, in 2015 [...] building the vehicle at the Tofaş plant in Turkey, importing only passenger configurations and subsequently converting cargo configurations.|$|E

[...] A large scale digitisation project began in 2007 in that department. That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol {{and to create a}} factory to completely digitise the collection. [...] The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs using digital cameras. [...] The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions, so new photos were shot. [...] Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum web-site. [...] 15,000 images were taken {{during the first year of}} the Factory Project, including drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. [...] The second step of the Factory Project is to catalogue everything. The third step of the Factory Project is to audit the collection. [...] All <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>items</b> which were photographed and catalogued, must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project. [...] The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation, which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department. [...] There is a [...] "Search the Collections" [...] feature on the Victoria and Albert web-site. [...] The main impetus behind the large-scale digitisation project called the Factory Project was to list more items in the collections in those computer databases.|$|E
