5|$|On March 10, Archbishop Szoka {{reported}} {{the situation to}} the Vatican. The Vatican delegated Archbishop Pio Laghi to address the matter, and he {{sent a message to}} Sister Theresa Kane, the national president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> of Mercy, telling Kane that she must convince Mansour to resign as director of DSS. Kane refused, as did Detroit Provincial Superior Emily George who was the Vice President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> of Mercy of the Union, and was previously (as Mary Karl George) the president of Mercy College, before Mansour.|$|E

5|$|Mansour {{assumed the}} {{directorship}} on December 29, 1982, pending Michigan legislative confirmation in the position. Archbishop Szoka hardened his resolve, on February 23, 1983, directed the Detroit Province <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> of Mercy {{to determine whether}} Mansour was {{in violation of the}} teachings of the Church. He told the Detroit Sisters leadership that Mansour no longer had his permission to serve the state, and he ordered them to inform her that she was to resign the state appointment.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, nativists {{returned}} in greater numbers. During the rally, {{it began to}} rain, and the meeting was moved into a nearby market. The inflammatory remarks continued inside the market, where fighting broke out between the local Irish Catholics and the nativists. Fighting spilled outside the market, where nativists were shot at by people {{in the windows of}} nearby buildings. One or two nativists were reportedly killed. George Shiffler, an 18 year old leather worker, was the first nativist killed in the riots of 1844. A mob of nativists attacked the Seminary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> of Charity and several Catholic homes before the riot ended. Numerous people were injured, and two more nativists were killed.|$|E
5|$|President Steyn {{played a}} minor role in Operation Savannah, the South African covert {{intervention}} in the Angolan Civil War, most notably when she rescued 26 advisors to the National Liberation Front of Angola who had been cut off after a failed attack on Luanda on 28 November. To provide manpower for the French corvettes under construction, the ship was placed in reserve in early 1977. The United Nations arms embargo imposed later that year put paid to that plan and she was recommissioned the following year. Shortly before President Kruger was recommissioned on 15 August 1980, President Steyn was permanently decommissioned on 1 August, after the navy decided to only keep two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sisters</b> active.|$|E

5|$|The air groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sisters</b> were {{decimated}} in the battle, which forced Zuikaku {{to return}} to Japan with Shōkaku for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier {{was able to take}} part in the Battle of Midway in June. En route to Japan, Shōkaku was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used to put out the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months and she was not ready for action until late August.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, {{all three}} ships were {{assigned}} to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet and St Vincent became the flagship of the division's second-in-command. In July, they were present when King George V visited the fleet in Torbay and participated in his Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911. Less than a year later, the 1st Division was renamed the 1st Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. Collingwood became the squadron flagship on 22 June and reverted to a private ship again two years later. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sisters</b> underwent a lengthy refit before the First World War began in mid-1914.|$|E
5|$|After a brief lull, the {{violence}} continued on May 8. The nativists {{came back to}} Kensington and burned down St. Michael's Catholic Church and rectory at Second and Jefferson Streets, the Seminary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> of Charity, which had been attacked a few days before, and several homes were attacked before soldiers arrived and the fire was contained. While the riot was being contained in Kensington, another nativist mob had gathered within the borders of Philadelphia itself. They gathered at St. Augustine's Catholic Church, located on Fourth Street between Vine and New Streets. City troops were stationed by the church, and Mayor John Morin Scott pleaded for calm. The rioters threw stones at the mayor, ignored the troops and burned down the church, cheering when the steeple fell. A nearby school {{with a collection of}} rare books was also set aflame. The rioters did not attack an unfinished German Catholic church under construction.|$|E

5|$|Superb and Temeraire {{returned}} home {{the following month}} after supporting Allied operations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea and were placed into reserve. Later that year, Temeraire was converted into a cadet training ship and continued on that duty until early 1921 when she was paid off. In the meantime Superb relieved Bellerophon as a gunnery training ship in late 1919 and the latter was reduced to reserve. Superb was relieved in her turn {{at the end of}} 1919 and was paid off in early 1920. The ship was used for gunnery trials beginning {{at the end of the}} year and was used as a target ship during 1922 before being sold, the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sisters</b> still in existence as Temeraire and Bellerophon had been sold for scrap in late 1921.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Dexter {{was kept}} for centuries in the Szentjobb Abbey, except during the Mongol {{invasion}} of 1241 and 1242, {{when it was}} transferred to Ragusa (now Dubrovnik, Croatia). The relic was then taken to Székesfehérvár around 1420. Following the Ottoman occupation of the central territories of the Kingdom of Hungary in the mid-16thcentury, it was guarded in many places, including Bosnia, Ragusa and Vienna. It was returned to Hungary in 1771, when Queen Maria Theresa donated it to the cloister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> of Loreto in Buda. It was kept in Buda Castle's St. Sigismund Chapel between around 1900 and 1944, in a cave near Salzburg in 1944 and 1945, and again by the Sisters of Loreto in Buda, between 1945 and 1950. Finally, since 1950, the Holy Dexter has been in St. Stephen's Basilica in Budapest. An annual procession celebrating the relic was instituted in 1938, and continued until 1950, when the procession was forbidden by the Communist government. It was resumed in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The Sisters faced {{controversy}} {{not only}} from public opinion, but also within the medical profession. Initially the response of Montreal doctors was positive, and in 1850 the College of Physicians petitioned Bishop Bourget for permission to send students to the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie for training, which Bourget granted over the objections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters.</b> However, friction arose between the Sisters and the students; the Sisters {{did not want the}} students present (a position shared by many of the unwed mothers), while the students were often contemptuous, rude, or dismissive towards their patients. Combined with the competency of the Misericorde Sisters, and their non-profit mandate, this friction bloomed into hostility between the Sisters and Montreal physicians, who came to see the midwives as a professional threat.|$|E

5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sisters</b> {{of the father and}} any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of the father and then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father. It appears that if there were two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} five {{ships were}} obsolescent {{by the end}} of the war and most were assigned to secondary roles. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sisters</b> were sent to the Black Sea to support the Whites during the Russian Civil War. One ship ran aground and the crew of the other mutinied after one of its members was killed during a protest against intervention in support of the Whites. Both ships were quickly condemned and later sold for scrap. The remaining three sisters received partial modernizations in the mid-1920s and became training ships until they were condemned in the mid-1930s and later scrapped. The only survivor still afloat at the beginning of World War II in August 1939 had been hulked in 1931 and was serving as part of the navy's torpedo school. She was captured by the Germans when they occupied Vichy France in 1942 and scuttled by them after the Allied invasion of southern France in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its 66 {{years of}} operating, the orphanage took in {{approximately}} 2,500 individuals. Approximately four per cent of all boys who stayed there were orphans, whereas the remainder had living parents; {{most of them}} either came from poor or troubled families who were unable to afford to look after them. The orphanage also took in child migrants. Only boys from the ages of 5 to 16 were taken care there. However, the Sisters of Mercy sometimes took in families in need or individuals who were 3 years old or younger. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> of Mercy's aims was to keep brothers together if possible, {{and if they had}} sisters, they would be housed at the St. Joseph's Orphanage. Although the building could only house up to 100 boys, the capacity rose to between 140 and 250 boys during the Second World War, far above the suitable capacity of the building.|$|E
