5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|First {{responder}} – A {{person who}} arrives {{first at the}} scene of an incident, and whose job is to provide early critical care such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or using an automated external defibrillator (AED). First responders may be dispatched by the ambulance service, may be passers-by, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> dispatched to the scene from other agencies, such as the police or fire departments.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} may not develop at all, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> fused in the midline behind the aorta. These are {{associated}} with other congenital abnormalities, such as failure of the kidneys to develop, or fused kidneys. The gland may develop with a partial or complete absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.|$|E

25|$|A {{quadratic}} equation with real or complex coefficients has two solutions, called roots. These two solutions <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> distinct, and they <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> real.|$|R
5|$|The {{mission and}} purpose of the Army and Navy Union are to bind {{together}} in fraternal comradeship all comrades, shipmates, soldiers, sailors and marines, regular and volunteers, veterans of all wars in which the United States has been <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> engaged in. Besides patriotic, other purposes for the organization are for history and genealogy records. The main goal of the organization is to fraternally join all these veterans in a common semi-military group with similar backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|While growing, Azotobacter {{produces}} flat, slimy, paste-like colonies with {{a diameter}} of 5–10mm, which may form films in liquid nutrient media. The colonies can be dark-brown, green, or other colors, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> colorless, depending on the species. The growth is favored at a temperature of 20–30°C.|$|E
5|$|Æthelberht built Justus {{a cathedral}} church in Rochester; the {{foundations}} of a nave and chancel partly underneath the present-day Rochester Cathedral may date from that time. What remains of {{the foundations of}} an early rectangular building near {{the southern part of}} the current cathedral might also be contemporary with Justus <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> part of a Roman building.|$|E
50|$|Polygons may {{comprise}} multiple disjoint contours.Contour vertices <b>may</b> <b>be</b> specified as clockwise <b>or</b> anticlockwise.Contours <b>may</b> <b>be</b> convex, concave <b>or</b> self-intersecting.Contours <b>may</b> <b>be</b> nested.

5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne by birth. Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E
5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> related to preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the same}} herbs that are burned by one culture <b>may</b> <b>be</b> taboo to burn in another, <b>or</b> they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{used for a}} {{completely}} different purpose. When specific herbs are burned ceremonially, this <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> called [...] "smudging," [...] depending on the culture.|$|R
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|Established {{traits are}} not immutable; traits that have high fitness in one {{environmental}} context {{may be much}} less fit if environmental conditions change. In the absence of natural selection to preserve such a trait, it becomes more variable and deteriorate over time, possibly resulting in a vestigial manifestation of the trait, also called evolutionary baggage. In many circumstances, the apparently vestigial structure may retain a limited functionality, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> co-opted for other advantageous traits in a phenomenon known as preadaptation. A famous example of a vestigial structure, {{the eye of the}} blind mole-rat, is believed to retain function in photoperiod perception.|$|E
50|$|An {{injury to}} the MCL may occur as an {{isolated}} injury, <b>or</b> it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> part of a complex {{injury to the}} knee. Other ligaments ACL, <b>or</b> meniscus, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> torn along with a MCL injury.|$|R
50|$|Bacteria can be {{responsible}} for the spoilage of food. When bacteria breaks down the food, acids and other waste products are created in the process. While the bacteria itself <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> harmful, the waste products <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unpleasant to taste <b>or</b> <b>may</b> even <b>be</b> harmful to one's health.|$|R
50|$|Both of Bill's rebuttals are {{arguments}} from fallacy. Ginger <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> a cat, and Tom <b>may</b> <b>or</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> English. The fact that Tom's argument was fallacious is not, in itself, sufficient proof that his conclusion is false.|$|R
5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen fish products include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as}} a food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who may be unable to afford an ID <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to offer free state photo ID cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E

The audio level meters indicate when the signals are clipping.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{elements}} of analysis are angles and distances. Measurements (in degrees <b>or</b> millimetres) <b>may</b> <b>be</b> treated as absolute or relative, <b>or</b> they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{related to each other}} to express proportional correlations.

5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. People {{may be reluctant to}} take adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
5|$|The dish {{combines}} {{ingredients and}} culinary practices of several cultures, including French, Spanish, German, Filipino, West African, and Choctaw. Gumbo {{may have been}} based on traditional West African or native dishes, <b>or</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all three dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks {{in the latter half of}} the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish. Gumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana.|$|E
