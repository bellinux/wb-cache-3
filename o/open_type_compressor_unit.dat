40|$|The {{refrigerant}} circuits of car {{air-conditioning systems}} are fitted with so-called <b>open</b> <b>type</b> <b>compressors,</b> {{because there is}} only a lip seal preventing the refrigerant from leaking from the compressor housing to the atmosphere. In addition, the cycle uses damping elements between the compressor and the other components on the suction and pressure lines to reduce vibration and noise transfer from the engine to the car body. Both the lip seal and damping elements result in loss of refrigerant as they are made from elastomers and leak with age, and, under high temperature conditions inside the engine room, these elements also allow a relatively high permeation of the refrigerant gas to the atmosphere. With very high refrigerant losses in the older R 12 -cooling cycles and the damage caused by this gas to the ozone layer in the stratosphere, the Montreal protocol phased out this refrigerant and the car industry was forced to revert completely to R 134 a until 1994 / 95. R 134 a has no ozone depletion potential, but it has a direct global warming potential, and, therefore, leakages also have to be minimised. R 134 a has, because of its molecular size, a high permeation potential and, hence, all the refrigerant hoses are lined internally. Unfortunately, these hoses also leak with age and significant refrigerant loss will occur [1] R 134 a can therefore only be viewed as a solution until an alternative refrigerant with no direct global warming potential has been developed. Candidates for new refrigerants are natural substances such as hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide [2]. Unfortunately, both substances have disadvantages and their use is restricted to special cases, for e. g. hydrocarbons are flammable and are not used in car air-conditioners, but in Germany it is used as a refrigerant in household refrigerators with hermetic cycles. What makes the implementation of carbon dioxide (CO 2) difficult are the high system pressures and the low critical point [3]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{refrigeration}} system achieves its refrigeration function generally through cryogenic refrigerant generated by multiple refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units.</b> Traditionally, {{the operation of}} refrigerant <b>compressor</b> <b>units</b> is controlled only by experience or the proportional-integral-derivative controller of refrigerant temperature or pressure.

On this basis, this study employs the system optimization method to determine the optimum operation of each <b>compressor</b> <b>unit</b> within the system to obtain the most energy-saving operation for maximum operation efficiency of the refrigeration system (energy consumption efficiency), according to the actual required refrigeration capacity at load side, actual performance and operation condition of each unit.

Generally screw compressor is rotary positive displacement machine, which have very compact design and have just few moving parts.

Screw compressor is very efficient {{over a wide range}} of speeds and pressure differences [2]. Already half of century engineers challenge problems, which relate to change of mechanical properties of rotors surface of screw <b>type</b> <b>compressors.</b> Another challenge is to increase lifetime of rotors without diminishing its efficiency in action.

Using of various material verification types, analysis of surface topography, macro and microstructure and mechanical properties, gives to us ability to make analysis of structures and mechanical properties of rotors. Furthermore it gives to us recommendations for saving of efficient compressor rotor running for all lifetime.
