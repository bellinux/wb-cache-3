5|$|Most {{people should}} like their name. Those {{that do not}} should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name {{relatively}} highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their <b>own</b> <b>name</b> relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their <b>own</b> <b>name</b> negatively.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's <b>own</b> <b>name</b> is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their <b>own</b> <b>name,</b> producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her <b>own</b> <b>name.</b> She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E

5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our <b>own</b> <b>name</b> stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their <b>own</b> <b>name</b> or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Harris {{claimed to have}} been the first woman science-fiction writer in the United States.

5|$|After leaving Fitzgerald in 1978, Flanagan then {{attracted}} {{praise for}} the elegance of his playing, which was principally in trio settings when under his own leadership.

5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's <b>own</b> <b>name</b> significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
5|$|During her term at the university, Massaquoi {{succeeded in}} {{overcoming}} {{the requirement that}} students should adopt foreign names rather than keeping those of their indigenous families. In connection with this, when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948, Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh, calling herself Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh. Her husband also changed his <b>own</b> <b>name</b> back to Fahnbulleh. To further contribute to the cultural and social development of Liberia, she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script.|$|E
