Andrew Jergens, Jr. — aided by his father, Cincinnati businessman Andrew Jergens, Sr. and business partners Frank Adams and Morris Spazier — had purchased the site and built a single-story building. They began with a single product, coconut <b>oil</b> <b>soap,</b> but would later make face creams, lotions, liquid soaps and deodorants. In 1931, despite the Depression, the Jergens company expanded, building new offices and shipping department facilities. In 1939, the Burbank corporation merged with the Cincinnati company of Andrew Jergens, Sr., becoming known as the Andrew Jergens Company of Ohio. The Burbank plant closed in 1992, affecting nearly 90 employees.|$|E
25|$|Kadıköy is a busy {{shopping}} district, with a {{wide variety}} of atmospheres and architectural styles. The streets are varied, some being narrow alleyways and others, such as Bahariye Caddesi, being pedestrian zones. Turkey's biggest food market is there, starting next to the Osman Ağa Mosque, and has an immense turnover of fresh foods and other products from all around Turkey, including a wide range of fresh fish and seafood, olive <b>oil</b> <b>soap,</b> and so on. There are also modern shopping centres, most notably the large Tepe Nautilus Shopping Mall behind the center of Kadıköy, and pavements crowded with street vendors selling socks, unlicensed copies of popular novels, and other products. In the streets behind the main post office, there is a large number of well-known bookshops selling both new and second-hand books, craft-shops and picture-framers, and a number of shops selling music CDs and related ephemera such as film posters and T-shirts. Hard Rock and Heavy Metal music is sold in the arcade named Akmar Pasajı, where associated items are also sold. On Sundays this area becomes a large second-hand book and music street market. Being a crowded shopping district, Kadıköy has many buskers, shoe shine boys, glue sniffers and schoolchildren in the streets selling flowers, chewing gum and packets of tissues.|$|E

40|$|Nigerian {{traditional}} soaps {{were prepared}} using two commercial samples of {{palm kernel oil}} (black and pale-orange oils) that were extracted locally using two different traditional methods. The effect of the oil extraction method on the conductance of soaps in alcohols was then investigated. The conductance of the soaps prepared from the pale-orange oil was higher than that prepared from the black type. The plots of concentration conductance vs. the square root of concentration for methanolic solutions of the pale-orange <b>oil</b> <b>soaps</b> were linear, whereas the plots obtained for the black <b>oil</b> <b>soaps</b> were nonlinear. The plots of log(10) k vs. 1 /T were linear for all the soaps in methanol and for potassium soaps in 1 -propanol, whereas they were nonlinear for sodium soaps in 1 -propanol. The activation energy terms for the soaps prepared from pale-orange oil generally decreased {{with an increase in}} concentration, whereas the activation energies for the black <b>oil</b> <b>soaps</b> were less sensitive to changes in concentration. These observations suggest that the purity of the palm kernel oil can {{have a significant effect on}} the properties and quality of the traditional soaps and that the pale-orange oil was probably purer than the black type...|$|R

The purpose of this study could be summarized in the following: - (1) To determine the sources of wastes in vegetable <b>oil</b> and <b>soap</b> factories. (2) To determine the characteristic of wastes (quality and quantity). (3) To determine pretreatment of wastes from vegetable <b>oil</b> and <b>soap</b> factories to levels acceptable for discharge to municipal works and on land.
