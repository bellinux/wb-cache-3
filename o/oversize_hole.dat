40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the short- and long-term behaviour of injected bolted connections (IBCs) with <b>oversize</b> <b>holes</b> for various injection materials. A central theme in this thesis the demountability of IBCs, {{as a result of}} which several release agents are tested for their suitability in and effects on IBCs. Injection bolts have been used successfully in engineering practice using epoxy resin to limit the amount of slip in bolted shear connections with normal clearance holes, but no explicit results are available for connections with <b>oversize</b> or slotted <b>holes.</b> The use of <b>oversize</b> or slotted <b>holes</b> may be beneficial for the (re-) erection process of structures, and thus it is investigated what the effects of such <b>oversize</b> or slotted <b>holes</b> are on the connection behaviour. First, it is examined if grout is suitable as an injection material in injected bolted connections (IBCs), as well as what precautions are necessary to ensure proper demountability of grout- and (epoxy) resin-injected bolted connections. Secondly, the connection behaviour under short-term loading is determined, on the basis of which long-term creep tests are carried out. Finally, a new injection material is developed based on the preliminary conclusions drawn from the short- and long-term tests. It is concluded that IBCs can be demounted by treating the connection members with a release agent. The results of the experiments show that the long-term behaviour of resin-injected connections is governing the design, but that modelling of this time-dependent behaviour requires additional testing. The short and long-term performance of the newly developed material (resin reinforced with steel shot) in IBCs with <b>oversize</b> <b>holes</b> is significantly better than that of only resin, on the basis of which it is recommended to further investigate the potential and behaviour of this material in engineering applications.

The upper portion of the screws is smooth, not threaded. These six screws are often mistakenly assumed to be the pivot point rather than the hidden knife edge. This design works, in spite of the friction caused by the edges of the six holes sliding up and down the screw shafts when vibrato is applied.|$|R
40|$|Glass façade {{systems in}} {{buildings}} {{are subject to}} racking actions caused by inter storey drifts from earthquakes and wind action. The performance of façade systems {{is dependent on the}} amount of imposed drift and the interaction of the glass panels with the façade structural support frames. There are two major concerns related to the glass façade system performance during and immediately after a seismic event; hazards to people from falling glass and the cost associated with building down time and repair. It was observed that earthquake damage to glass façade systems resulting from in-plane racking actions is increasingly common and yet there has been limited research published in this field. The research completed to date has mainly focused on traditional framed glass façade systems; however, the racking performance of point fixed glass façade system (PFGFS) is likely to be quite different. Therefore, the aim of the research presented in this paper is to assess the in-plane racking performance of PFGFS which is a façade system gaining popularity worldwide. Two unique full scale in-plane racking laboratory tests on typical PFGFS with different types of connections were conducted and specific racking mechanisms were identified. Sophisticated non-linear finite element models (FE models) were developed and benchmarked against experimental results with excellent correlation. Further detailed FE analyses were conducted to evaluate the individual drift contributions of each racking mechanism such as rigid body translation of the glass panels at the <b>oversize</b> <b>holes</b> for construction tolerance, spider arm rotation and spider arm deformation. It was found that most of the drift capacity is attributed to the rigid body translation at the <b>oversize</b> <b>holes.</b> In this paper, the laboratory test setup and the experimental results are discussed together with the confirmatory FE analysis results to assess the in-plane racking performance of the PFGFS...|$|R
40|$|Described is a {{foldable}} expandable pallet for Space Station interface attachments {{with a basic}} square configuration. Each pallet {{consists of}} a series of struts joined together by node point fittings to make a rigid structure. The struts have hinge fittings which are spring loaded to permit collapse of the module for stowage transport to a Space Station in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle, and development on orbit. Dimensions of the pallet are selected to provide convenient, closely spaced attachment points between the node points of the relatively widely spaced trusses of a Space Station platform. A pallet is attached to a strut at four points: one close fitting <b>hole,</b> two <b>oversize</b> <b>holes,</b> and a slot to allow for thermal expansion/contraction and for manufacturing tolerances. Applications of the pallet include its use in rotary or angular joints; servicing of splints; with gridded plates; as instrument mounting bases; and as a roadbed for a Mobile Service Center (MSC) ...|$|R
40|$|The point fixed {{glass facade}} system (PFGFS), {{also known as}} a spider glass system, is popular because it is the most {{transparent}} facade system available for buildings. The glass facade system is fixed to the support structure at minimal points using bolts and spider arms. Generally, the racking performance of these systems is not considered at the design stage. The facade system will be vulnerable to racking actions mainly during severe earthquakes and wind actions if the system does not have sufficient in-plane drift capacity. A unique real-scale in-plane racking laboratory test on a typical PFGFS was conducted to assess the in-plane racking performance. A maximum drift of 2. 1 % was measured, which was much larger than initially anticipated because of the rigid-body articulation of the system and higher than typical maximum allowable interstory drift for buildings in regions of lower seismicity. A sophisticated nonlinear finite-element (FE) model was developed and conservatively benchmarked against the experimental results with excellent correlation. The FE analyses showed that a significant amount of the drift capacity was attributed to the rigid-body translation at the built-in <b>oversize</b> <b>holes</b> for construction tolerances provided in the facade system connections. In this paper, the laboratory test setup and experimental results are discussed together with the confirmatory FE analysis results...|$|R

40|$|Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 167 - 169) Ever since {{composite materials}} {{have been used}} in the aerospace industry, there have been problems with cutting and machining them. One of the reasons for this problem was the dearth of available tooling to machine composites. As research in composites progressed and as composites found wide application in the aerospace industry, efforts have been made to develop good and efficient tools to machine them. Nevertheless, this effort is still ongoing to develop better tools, as the problems faced during machining have not been totally eliminated. Of the different machining operations performed on composite materials, drilling is the most common. The major problems faced during the drilling of composite materials are delamination and fibers pull out. Delamination reduces the strength of the composite. Another problem that persists is the effect of excess cutting temperatures {{on the quality of the}} drilled hole. Excess cutting temperatures affect the dimensional accuracy of the drilled hole and deteriorate its surface finish. Excess cutting temperatures during drilling may melt the matrix and char the drilled hole. Research and experiments conducted on drilling of composite materials have shown that as the cutting edges of the drill bit wear out, the heat generated and the thrust force produced increases. Increase in thrust force gives rise to delamination. Also tool geometry plays a big role in producing a hole with an acceptable quality. Hence, it is important to thoroughly investigate the performance of the drill bit in terms of producing a good hole quality. The objective of this research work was to evaluate the performance of drill bits when drilling carbon-fiber composites. Drill bits were evaluated for temperature, <b>Hole</b> <b>oversize,</b> surface roughness, roundness, thrust force, torque, damage area, and tool wear. By conducting experiments using different drill bits, the drill bit performance was determined for every parameter in question. Based on the results of these experiments, it was possible to determine which drill bit performs optimally for the different parameters investigated in this research work. Also by evaluating the <b>Hole</b> <b>oversize,</b> roundness, and surface roughness, it was be possible to study the effect of speed and feed rate on these parameters. Also tool wear analysis was carried out as a part of this research work...|$|R
40|$|High speed {{twist drills}} are {{probably}} the most common of all metal cutting tools and also the least efficient. In this study, detailed research was undertaken into aspects of drill performance and ways in which drilling could be improved in short hole depths of up to two diameters. The work included an evaluation of twist drill geometry and grinding parameters. It was established that errors in point grinding lead to increased <b>hole</b> <b>oversize</b> and reduced drill life. A fundamental analysis was made to establish predictive equations for the drill torque and thrust using modified orthogonal cutting equations and empirical data. A good correlation was obtained between actual and predicted results. Two new techniques for extending twist drill life by the use of coolant feeding holes and also the application of titanium nitride coatings were evaluated. Both methods were found to have potential for improving drill performance. A completely new design of carbide tipped drill was designed and developed. The new design was tested and it compared favourably with two commercially available carbide tipped drills. In further work an entirely different type of drill point geometry was developed for the drill screw. A new design was produced which enabled the drilling time to be minimised for the low thrust forces that were likely to be used with hand held power tools...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contexts}} {{where the}} application requires extremely tight (narrow) tolerance ranges, the requirement may push slightly past {{the limit of}} {{the ability of the}} machining and other processes (stamping, rolling, bending, etc.) to stay within the range. In such cases, selective assembly is used to compensate for a lack of total interchangeability among the parts. Thus, for a pin that must have a sliding fit in its hole (free but not sloppy), the dimension may be spec'd as 12.00 +0 −0.01 mm for the pin, and 12.00 +.01 −0 for the hole. Pins that came out oversize (say a pin at 12.003mm diameter) are not necessarily scrap, but they can only be mated with counterparts that also came out <b>oversize</b> (say a <b>hole</b> at 12.013mm). The same is then true for matching undersize parts with undersize counterparts. Inherent in this example is that for this product's application, the 12 mm dimension does not require extreme accuracy, but the desired fit between the parts does require good precision (see the article on accuracy and precision). This allows the makers to [...] "cheat a little" [...] on total interchangeability in order to get more value out of the manufacturing effort by reducing the rejection rate (scrap rate). This is a sound engineering decision as long as the application and context support it. For example, for machines {{for which there is no}} intention for any future field service of a parts-replacing nature (but rather only simple replacement of the whole unit), this makes good economic sense. It lowers the unit cost of the products, and it does not impede future service work.|$|R
