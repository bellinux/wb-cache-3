This area is in the ward of Harlescott. A further four SOAs fall into the bottom 30% nationally, these being in the wards of Monkmoor, Sundorne, Battlefield and Heathgates and Meole Brace. The most affluent areas of the town are generally to the south and west, around the grounds of Shrewsbury School, and the Copthorne area.|$|E

5000|$|Super <b>Output</b> <b>Areas</b> (SOAs) are {{a set of}} {{geographical}} areas developed following the 2001 census, initially to facilitate the calculation of the Indices of Deprivation 2004 and subsequently {{for a range of}} additional Neighbourhood Statistics (NeSS). The aim was to produce a set of areas of consistent size, whose boundaries would not change (unlike electoral wards), suitable for the publication of data such as the Indices of Deprivation. They are an aggregation of adjacent <b>Output</b> <b>Areas</b> with similar social characteristics. Lower Layer Super <b>Output</b> <b>Areas</b> (LSOAs) typically contain 4 to 6 OAs with a population of around 1500. Middle Layer Super <b>Output</b> <b>Areas</b> (MSOAs) on average have a population of 7,200. [...] The hierarchy of <b>Output</b> <b>Areas</b> and the two tiers of Super <b>Output</b> <b>Areas</b> have become known as the Neighbourhood Statistics Geography.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{a single}} {{geographical}} unit to both collect and disseminate census data is common in many countries across the world, especially in developing countries. In South Africa this approach poses some challenges, as the design of small geographical units called enumeration areas to facilitate data collection differs considerably from the design of units that aid data analysis and interpretation. We aimed to create optimised census <b>output</b> <b>areas</b> using the Automated Zone-design Tool (AZTool) program, using the 2001 census enumeration areas as building blocks at various spatial levels, for both rural and urban settings in two South African provinces. The results were consistent and stable. The primary criterion of the confidentiality limit of 500 people was respected at all geographical levels or regions, in both urban and rural settings, for newly created optimised <b>output</b> <b>areas.</b> For the second criterion, lower intra-area correlation values at lower geographical levels for both rural and urban areas showed that higher geographical levels produced more homogeneous <b>output</b> <b>areas</b> than did lower geographical levels or regions. Our obtained intra-area correlation of 0. 62 for the two provinces combined indicated that the selected homogeneity variables were good indicators of social homogeneity for creating optimised <b>output</b> <b>areas</b> in South Africa. We conclude that the AZTool software {{can be used to}} effectively and objectively create optimised <b>output</b> <b>areas</b> for South African data. Further research on the comparison of the newly created <b>output</b> <b>areas</b> with existing <b>output</b> <b>areas</b> in South Africa should be explored...|$|R

25|$|Parts {{of eastern}} Essex suffer from {{high levels of}} deprivation; {{one of the most}} highly {{deprived}} wards is in the seaside town of Clacton. In the Indices of deprivation 2007, Jaywick was identified as the most deprived Lower Super <b>Output</b> <b>Area</b> in Southern England. Unemployment was estimated at 44% and many homes were found to lack severely basic amenities. The Brooklands and Grasslands area of Jaywick were found to be the third-most deprived area in England; two areas in Liverpool and Manchester were rated more deprived. In contrast, west and south-west Essex {{is one of the most}} affluent parts of eastern England, forming part of the London commuter belt. There is a large middle class here, and the area is widely known for its private schools. In 2008, The Daily Telegraph found Ingatestone and Brentwood to be the 14th- and 19th-richest towns in the UK respectively.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the city's first Welsh School (Ysgol Gymraeg Bryntaf) in the 1950s, Welsh has regained ground. Aided by Welsh-medium education and migration from other parts of Wales, there has been {{a significant increase in the}} number and percentage of Welsh speakers, with numbers doubling in the 20 years between the 1991 and 2011 censuses, from 18,071 (6.6%) to 36,735 (11.1%) residents aged three years and above. Cardiff City Council adopted a 5-year Welsh language strategy in 2017 in order to increase the number of Welsh speakers (aged 3+) in Cardiff by 15.9%, from 36,735 in 2011 to 42,584 residents by the 2021 Census. The LSOA (Lower Layer Super <b>Output</b> <b>Area)</b> with the highest percentage of Welsh speakers in the city-centre is found in Canton, at 25.5%.

Lower super <b>output</b> <b>areas</b> are the next level above Census enumeration districts (see Vickers and Rees (2007) for more on the creation of 2001 Census <b>output</b> <b>areas).</b> The domains that make up the WIMD are: access to services; education, skills and training; employment; health; housing; income, and physical environment. For this study, the WIMD was chosen because it is the index used by the Welsh Assembly Government, and it has a domain which focuses on health, which is most relevant here.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the boom}} times of tourism in the 1950s {{there was not}} a large enough local {{workforce}} to service the needs of the tourism industry during the summer months.

At its peak over 10,000 holidaymakers used the railway each Saturday during peak season, and passenger ferries brought still more. [...] When the tourism market faltered with the arrival of cheap foreign package holidays in the 1960s, and the closure of the railway, unemployment levels rose.

2500|$|The {{benefits}} of continuous presses is the [...] "continuous" [...] sequence that allows {{large volumes of}} grapes to be pressed with minimum labor involvement. Instead of pressing separate batches {{that need to be}} emptied and refilled, continuous press typically have an input area and some mechanism (such as an auger screw or belt) that transfers the grapes through the pressings with an <b>output</b> <b>area</b> for the discarded cake. The throughput is limited by the capacity of the tank and the diameter of the screw or width of the belts. Many models of continuous screw presses can process from 50 to upwards of a 100 metric tonnes an hour.
