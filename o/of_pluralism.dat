Also the King was eager to reward his capable servant; in 1341 {{he was given the}} prebend of Leighton Manor (Lincoln), by 1344 he also held that of Netheravon (Salisbury), and by 1345 that of Putston (Hereford). This level <b>of</b> <b>pluralism</b> was not unusual at the time. His greatest preferment, however, came with his papal appointment– on the King's request– to the see of Winchester in 1345. This was the richest see in England, considered second only to the archbishopric of Milan.|$|E

25|$|After the {{two terms}} of Democrat Grover Cleveland, the {{election}} of William McKinley in 1896 is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is sometimes cited as a realigning election.

25|$|The World Englishes initiative, in {{recognizing}} and describing the New Englishes of the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, has been partly {{motivated by a}} consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by {{a consideration of the}} wider cultural and political contexts of language acquisition and use.

The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.|$|E
25|$|Bowles was Rector of {{the parish}} of St Peter, Brackley, Northamptonshire for 37 years, from 1729 to 1766. From January 1734 he also held two Berkshire parishes, being the {{absentee}} Rector of Tubney (from 18 January) and Aston Tirrold (from 19 January). He would seldom if ever have ministered in either Tubney or Aston Tirrold: Bowles followed the then common Church of England practice <b>of</b> <b>pluralism,</b> under which Rectors could hold a number of parishes for their tithe or glebe income, use some of that income to pay a perpetual curate to minister in each parish, and keep the difference.|$|E

25|$|Many {{groups and}} {{individuals}} (both in Morocco and abroad) reacted favorably to the revised code, pointing out that from an economic perspective, it finally legally recognized women’s economic contributions to the household – not an insignificant point, as in 2000, women represented {{over a third of}} the Moroccan workforce. Supporters point out that the reforms indicate a democratization of Moroccan society on two fronts: because of the sense <b>of</b> <b>pluralism</b> and debate they sparked in the public sphere, and because of their movement towards an individual-based rights system, as opposed to one based on collective rights.|$|E

The congress also opened a discussion on the place <b>of</b> <b>pluralism</b> in Socialist Democracy, which was to continue until 1985. It also invited contributions from the Workers' Socialist League in Britain, developing a relationship which led to WSL's successor organisation joining the International in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue has}} been a subject of {{contention}} within modern Jewish denominations, and has led to debate and division. Traditionally, Judaism has understood homosexual male intercourse as contrary to Judaism, and this opinion is still maintained by Orthodox Judaism. On the other hand, Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism do not hold this view and allow homosexual intercourse and same-sex marriage. Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which until December 2006 held {{the same position as}} Orthodoxy, recently issued multiple opinions under its philosophy <b>of</b> <b>pluralism,</b> with one opinion continuing to follow the Orthodox position and another opinion substantially liberalizing its view of homosexual sex and relationships while continuing to regard certain sexual acts as prohibited.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{surveys of}} {{religion}} and values in Great Britain, this paper suggests that Peter Berger’s paradigm <b>of</b> two <b>pluralisms</b> can be usefully supplemented by taking account of a third kind <b>of</b> intensified <b>pluralism.</b> This involves {{the breakdown of the}} boundaries between religions, and between the religious and the secular, and is therefore a <b>pluralism</b> <b>of</b> de-differentiation.

25|$|On 7 October 2010, Annan was {{appointed}} to the Board of Directors of the Global Center for Pluralism, Canada’s new international research and education center dedicated to the study and practice <b>of</b> <b>pluralism</b> worldwide. The Global Center for Pluralism is an initiative of His Highness the Aga Khan in partnership with the Government of Canada. The Center is located in Ottawa, Canada. Dedicated to the creation of successful societies, the Center is founded on the premise that tolerance, openness and understanding towards the cultures, social structures, values and faiths of other peoples are essential to the very survival of an interdependent world. Pluralism is no longer simply an asset or a prerequisite for progress and development.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards issued three responsa on {{the subject}} of Niddah. All three ruled the {{traditional}} requirements of ritual washing remained in effect for Conservative Jews (with some leniencies and liberalization of interpretation), but disagreed on the reasoning for continuing this practices {{as well as on the}} validity of specific leniencies. Two of the opinions reflect reasoning similar to the respective Orthodox views (Biblical requirements or rabbinic ordinances enacted in remembrance of the Temple.) A third opinion expressed the view that Conservative Judaism should disconnect ritual purity practices from the Temple in Jerusalem or its memory, and offered a new approach based on what it called the concept of holiness rather than the concept of purity. Thus, Conservative ideology, under its philosophy <b>of</b> <b>pluralism,</b> supports a range of views on this subject, from views similar to the Orthodox view to views expressing a need for a contemporary reorientation. Most Conservative Jews do not observe the laws of niddah.|$|E
25|$|The Applicant {{responded that}} the {{provisions}} used {{to ban the}} marches applied only to the safety and suitability of proposed venues rather than to a general risk of violence, and that the authorities on refusing an application for these reasons were obliged to suggest an alternative venue, which had not been done. He further contended that the Government's definition of morals was incorrect, as it referred only to majoritarian public opinion {{without regard to the}} concepts <b>of</b> <b>pluralism</b> or diversity. Furthermore, the proposed marches would not have been a threat to morals as they were concerned with human rights and civil liberties and would not have involved any sexually provocative content. He claimed the Government's references to public safety were unsubstantiated as they had not demonstrated an assessed risk of violence. He claimed finally that the sweeping nature of the ban was disproportionate and could not be justified {{on the grounds that it}} may have shocked or confused some parts of society (Bączkowski v Poland).|$|E

Before screening the film for the Indonesian Film Censor Board, several scenes were cut, including one in which a pig's head was displayed in the window of Sun's restaurant; other scenes that raised commentary were kept, although trimmed. Prior to the film's release, Bramantyo consulted about twenty people, including several religious leaders, in an attempt to ensure that the film was not offensive. Titien Wattimena was brought in to work further with the script; she put more emphasis on the message of tolerance.|$|E
