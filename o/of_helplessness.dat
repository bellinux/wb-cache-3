30|$|Korean {{students}} show a high possibility <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> {{when they}} strongly agreed that their failure {{is due to}} their ability (the probability is 0.84), task difficulty (the probability is 0.77), or even misfortune (the probability is 0.63). However, if students report any degrees of disagreement that they could succeed in mathematics with sufficient effort, they report high probabilities <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> (the probability is 0.67 for “disagree” while 0.80 for “strongly disagree”). In addition, students’ answers about their ability make the widest range of probabilities <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> (from 0.11 to 0.84) while those about luck have the narrowest range (from 0.35 to 0.63).|$|R

25|$|During {{and after}} the initial investigations, social cliques within high schools were widely discussed. One {{perception}} formed was that both Klebold and Harris had been isolated from their classmates, prompting feelings <b>of</b> <b>helplessness,</b> insecurity, and depression, {{as well as a}} strong need for attention. This concept has been questioned, as both Harris and Klebold had a close circle of friends and a wider informal social group.|$|E

25|$|A common {{reason for}} the active partner to tie up their partner is so both may gain {{pleasure}} from the restrained partner's submission and {{the feeling of the}} temporary transfer of control and power. For sadomasochistic people, bondage is often used as a means to an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The restrained partner can derive sensual pleasure from the feeling <b>of</b> <b>helplessness</b> and immobility, and the active partner can derive visual pleasure and satisfaction from seeing their partner tied up.|$|E
25|$|Learned {{helplessness}} theory {{posits that}} because human bodies are only alterable {{to a certain}} point, people {{develop a sense of}} body shame and anxiety from which they create a feeling <b>of</b> <b>helplessness</b> in relation to correcting their physical appearance and helplessness in being able to control the way in which others perceive their appearance. This lack of control often results in depression. In relating to a lack of motivation, objectification theory states that women have less control in relationships and the work environment because they have to depend on the evaluation of another who is typically basing their evaluation on physical appearance. Since the dependence on another's evaluation limits a woman's ability to create her own positive experiences and motivation, it adversely increases her likelihood for depression. Furthermore, sexual victimization may be a cause. Specifically, victimization within the workplace degrades women. Harassment experienced every day wears on a woman, and sometimes results in a state of depression.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore perceived organisational injustice through the lens <b>of</b> learnt <b>helplessness</b> in a Norwegian post-merger case study focusing on an ageing knowledge-based workforce. The case describes a lucrative large-scale early retirement organisational downsizing deployed only in the headquarters, located in Norway, but not offered across country subsidiaries. This qualitative research collected data from 28 semi-structured face-to-face interviews and other observations. This study was based on the assumption that organisational injustice would prevail with observed counter-productive workplace behaviours (CWBs). Three research questions were formulated: 1) Does perceived organisational injustice always lead to the expected CWB? 2) To what degree does learnt helplessness function as a buffer against the expected CWB resulting from perceived organisational injustice? 3) What are the antecedents and consequences <b>of</b> learnt <b>helplessness?</b> A key contribution of this study is to provide a unique case where injustice does not always lead to the predicted negative organisational outcomes of CWBs under the conditions <b>of</b> learnt <b>helplessness.</b> The case illustrates that organisational culture is the antecedent <b>of</b> learnt <b>helplessness,</b> which in turn, has buffering effects against the predicted CWBs...|$|R
30|$|The {{attribution}} theory {{could contribute}} to better understanding <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> in students in Korea and Finland. At the same time, the findings reinforce that learned helplessness is a complex problem in which multiple factors at different levels are involved. Students are unlikely to feel learned helplessness when {{they believe that they}} fail due to misfortune or they can succeed with enough effort. Furthermore, recent movement to make the Korean national curriculum easier might contribute to reducing the chance <b>of</b> students’ learned <b>helplessness.</b> However, because missing is empirical evidence to connect mathematics abandoners and feeling <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness,</b> I cannot argue that all Korean students could have benefits from easier tasks to resolve feeling <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness.</b> I recognize that this is an important limitation of this study. However, we need to help mathematics abandoners and the findings in this article partially contribute to this. Also, mathematics educators should be concerned about other educational and social factors impacting on learned helplessness because attribution theory cannot explain learned helplessness completely.|$|R

25|$|In 1979, Ronald Reagan {{visited the}} NORAD command base, Cheyenne Mountain Complex, {{where he was}} first {{introduced}} to the extensive tracking and detection systems extending throughout {{the world and into}} space. However, he was struck by their comments that while they could track the attack down to the individual targets, there was nothing one could do to stop it. Reagan felt that {{in the event of an}} attack this would place the president in a terrible position, having to choose between immediate counterattack or attempting to absorb the attack and then maintain an upper hand in the post-attack era. Shultz suggests that this feeling <b>of</b> <b>helplessness,</b> coupled with the defensive ideas proposed by Teller a decade earlier, combined to form the impetus of the SDI. In the fall of 1979, at Reagan's request, Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham, the former head of the DIA, briefed Reagan on a concept he called the High Frontier, a missile shield composed of multi-layered ground- and space-based weapons that could track, intercept, and destroy ballistic missiles, which would theoretically be possible because of emerging technologies. It was designed to replace the MAD doctrine that Reagan and his aides described as a suicide pact. In September 1981, Graham formed a small, Virginia-based think tank called High Frontier to continue research on the missile shield. The Heritage Foundation provided High Frontier with space to conduct research, and Graham published a 1982 report entitled, “High Frontier: A New National Strategy” that examined in greater detail how the system would function.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{psychological}} phenomenon <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> is investigated {{to determine its}} significance as a characteristic of members of progressive co-operatives within the South African context. Most {{of the members of}} these co-operatives are black South Africans. It is argued that because of the country's racial policy, many of the members have become accustomed to a passive response to events in their lives and this gives rise to their failure to utilise the freedom and opportunities of the co-operative structure. The researcher hypothesises that this passive response could be explained in terms of a high level <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> among co-operative members. Two hypotheses are investigated in this study: Hypothesis 1 : Passive co-operative members will have higher levels <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> than active members. Hypothesis 2 :The level <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness</b> decreases as the length of co-operative members involvement increases. Data collection for this study was carried out by combining a personal interview and a standardised questionnaire (the Attributional Style Questionnaire). To distinguish between the passive and active members, a Participation Index was constructed. The ASQ was translated into Xhosa, adapted for the sample and two translators were employed to conduct the interviews in Xhosa. The sample consisted of 50 black South Africans, many with limited education and was drawn from six co-operatives in the Eastern Cape. No {{significant differences were found between}} the active and passive groups in terms of their levels <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness.</b> Furthermore, the length of involvement in the co-operative had no effect on the level <b>of</b> learned <b>helplessness.</b> No support was found therefore for Hypothesis l and 2. A significant difference, however, was found between active and passive members and the number of months of involvement. This suggests that the length of involvement has an effect on how active members will be in the co-operative. The results of this study indicate that generally the sample does not suffer from learned helplessness. It is argued that Hypothesis 2 is not supported due to confounding variables. The study raises many doubts as to the reliability of the ASQ and the Participation Index used in the study...|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Collins, {{it was noted that}} the novel [...] "tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others." [...] The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate. The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>helplessness</b> that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations. On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly writes that the book [...] "is an incisive satire of reality television shows", and that the character of Cinna [...] "almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of Project Runway, using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas." ...|$|E
