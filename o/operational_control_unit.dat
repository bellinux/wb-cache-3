40|$|Abstract –The {{development}} of a PV-converter based on the advanced Multi-String concept results in significantly reduced specific costs while still profiting from the well-known advantages of the String-converter technology developed by ISET and SMA in the mid-nineties. The paper deals with the basic considerations from a system’s {{point of view that}} resulted in the {{development of}} the Multi-String-converter. The features of the Multi-String-Converter concerning operational behaviour and PV-system design are described. Due to enhanced capacity of the <b>operational</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> the Multi-String-converter can be used additionally for active compensation of harmonics and reactive power in order to improve the power quality. An evaluation of Multi-String-Converters in comparison with String-converters or conventional Central-converter concepts is presented. The selected topology and the control strategy for the Multi-String-Converter are introduced...|$|E

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2002, {{more than}} 13. 500 Wind Turbines (WTs) with an {{installed}} capacity of 12. 000 MW generated approx. 17. 300 GWh and supplied about 3. 6 % of the German electricity consumption. Today, the electrical power generated from wind already covers the total grid load in some grid areas temporarily. According to Federal Government planning, in the long-term wind turbines will be erected with a total power of up to 25 GW in the North and Baltic Seas, which would cover around 15 % of the German electricity consumption. For the capability of these immense powers to {{be integrated into the}} energy supply system, however, the wind turbines installed on land are also to be considered. Here, an installed wind power of around 10, 000 MW is to be reckoned with, alone {{in the area of the}} grid operator E. ON Netz GmbH, up to the year 2007. These large intermittend generation have growing influence on the loading and security of grids, the operation of other power plants and on the economics of the complete German supply system. It is today already foreseeable that these demands must be reacted on with both technical and regulative measures. Large (offshore) wind farms will therefore require access to a central <b>operational</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> in order to coordinate and control the operation of many individual wind turbines with correspondingly defined demands. The paper will present new operational control strategies to provide a multitude of new possibilities to enable simple, flexible and undisturbed reaction to the demands of participants (wind farm operators, grid operators). These operational control strategies are mainly based on ISETs successful employed wind power prediction tools (E. ON Netz, RWE Net, Vattenfall Europe Transmission) and will enable energy and power control, as well as the provision of reactive power, in order to maintain comparable properties to conventional power plant types...|$|E

The Slovak Expeditionary Army Group of about 45,000 entered the Soviet Union shortly after the German attack.

50|$|Activation of GHQ Air Force {{represented}} {{a compromise between}} strategic airpower advocates and ground force commanders who demanded that the Air Corps mission remain tied {{to that of the}} land forces. Airpower advocates achieved a centralized <b>control</b> of air <b>units</b> under an air commander, while the WDGS divided authority within the air arm and assured a continuing policy of support of ground operations as its primary role. GHQ Air Force organized combat groups administratively into a strike force of three wings deployed to the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts but was small in comparison to European air forces. Lines of authority were difficult, at best, since GHQ Air Force controlled only operations of its combat units while the Air Corps was still responsible for doctrine, acquisition of aircraft, and training. Corps area commanders continued to exercise control over airfields and administration of personnel, and in the overseas departments, <b>operational</b> <b>control</b> of <b>units</b> as well.

40|$|Although the {{importance}} of command and control (C 2) training has grown in recent years, many C 2 organizations are having difficulty in meeting training requirements. A number of solutions have recently been proposed to provide effective training for the Air Force (AF) battle management crews responsible for tactical-level command and control (C 2) in the Theater Air Control System (TACS) Modular Control Equipment (MCE). Some proposed solutions include intelligent tutors and stand-alone systems. Stand-alone systems currently do not provide training for the complete TACS MCE functionality. The {{most effective way to}} provide TACS training is to have the traineesemploy the equipment they aetuaIly use, interfaced with other entities, and all operating in a realistic synthetic battlespace. Although it has been possible to interface several <b>operational</b> modular <b>control</b> <b>units</b> together for operator training, these Systems Training Exercises (STEs) have typically involved a large investment of time and manpower for planning, scenario generation, and operation. In addition, these training exercises have been expensive. Joint Service Training Exercises (JSTEs) have involved an even greater investment of time, manning, and funding. The JSTE cost is so great that operators do not have an opportunity to participate on a regular basis.
