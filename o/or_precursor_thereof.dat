40|$|Mutants of Escherichia coli were {{isolated}} and identified as lacking key enzymes of specific anaplerotic equences. With these muntants {{it was shown}} that growth on pyruvate <b>or</b> <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof</b> necessitates the functioning of an acetyl-COA dependant PEP carboxylase, and that growth on acetate requires the operation of isocitrate lyase. The growth of all the PSP carboxylase-less mutants on acetate was inhibited by addition of pyaruvate <b>or</b> <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof.</b> Analysis of this effect of pyruvate and substances derived from it on the behaviour of whole cells and cell-free extracts suggested that the phenomenan {{is due to the}} inhibition by PEP of isocitrate lyase. Further studies with mutants which lacked the ability to convert pyruvate to PEP or which were derepressed for isocitrate lyase suggested that the inhibition of isocitrate lyase by PEP was of physiological significance and provides a means whereby the rate of operation of the glyoxylate cycle is controlled. Isocitrato lyase has been partially purified and its properties investigated. An anaplerotic enzyme of glyoxylate metabolism, tartronic semi-aldehyde/(TSA) reductase was shown to be formed during growth of E. coli on DL-glycerate. Studies on the behaviour of mutants devoid of glycollic oxidase or PEP carboxylase or citrate synthase activities indicate, however, that the formation of TSA reductase is not an indication of a pathway of glycerate metabolism distinct from the glycolytic sequences: rather it is concluded that it functions as one component of the enzymic system catalysing the interconversion of the D and L isomers of glycerate...|$|R

40|$|Ergot {{alkaloids}} are nitrogen-containing {{natural products}} belonging to indole alkaloids. The best known producers are fungi of the phylum Ascomycota, e. g., Claviceps, Epichloë, Penicillium and Aspergillus species. According to their structures, ergot alkaloids {{can be divided}} into three groups: clavines, lysergic acid amides and peptides (ergopeptines). All of them share the first biosynthetic steps, which lead to the formation of the tetracyclic ergoline ring system (except the simplest, tricyclic compound: chanoclavine). Different modifications on the ergoline ring by specific enzymes result in an abundance of bioactive natural products, which are used as pharmaceutical drugs <b>or</b> <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof.</b> From the 1950 s through to recent years, most of the biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated.

40|$|Situations of {{extremely}} low substrate availability, resulting in slow growth, {{are common in}} natural environments.

Stress resistance mechanisms were not massively induced during transition to extremely slow growth. The energy-generating metabolism was remarkably stable and remained largely based on the conversion of glucose to lactate. The combination of metabolic and transcriptomic analyses revealed behaviors involved in interactions with the environment, more particularly with plants: production of plant hormones <b>or</b> <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof,</b> and preparedness for the utilization of plant-derived substrates. Accordingly, the production of compounds interfering with plant root development was demonstrated in slow-growing L. plantarum.

40|$|BACKGROUND: All organisms use cofactors {{to extend}} the {{catalytic}} capacities of proteins. Many bacteria and archaea can synthesize cofactors from primary metabolites, {{but there are also}} prokaryotes that do not have the complete biosynthetic pathways for all essential cofactors. These organisms are dependent on the uptake of cofactors, or at least their precursors that cannot be synthesized, from the environment. Even in those organisms that contain complete biosynthetic pathways membrane transporters are usually present, because the synthesis of cofactors is more costly than uptake. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here we give an overview of bacterial and archaeal transport systems for B-type vitamins, which are either cofactors <b>or</b> <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof.</b> MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Prokaryotic vitamin transporters are extremely diverse, and found in many families of transporters. A few of these transport systems have been characterized in detail, but for most of them mechanistic insight is lacking. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The lack of structural and functional understanding of bacterial vitamin transporters is unfortunate because they may be targets for new antibiotics.

40|$|A mutational {{and genetic}} {{analysis}} of the poliovirus protein 3 A {{has led to the}} identification of a single amino acid mutant virus with a restrictive phenotype to form plaques in Vero cells. This mutant (I 46 T 3 A) can be grown and amplified in HeLa cells, where virus replication takes place at wild-type levels. However, Vero cells infected with this virus cannot complete the growth cycle. I 46 T 3 A virus has a defect in the ability to kill Vero cells, as estimated by FACS analysis of propidium iodide uptake by dead cells. Since these defects are observed under conditions where no abnormalities in the rate of synthesis and processing of the mutant polyprotein occur, the inability to induce the cytopathic effect in infected Vero cells denotes the existence of a defect in the activity of 3 A, but not the level of expression of the viral genome. As a consequence of this impaired capability to generate the cytopathic effect, I 46 T 3 A mutant viruses cannot be titrated by plaque assay in Vero cells. Only revertant viruses with the wild-type sequence arise and form lysis plaques in Vero cells. Our results suggest a role for the 3 A protein (<b>or</b> a <b>precursor</b> <b>thereof)</b> in the virusinduced cytopathic effect.

Virol. 60 : 43 - 53, 1986). Viruses {{used to produce}} the CRC were poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney), [PV- 1 (M) ], poliovirus type 1 (Sabin) [PV- 1 (S) ], and four in vitro recombinants that were constructed from infectious cDNA clones. RNA synthesis in CRC was studied. No end-linked, full-length double-stranded poliovirus RNA was detected in CRC regardless of whether nonionic detergent (Nonidet P- 40) was added prior to incubation. Synthesis of VPg-pU and VPg-pUpU, two nucleotidyl proteins presumed {{to be involved in}} the initiation of RNA synthesis, was slower at 30 degrees C in CRC induced by PV- 1 (S) than by PV- 1 (M). This observation was used to design a pulse-chase experiment whose result suggested that synthesis of VPg-pUpU occurred by uridylylation of VPg-pU. Synthesis of VPg-pU(pU) was thermosensitive in CRC induced by PV- 1 (S). With CRC of recombinant viruses, the thermosensitive block covaried to nucleotide substitutions in PV- 1 (S) that mapped to the virus-induced RNA polymerase 3 Dpol. We conclude that plus-stranded RNA synthesis in CRC does not proceed via hairpin structures. The results of VPg-pU [...] VPg-pUpU synthesis are consistent with a model in which VPg-pU is the primer of RNA synthesis mediated by 3 Dpol.

40|$|The {{transport}} of metabolites, coenzymes, and ions across the mitochondrial inner membrane is still poorly understood. In most cases, membrane transport is {{facilitated by the}} so-called mitochondrial carrier proteins. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 35 members of the carrier family, but a function has been identified for only 13 proteins. Here, we investigated the yeast carrier Leu 5 p (encoded by the gene YHR 002 w) and its close human homologue Graves' disease protein. Leu 5 p is inserted into the mitochondrial inner membrane along the specialized import pathway used by carrier proteins. Deletion of LEU 5 (strain Δleu 5) {{was accompanied by a}} 15 -fold reduction of mitochondrial coenzyme A (CoA) levels but did not affect the cytosolic CoA content. As a consequence, the activities of several mitochondrial CoA-dependent enzymes were strongly decreased in Δleu 5 cells.

The function of the human protein might not be directly linked to the disease, as antisera derived from patients with active Graves' disease do not recognize the protein after expression in yeast, suggesting that it does not represent a major autoantigen.

40|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} {{is considered}} as a major risk factor of cardiovascular complications of type I and types II diabetes. Impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation can be directly linked to a decreased synthesis of the endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) and/or {{an increase in the}} production of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. Administration of tetrahydrobiopterin, an important co-factor for the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), has been demonstrated to enhance NO production in prehypertensive rats, restore endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in coronary arteries following reperfusion injury, aortae from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation has been shown to improve endothelium-dependent relaxation in normal individuals, patients with type II diabetes and in smokers. These findings from different animal models as well as in clinical trials lead to the hypothesis that tetrahydrobiopterin, <b>or</b> a <b>precursor</b> <b>thereof,</b> could be a new and an effective therapeutic approach for the improvement of endothelium function in pathophysiological conditions. In addition to NO, the endothelium also produces a variety of other vasoactive factors and a key question is: Is there also a link to changes in the synthesis/action of these other endothelium-derived factors to the cardiovascular complications associated with diabetes? Endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, or EDHF, is thought to be an extremely important vasodilator substance notably in the resistance vasculature. Unfortunately, the nature and, indeed, the very existence of EDHF remains obscure. Potentially there are multiple EDHFs demonstrating vessel selectivity in their actions. However, until now, identity and properties of EDHF that determine the therapeutic potential of manipulating EDHF remains unknown.

40|$|Plants use {{at least}} two main {{strategies}} to protect themselves against pathogens and herbivores: by a physical barrier making the plant content inaccessible to the invader and/or by the production of appetite spoiling or even toxic components (<b>or</b> the <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof).</b> Apart from shaping the habitus of plants, cell walls, a rigid and tightly interwoven fabric consisting mainly of polysaccharides, constitute a formidable physical barrier. The primary cell wall is a relatively thin layer made up of carbohydrates and structural proteins. The secondary cell wall is a thicker layer rich in cellulose and lignin, polymers that greatly contribute to the physical strength of the plant cell wall. Combined the two cell wall elements constitute a compact protective layer. On top of this physical barrier, plants may produce secondary metabolites to reduce its attractiveness as a food source for pathogens and herbivores. Some plant families are well known by the production of specific categories of metabolites that reduce their attractiveness for herbivores. The plantain family (Plantaginaceae) harbours a wide diversity of genera including Plantago (about 200 species). Some Plantago species {{are known for their}} anti-toxic and antimicrobial characteristics. Iridoid glucosides such as aucubin and catalpol are terpenoid secondary metabolites produced by a range of plantain species, and the components make these plants unattractive for a wide spectrum of herbivores. Upon cleaving of the sugar residue by beta-glucosidases either from the plant or from the digestive tract of the invading organism, the resulting aglycon acts un-specifically by cross linking proteins and the inhibitions of enzymes. Iridoids are a class of compounds with as a core a cyclopentane fused to a 6 -C oxygen heterocycle. All by all, iridoid glucosides are precursors of defence molecules against a broad range of pathogens and herbivores (Dobler et al., 2011). Members of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) produce another category of non-specific anti-feedants. The genus Ranunculus L. (buttercups) comprises about 600 herbaceous species, and fresh buttercup plant parts are poisonous {{for a wide range of}} organisms. This can be explained by a secondary metabolite named ranunculin. Upon de-compartimentation (chewing, maceration etc.), the enzyme beta-glucosidase, normally stored in the vacuole, comes into contact with ranunculin, and as a result this glucoside is broken down to form the volatile lactone protoanemonin (C 5 H 4 O 2). This highly reactive component has anti-microbial properties, and ingestion by herbivorous mammals results in erythema and blistering (Sedivy et al., 2012; Martin et al., 1990). Yet another plant family that produces relatively harmless glycosides that are turned into toxic compounds upon the mechanical damaging of plant tissues is the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Over 100 types of glucosinolates are produced by members of this family. This class of secondary metabolites are the most important flavour compounds in edible representatives such as cabbage, 2 mustard and horseradish. The actual reason why these compounds are produced is (again) the defence against pathogens and herbivores. Just like we’ve seen for the Plantaginaceae and the Ranunculaceae, Brassicaceae produce precursors that are converted into toxic components upon de-compartimentation. The activating enzyme myrosinase (a thioglucoside glucohydrolase) is stored in the vacuole. Upon damaging or maceration of the plant tissue, myrosinase cleaves off the thio-linked glucose from its substrate, and the resulting chemically-unstable aglycone is converted into toxic isothiocyanate or related components (Textor & Gershenzon, 2009). The ban of certain categories of soil fumigantia and the severe restrictions with regard to the application of those fumigants that are still on the market to control soil-borne diseases including plant-parasitic fungi and nematodes have been the driving factors behind a search to find effective environmentally acceptable alternatives. One of the options was the use specific types of green manure. Incorporation in the topsoil of plant material harbouring compounds (<b>or</b> <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof)</b> that are toxic for a range of soil borne pathogens is called biofumigation. As compared to aglycones such as protoamonin from buttercups or iridoids from plantain species, the effective products released upon mechanically damaging Brassicaceous plant parts are relatively stable and volatile. Hence it will spread easily throughout the topsoil. In fact, the incorporation of mulched Brassicaceous material could be considered as a natural replacement of the soil fumigant metam sodium (Matthiessen & Kirkegaard, 2006). Recently we investigated in a field experiment in the western part of Germany the impact of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) on plant parasitic and free-living nematode taxa (Vervoort et al., 2014). Just before the incorporation of plant material in the topsoil, aliquots of above and below plant parts were sampled and the glucosinolate content was determined both qualitatively and quantitatively. As a positive control 2 -propenyl ITC was directed applied to the control plots. Although the impact of the incorporation of mulched Indian mustard material on the nematode community was clear and significant, this impact could not be attributed the effect of isothiocyanates on the nematode community. The severe physical disturbance of the soil in combination with addition of a large quantity of green manure alone sufficed to explain the observed changes. Even more remarkable: the positive control treatments by direct application of 2 -propenyl ITC (two concentrations, the highest being two times the concentration predicted for the highest producing Indian mustard cultivar) had no significant effect on the nematode taxa under investigation. We cannot rule out the possibility that local circumstances such as soil type, organic matter type and content, moisture content and/or temperature of the soil at the day of biofumigation can be explanatory factors for the absence of a clear glucosinolate-related response. Our results suggest that a more widely acceptance of bio-fumigation as a tool to manage soil borne pathogens would require an increase in the efficacy and the robustness of this tool. In this paper we pay attention to some other plant families that a producing broad-spectrum toxic components (aglycones) upon maceration and/or physical damage. It could be worthwhile to investigate the impact of the simultaneous release of multiple plant-derived aglycones on plant pathogenic soil biota. The two ‘other’ plant families highlighted in this paper, the Plantaginaceae and the Ranunculaceae, should just be considered as examples (not necessarily the best ones) of families producing distinct broad-spectrum anti-microbial aglycones. We hypothesize that simultaneous exposure of soil pathogens to multiple plant defense-related aglycones could contribute to an improved efficacy and robustness of biofumigation...|$|R

In Kombination mit Labeling-Methoden ist sie eine äußerst geeignete Technik um NMR-Spektren von Makromolekülen zu vereinfachen. NMR-Spektroskopie wird unter anderem zur Untersuchung von Proteinen, sowie deren Falteigenschaften und chemischen und biochemischen Reaktionen benutzt. Proteine haben typischerweise eine hohe Molekülmasse sowie eine hohe Anzahl an Spin-Systemen, die für schwer interpretierbare NMR Spektren verantwortlich sind, weshalb es notwendig ist 13 C- und 15 N- Isotope in das Molekül zu integrieren um die jeweiligen Spektren zu vereinfachen. Die Entwicklung einer neuen synthetischen Route, ausgehend von wirtschaftlich tragbaren und einfach zugänglichen Ausgangsprodukten, hin zu 13 C Isotopen-markiertem Phenylalanin, ist der Hauptfokus dieser Arbeit. Zur Markierung wurden [13 C]-Essigsäure, [13 C]-Formaldehyd, [13 C]-Allylalkohol und [13 C]-Glycine verwendet. Die Synthesestrategie muss den regioselektiven Einbau von markierten Isotopen erlauben und so möglicherweise die Durchführung völlig neuer NMR-Experimente erlauben. Schlüsselschritte der Strategie sind vor allem die Ringschluß-Metatheses sowie eine Indium-unterstützte Allylierungsmethode. Der zweite Teil dieser Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit Kohlenhydratchemie, im speziellen mit Desoxyzuckern, Bestandteile vieler Naturprodukte. Desoxyzucker können unter anderem in Pflanzen, Pilzen und Bakterien gefunden werden und sind Bestandteil einer breiten Anzahl von biologischen Prozessen. Besondere Beachtung wird 3 -Desoxyzucker und einer vielseitigen und flexiblen Synthesestrategie für die Vorbereitung dieses Zuckers, ausgehend von D-Glyceraldehyd, zuteil. Diese Zucker sind ein Hauptbestandteil der Lipopolysaccharide in Gram-negativen Bakterien und sind ebenfalls in die Biosynthese aromatischer Aminosäuren in Bakterien und Pflanzen involviert. Die Möglichkeit diese Synthese in einem präparativen Ausmaß durchzuführen, erlaubt es möglicherweise die Forschung in diesem Bereich zu vertiefen und zu intensivieren, sowie das Verständnis der Glycobiologie im Bereich neuer Medikamente zu erweitern. NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} versatile tools for studying structural parameters of organic and bioorganic compounds. It became a highly suitable method to achieve spectra simplification of macromolecules in combination with isotope labeling techniques. This technique is used to study protein structures, folding properties and mechanisms of chemical and biochemical reactions. Proteins typically feature a high molecular mass showing a high number of spin systems, being responsible for increasingly difficult to interpret NMR spectra, which is why it is essential to introduce 13 C- and 15 N- isotopes to obtain reasonable signal intensities. The development of a new synthetic route towards 13 C-isotope labeled Phenylalanine <b>or</b> <b>precursors</b> <b>thereof,</b> starting from inexpensive and easily accessible labeled starting materials, is the main purpose of this work. Label sources such as [13 C]-acetic acid, [13 C]-formaldehyde, [13 C]-allyl alcohol and [13 C]-glycine will be used. The synthetic pathway will be carried out in a way where the position-selective incorporation of labeled isotopes can be performed. This important feature of the synthesis may open access towards newly designed NMR-experiments. Key steps for the tested route are ring closing metatheses as well as indium mediated reactions. The second part of this work focuses on the field of sugar chemistry, in particular on the family of deoxy sugars, components of many natural products, found in different plants, fungi and bacteria. Deoxy sugars also participate in a wide range of biological processes. Special focus is given to 3 -deoxy sugars and the research of a versatile and flexible synthetic route for their preparation starting from the easily accessible D-glyceraldehyde. These sugars are found on Gram-negative bacteria where they are a key component of the lipopolysaccharides, or where they can take place in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria and plants. Being able to perform this synthesis on a preparative scale may potentially increase the specificity and biological activity of these carbohydrates and deepen the understanding of glycobiology in the research of new medicines...|$|R
