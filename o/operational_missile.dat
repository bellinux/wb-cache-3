2500|$|Hercules' {{was officially}} {{referred}} to as [...] "transportable", but moving a battery was a significant operation and required considerable construction at the firing sites. Over its lifetime, significant effort was put into development of solid state replacements for the vacuum tube-based electronics inherited from the early-1950s Ajax, {{and a variety of}} mobile options. None of these were adopted, in favor of much more mobile systems like the MIM-23 Hawk. Another potential development was an upgraded version of the Hercules for the anti-ballistic missile role, but this later emerged as the rather different LIM-49 Nike Zeus design. Hercules would prove to be the last <b>operational</b> <b>missile</b> from Bell's Nike team; Zeus was never deployed, and Hercules follow-on were developed by different teams.|$|E
2500|$|The MIDAS {{program was}} {{temporarily}} suspended {{at this point}} when a committee headed by ARPA director Jack Ruina recommended that no attempt at an <b>operational</b> <b>missile</b> early warning system be made until the Air Force demonstrated {{that it was a}} feasible concept at all; in addition, Midas's sensors were designed to detect liquid-fueled rocket exhaust, not solid-fueled exhaust, which was now widely seen as the future of ballistic missiles (as things would have it, the Soviet Union was far behind the United States in development of solid-fueled rockets). The committee found that program management of MIDAS was [...] "awful" [...] and at the current rate of success, [...] "it would take ten years to develop an operational system". In November 1961, the Defense Department issued a directive placing all DoD space programs under strict secrecy, and so MIDAS was given the cover name [...] "Program 461". The development time of the program was also lengthened to give more space to work out problems with the hardware.|$|E

50|$|Twenty eight test {{launches}} {{were conducted}} with three failures. Most test launches occurred from Sites 1/5 and 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The main operational base for R-7A missiles was Plesetsk Cosmodrome, where four launch pads were used at Sites 41/1, 16/2, 43/3 and 43/4. Baikonur Site 31/6 was also used for <b>operational</b> <b>missiles.</b> Another base near Krasnoyarsk was proposed, but later cancelled.|$|R
25|$|The United States Air Force {{planned to}} {{purchase}} 2,328 <b>operational</b> <b>missiles</b> and 53 missiles for test and evaluation. This {{would have provided}} enough missiles for 10 squadrons. Deployment was planned to start in 1961 and be completed by October 1963. Bull Goose bases were initially planned at Duluth Municipal Airport, Minnesota and Ethan Allen Air Force Base, Vermont. Construction of Bull Goose missile sites began in August 1958.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 1948 Nereus was {{primarily}} engaged in submarine repair and services at San Diego. During {{the next two}} decades, Nereus made occasional cruises to Pearl Harbor; to Acapulco, Mexico; and various west coast ports. In 1948 she was camera-ship photographing the sinking of cruiser [...] some 130 miles off the west coast. In the spring of 1955, she accompanied submarines , [...] and [...] to Pearl Harbor and acted as observer ship and advance base headquarters during the first firing of <b>operational</b> <b>missiles</b> from submarines.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to reuse the -68 designation; notably the U.S. Navy wanted their new Standard Block V missile {{to be known}} as the RIM-68A. This failed (the designation RIM-156A was used instead). In 1995, the Navy tried to change it again—apparently wanting an <b>operational</b> <b>missile</b> to have a continuous run with the RIM-66 Standard MR and RIM-67 Standard ER designations. The request was refused again.|$|E
50|$|The role of INS Trata is {{to defend}} the Indian naval bases and {{shipping}} against enemy ship attacks.

25|$|On October 19, the EXCOMM formed {{separate}} {{working groups}} {{to examine the}} air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM shifted to the blockade option. However, reservations about the plan continued to be voiced {{as late as the}} October 21, the paramount concern being that once the blockade was put into effect, the Soviets would rush to complete some of the missiles. Consequently, the US could find itself bombing <b>operational</b> <b>missiles</b> if blockade failed to force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island.|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{developed}} for the US Navy during the late 1960s, the AGM-78 was created {{in large part because}} of the limitations of the AGM-45 Shrike, which suffered from a small warhead, limited range and a poor guidance system. General Dynamics was asked to create an air-launched ARM by modifying the RIM-66 SM-1 surface-to-air missile. This use of an [...] "off the shelf" [...] design greatly reduced development costs, and trials of the new weapon begun in 1967 after only a year of development. The first <b>operational</b> <b>missiles</b> were issued in early 1968.|$|R
50|$|On January 1, 1958, Lieutenant General David Wade of Louisiana was {{assigned}} as {{commander of the}} 1st Missile Division at Vandenberg.There he commanded the first <b>operational</b> <b>missile</b> unit in Air Force history. His commission was two-fold: (1) maintain operational capability with intercontinental ballistic missiles, and (2) establish operational readiness training for the missile crews of the SAC missile sites. Wade worked to develop the Discoverer, Samos, and Midas orbiting satellite programs.|$|E
50|$|In December 2008 the Brazilian {{government}} {{approved the}} sale of 100 MAR-1 missiles to the Pakistan Air Force, in a contract worth $108 million.

50|$|The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review {{concluded}} that the Successor submarine would have eight <b>operational</b> <b>missiles</b> carrying no more than 40 operational warheads between them. This would allow the UK to reduce its stocks of operational warheads from 160 to 120, and the overall stockpile from no more than 225 {{to no more than}} 180. They would be carried in a 12-missile common missile compartment designed in collaboration with the US for their SSBN-X, which could accommodate the current Trident D5 missiles and any replacement missile once the D5 reaches the end of its expected life in the 2040s.|$|R

It was declared fully operational on 12 September 1960 and was retired from service in 1968.|$|E
50|$|The 702d Strategic Missile Wing was {{established}} in July 1958. As the only SM-62 Snark missile wing in the USAF, the wing performed intercontinental missile test operations from Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, April-June 1959, and from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, c. December 1959 - June 1961. Its operational component was the 556th Missile Squadron. On 27 May 1959, the wing received its first <b>operational</b> <b>missile</b> at Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine. Ten months later, on 18 March 1960, the Snark missile went on alert status.
