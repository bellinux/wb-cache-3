5|$|The Theban Cycle {{deals with}} events {{associated}} especially with Cadmus, the city's founder, and {{later with the}} doings of Laius and Oedipus at Thebes; a series <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> lead to the eventual pillage of that city {{at the hands of}} the Seven Against Thebes and Epigoni. (It is not known whether the Seven Against Thebes figured in early epic.) As far as Oedipus is concerned, early epic accounts seem to have him continuing to rule at Thebes after the revelation that Iokaste was his mother, and subsequently marrying a second wife who becomes the mother of his children — markedly different from the tale known to us through tragedy (e.g. Sophocles' Oedipus Rex) and later mythological accounts.|$|E

25|$|A {{very popular}} modern subgenre {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> treat werewolves as separate race or species (either science fictional or magical) or as persons using magic {{in order to}} deliberately transform into wolves at will. Such current-day werewolf fiction almost exclusively involves lycanthropy being either a hereditary condition or being transmitted like a disease by the bite of another werewolf. The form a werewolf takes is not always an ordinary wolf, but is often anthropomorphic or may be otherwise larger and more powerful than an ordinary wolf. Sometimes the beast form of the werewolf will have some physical characteristics borrowed from an animal species other than the wolf, {{as can be seen}} in the boar-like werewolf of Wild Country (2006). Many modern werewolves are also supposedly immune to damage caused by ordinary weapons, being vulnerable only to silver objects (usually a bullet or blade). This negative reaction to silver is sometimes so strong that the mere touch of the metal on a werewolf's skin will cause burns.|$|E

[...] While they thought that the message was heavy-handed, it was the type <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> Enterprise should have been {{covering}} all along. They gave [...] "Demons" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] a score of four out of five. Jay Garmon, whilst compiling {{a list of the}} best episodes of Enterprise, listed [...] "Demons" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] as the third best. He thought that Peter Weller [...] "stole the show", and that it created a [...] "solid conclusion" [...] to the show despite the following episode, [...] "These Are the Voyages...".

500|$|Show {{scriptwriter}} Mark Catley, {{who wrote}} the third standalone episode [...] "Holby Sin City", received negative criticism about the episode from fans, expressing their displeasure at the episode. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy labelled [...] "Holby Sin City" [...] as [...] "one of the show's most divisive episodes ever." [...] The show faced further criticism following the broadcast of episode forty-three, which featured a patient crash his lorry after blacking out while driving. The character was diagnosed with narcolepsy, but refused to tell the DVLA about his diagnosis. The storyline was compared to the real-life 2014 Glasgow bin lorry crash, with four similarities made between the fictional crash and the real-life crash, and described as [...] "deeply unfortunate". A BBC spokesperson said, [...] "We would never knowingly imitate a real life event. Parallels can be drawn with many of our storylines. However, with the amount <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> we tell of characters in extreme situations, {{it is hard to}} avoid dramatising situations that can occasionally be reminiscent of real life events".|$|E

500|$|Ejler Jakobsson's tenure {{began with}} a large backlog <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> Pohl had acquired, but {{within a year or}} two {{substantial}} changes were apparent. [...] In the early 1970s, Jakobsson attempted to update Galaxys image, adding a comic strip, [...] "Sunpot", by Vaughn Bodé, for example. Theodore Sturgeon took over from Budrys as the regular book reviewer in January 1972 and held the post until mid-1975. Jakobsson did not manage to give Galaxy a new and distinctive character: [...] "Sunpot" [...] lasted only four issues, Sturgeon's reviews were undistinguished, and many of the new authors he published have been, in the words of Mike Ashley, [...] "mercifully unknown ever since". [...] The paper quality and printing quality also dropped, and early cover designs were very weak. [...] Jakobsson initially printed guest editorials rather than writing his own; when he took over the editorial page his work was unremarkable. [...] However, he did manage to attract some of the new writers who were just becoming well known in the sf scene, including George R.R. Martin, Joe Haldeman, and Joanna Russ. [...] Three novels published in Jakobsson's Galaxy won awards: Isaac Asimov's The Gods Themselves and Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama each won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, in 1972 and 1973 respectively, and Robert Silverberg's A Time of Changes won the Nebula in 1971. Sturgeon's short story [...] "Slow Sculpture" [...] won both the Hugo and the Nebula in 1970.|$|E

500|$|Few {{of the new}} {{magazines}} launched {{during the}} boom lasted {{until the end of}} the war, which brought paper shortages that forced difficult decisions on the publishers. [...] Not every magazine cancellation was because of the war; the usual vicissitudes of magazine publishing also played a role. [...] In 1941, Silberkleit cancelled Science Fiction after 12 issues because of poor sales, merging it with Future Fiction. Two years later Silberkleit ceased publication of both Future and Science Fiction Quarterly when he decided to use the limited paper he could acquire for his western and detective titles instead. [...] Both Science Fiction and Future eventually reappeared in the 1950s. [...] Fantastic Novels merged with its stablemate, Famous Fantastic Mysteries, in 1941, probably because of wartime difficulties, after only five issues. [...] In 1942 Famous Fantastic Mysteries was sold by Munsey to Popular, who were already the publishers of Astonishing Stories and Super Science Stories. [...] Mary Gnaedinger continued as editor, but the editorial policy changed to exclude reprints <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> had appeared in magazine form. [...] Booklength work was still reprinted, including G. K. Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday and H. G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau. [...] In the event, Famous Fantastic Mysteries was the only one of Popular's science fiction and fantasy titles to survive the war. Both Astonishing and Super Science Stories ceased publication in 1943 when Frederik Pohl, the editor of both titles, enlisted in the army; the publisher was having difficulty obtaining enough paper and decided to close the magazines down. [...] The same year, paper shortages forced John Campbell to choose between Astounding and Unknown, which had already gone to a bimonthly schedule; he decided to keep Astounding on a monthly schedule, and Unknown ceased publication with the October 1943 issue. [...] Astounding switched to digest format the following month; this was a leading indicator for the direction the field would take, though it would be over a decade before the rest of the field followed suit.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{low rates}} of pay, the stories {{submitted}} to Astonishing {{in its first year}} had generally already been rejected elsewhere. [...] However, Pohl {{was a member of the}} Futurians, a group of science fiction fans that included Isaac Asimov, C.M. Kornbluth, Richard Wilson and Donald Wollheim; the Futurians were eager to become professional writers and were glad to submit stories to Pohl. [...] Asimov recalls in his memoirs that on October 27, 1939, two days after Pohl was hired to edit the magazines, Pohl turned up at Asimov's apartment and asked to buy [...] "Half-Breed", a story Pohl had been trying to sell on Asimov's behalf since June of that year. [...] Pohl needed stories quickly for the first issue of Astonishing (though the name had not yet been selected), and as the story had been rejected by Amazing Stories and Astounding Stories, Asimov was willing to sell it for half a cent per word. [...] A couple of weeks later Pohl also acquired [...] "The Callistan Menace" [...] from Asimov. [...] The other Futurians were prolific as well; in Pohl's first year as an editor he bought a total of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines. [...] Damon Knight, another of the Futurians, recalled in his memoirs that Pohl once asked the group for a story to fill out an issue, with $35 available to pay for it. [...] Kornbluth and Wilson wrote a first draft, alternating turns at the typewriter; the result was edited by Harry Dockweiler, another Futurian, and then again by Pohl before it appeared in the April 1940 Astonishing under the title [...] "Stepsons of Mars", with a byline of [...] "Ivar Towers". [...] Pohl contributed material himself, using the pseudonyms [...] "James McCreigh" [...] and [...] "Dirk Wylie" [...] (the latter pseudonym was also used by Dockweiler); he used his own stories when he needed to fill an issue, and to supplement his salary of ten dollars a week. [...] Particularly after his marriage to Doris Baumgardt in August 1940, Pohl realized that his salary covered their apartment rent with almost no money left over, and began to augment his income by selling to himself as well as to other magazines. [...] When Pohl lost his job as editor in late 1941, he had bought from himself (and paid for) a couple <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> <b>that</b> he had not actually written, and hence had to write them very quickly and turn them in.|$|E
