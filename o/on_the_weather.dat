5|$|Robert FitzRoy was {{appointed}} in 1854 {{as chief of}} a new department within the Board of Trade {{to deal with the}} collection of weather data at sea as a service to mariners. This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office. All ship captains were tasked with collating data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and computing it, with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The hemmema's {{design was}} {{very similar to that}} of the turuma. The primary {{difference}} was that the turuma's oarsmen sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the gundeck. The later hemmemas were considerably larger, more heavily armed, and of a more robust construction. Glete has described them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{structure}} of the SYNOP code, a maximum of three cloud symbols can be plotted for each reporting station that appears <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> map. All cloud types are coded and transmitted by trained observers then plotted on maps as low, middle, or high-étage using special symbols for each major cloud type. Any cloud type with significant vertical extent that can occupy more than one étage is coded as low (cumulus and cumulonimbus) or middle (nimbostratus) depending on the altitude level or étage where it normally initially forms aside from any vertical growth that takes place. The symbol used on the map for each of these étages at a particular observation time is for the genus, species, variety, mutation, or cloud motion that is considered most important according to criteria set out by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). If these elements for any étage at the time of observation are deemed to be of equal importance, then the type which is predominant in amount is coded by the observer and plotted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> map using the appropriate symbol. Special weather maps in aviation show areas of icing and turbulence.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E

5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> deck, above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular outrigger that was designed to improve the leverage. Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the average speed with oars was reported as low as half a knot.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn).

5|$|Surface weather {{analyses}} {{have special}} symbols that show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information.

Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location.|$|E

5|$|Although Howe {{was in a}} {{favourable}} position, Villaret had {{not been}} idle during the night. He had attempted, with near success, to distance his ships from the British fleet; when dawn broke at 05:00 he was {{within a few hours}} of gaining enough wind to escape over the horizon. Allowing his men to breakfast, Howe took full advantage of his position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> gage to close with Villaret, and by 08:12 the British fleet was just four miles (6km) from the enemy. By this time, Howe's formation was strung out in an organised line parallel to the French, with frigates acting as repeaters for the admiral's commands. The French were likewise in line ahead and the two lines began exchanging long-range gunfire at 09:24, whereupon Howe unleashed his innovative battleplan.|$|E
5|$|As Han troops {{returned}} from the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, the Han government debated annexing Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Zou Yushan, had agreed to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue. Yushan blamed the delay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather.</b> The proposal to annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu, but was dismissed by Emperor Wu. The naval force arrived home without having attacked Dongyue. Zou caught wind of Yang's request, and responded by revolting against the Han. Han forces were led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule.|$|E
5|$|Field {{punishment}} (FP) {{had replaced}} flogging (abolished {{at home in}} 1868 and on active service in 1881, although still used in military prisons until 1907). FP No.1 (in which the man was shackled to fixed object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many repeat offenders). FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking {{a man in a}} shed and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that a man was shackled but not fixed in place.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather.</b> Nevertheless, {{it was clear to}} Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under those circumstances, Operation Sea Lion could not take place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out as a last resort regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E
5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E
5|$|The Faroe Islands {{national}} football team represents the Faroe Islands in association football and {{is controlled by}} the Faroe Islands Football Association (FSF), the governing body of the sport in the country.

Organised football has been played in the country since the 19th century; Tvøroyrar Bóltfelag was its first club, founded in 1892. Initially, clubs played friendlies to determine the winner of an unofficial championship, with matches being contested home and away, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and the state of the generally uneven grass pitches. The Faroe Islands Sports Association was formed in 1939, and three years later a national league was created.
