40|$|According to Howard Gardner (1973), <b>operativity,</b> i. e. {{the extent}} to which it is {{possible}} to act with or upon an object, influences picture naming by aphasic subjects. In the present study, this influence is analysed with three purposes: (1) to replicate the Gardner's observation, (2) to avoid methodological biases and to extend the analyses, and (3) to look for alternative explanations. Sixty-four pictures corresponding to high- and low-frequency nouns rated as high or low in <b>operativity</b> were presented to 18 aphasic subjects. Frequency and <b>operativity</b> were found to significantly affect naming performance. More particularly, fewer semantic paraphasias were observed in confrontation with operative items and fewer phonemic paraphasias in the production of frequent nouns. However, the influence of <b>operativity</b> on the reduction of errors disappeared when age-of-acquisition and picture familiarity were introduced as co-variables. These dimensions were found to be better predictors of aphasic performance than <b>operativity...</b>|$|E

40|$|During their day-to-day tasks, {{public safety}} {{operators}} rely on commercial mobile networks {{in order to}} perform data communications and make use of data-based services. In major disasters, however, it is the norm to witness high degrees of network congestion and, often, to experience service outages caused by infrastructural damage. This may strongly hinder the <b>operativity</b> of emergency operators, that expect to rely on resilient communication infrastructures and that demand network availability no matter what. In order for today mobile networks to provide such capabilities, some degree of redundancy should be introduced, either in hardware as infrastructural deployments or in software as data replication mechanisms. This paper focuses on the latter approach. It proposes a network framework to enable collaborative hosts to concurrently forward replicated data over an arbitrary number of channels, in order to compensate for high packet losses or sudden unavailability of routing paths. The data replication and the forwarding behavior are concerted by an SDN controller, that transparently implements a network abstraction to virtually pool hosts network resources. The paper also presents the test bed that has been built and used to extract the emulation results. These demonstrate that the proposal {{have the potential to}} strongly improve data communication capabilities in constrained scenarios, in the form of higher data rates and stronger resilience guarantees.

40|$|This thesis {{suggests}} a cultural logic of financialisation {{in terms of}} (re) presentation of information and (re) configuration of temporality, {{both of which are}} critically undertaken and regulated by financial narrative. This narrative functions, following Bourdieu, as “the sign of wealth” in our times. It is time for cultural theorists and activists to approach finance as a set of epistemic cultural processes beyond the economic, which modulates epistemological and ontological contexts, affecting actors’ cognition and behavior in value production and realisation. Financialisation is supported and maintained by narrative intervention in valorising the onto-phenomenological level of the economic. From this perspective, financialisation is suggested as a disinformation campaign, through which the cognitive dissonance of the financial mechanism is effectively contained, concealing its damaging effects and thus valorising the financial mechanism. It implements an intensification of the transactional orientation as the legitimate mode of value production and circulation. Sustaining and amplifying the transactional orientation of investment banking among the actors in the financial markets, the financial system conceals cognitive dissonance through its <b>operativity</b> of information. It works towards {{the construction of a new}} financial reality, stimulating belief and guiding action⎯without which financial integrity, credit relations, and transactional orientation could not be sustained. Observing the contemporary culture-finance relationship from the perspective of value politics under financial capitalism, this thesis analyses specific aspects of homology between culture and finance from the perspective of the cultural logic of financial narrative. This is seen as a frame of value transference and a device of activation as well as of domination. Exploring the possibilities of a cultural theory of value, this project, first of all, focuses upon the question of value and the actual process of value formation associated with <b>operativity</b> and performativity of narrative. Narrative is analysed as the cognitive operation constitutive of financial narrative politics for value transference in the discourse of financial crisis, which has been, as this thesis upholds and examines, systematically operated throughout the Korean financial crisis. It mainly revisits the value theories and narrative analyses of Simmel, Marx, Ricoeur, Jameson, and Genette to articulate an economic theory of value in the cultural politics of narrative. Following Ricoeur, it sees this as a mechanism of value transference, and it is here correlated with the financial doctrine of entanglement and contagion. Through a narrative, wherein utterances and statements around a primal event, or crisis, perform as the collective <b>operativity</b> of information, a value is constructed and transferred to inform and motivate actors. Narrative structure, from which the nexuses of intentionalities of the financial system are formulated and transmitted, is proposed as a meta-frame of cultural valorisation. It valorises economic value for the (re) production of dominant financial value, without which any unprecedented application of ‘methodology,’ such as a ‘shock doctrine,’ of economic prescription cannot be legitimised and extrapolated. This project begins with the argument in Chapter 2 that narrative exploits uncertainty as a resource for performativity, and thus necessitates a new standard, thereby regulating and activating heterogeneous actors in the markets. A financial crisis is the crucial point of narrativity in the constitution of a legitimate guiding structure, exploiting uncertainty in order to manage risk⎯ thus producing a narrative as a frame of self-reference. The narrative identifies the new main value by effectively performing the uncertainty of a financial crisis. In this regard, the chapter proposes that the necessity of negating (or guaranteeing) the fundamental contradiction, or “the self-abolishing contradiction,” bolstered by the sheer size of the entanglement and contagion in finance capitalism, is authenticated and initiated by a preliminary cultural operation of a discursive approach to the crisis. The discourse is not a randomly disseminated rhetoric, but is presented as a narrative in which temporal reconfiguration and sequences of action are carefully guided to represent the main event as a source of cognition and action for contextual control; a certain sequence of events is thereby thematised and anticipated through the interpretation of the event in question, with clear intentions by the main financial narrator. Narrative opens a performative field of objectification in which the power relationship between the main narrator and the object, the narratee, is established and coordinated. The narrative emphasis in a collapse, for instance, one that is yet to come, grounds the <b>operativity</b> and performativity through which actors are informed and motivated, while implementing and legitimising the necessary official description. Articulating the intentions of the system, and its employment of capitalistically reconfigured temporality, as well as its representation of information into narrative, Chapter 3 suggests that narrative is the objectifying field of value and value-transference, in which the textuality of everyday narrative is produced to direct actors as the ushering force of the main value. Proposing value as a guiding force of cognition and action, the chapter closely inquires into the value-forming process, arguing that narrative process is an inevitabl...|$|E

Semantical Virtual Environments (SVEs) have recently been proposed not only to ease world modelling but also to enhance agent-object and agent-agent interaction.

The object taxonomy also helps to create general and reusable <b>operativity</b> for autonomous characters – for example, liquids can be poured from containers such as bottles.

The study and application of this method were made in the Company of Raw materials Recovery in an experimental form...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{selection}} on codon usage is {{a pervasive}} force that acts {{on a large}} variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Despite this, obtaining reliable estimates of selection on codon usage has proved complicated, perhaps {{due to the fact}} that the selection coefficients involved are very small. In this work, a population genetics model is used to measure the strength of selected codon usage bias, S, in 10 eukaryotic genomes. It is shown that the strength of selection is closely linked to expression and that reliable estimates of selection coefficients can only be obtained for genes with very similar expression levels. We compare the strength of selected codon usage for orthologous genes across all 10 genomes classified according to expression categories. Fungi genomes present the largest S values (2. 24 – 2. 56), whereas multicellular invertebrate and plant genomes present more moderate values (0. 61 – 1. 91). The large mammalian genomes (human and mouse) show low S values (0. 22 – 0. 51) for the most highly expressed genes. This might not be evidence for selection in these organisms as the technique used here to estimate S does not properly account for nucleotide composition heterogeneity along such genomes. The relationship between estimated S values and empirical estimates of population size is presented here for the first time. It is shown, as theoretically expected, that population size has an important role in the <b>operativity</b> of translational selection...|$|E
