40|$|This paper {{reports a}} series of 52 {{patients}} with Barrett's (or columnar-lined) oesophagus from one medical unit diagnosed over a six-year period. The commonest associated symptoms were heartburn, regurgitation and dysphagia but 10 patients had no oesophageal symptoms and two had no symptoms at all. Gastrointestinal bleeding (overt or occult) was observed in almost one-third of patients. At diagnosis, 26 patients had oesophagitis, 23 had <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> and 10 had benign oesophageal strictures. An association between <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory-drug ingestion was suggested by the data and patients with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> were significantly older than patients with uncomplicated Barrett's oesophagus. No patient had adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus at diagnosis and neither carcin-oma nor dysplasia were seen during a mean period of 16. 4 months. However, 17 per cent of patients in the series had malignancies in other sites. Most patients did well on medical treatment and only two were referred for anti-reflux surgery (both for non-healing oesophageal ulcers). Barrett's oesophagus was seen in 10 per cent of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux at endoscopy. <b>Oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> in patients with Barrett's oesophagus made up 21 per cent of oesophageal ulcers seen and benign oesophageal stricture in patients with Barrett's oesophagus constituted 13 per cent of all benign strictures seen.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the aetiology of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> in HIV-infected patients. Design. A retrospective clinical, endoscopic and histopathological analysis {{of patients with}} confirmed HIV infection and an oesophageal ulcer diagnosed on endoscopy. Setting. A tertiary referral, gastrointestinal clinic in Cape Town. Results. Fifty-one patients with HIV infection and <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> were seen from January 2001 to December 2007. Median CD 4 count was 26 cells/µl. Mean age was 35. 5 years. Sixty per cent of patients were female.

A surprisingly small number of patients with HIV associated <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> were seen during the study period. This may reflect local referral practices {{or the fact that}} patients with severe immunosuppression succumb before developing oesophageal ulcers. As in other series, idiopathic oesophageal ulcers and cytomegalovirus ulcers made up the majority of cases.

40|$|ABSTRACT An unusual case of {{epidermolysis bullosa}} dystrophica with {{extensive}} stenosis, high perforation, and dissection of the oesophagus forming a "double-barrel " structure is described. Gastric epithelium {{found in the}} upper oesophagus {{is thought to be}} of metaplastic origin and caused by repeated minor trauma with repair. The most common non-dermatological com-plication encountered in epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica is bulla formation, ulceration, and scarring with stricture of the oesQphagus. 1 Perforation of the oesophagus is very rare, and formation of a double-barrel oesophagus has not been reported. Here we present a case of epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica in which an <b>oesophageal</b> stricture with <b>ulceration,</b> dissection, perforation, and a double-barrel deformity developed late {{in the course of the}} disease. There was also extensive replacement of oesophageal epithelium by gastric mucosa. Case report A 34 -year-old white woman was admitted to hospital with sudden haemoptysis associated with chest pain. Shortly after birth, the patient's skin was noted to be friable and easily traumatised, resulting in indolent ulcers with scar formation. Throughout her childhood, she appeared under-developed for her age and was chronically anaemic. Numerous bullae and excoriations developed on her hands, feet, forearms, legs, elbows, knees, and back (fig 1). All nails were lost. Several successful autografts were per-formed, but eventually fusion of digits and toes by scar tissue occurred and progressed relentlessly to "mitten deformities " (fig 2).

40|$|Standard {{oesophageal}} scintigraphic techniques using 99 mTc-colloids rarely identify oesophageal mucosal damage. Sucralfate can be labelled with 99 mTc for {{the detection}} of oesophageal mucosal ulceration. This method uses two separate supine swallows of 10 MBq 99 mTc-colloid in 10 ml, followed by a single supine swallow of 30 MBq 99 mTc-sucralfate. The data are processed to give time-activity curves, mean transit times and condensed dynamic images. When <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> is detected, the time-activity curves using sucralfate show residual activity in the oesophagus after the transit time indicated by the colloid swallow.

40|$|Bleeding from {{oesophageal}} varices, oesophageal ulcers or oesophagitis is occasionally {{massive and}} difficult to control. Octreotide, a synthetic analogue of somatostin lowers portal pressure and collateral blood flow including that through varices, increases lower oesophageal sphincter pressure, and inhibits the gastric secretion of acid as well as pepsin. Our current experience suggests it is effective in controlling acute variceal haemorrhage. Therefore we have examined the efficacy of octreotide in the control of postsclerotherapy bleeding from oesophageal varices, oesophageal ulcers and oesophagitis. During the study period 77 patients experienced a significant gastrointestinal bleed (blood pressure 100 beats per min or the need to transfuse 2 or more units of blood to restore the haemoglobin level) following injection sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices. The source of bleeding was varices in 42 patients, oesophageal ulcers in 31 and oesophagitis in 4. All patients received a continuous intravenous infusion of octreotide (50 lag/h) for between 40 - 140 h. If bleeding was not controlled in the first 12 h after commencing octreotide hourly bolus doses (50 lag) for 24 h were superimposed on the continuous infusion.

40|$|Treatment of {{osteoporosis}} with alendronate sodium has several challenges. The first challenge is the low bioavailability.

Enteric coated solid lipid nanoparticles were prepared according to the Box-Behnken design employing Design expert® software, and characterized for size, morphology, and entrapment efficiency. The optimized formula was coated with an Eudragit S 100 and evaluated for drug release in acidic and basic media, stability studies and pharmacokinetic evaluations on rabbits. The results indicated that, using Derringer's desirability functional tool for optimization, the highest entrapment efficiency value of 74. 3 % and the smallest size value of 98 nm were predicted under optimum conditions with a desirability value of 0. 917. The optimized nanoparticles released alendronate sodium only at an alkaline pH.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{medication}} {{history of}} patients presenting with benign oesophageal stricture is {{compared with an}} age and sex matched control population selected from the community. Fifty five out of 151 consecutive admissions to a dysphagia clinic {{were found to have}} benign oesophageal stricture. Twenty six out of 53 (49 %) had been prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the year preceding their clinic appointment. Ten patients (19 %) had been prescribed other drugs implicated in oesophageal disease over the same period. In the control population, 20 out of 165 (12 %) had been prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and 31 out of 165 had been prescribed 'other ' drugs in the preceding year. The difference between numbers on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the patient and control groups was highly significant (J 2 = 23. 87, p< 0. 1 %). This study has shown an association between the prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and benign stricture of the oesophagus. Gastro-oesophageal reflux is the most important cause of <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration.</b> The relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux and benign oesophageal stricture is less clearly defined: only a minority of patients with radiographic and endoscopic evidence of reflux oesophagitis progress to benign stricture. This suggests that there are other factors involved in the progression to stricture formation. There are a number of publications which question the role of certain drugs in the aetiology of benign stricture. l- 4 The majority relate to case reports, but Heller and colleagues in a controlled study found a significant association between a history of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ingestion and benign oesophageal stricture.

40|$|Gastroduodenal {{ulceration}} is a prevalent {{disease in}} foals and adult horses. Decreased performance {{as well as}} fatal complications relate to this syndrome. The objective of our {{study was to determine}} the prevalence of gastric ulceration in a mixed population of horses by postmortem examination and to evaluate a possible association between equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) and sex or age of the examined horses, to evaluate the localisation of lesions in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract and to determine the occurrence of gastric parasites. Post-mortem examinations were performed on 71 horses over a period of 24 months. Gastric ulcers were found in 52 horses (73. 2 %). There was no significant association between age or sex and occurrence of gastric ulcers. In all horses the squamous mucosa lesions were localised near the margo plicatus (100 % of the cases), whereas in 23 horses the lesions were near the margo plicatus and lesser curvature and in 7 horses at the greater curvature. In 18 horses the mucosa was affected in the whole extent of the margo plicatus and in 1 horse diffuse lesions of the squamous mucosa were noted. Lesions of the glandular mucosa were localised in 11 horses at the fundic area, in 1 horse they occurred in the pylorus, and in 10 horses diffuse lesions of the glandular mucosa were recorded. A low prevalence of Gasterophilus intestinalis infection was detected (1 horse, 1. 4 %). We have confirmed that gastric ulcers are a common problem in horses and duodenal or <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> is rare (not a single case of the latter was found in this study).

40|$|In a {{prospective}} study of 154 AIDS patients, 48 (31 %) complained of pain on swallowing both liquids and solids and 32 (21 %) of these also had dysphagia. While candidiasis {{was the most}} common cause of symptoms (26 patients), discrete ulceration of the oesophagus occurred in 12 instances in 10 patients (four cytomegalovirus, four herpes simplex virus, three aphthous ulcer, one peptic ulcer). One patient had a diffuse oesophagitis caused by Mycobacterium avium intracellulare. No cause was found for the oesophageal symptoms in four patients. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was found in seven patients associated with other pathology in four. All 26 patients with oesophageal candidiasis only, also had oral involvement. All the patients with herpes simplex virus (four) and aphthous ulcers (three) had obvious perioral involvement. Three of the four patients with cytomegalovirus ulceration had evidence of disease elsewhere (colon or retina). All patients with Kaposi's sarcoma lesions had skin and buccal cavity involvement. The cause of oesophageal disease was usually obvious at endoscopy. The appearance of candidiasis was typical and the various ulcerating lesions also had different macroscopic configurations. Cytomegalovirus infection produced deep linear ulcers in the distal oesophagus, herpes simplex oesophagitis is similar in appearance to the typical perioral lesions of fluid filled vesicles. Diagnostic radiology was not helpful in most patients. In nine of 17 patients with candidiasis, the barium swallow examination performed within 24 hours of presentation was normal. In only three of seven patients with <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> (three cytomegalovirus, two herpes simplex virus, one aphthous, one peptic) was there evidence of an abnormality.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} dermal and transdermal delivery of doxycycline from vehicles containing Migliol 840 (M 840) and ethanol. Delivery of the drug via the skin would provide a useful alternative to oral delivery, which has many undesirable side-effects, such as <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> and disturbance of the normal gut flora. Potential applications include malaria prophylaxis, and the treatment of acne vulgaris, Lyme disease and Reiter syndrome. Experiments were performed to determine the permeation of doxycycline across excised full-thickness human skin and heat-separated epidermal membranes from saturated solutions in ethanol, 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ethanol/M 840. Unusual burst behaviour was observed using an ethanol vehicle, possibly {{as a result of}} the formation of dimers at saturation. Doxycycline permeated to a higher degree from ethanolic vehicles when M 840 is present, suggesting that M 840 is capable of enhancing the permeation of doxycycline. The flux across full-thickness skin was highest from a 2 : 1 ethanol:M 840 vehicle (2. 41 microg cm(- 2) h(- 1)), sufficient to deliver 282 microg l(- 1) using an area of application of 30 cm(2). The data also produced unexpected results in that permeability across heat separated skin was an order of magnitude greater than across full-thickness skin (28. 75 microg cm(- 2) h(- 1) for the 2 : 1 ethanol:M 840 vehicle). Depth profiling indicated that the drug distributed quite evenly throughout the epidermis. The mean amount of doxycycline recovered from the epidermis at the end of a permeation experiment was 458. 4 microg ml(- 1). This was far higher than the volume of extractable lipid present in the same unit area, approximately 52. 3 microg ml(- 1) and indicated that a large proportion of the drug must have been located within the proteinaceous domain. The data therefore suggest (1) significant amounts of doxycycline can be administered into and across the skin; (2) M 840 is a potentially useful enhancing vehicle; and (3) the transcellular route was of significance...|$|E
40|$|Injection {{sclerotherapy}} is now {{the accepted}} first line treatment for bleeding oesophageal varices, although it is associated with an impressive list of rare complications. The main problem concerns the strategy for uncontrollable or recurrent bleeding. Patients with uncontrolled bleeding may be referred for surgery after considerable blood loss and are then extremely difficult to assess. The effects of blood loss on liver function can lead to an unduly pessimistic assessment of liver status. An effective choice of emergency surgical procedure may require considerable surgical expertise. Oesophageal transection and devascularisation are satisfactory for many patients with oesophageal varices secondary to cirrhosis and should nearly always control bleeding. Difficulties arise in patients who are grossly obese and in those who have undergone extensive surgery in the upper abdomen. Problems may also be encountered in those treated by repeated sclerotherapy, which may have caused severe inflammatory change and thickening around the lower oesophagus and upper stomach. We believe that an emergency mesocaval shunt using either a vein graft or a synthetic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene is the procedure of choice for this difficult group of very sick patients. The surgical exposure is satisfactory and not unduly prolonged in even the largest patients and the technique does not interfere with any subsequent transplant operation. There is a greater choice {{in the management of}} the patient with less urgent bleeding from recurrent varices after sclerotherapy. Repeat sclerotherapy may be effective for small oesophageal varices while liver transplantation may be indicated in the patient with deteriorating liver function. A selective distal splenorenal shunt should be considered for patients with intact splenic and left renal veins and a mesocaval vein graft for the remainder. We would therefore suggest that surgery should still be considered for the management of portal hypertension, particularly in the following circumstances: (1) Uncontrollable bleeding during the initial course of sclerotherapy; (2) Life threatening haemorrhage from recurrent varices; (3) Bleeding from ectopic varices not accessible to sclerotherapy; (4) Uncontrollable bleeding from <b>oesophageal</b> <b>ulceration</b> secondary to injection sclerotherapy; (5) Severe, symptomatic hypersplenism; (6) For patients who live in communities remote from blood transfusion facilities and adequate medical care. The management of the complications of portal hypertension continues to pose problems. We believe that the best results should come from a combined management approach using injection sclerotherapy as primary treatment and surgery for complications and for haemorrhage from unusual anatomical sites...|$|E
