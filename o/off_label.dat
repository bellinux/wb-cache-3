This practice is an <b>off</b> <b>label</b> use of ketamine in the United States. As of 2015 there were about 60 such clinics in the US, the procedure was not covered by insurance, and people paid between $400 and $1700 out of pocket for a treatment. A chain of such clinics in Australia run by Aura Medical Corporation was closed down by regulatory authorities in 2015, because the clinics' marketing was not supported by scientific research and because the clinic sent people home with ketamine and needles to administer infusions to themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{signed to}} the Pye spin <b>off</b> <b>label,</b> Dawn, the quartet {{released}} their first single, [...] "When Love Catches Up on You" [...] in January 1974. It failed to chart, but the follow-up single, [...] "Lady" [...] became {{a hit in}} Europe. Encouraged by this, the group set about recording their debut album. The album Good Things Happening was released {{later in the year}} along with two more singles, but none of these found success. Before the record label folded, Brotherhood of Man released one more single in the Summer of 1975. This was the upbeat [...] "Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby" [...] and although failed to make an impression in the UK, became a big hit in Europe, reaching Number one in Belgium and Number two in the Netherlands as well as top 10 placings in other countries. Brotherhood of Man toured extensively in Europe, honing their stage act and harmonies, while Hiller, Sheriden and Lee worked on composing songs for their second album. Among them was a song Sheriden had largely written called [...] "Save Your Kisses for Me".|$|E
2500|$|Medications for PCOS include oral {{contraceptives}} and metformin. [...] The {{oral contraceptives}} increase sex hormone binding globulin production, which increases binding of free testosterone. [...] This reduces {{the symptoms of}} hirsutism caused by high testosterone and regulates return to normal menstrual periods. Metformin is a drug commonly used in type 2 diabetes to reduce insulin resistance, and is used <b>off</b> <b>label</b> (in the UK, US, AU and EU) to treat insulin resistance seen in PCOS. [...] In many cases, metformin also supports ovarian function and return to normal ovulation. Spironolactone {{can be used for}} its antiandrogenic effects, and the topical cream eflornithine can be used to reduce facial hair. A newer insulin resistance drug class, the thiazolidinediones (glitazones), have shown equivalent efficacy to metformin, but metformin has a more favorable side effect profile. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin when other therapy has failed to produce results. Metformin may not be effective in every type of PCOS, and therefore there is some disagreement about whether it should be used as a general first line therapy. The use of statins in the management of underlying metabolic syndrome remains unclear.|$|E
