5|$|Large {{numbers of}} people participated in solving the puzzles within the ARG. Reaction from players and journalists was mixed; some saw the ARG as a show of strong support and {{commitment}} by Valve for independent game development, while <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> the ultimate conclusion was of limited benefit to justify buying the games to begin with.|$|E
5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents; some were angry because her surprise visit halted work at the site, and <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> her presence was politically motivated. The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.|$|E
5|$|The Go-Getter debuted on January 22, 2007 at the Sundance Film Festival and {{was given}} a limited {{theatrical}} release on June 6, 2008 by Peace Arch Entertainment.

Critics were divided {{in reaction to the}} film; some praised the performances, the dialogue and the cinematography, while <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> it was unoriginal, forgettable, and poorly acted.|$|E

5|$|The {{match between}} Taylor and Bigelow brought the WWF {{mainstream}} press coverage. The {{reactions to the}} match were mixed; some people thought that Taylor performed surprisingly well for a non-wrestler. <b>Others</b> <b>thought</b> that the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{academic}} study, people {{perceived to be}} Middle Eastern were {{as likely to be}} victims of hate crimes as followers of Islam during this time. The study also found a similar increase in hate crimes against people who may have been perceived as Muslims, Arabs, and <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> to be of Middle Eastern origin. A report by the South Asian American advocacy group known as South Asian Americans Leading Together, documented media coverage of 645 bias incidents against Americans of South Asian or Middle Eastern descent between September 11 and 17. Various crimes such as vandalism, arson, assault, shootings, harassment, and threats in numerous places were documented.|$|E
5|$|Deathrow {{received}} largely favorable reviews. Reviewers {{praised the}} game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained {{of its high}} difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> it was a highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically Speedball. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later reported that a sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T.

Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over well with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
5|$|In October 1849 the {{southern}} interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis, {{in response to}} a convention in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there, to connect with an El Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only over the issue of financing. The convention president, Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia, preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> that federal land grants to railroad developers would be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to build}} a new stadium in Malmö {{originated}} in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö IP to be too small for major events. However, the city council could not agree where to build the new stadium, and the matter was dropped for the time being. It was not until Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup that the question resurfaced. The location of the stadium was a main subject of discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, while <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> that the stadium should be located in central Malmö, near the neighbourhood of Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Hiroshima {{had reached a}} peak of over 381,000 earlier in the war but prior to the atomic bombing, the population had steadily decreased because of a systematic evacuation ordered by the Japanese government. At {{the time of the}} attack, the population was approximately 340,000–350,000. Residents wondered why Hiroshima had been spared destruction by firebombing. Some speculated that the city was to be saved for U.S. occupation headquarters, <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps their relatives in Hawaii and California had petitioned the U.S. government to avoid bombing Hiroshima. More realistic city officials had ordered buildings torn down to create long, straight firebreaks, beginning in 1944. Firebreaks continued to be expanded and extended up to the morning of August 6, 1945.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} manuscript before {{an editor at}} the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed. Some praised the novel as a powerful paean to individualism, while <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, but the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects and right-libertarians.|$|E

5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|Captain Benaud retired {{at the end}} of the South Africa serieshe {{had already}} relinquished the {{leadership}} after the First Testand Booth was elevated to the vice-captaincy under Bob Simpson for the 1964 tour of England. Along with Simpson and Lawry, Booth was one of three on-tour selectors. Some observers felt that the personable Booth would have been more popular among the playing group than Simpson, while <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> that he would not have been hard-nosed enough in pursuing his team's competitive interest. While Simpson was known for being relentlessly hard-nosed, he was also abrasive and sometimes irritated others by making derogatory comments towards teammates. Booth again ran daily fitness classes during the voyage, and on this occasion, Simpson made them compulsory for the players. Booth started the tour well, scoring 109 not out in his third match for the summer, against Surrey. He passed 50 three more times before the start of the Tests, when his form waned.|$|E
5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> Shabazz was doing whatever she had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E

5|$|Multi-purpose types {{like the}} Charolais and the Morvan were slowly supplanted in farmers' favor by draft horses. The Nivernais breed, in particular, was {{preferred}} by farmers and threatened {{the existence of}} the Charolais. Thus, the original small multi-purpose strain of Charolais gave way to a type of small draft horse that was next crossed with purebred and crossbred Thoroughbreds until, by 1850, it had become a horse for cavalry purposes. It was thought by some enthusiasts, however, that this outcrossing reduced the quality of the breed, and many missed the old-style Charolais, which had disappeared {{due to a lack of}} demand and use. However, <b>others</b> <b>thought</b> that the outcrossings had benefited the Charolais breed: in 1919, one author stated that the breeding of the Charolais type was in excellent condition, and a report from the time stated that the favorite horse of King Albert I of Belgium was a Charolais named Titanic.|$|E
