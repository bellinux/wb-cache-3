2500|$|Comedy Central premiered Office Space on August 5, 2001 and 1.4 {{million viewers}} tuned in. By 2003, the channel had {{broadcast}} the film another 35 times.

He said, [...] "I get a lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>say,</b> 'I quit my job because of you.' That's kind of a heavy load to carry." [...] People approached Stephen Root asking him to sign their staplers. The red Swingline stapler featured prominently in the film was not available until April 2002 when the company released it in response to repeated requests by fans of the film. Its appearance in the film was achieved by taking a standard Swingline stapler and spray-painting it red.|$|E

I relate these results to the jurisprudence of social norms and to economic development...|$|R
