These apologetics attempt to justify his piracy, blaming it <b>on</b> <b>poverty,</b> revenge or a desire to restore his family's honor, and portray Cofresí as a class hero defying official inequality and corruption. He {{is said to have}} been a protector and benefactor of children, women and the elderly, with some accounts describing him as a rebel hero and supporter of independence from imperial power.|$|E
5|$|Wax was {{particularly}} involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MCCR). The MCCR {{was formed in}} 1958 {{by a group of}} Memphis city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War <b>on</b> <b>Poverty</b> Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.|$|E

40|$|The {{poverty level}} in Pakistan has been {{increasing}} and despite decades after independence {{it is still a}} very critical socioeconomic issue. This study examines the effects of macroeconomic variables (GDP, inflation, unemployment, and tax revenues) <b>on</b> the <b>poverty</b> rate in Pakistan since 1974 to 2014. Moreover, this study also investigated the impact of a different regime i. e. democracy and military regime with reference to macroeconomic variables and poverty rate. The descriptive statistical analysis was carried out by using graphs and inferential statistical analysis was performed using Pearsons correlation and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that the real GDP and tax revenues have significant negative effects <b>on</b> the <b>poverty</b> rate. The inflation also showed a significant positive effect <b>on</b> the <b>poverty</b> rate, which implied that an increase in inflation hurts the poor more and leads to increased poverty. The unemployment rate showed insignificant positive impact <b>on</b> the <b>poverty</b> rate. <b>On</b> the aspect of influence of different regimes i. e. democracy and military rule, the results showed democracy has a negative impact <b>on</b> the <b>poverty</b> rate, implying that the democratic regimes are more favourable for poverty reduction in Pakistan. gross domestic product; GDP; inflation; unemployment; tax revenues; poverty rate; political regimen; macroeconomic dynamics; Pakistan; democracy; military regimes; poor...|$|R
