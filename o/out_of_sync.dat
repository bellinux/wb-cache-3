5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical retainer can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the works}} created {{during the war}} was Yakov Knyazhnin's tragedy Olga (1772). The Russian playwright chose to {{introduce}} Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> with the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival Nikolai Nikolev (1758–1815) also wrote a play {{on the subject of}} Sviatoslav's life. Ivan Akimov's painting Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of Poussinesque rendering of early medieval subject matter.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers, such as John Cage, John Corigliano, and Steve Reich, Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich {{discovered}} a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync,</b> creating a natural sense of development. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah {{for only}} the third time since Thanksgiving was {{declared}} a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899; and due to the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.

25|$|In late 1999, Timberlake {{appeared}} in the Disney Channel movie Model Behavior. He played Jason Sharpe, a model {{who falls in love}} with a waitress after mistaking her for another model. It was released on March 12, 2000. The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to the dissolution of NSYNC. Band member Lance Bass was openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sync.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historically the paschal {{full moon}} date {{for a year}} was found from its {{sequence}} number in the Metonic cycle, called the golden number, which cycle repeats the lunar phase on a certain date every 19 years. This method was abandoned in the Gregorian reform because the tabular dates go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> with reality after about two centuries, but from the epact method a simplified table can be constructed that has a validity of one to three centuries.|$|E
40|$|Synapsins are {{abundant}} synaptic vesicle proteins with an essential regulatory {{function in the}} nerve terminal. We determined the crystal structure <b>of</b> a fragment (<b>synC)</b> consisting <b>of</b> residues 110 - 420 of bovine synapsin I; synC coincides with the large middle domain (C-domain), the most conserved domain <b>of</b> synapsins. <b>SynC</b> molecules are folded into compact domains and form closely associated dimers. SynC monomers are strikingly similar in structure to a family of ATP-utilizing enzymes, which includes glutathione synthetase and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase. SynC binds ATP in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. The crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>synC</b> in complex with ATPgammaS and Ca 2 + explains the preference <b>of</b> <b>synC</b> for Ca 2 + over Mg 2 +. Our results suggest that synapsins may also be ATP-utilizing enzymes...|$|R

25|$|Karaites and Samaritans use {{different}} versions of the Jewish calendar, which are often <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> with the modern Jewish calendar by one or two days. In 2009, for example, Nisan 15 on the Jewish calendar used by Rabbinic Judaism corresponds to April 9. On the calendars used by Karaites and Samaritans, Abib or Aviv 15 (as opposed to 'Nisan') corresponds to April 11 in 2009. The Karaite and Samaritan Passovers are each one day long, followed by the six-day Festival of Unleavened Bread – for a total of seven days.|$|E
25|$|The Church's {{interest}} in astronomy began with purely practical concerns, {{when in the}} 16th century Pope Gregory XIII required astronomers to correct {{for the fact that}} the Julian calendar had fallen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> with the sky. Since the Spring equinox was tied to the celebration of Easter, the Church considered that this steady movement in the date of the equinox was undesirable. The resulting Gregorian calendar is the internationally accepted civil calendar used throughout the world today and is an important contribution of the Catholic Church to Western Civilisation. It was introduced by Pope Gregory XIII, after whom the calendar was named, by a decree signed on 24 February 1582. In 1789, the Vatican Observatory opened. It was moved to Castel Gandolfo in the 1930s and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope began making observation in Arizona, USA, in 1995.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the biotic {{communities}} of the Great Plains, the potential repercussions of these changes could be felt {{in a variety of}} ways. Extreme droughts could kill vegetation, potentially causing the collapse of agriculture in some areas increasing the risk of erosion. This loss of growing medium, nutrients and moisture retention could prove to be a devastating blow to any ecosystem that may try to reclaim the land as well as leaving the barren areas susceptible to more stress tolerant invasive species. Additionally, droughts could dry up prairie potholes essential for the breeding of many species, especially migratory waterbirds. Changes in temperature have the potential to cause range shifts for some species, possibly increasing competition between species that never previously shared a range and even decreasing populations of or eliminating species that can’t effectively spread or adapt to new conditions. Temperature changes, especially earlier springs, could also cause changes in phenology which could put organisms <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> with their ecosystem and eventually lead to their decline. Other potential issues include a loss of biodiversity and decreased productivity within the ecoregion.|$|E
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sync</b> from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E

[...] "Make You Mine" [...] came to fruition after Jonas expressed a desire to create a [...] "Michael Jackson tribute" [...] for the album. Jim Beanz is credited as a producer on four songs for the project. Rob Knox worked with Jonas on three songs for the record, including the album's lead single [...] "See No More" [...] and the title track. Knox was quoted as saying [...] "I look at Joe's scenario as kind of like when Justin Timberlake broke <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 'N <b>Sync.</b> Justin was 21 when he came out as a solo artist.
