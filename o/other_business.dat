5|$|According to Cooney and O'Dell, the 1980s were a {{problematic}} {{period for the}} Workshop. Other than Sesame Street, many of its productions were not successful. 3-2-1 Contact premiered during 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988. The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science-oriented series like Square One Television, which was broadcast from 1987 to 1992, was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education. A series of poor investments in video games, motion picture production, theme parks, and <b>other</b> <b>business</b> ventures hurt the organization financially. Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late 1970s {{to work on their}} licensing agreements, but he was unable to compensate for the CTW's losses until 1986, when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased.|$|E
