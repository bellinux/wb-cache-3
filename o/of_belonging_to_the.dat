5|$|Originally, Darwaza {{supported}} the Ottoman Empire {{based on his}} feelings of identification with Islam and <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> larger Ottoman Muslim ummah ("nation"). In 1906, {{he served in the}} local Ottoman administration as a clerk in the Department of Telegraphic and Postal Services (DTPS) in Nablus. His first assignment in that department was for the District of Beisan and northern Palestine (the Galilee and northern Samaria). He was also an Arabist and was enthusiastic about the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, expecting that the new Ottoman government would institute reforms and grant the Arabs autonomy {{within the framework of the}} empire.|$|E
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E
25|$|The valiha, the {{national}} instrument of Madagascar, was originally {{an instrument of}} the masses but came to be affiliated with the noble class in the 19th century. The valiha featured heavily in {{the music of the}} Merina royal court performed at palaces such as Ambohimanga or the Rova at Antananarivo. The strings of the valiha were more easily plucked with the fingernails, which were commonly grown long for this purpose; long fingernails became fashionable and symbolic <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> andriana class within the Kingdom of Imerina.|$|E

25|$|The {{seizure of}} power by {{dictator}} Ioannis Metaxas in 1936 had a significant bearing on the pattern of Greek–Jewish relations in Thessaloniki. Metaxas' regime was not antisemitic; it perceived the Venizelists and the Communists as its political enemies, and Bulgaria as its major foreign enemy. This endeared Metaxas to two influential Jewish groups: the upper/middle classes, which felt threatened by organized labor and the socialist movement, and Jewish refugees who had fled Bulgaria and the Bitola region during the Balkan Wars. Antisemitic organizations and publications were banned {{and support for the}} regime was sufficiently strong for a Jewish charter of the regime-sponsored National Organisation of Youth (EON) to be formed. This reinforced the trend of national self-identification as Greeks among the Jews of Salonika, who had been Greek citizens since 1913. Even in the concentration camps, Greek Jews never ceased to affirm their sense <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greek nation.|$|E
25|$|In Central Park a band intones the American {{national}} anthem and starts marching {{together with a}} group of majorettes. In her own space, Marilyn thinks of her unhappy childhood. In Korea, standing amongst the casualties, General MacArthur is reinvigorating his troops and recounting his speech to Congress in favour of the war. Marilyn reflects on her life and complains about being considered as just a sex symbol. Various characters suspected <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American Communist Party appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for interrogation. Marilyn calls Doctor Johnson on the phone and talks about her irrational fears of going insane, her feelings of loneliness, emptiness, and depersonalization. In the background books are being burned, including those by Wilhelm Reich. The psychiatrist, on the brink of madness, is taken off to prison. In an imaginary duet with Marilyn, he rants about being persecuted like Christ whilst she speaks about her distress.|$|E

25|$|According to the Khalimpur {{copper plate}} inscription, the first Pala king Gopala {{was the son}} of a warrior named Vapyata. The Ramacharitam attests that Varendra (North Bengal) was the {{fatherland}} (Janakabhu) of the Palas. The ethnic origins of the dynasty are unknown, although the later records claim that Gopala was a Kshatriya belonging to the legendary solar dynasty. The Ballala-Carita states that the Palas were Kshatriyas, a claim reiterated by Taranatha in his History of Buddhism in India as well as Ghanaram Chakrabarty in his Dharmamangala (both written in the 16th century CE). The Ramacharitam also attests the fifteenth Pala emperor, Ramapala, as a Kshatriya. Claims <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mythical solar dynasty are unreliable and clearly appear to be an attempt to cover up the humble origins of the dynasty. The Pala dynasty has also been branded as Śudra in some sources such as Manjushri-Mulakalpa; this might be because of their Buddhist leanings. According to Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak (in Ain-i-Akbari), the Palas were Kayasthas. There are even accounts that claim Gopala may have been from a Brahmin lineage.|$|E
25|$|The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, {{wheeled vehicle}} used {{to discern the}} {{southern}} cardinal direction (without magnetics), was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary Fu Xuan. The contemporary 3rd century CE source of the Weilüe, written by the East Han Dynasty politician Yuan Huan also described the south-pointing chariot <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese mechanical engineer and politician Ma Jun. The Jin Dynasty (265420 CE) era text of the Shu Zheng Ji (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern gatehouse of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city. However, the later written Song Shu (Book of Song) (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as created background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the Western Zhou Dynasty (1050771 BCE). The book also provided description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century CE text reads as follows. (In this translation, by The British scientist and historian Joseph Needham, the south-pointing chariot {{is referred to as}} the south-pointing carriage.|$|E
25|$|Blanchett {{is married}} to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in 1996 {{on the set of}} a TV show and were married on 29 December 1997. Blanchett and Upton have four children: {{biological}} sons Dashiell John (b. December 2001), Roman Robert (b. April 2004), and Ignatius Martin (b. April 2008), and adopted daughter Edith Vivian Patricia, whose adoption was confirmed in March 2015. Blanchett said {{that she and her husband}} had been wanting to adopt ever since the birth of their first child. After making Brighton, England their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006. In November 2006, Blanchett attributed this move to desires to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and to have a sense <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australian theatrical community. She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. Their Hunters Hill residence underwent extensive renovations in 2007 to be made more eco-friendly. Following the sale of their property there in late 2015, Blanchett and Upton purchased a house in East Sussex, England in early 2016.|$|E
