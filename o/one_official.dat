5|$|On 12 June, Wrawe {{attacked}} Sir Richard Lyons' {{property at}} Overhall, advancing on to Cavendish and Bury St Edmunds in west Suffolk the next day, gathering further support as they went. John Cambridge, the Prior {{of the wealthy}} Bury St Edmunds Abbey, was disliked in the town, and Wrawe allied himself with the townspeople and stormed the abbey. The Prior escaped, but was found two days later and beheaded. A small band of rebels marched north to Thetford to extort protection money from the town, and another group tracked down Sir John Cavendish, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. Cavendish was caught in Lakenheath and killed. John Battisford and Thomas Sampson independently led a revolt near Ipswich on 14 June. They took the town without opposition and looted {{the properties of the}} archdeacon and local tax officials.

5|$|The Scottish Football Union (SFU), the {{governing}} body for rugby union in Scotland, {{did not give}} the New Zealanders an official welcome, and sent only <b>one</b> <b>official</b> to greet them on their arrival in Edinburgh.

One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from David Bedell-Sivright, who was Scotland's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand. Bedell-Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year, especially regarding the wing-forward play of Gallaher.|$|E
