5|$|Black {{honeyeaters}} feed on nectar, {{and have}} a long curved bill to reach the base of tubular flowers {{such as those of}} the emu bush. They also take insects on the wing, and regularly eat charcoal left behind at campfires. The male engages in a soaring song flight in the mating season, but contributes little to nest building and incubation. Both sexes feed and care for the young. While the population appears to be decreasing, the black honeyeater is sufficiently numerous and widespread to be considered least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List <b>of</b> <b>Endangered</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads its narrow neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List <b>of</b> <b>Endangered</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 1996, {{the alpine}} pika has been rated {{a species of}} least concern on the IUCN Red List <b>of</b> <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species.</b> This is because it is widespread, with no known {{population}} decline.
