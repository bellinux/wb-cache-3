5|$|<b>One</b> <b>feature</b> {{that has}} always been heavily {{promoted}} is Eastbourne's floral displays, most notably the Carpet Gardens along the coastal road near the pier. These displays, and the town as a whole, frequently win awards – such as the 'Coastal Resort B' category in the 2003 Britain in Bloom competition.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. <b>One</b> <b>feature</b> continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
5|$|In October 1999, Dream Quest Images, {{a special}} effects studio {{previously}} purchased by The Walt Disney Company in April 1996 to replace Buena Vista Visual Effects, was {{merged with the}} computer-graphics operation of Walt Disney Feature Animation to form a division called The Secret Lab. The Secret Lab produced <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> film, Dinosaur, which was released in May 2000 and featured CGI prehistoric creatures against filmed live-action backgrounds. The $128 million production earned $349 million worldwide, below studio expectations, and the Secret Lab was closed in 2001.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1990s Quin-Harkin {{began writing}} mystery novels for adults {{under the name}} [...] "Rhys Bowen". She has written three series under this name: <b>one</b> <b>featuring</b> British aristocrat Lady Georgiana ("Georgie") in 1930s England; <b>one</b> <b>featuring</b> Irish {{immigrant}} Molly Murphy living in early 1900s New York City; and <b>one</b> <b>featuring</b> a Welsh police constable named Evan Evans.|$|R
5|$|Subsequent discoveries and {{analyses}} upheld Sternberg's {{view on the}} position of Triceratops, with Lehman defining both subfamilies in 1990 and diagnosing Triceratops as ceratopsine (chasmosaurine of his usage) {{on the basis of}} several morphological features. In fact, it fits well into the ceratopsine subfamily, apart from its <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> of a shortened frill. Further research by Peter Dodson, including a 1990 cladistic analysis and a 1993 study using RFTRA (resistant-fit theta-rho analysis), a morphometric technique which systematically measures similarities in skull shape, reinforces Triceratops placement in the ceratopsine subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the Dutch East Indies, with over forty {{domestic}} productions released. Following the Japanese occupation in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the ethnic Chinese-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> film– Rd Ariffien's Berdjoang (Struggle; 1943)– six short films, and several newsreels. All were pro-Japanese propaganda.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{closed on}} January 1, 1921. The Blue Flame was Bara's last Broadway {{performance}} and her last acting tour. She did {{a season of}} vaudeville touring, but did not act in it; instead she talked with audiences and told stories about her career. Her only subsequent stage acting was in a Little Theatre production of Bella Donna in 1934. Bara's film career was also waning. She acted in only <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> film after The Blue Flame ended, the 1925 drama The Unchastened Woman.|$|E
50|$|WarioWare: Snapped! {{is set in}} a theme park. There {{are four}} sets of microgames - <b>one</b> <b>featuring</b> Wario, <b>one</b> <b>featuring</b> Mona, <b>one</b> <b>featuring</b> Jimmy T., and <b>one</b> <b>featuring</b> Kat & Ana. It only has 20 microgames, a {{fraction}} of the microgames found in the average WarioWare title. This title also allows for more time to play the microgames. It uses the Nintendo DSi's built-in digital camera to make a silhouette of the player to use as a character in the microgames with the Nintendo DSi placed on a flat surface.|$|R

5|$|The crusades were {{intended}} to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 {{in response to a}} request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. <b>One</b> <b>feature</b> of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Xperiment came at an opportune time for Hammer. By 1955 {{the deal with}} Robert L. Lippert had expired and the company {{produced}} just <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> film that year, Women Without Men. Many of the independent cinemas that provided the market for Hammer's films in the UK were struggling {{in the face of}} competition from television and faced closure. The Quatermass Xperiment gave Hammer a much needed box office hit and was also the first film to bring the company to the attention of a major film distributor, in this case United Artists. From this point onward, Hammer was increasingly able to deal directly with the major distributors and no longer needed intermediaries like Lippert. This ultimately spelt the end for Exclusive Films, Hammer's own distribution company, which was wound down in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> film, and the producers decided to go after someone who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E

25|$|The local context {{where the}} topic of family resemblances appears is Wittgenstein's {{critique}} of language. In Philosophical Investigations §65-71 the plurality of language uses is compared to the plurality of games. Next it is asserted that games have common features but no <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> is found in all of them. The whole argument has become famous under the heading 'language games'.|$|E
25|$|The round stone {{tower is}} <b>one</b> <b>feature</b> of early {{historic}} architecture not usually found outside Ireland {{with only three}} in Scotland {{and one on the}} Isle of Man.
