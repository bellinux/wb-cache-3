5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, <b>octanoic</b> <b>acid</b> and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background For cachectic {{patients}} with chronic respiratory disease (CRD), conventional enteral nutrition formula is an optional treatment to maintain energy balance. The molecular mechanisms by which enteral nutrition formula controls appetite and weight remain unknown. We examined whether enteral nutrition formula rich in <b>octanoic</b> <b>acids</b> would increase plasma levels of ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone produced in the stomach, in cachectic {{patients with}} CRD. Methods Plasma ghrelin profiles in cachectic patients with CRD were assessed and compared with those in age- and sex-matched controls. Plasma levels of acyl-ghrelin, an active ghrelin modified by <b>octanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> and desacyl-ghrelin were measured separately. We examined changes in 24 -h plasma ghrelin profiles before and after single administration of the formula. We also evaluated the effects of 2 -week administration of the formula on plasma ghrelin levels and nutritional status in patients. Results The ratio of acyl-ghrelin to desacyl-ghrelin in plasma was lower in patients than in controls. Single administration of the formula did not change plasma desacyl-ghrelin levels, but induced an increase in acyl-ghrelin levels. Two-week treatment with the formula was effective in increasing weight and acyl-ghrelin, along with improving nutritional status in patients. Conclusion These {{results show that the}} formula contributes to increased weight, which may be associated with induction of acyl-ghrelin production in cachectic patients with CRD. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract During {{treatment}} of winery and distillery wastewater by natural evaporation in ponds, formation of malodorous compounds induces harmful olfactory effects. In this work, we studied {{the origin of}} malodorous compounds and methods to prevent and treat odours. The formation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from pure substrates (glycerol, lactic and tartaric acids, ethanol) and complex media (winery and distillery wastewater) was studied. Various anaerobic bacteria ferment the glycerol and produce butyric or propionic acid. Valeric and caproic acids were observed at lower concentrations than butyric and propionic acids, but their malodorous intensities were higher. Microflora produce butyric, valeric, caproic, heptanoic and <b>octanoic</b> <b>acids</b> from ethanol, {{the main component of}} winery wastewater. When nitrate (an electron acceptor) is added, catabolism leads to an anaerobic respiration phenomenon (denitrification). The organic compounds are oxidised to CO 2 and the nitrate is reduced to N 2 (odourless compounds), without VFA formation. The preventive {{treatment of}} odours by nitrate addition was tested on an industrial scale in winery and distillery ponds. Furthermore, the study took the effect of nitrate on VFA degradation into consideration. The results make it possible to consider using nitrate for the curative treatment of pond odours...|$|R

Odor thresholds and interindividual differences in olfactory acuity among these young, normosmic participants were lower than traditionally thought and reported. No significant effects of gender on odor detectability were observed.

The discovery study included 144 TBI patients, with the samples taken at the time of hospitalization. The patients were diagnosed as severe (sTBI; n= 22), moderate (moTBI; n= 14) or mild TBI (mTBI; n= 108) according to Glasgow Coma Scale. The control group (n= 28) comprised of acute orthopedic non-brain injuries. The validation study included sTBI (n= 23), moTBI (n= 7), mTBI (n= 37) patients and controls (n= 27). We show that two medium-chain fatty <b>acids</b> (decanoic and <b>octanoic</b> <b>acids)</b> and sugar derivatives including 2, 3 -bisphosphoglyceric acid are strongly associated with severity of TBI, and most of them are also detected at high concentrations in brain microdialysates of TBI patients.

All the mass uptake results are well described by a simple Fickian model (for t < t 1 / 2) and were {{used to calculate the}} corresponding diffusion coefficients using the thin-film approximation. Acetic acid exhibits a peculiar diffusion rate: its diffusion coefficients in polystyrene do not follow the same trend of all the remaining acids, being smaller than those of hexanoic acid at the same temperatures. Polystyrene swells at a higher rate in hexanoic and <b>octanoic</b> <b>acids</b> than in acetic acid, at the same temperature. This peculiarity is confirmed using NMR spectroscopy for acetic and hexanoic acids. For all the carboxylic acids considered, the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients is non-Arrhenius in character. For each liquid penetrant, its log(D) increases linearly with the decrease in liquid viscosity associated with an increase in temperature. Plots of log(n 2 D) versus n suggest that higher-n carboxylic acids diffuse through a reptation-like mechanism at higher temperatures.
