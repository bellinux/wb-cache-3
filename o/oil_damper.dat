5000|$|The [...] "Progress 4WDS" [...] was Kyosho's first {{electric}} 4WD off-road racer. The motor {{was mounted}} on the rear overhang, and the forward wheel moves with a chain extending from the rear gearbox. This chain system was also tried on the on-road racer, [...] "Fantom EP." [...] The rear suspension was an orthodox double trailing arm and <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> with coil springs, but the front suspension featured a double wishbone and mono damper, and substituted a torsion bar for a spring. This unique front suspension was rather difficult to set up, and had a short arm, which prevented it from taking powerful strokes.|$|E
5000|$|Races with {{electric}} off-road cars increased in popularity {{after the release}} of Tamiya's Rough Rider. The 2WD [...] "Scorpion" [...] was released by Kyosho during this period. Kyosho had been promoting its 1/8 scale engine buggy [...] "Circuit 20" [...] in races at the time, and the Scorpion can be described as a miniaturized version of the Circuit 20. The double trailing arm front suspension, semi-streaming rear suspension, aluminum ladder frame, rear-mounted RS540S motor, <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> and coil springs very much resemble the design for a 1/8 scale racing buggy of the time. The thin body was realized by placing the batteries pointing forward, and its light weight (1680g, with full equipment) gave it a huge advantage over rival models. Its main rivals were Tamiya's Rough Rider and ayk's 556B.|$|E

The right bar has bigger <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> section, with regulated rebound and compression damping. According to the manufacturer, this asymmetric design provides a reduction of the friction inside the fork, significant mass loss and more friendly response of suspension. The KTRC system uses manipulation of the ignition timing on all 3 traction control modes, while mode 3 (rain mode) also uses a separate throttle controlled by the on-board electronics, to allow faster reaction for wheel over-spin on slippery surfaces. Traction control and power modes can be adjusted or turned off whenever the throttle is closed, even while riding the bike. The bike is sold without a steering damper, as Kawasaki reports that people complained about the OEM steering dampers in the previous model, {{so they decided to}} not include one into the new bike.|$|E

The length stroke {{is a part}} of the Opticruise system, in which the mechanical gear shifting process is performed by pneumatic actuators. To reduce piston velocity before the cylinder walls are reached, an <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> is attached to the pneumatic actuator. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate if the <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> can be replaced by a pneumatic feedback control law, a model predictive control scheme or an alter-native mechanical construction; in the interest of cost reduction, robustness, shift comfort and shift time. To be able to do a systematic analysis, a mathematical model of the length stroke is developed. The model, developed using a length stroke that is not mounted on a truck, captures the essential dynamics of the system and is used to evaluate control strategies and investigate system properties. As the delay in feedback information from the different sensors is larger than the process time constant, a pneumatic feedback control law is discarded. A mode...|$|E

40|$|The {{connection}} of two building structures with dampers {{is one of}} effective vibration control systems. In this vibration control system, both buildings have to possess different vibration properties {{in order to provide}} a higher vibration reduction performance. In addition to such condition of different vibration properties of both buildings, the connecting dampers also {{play an important role in}} the vibration control mechanism. In this paper, the effect of nonlinearity of connecting dampers on the vibration control of connected building structures is investigated in detail. A high-damping rubber damper and an <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> with and without relief mechanism are treated. It is shown that, while the high-damping rubber damper is effective in a rather small deformation level, the linear <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> is effective in a relatively large deformation level. It is further shown that, while the oil dampers reduce the response in the same phase as the case without dampers, the high-damping rubber dampers change the phase. The merit is that the high-damping rubber can reduce the damper deformation and keep the sufficient space between both buildings. This can mitigate the risk of building pounding...|$|E

The suggested hybrid method can {{take account of}} cable sag, cable internal damping, damper stiffness, damper mass, and others. The results show that an <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> with appropriate parameters selected can effectively suppress the vibration of a cable under harmonic excitation. The cable sag, damper stiffness, cable internal damping, and others do affect damper performance. In particular, if a cable has symmetric modes of vibration near the frequency crossover points excited by harmonic loading, the damper may lose its function to suppress these modes of vibration. The possible reasons behind this and the measures to overcome the frequency crossover problem are explored and some preliminary results are presented.

The implementation of skyhook control suffered performance degradation from the idealization due to particular elements of hardware, however acceleration driven damping showed a marked and statistically significant improvement over skyhook control, in hardware, by 14 %. The combined control laws exhibited as yet unexplained transient behavior that produced results with low confidence in their veracity.

40|$|The {{deflation}} of an airspring deteriorates {{the riding}} comfort of railway vehicles {{due to an}} increased bending vibration of the car body. This paper describes {{the results of a}} calculation analysis for the car body-bending vibration with deflated airsprings excited at the car body. The results are summed up as follows. The bending vibration characteristics are affected to a large degree by the damping force acting to the primary suspension (axle spring). In case of the bogie structure in which the frictional force of high damping acts on the axle spring, the natural frequency of car bodybending increases when its airsprings deflate. The natural frequency decreases in the bogie structure which has a low damping force such as the usual oil dampers for the axle spring. Unless the <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> fails, the acceleration amplitude of the latter structure is less than the former one under the deflation of airsprings...|$|E
40|$|The {{formulation}} derived in Part I of {{this paper}} is applied to investigate non-linear vibration behavior of inclined sag cables with and without oil dampers in long-span cable-stayed bridges. The inclined sag cables used in computation are also tested in the laboratory with scaled cables and oil dampers.

Both theoretical analyses and experiments display some typical non-linear behavior of cable vibration, including response hardening, response bifurcation, multiple solutions, jump, and internal resonance. They also demonstrate that an <b>oil</b> <b>damper</b> with an appropriate damping coefficient being selected can effectively suppress large vibration amplitudes of the cable so that in some cases, non-linear cable vibration problem may become a linear vibration problem.

40|$|Vibration {{mitigation}} of {{stay cables}} in cable-stayed bridges using oil dampers was experimentally investigated with scaled model cables and oil dampers. The increased cable modal damping ratios attributed to oil dampers were measured, {{and the relationship}} between the increased modal damping ratio and damper damping coefficient was pursued through a series of free vibration tests. The stay cable-oil damper systems were then driven by harmonic and planar excitation. The linear and nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the systems were observed. Free vibration tests confirmed the theoretical prediction that there is an optimum damper size by which the maximum modal damping ratio can be achieved. Free vibration tests also verified the theoretical finding that cable sag may affect damper performance due to frequency avoidance.

Firstly, the vibration transmissibility from the rough road to the vehicle’s body for all these suspensions was de-termined under the constraint that damping varies versus the excitation frequency.

The experimental work mainly focused on evaluating the equivalent structural damping ratio of a cable-damper system using forced vibration tests. General damper design curves based on the current experimental results have been developed and compared with those in the existing literature. In addition, the damper stiffness effect, which is ignored in the past work, has been extensively studied.

An approximately linear relationship is found to exist between the damper stiffness and the damping ratio. As stiffness of the damper increases, the equivalent modal damping ratio of the system will decrease...|$|E
