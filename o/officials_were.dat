5|$|As Ottoman {{rule in the}} Balkans expanded, Albanian timar holders and <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> {{once again}} {{replaced}} with Anatolian ones.

5|$|From {{passage in}} 1961 until {{approximately}} 1971, political <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> not prosecuted under the Travel Act.

50|$|Further {{complicating the}} job of an <b>official</b> <b>is</b> the {{proximity}} to the crowds. Unlike football or baseball, the crowd is nearly always located within {{a few feet of}} the <b>official,</b> as <b>are</b> coaches and other players on the bench. To combat this, <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> able to remove a fan from the arena with an ejection.|$|R
50|$|A main {{distinction}} between COPE and the ruling ANC party is that COPE favours {{a system in}} which top-level government <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> elected directly, by public election, and <b>officials</b> can <b>be</b> removed only by courts of justice, whereas the current situation in South Africa is that top-level government <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> appointed and can be removed from office by the political parties themselves.|$|R

5|$|In May 2015, a {{detailed}} {{article in the}} London Review of Books by journalist Seymour Hersh said that the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006, and that Pakistani Army chief Pervez Kayani and ISI director Ahmad Shuja Pasha aided the U.S. mission to kill, not capture bin Laden. According to Hersh, Pakistani <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> always aware of bin Laden's location and were guarding the compound with their own soldiers. Pakistan decided to give up bin Laden's location to the U.S. because American aid was declining. Pakistani <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> aware of the raid, and assisted the U.S. in carrying it out. According to Hersh, bin Laden was basically an invalid.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{programs}} in Singapore {{had a profound}} effect on the Communist leadership in China, who made a major effort, especially under Deng Xiaoping, to emulate his policies of economic growth, entrepreneurship, and subtle suppression of dissent. Over 22,000 Chinese <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> sent to Singapore to study its methods.|$|E
5|$|Military {{rule was}} {{replaced}} by a civilian government by way of the Foraker Act of 1900. However, the Act stipulated that the governor, chief of police and top <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> presidentially appointed and they were all to be Americans.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} codes of {{football}}, where the <b>official</b> <b>is</b> called a referee, in Australian rules football the <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> called umpires.

5|$|Tech's {{selection}} to the Gator Bowl was a controversial one.

5|$|The {{impact of}} Graffham was minimal.

5|$|Though {{they were}} {{concerned}} by low attendance at the game, Gator Bowl <b>officials</b> <b>were</b> able to renegotiate a sponsorship agreement with Toyota Motor Company after the game's previous contract expired following the game.|$|E
50|$|Another {{challenge}} {{is the need}} for a prompt and irrevocable decision. Election results need to be confirmed promptly, before <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> sworn into office. In many commercial uses of information technology, managers can reverse computer errors even when detected long after the event. However, once elected <b>officials</b> <b>are</b> sworn into office, they begin to make decisions such as voting on legislation or signing contracts on behalf of the government. Even if the <b>official</b> <b>were</b> to be removed because a computer error was discovered to have put that official in office, it would not be possible to reverse all the consequences of the error.|$|R

5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement.

Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman countercoup of 1909, Quwatli {{strongly}} supported the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) against Abdul Hamid II.
