5|$|Grande {{embarked}} {{on her first}} solo concert tour titled The Listening Sessions in support <b>of</b> <b>Yours</b> Truly. Pre-sale tickets went on sale on July 18, 2013. Regular tickets went on sale on July 19. Pre-sale tickets {{had to be taken}} down early, as they were selling at such a fast rate that the tour was almost sold before regular tickets were available. Grande also was the opening act for the last three US dates of Justin Bieber's Believe Tour. The performances took place in Jacksonville, Tampa, and Atlanta on August 7, August 8, and August 10, in support of the album. It was at these Listening Sessions that Grande discovered the album reached number one on US iTunes.|$|E

And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it <b>of</b> <b>yours?</b> You just shut your mouth, and stay out of it.

According to Koons, Gaga [...] "just kind of grabbed ahold of me {{and gave me a}} big hug around my waist and replied, 'You know, Jeff, I've been such a fan <b>of</b> <b>yours,</b> and when I was a kid just hanging out in Central Park I would talk to my friends about your work'." [...] In addition to Interscope Records notifying mainstream media outlets about upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga announced plans for a multimedia software application which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community." ...|$|E
500|$|Bosanquet's {{performances}} {{during the}} season earned him a place on Warner's team for the first tour of Australia by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which was to include Test matches. Warner later wrote that {{he was accused of}} selecting Bosanquet out of favouritism as they played on the same county team, and received [...] "a hail of criticism and disapprobation" [...] as a result. Before the tour began, Sussex and England batsman C. B. Fry wrote an open letter to Warner in the Daily Express, stating Warner [...] "must persuade that Bosanquet <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> to practise, practise, practise those funny 'googlies' of his till he is automatically certain of his length. That leg-break of his which breaks from the off might win a test match!" ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, rebel strength peaked at around 50,000 fighters. Despite their initial successes, the rebel leaders were seldom on good terms, and constant infighting plagued their camp. In {{the western part}} of the country, Jakov Nenadović was the principle figure. In the east, Milenko Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac held sway. The latter two opposed Karađorđe's attempts to create a centralized state, fearing that this would result in their own power being diminished. Others, such as Nenadović, complained that Karađorđe was becoming too authoritarian. Nenadović suggested that the rebels establish a central council to rein in Karađorđe's power and write up a constitution based on the rule of law. Karađorđe balked at the possibility. [...] "It's easy for this sovereign law <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> to rule in a warm room, behind this table," [...] he responded, [...] "but let us see tomorrow, when the Turks strike, who will meet them and beat them." ...|$|E

500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E
500|$|Evan Sawdey, a Popmatters {{interview}} Editor, {{called it}} the second best song from My Everything, coming close to [...] "Love Me Harder", and Bustle writer Kadeen Griffiths called it [...] "one of Grande's best love songs so far." [...] HollywoodLife's Caitlin Beck said it was [...] "sure to be another hit!" [...] Carolyn Menyes of the Music Times applauded Grande for her calming vocals and transition into a more mature sound of music. Billboards Jason Lipshutz called the production [...] "impressive" [...] and said the song [...] "rows stickier upon each listen". Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner and Entertainmentwise's Shaun Kitchener noted the song showed her R roots, the latter stating that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded out of place on Kelly Rowland's under-rated last album [...]" [...] The Official Charts Company critic Rob Copsey felt it was [...] "like an extension <b>of</b> <b>Yours</b> Truly, albeit moodier and more grown up." [...] Brennan Carley of Spin called it [...] "classic Grande, eshcewing any of {{the bells and whistles}} that she's fond of, instead focusing entirely on her carefully sung vocals and the quiet piano line in the song's background." [...] Newsday critic Glenn Gamboa described [...] "Best Mistake" [...] as a [...] "gorgeous hip-hop" [...] song that [...] "showcases her wide-ranging voice, without focusing on the upper notes too much." [...] Sydney Gore of The 405 called it an improvement of the two's previous collaboration [...] "Right There", writing that [...] "the singer and rapper serenade us on the grounds that sneaking around with each other was the best mistake they ever made." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "New Wave" [...] did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} approval among those who were regarded as part of it. [...] Brian Aldiss, for example, wrote to Judith Merril in 1966 that he suspected the term was [...] "a journalistic invention <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> and Mike Moorcock's", and added [...] "I feel I am {{no part of the}} New Wave; I was here before 'em, and by God I mean to be here after they've gone (still writing bloody science fiction)!" [...] Merril was a key advocate for the New Wave, and popularized it in her anthology England Swings SF, which appeared in 1968; she spent almost a year in London, living near Moorcock, when researching the anthology in 1966–1967. [...] Merril and writer Christopher Priest were among those who used the term [...] "New Wave" [...] to describe the work being done in New Worlds, but Aldiss was not the only writer to object to the term, and it never received a generally accepted definition. [...] Critic Brian Attebery characterizes it as a [...] "disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring" [...] style; Peter Nicholls hesitates to define it but comments that [...] "perhaps the fundamental element was the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature". [...] In a 1967 interview, Ballard, one of the writers most closely associated with the New Wave, described modern U.S. sf as extrovert and optimistic, and contrasted it with [...] "the new science fiction, that other people apart from myself are now beginning to write", which he saw as [...] "introverted, possibly pessimistic rather than optimistic, much less certain of its own territory." ...|$|E

500|$|From 1953 to 1967, O'Hara had a {{relationship}} with Enrique Parra, a wealthy Mexican politician and banker. She met him at a restaurant during a trip to Mexico in 1951. O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to do a little publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E

2500|$|On {{two other}} {{occasions}} around this time, Van Gogh {{used the word}} [...] "arrangement" [...] to refer to color, {{similar to the way}} James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, [...] "As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and Veronese greens. As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I’ve never devised anything better." [...] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: [...] "But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> again, like the painting <b>of</b> <b>yours</b> that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you’re exchanging that for something — must one say the word — something artificial — something affected." ...|$|E
