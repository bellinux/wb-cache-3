5|$|The last Ottoman census, {{conducted}} in 1908, counted 128,000 Orthodox Christians and 95,000 Muslims in the region. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> population, an estimated 30,000 to 47,000 spoke Greek exclusively. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> community spoke an Albanian patois at home, but was literate only in Greek, {{which was used}} in cultural, trading and economic activities. Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and {{were the first to}} support the following breakaway autonomist movement. Considering these conditions, loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government competing in an anarchy, whose leaders were mostly Muslim, could not be guaranteed.|$|E

5|$|After basic {{education}} in Greek with a tutor known as Alexe, Ion Heliade Rădulescu taught himself reading in Romanian Cyrillic (reportedly {{by studying the}} Alexander Romance {{with the help of}} his father's Oltenian servants). He subsequently became an avid reader of popular novels, especially during his 1813 sojourn in Gârbovi (where he had been sent after other areas of the country came to be ravaged by Caragea's plague). After 1813, the teenaged Rădulescu was a pupil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> monk Naum Râmniceanu; in 1815, he moved on to the Greek school at Schitu Măgureanu, in Bucharest, and, in 1818, to the Saint Sava School, where he studied under Gheorghe Lazăr's supervision.|$|E
5|$|Andronicus' {{rule was}} marked by {{incompetence}} and short-sighted decisions {{that in the long}} run would damage the Byzantine Empire beyond repair. He began to debase the Byzantine hyperpyron, resulting in a reduction of the value of the Byzantine economy; taxes were decreased for the Powerful, i.e. landed aristocracy and instead placed upon the Knight-class Pronoia. To popularize his rule he repudiated the union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> and Catholic Churches decreed by the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, thereby further increasing hostilities between the Latins and the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was wavering on {{his belief in the}} doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>orthodox</b> Calvinism and became {{one of the leaders of}} the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich's assailants hid in safe {{houses and}} {{eventually}} {{took refuge in}} Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral, an Orthodox church in Prague. After a traitor in the Czech resistance betrayed their location, the church was surrounded by 800 members of the SS and Gestapo. Several Czechs were killed, and the remainder hid in the church's crypt. The Germans attempted to flush the men out with gunfire, tear gas, and by flooding the crypt. Eventually an entrance was made using explosives. Rather than surrender, the soldiers killed themselves.

5|$|Lactantius' De Mortibus Persecutorum, a {{political}} Christian pamphlet on the reigns of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, provides valuable but tendentious detail on Constantine's predecessors and early life. The ecclesiastical histories of Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret describe the ecclesiastic disputes of Constantine's later reign. Written {{during the reign}} of Theodosius II (408–50AD), a century after Constantine's reign, these ecclesiastic historians obscure the events and theologies of the Constantinian period through misdirection, misrepresentation and deliberate obscurity. The contemporary writings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>orthodox</b> Christian Athanasius and the ecclesiastical history of the Arian Philostorgius also survive, though their biases are no less firm.|$|E

5|$|Michael VIII countered the {{emerging}} threat by a diplomatic {{mission to the}} Papacy, which in the Second Council of Lyon (1274) agreed to the union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> and Catholic churches, estranged after the Great Schism of 1054, and thereby placed Michael and his empire under papal protection. Taking advantage of Charles's entanglement in the conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy, in spring 1274 Michael launched an attack against Angevin holdings in Albania. Berat and Buthrotum were taken and Charles's troops were pushed back from the hinterland to the two ports of Valona and Dyrrhachium. Although these were assaulted several times in 1274–1275, they remained in Angevin hands.|$|E
5|$|Mindaugas and his {{antagonist}} Daniel {{reached a}} reconciliation in 1255; the Black Ruthenian lands {{were transferred to}} Roman, Daniel's son. Afterwards Mindaugas's son Vaišvilkas received baptism as a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> faith, becoming a monk and later founding a convent and monastery. Tautvilas's antagonism was temporarily resolved when he recognized Mindaugas's superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom. A direct confrontation with the Mongols occurred in 1258 or 1259, when Berke Khan sent his general Burundai to challenge Lithuanian rule, ordering Daniel and other regional princes to participate. The Novgorod Chronicle describes the following action as a defeat of the Lithuanians, {{but it has also}} been seen as a net gain for Mindaugas.|$|E
5|$|Most {{orthodox}} Christian theologians {{agree with}} the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and {{agree with the}} proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, {{would be capable of}} preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so. The argument from evil concludes that the existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>orthodox</b> Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.|$|E

5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists. Domes standing alone represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other patriarchs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinal Laws, a quasi-constitution {{endorsing}} most of {{the conservative}} laws responsible for the inefficient functioning of the Commonwealth, were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers.

At one point there was a proposal to include a day on the Episcopal Church calendar (which was taken into consideration by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in developing the Lutheran Book of Worship) for Old Testament saints following the octave of All Saints (November 8), but this idea was ultimately rejected as tokenism.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations with Pelagius {{about the}} status of the Church in the Kingdom of Cyprus {{concluded}} with an agreement in October 1220. One of Alice's demands was for Greek Orthodox priests to be exempt from taxation. She also persuaded the pope, who had ordered the abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> hierarchy on the island, to permit the appointment of Orthodox suffragan bishops in the four Roman Catholic dioceses. In time, the agreement was revised, as the Cypriot noblemen opposed the payment of a tithe (as prescribed by the agreement). The Holy See had also demanded that the estates the nobles had seized from the Orthodox Church be restored to the Catholic clerics. However, this new agreement, reached in 1222, neither freed the noblemen from the tithe nor prescribed the restoration of Church property.|$|E
5|$|This {{work was}} the first and only volume by Daniel Philippidis and Grigorios Konstantas, and their {{intention}} was not only to define and describe the lands that were populated by Greeks, but also to describe the current social developments in the wider region. With this work they gave a precise delimitation of European Hellas (Greece) of that time, a few decades before the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821). According to their description this area would not only include present-day Greece, but also Albania, the Republic of Macedonia and the southern half of Bulgaria, an area that included all the areas ruled by the Macedonian Kings, in addition to those of classical Greece incorporating most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> populations of the Balkan peninsula, which was during that time under Ottoman rule.|$|E
5|$|The Greek akolouthia on Saint Jovan Vladimir, {{containing}} his hagiography, {{prayers to}} him, and hymns to be chanted in church services on his feast day, was printed in Venice in 1690. The book was reprinted with {{small changes in}} 1774 and 1858. It was written from oral traditions by the deputy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Orthodox</b> Archbishop of Ohrid, Cosmas, who resided at the Monastery of StJovan Vladimir, near Elbasan. Copies of the book were distributed to other Orthodox churches and individuals. The akolouthia was also published in 1741 in Moscopole, an Aromanian center in southeastern Albania, {{as part of a}} compilation dedicated to saints popular in that region. A shorter hagiography of the saint, based on his life contained in this akolouthia, was included in the Synaxarium composed by Nicodemus the Hagiorite, printed in Venice (1819) and Athens (1868). Cosmas's text was the basis for the Church Slavonic akolouthias on the saint, which appeared in Venice (1802) and Belgrade (1861). The latter was printed as part of the third edition of Srbljak, a compendium of akolouthias on Serb saints, published by the Serbian Orthodox Church. The saint's life in English, translated from Church Slavonic, appeared in the book Lives of the Serbian Saints, published in London in 1921 by the Anglican Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.|$|E
