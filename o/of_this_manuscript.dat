The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript's arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor LeopoldI who was a considerable patron of the arts, and opera in particular.|$|E

25|$|In February 1487, Pope Innocent VIII {{halted the}} {{proposed}} debate, {{and established a}} commission to review the orthodoxy of the 900 Theses. Although Pico answered the charges against them, thirteen of them were condemned. Pico agreed in writing to retract them, {{but he did not}} change his mind about their validity. He proceeded to write an apologia defending them, as Apologia J. Pici Mirandolani, Concordiae comitis, published in 1489, which he dedicated to his apparently very tolerant patron, Lorenzo. When the pope was apprised of the circulation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>manuscript,</b> he set up an inquisitorial tribunal, forcing Pico to renounce the Apologia, in addition to his other condemned theses, which he agreed to do.|$|E
25|$|The 11th-century eastern Qur'anic {{manuscript}} {{contains the}} 20th juz’ (section) of a Qurʼan that originally consisted of 30 parts. The arrangement into 30 parts {{corresponds to the}} number of days in the month of Ramadan, during which the Muslim is obliged to fast and to read through the whole of the Qurʼan. Other sections or fragments of this magnificent manuscript lie scattered in various collections all over the world. A Turkish note ascribes the Qurʼan to the hand of the Caliph Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, and thus demonstrates the high significance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>manuscript.</b> The text is written in Eastern Kufic, a monumental script that was developed in Iran in the late 10th century. The writing and the illumination of the manuscript bear witness to the great artistic skills of the calligrapher and the illustrator. The manuscript is at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, Germany. Out of seven complete or nearly complete semi-Kufic Qur'ans from {{before the end of the}} eleventh century, four contain a verse count. Although admittedly a small sample,it does suggest that the use of a verse count was a prevalent and quite deeply rooted practice in semi-Kufic Qur'ans between ca. 950 and ca. 1100.|$|E
25|$|Like {{a number}} of other manuscripts that {{comprise}} the Canterbury/Tiberius group, the specific provenance or place (i.e., scriptorium) of manufacture of the Book of Cerne is unknown. This issue of provenance has generated much academic debate within the literature of this Southumbian codex, especially with the two references to Bishop Ædeluald/Oeðelpald, presumably the patron of this codex, within its text. The issue partly revolves around the identity of Bishop Ædeluald/Oeðelpald mentioned in the texts. Some researchers believe that these texts refer to Bishop Ædiluald/Æthelwold (721-740 CE) of Lindisfarne in Northumbria, while others have suggested that the name refers to Bishop Ædeluald (818-830 CE) of Lichfield in Mercia. As early as 1868 J.O Westwood attributed the Book of Cerne to Lindisfarne in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Variants of this Lindisfarne recension theory have been supported by subsequent studies written by such scholars as Bishop, Henry, and Dumville. However, other researchers who favor a 9th-century Mercian original have contested this Lindisfarne hypothesis. In 1902 Kuypers recognized this issue in his study <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> where he cautiously identified the patron as the Bishop of Lichfield. More recent studies of the Book of Cerne by Moorish, Wormald, Robinson, Brown, Walker, and Webster have supported the Southumbrian/Mercian hypothesis. Brown has inferred that even if this manuscript is linked to the earlier Bishop of Lindisfarne, the orthography of the acrostic poem suggests that it may have been produced with reference to Bishop Ædeluald of Lichfield, or it was changed with him in mind.|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} Turkish paper marbling {{are thought to}} be a copy of the Hâlnâme by the poet Arifî. The text <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>manuscript</b> was rendered in a delicate cut paper découpage calligraphy by Mehmed bin Gazanfer and completed in 1540, and features many marbled and decorative paper borders. One early master by the name of Şebek is mentioned posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the Tertib-i Risâle-i Ebrî, which is dated based on internal evidence to after 1615. Several recipes in the text are accredited to this master. Another famous 18th-century master by the name of Hatip Mehmed Efendi (died 1773) is accredited with developing motifs and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from India appears to contradict some of these claims. Despite this, marbled motifs are commonly referred to as [...] "Hatip" [...] designs in Turkey today.|$|E
