5|$|The {{squadron}} {{received its}} fifth KC-30 on 3December 2012, and achieved initial <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> in February 2013. It {{expected to reach}} final <b>operating</b> <b>capability,</b> with both boom and probe-and-drogue delivery systems, in 2014. On 14September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of a}} coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the boom system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1October 2014. The first successful contact using the boom system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s for delivery in 2018, taking No.33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 passenger liners, converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe, near Madrid. The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the boom system in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No.33 Squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient squadron of the previous year, as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the {{delivery}} of Australia's first C-17s, RAAF personnel received training on the aircraft in the United States. From May 2006 a group of pilots and loadmasters led by Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the commanding officer designate of No. 36 Squadron, undertook conversion training with the USAF's C-17 units at Altus Air Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base. A group of 48 technical personnel also received training at Charleston and McChord Air Force Base from September that year. No. 36 Squadron began a period of intensive training once Corbould delivered A41-206 to Amberley on 7 December 2006, and the unit achieved initial <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> status in September 2007. Also in 2007, the RAAF's No. 1 Air Operations Support Squadron was expanded by 80 personnel to provide air load teams to support the Globemasters. A project to acquire the equipment needed to allow the RAAF's C-17s {{to be used in}} the aeromedical evacuation role and develop associated crew procedures began in late 2007. The first Globemaster aeromedical evacuation sortie was flown on 5 September 2008, the day after the type was certified to operate in this role. On 8 December 2008, Corbould led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a training flight over South East Queensland to mark the second anniversary of the entry of the Globemaster into service. A team of USAF trainers was posted to Amberley until the RAAF had sufficient C-17 pilots who were qualified to instruct others. The RAAF began training new C-17 pilots in early 2010 after the flight simulator was delivered, and the first Australian-trained pilots graduated in early May that year. No. 36 Squadron achieved final <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> status in December 2011. The components for a simulated C-17 cargo compartment were delivered to Amberley in early 2013, and this facility was commissioned in November that year. The simulator is used to train air movements and medical staff as well as to develop and trial new cargo carrying techniques for the C-17s. The first Australian-trained Globemaster loadmasters graduated in mid-2014. The final element of C-17 aircrew training to be routinely conducted in the United States was the course to qualify co-pilots as aircraft captains. This course was relocated to Australia in mid-2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{unit was}} re-established in February 1981 as a flight, {{equipped}} with two Boeing707s for VIP and other long-range transport duties out of RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. No.33 Flight was re-formed {{as a full}} squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991. No.33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008. It began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011, and achieved initial <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> with the type in February 2013. One of its aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS.|$|E
40|$|Managers {{have long}} been {{challenged}} by an abundance of internal and external demands and uncertainties in their operating environments. Anecdotal evidence {{and a growing number}} of research studies have advocated process flexibility and product innovation as organization-level <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> critical for responding to such demands and uncertainties, and have highlighted the need for more efficient and effective management of the firm's knowledge-based resources. Leveraging arguments from the resource-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, we introduce a second-order latent construct called operational intellectual capital, which represents the organization's operating know-how embedded in a system of complementary (i. e., covarying) knowledge-based resources. We argue that operational intellectual capital influences organization-level <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> such as process flexibility and product innovation, which, in turn, influence business performance. We empirically examine these relationships using structural equation modeling on a cross-section of U. S. manufacturing survey data. Statistical results from the estimation of a coalignment model and comparisons with several other models support our operational intellectual capacity conceptualization and its impact on <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> and business performance, respectively. Our research thus suggests the importance of possessing and leveraging a system of complementary knowledge-based operating resources, and addresses the need for the reformulation of operations strategy theory in terms of the emergent knowledge-based view of the firm. operations strategy, operational intellectual capital, <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities,</b> business performance, structural equation modeling...|$|R

40|$|It {{has become}} evident that our {{commercial}} air transportation system is reaching its peak in terms of capacity, with numerous delays {{in the system and}} the demand still steadily increasing. NASA, FAA, and the National Consortium for Aviation Mobility (NCAM) have partnered to aid in increasing the mobility throughout the United States through the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) project. The SATS project has been a five-year effort to provide the technical and economic basis for further national investment and policy decisions to support a small aircraft transportation system. The SATS vision is to enable people and goods to have the convenience of on-demand point-to-point travel, anywhere, anytime for both personal and business travel. This vision can be obtained by expanding near all-weather access to more than 3, 400 small community airports that are currently under-utilized throughout the United States. SATS has focused its efforts on four key <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> that have addressed new emerging technologies, procedures, and concepts {{to pave the way for}} small aircraft to operate in nearly all weather conditions at virtually any runway in the United States. These four key <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> are: Higher Volume Operations at Non-Towered/Non-Radar Airports, En Route Procedures and Systems for Integrated Fleet Operations, Lower Landing Minimums at Minimally Equipped Landing Facilities, and Increased Single Pilot Performance. The SATS project culminated with the 2005 SATS Public Demonstration in Danville, Virginia on June 5 th- 7 th, by showcasing the accomplishments achieved throughout the project and demonstrating that a small aircraft transportation system could be viable. The technologies, procedures, and concepts were successfully demonstrated to show that they were safe, effective, and affordable for small aircraft in near all weather conditions.
