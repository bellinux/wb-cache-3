40|$|EN] Scholarly {{books have}} been a {{periphery}} among the objects of study of bibliometrics until recent developments provided tools for assessment purposes. Among scholarly book publishers, University Presses (UPs hereinafter), subject to specific ends and constrains in their publishing activity, might also remain on a second-level periphery despite their relevance as scholarly book publishers. In this study the authors analyze the absolute and relative presence, overlap and uniquely-indexed cases <b>of</b> 503 <b>UPs</b> by country, among five assessment-oriented databases containing data on scholarly book publishers: Book Citation Index, Scopus, Scholarly Publishers Indicators (Spain), the lists of publishers from the Norwegian System (CRISTIN) and the lists of publishers from the Finnish System (JUFO). The comparison between commercial databases and public, national databases points towards a differential pattern: prestigious UPs in the English Speaking world represent larger shares {{and there is a}} higher overall percentage <b>of</b> <b>UPs</b> in the commercial databases, while the richness and diversity is higher in the case of national databases. Explicit or de facto biases towards production in English by commercial databases, as well as diverse indexation criteria might explain the differences observed. The analysis of the presence <b>of</b> <b>UPs</b> in different numbers of databases by country also provides a general picture of the average degree <b>of</b> diffusion <b>of</b> <b>UPs</b> among information systems. The analysis <b>of</b> ‘endemic’ <b>UPs,</b> those indexed only in one of the five databases points out to strongly different compositions <b>of</b> <b>UPs</b> in commercial and non-commercial databases. A combination of commercial and non commercial databases seems to be the optimal option for assessment purposes while the validity and desirability of the ongoing debate on the role <b>of</b> <b>UPs</b> can be also concluded.
