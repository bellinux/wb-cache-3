5|$|The loss {{of one of}} the sisters, Merope, in some Greek myths {{may reflect}} an astronomical event wherein <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> in the Pleiades {{disappeared}} from view by the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|A type Ia {{supernova}} (type one-a) {{is a type}} of supernova {{that occurs}} in binary systems (two stars orbiting one another) in which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> is a white dwarf. The other star can be anything from a giant star to an even smaller white dwarf.|$|E
5|$|In close {{binary star}} systems <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An {{example is a}} Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E

5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity of at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> {{even though they are}} unable to resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Cook {{began working}} on his new {{television}} series, Written N Black & White.

The two play an interracial newlywed couple who are comedians and their parents are clueless of the marriage.

5|$|The {{director}} {{assigned to}} the serial, which was eventually named The Quatermass Experiment, was Rudolph Cartier. A few months beforehand he had directed a play entitled It Is Midnight, Dr. Schweitzer for the BBC, and he offered the role of Quatermass to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of that play, André Morell. Morell considered the offer but declined the part, which Cartier then offered to another actor who had appeared in It Is Midnight, Dr. Schweitzer, Reginald Tate, who accepted.|$|E

5|$|The post–main-sequence {{evolution}} of binary stars may be {{significantly different from}} the {{evolution of}} single stars of the same mass. If stars in a binary system are sufficiently close, when <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> expands to become a red giant it may overflow its Roche lobe, the region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star, leading to transfer of material to the other. When the Roche lobe is violated, a variety of phenomena can result, including contact binaries, common-envelope binaries, cataclysmic variables, and type Ia supernovae.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack, {{responding}} to audience research, starts cleaning out green {{clothes from the}} set. He asks Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of TGS, how old she is, and she tells him that she is 29. As {{a result of this}} exchange, Jenna gets botox and collagen injections that go terribly wrong. Later, during a sketch rehearsal—involving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush, and John Kerry—the various mishaps of Tracy, Jenna, and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) that it would be impossible for the three to perform on the show. Fortunately, the power in the NBC Studios goes out, canceling the show.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' defense, which {{appeared}} {{strong in the}} first games of the season, faltered in later games, allowing 129 points in its final five games. During the entire season, the Hokies allowed only 185 points. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> of the Virginia Tech defense was defensive tackle Nat Williams, who had a team-best 8.5 tackles for loss amid 52 total tackles. Linebacker Steve Tate was the team's leader in tackles, recording 104. Former walk-on defensive tackle Kerwin Hairston was fifth on the team in tackles (69) and tied for third in sacks (3.5) and quarterback hurries (eight).

5|$|Vega {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied by astronomers, leading it to be termed “arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun.” Vega was the northern pole star around 12,000 BC and will be so again around the year 13,727 when the declination will be +86°14'. Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed {{and the first to}} have its spectrum recorded. It {{was one of the first}} stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements. Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale, and was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> used to define the mean values for the UBV photometric system.|$|E
25|$|Planets {{orbiting}} around <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> in binary {{systems are}} more easily detectable, as they cause perturbations in the orbits of stars themselves. However, with this method, follow-up observations are needed to determine which star the planet orbits around.|$|E

25|$|Eclipsing {{binaries}} are variable stars, {{not because}} {{the light of the}} individual components vary but because of the eclipses. The light curve of an eclipsing binary is characterized by periods of practically constant light, with periodic drops in intensity. If <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> is larger than the other, one will be obscured by a total eclipse while the other will be obscured by an annular eclipse.|$|E
