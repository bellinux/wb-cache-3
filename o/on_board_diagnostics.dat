5000|$|For {{the first}} time for a Mazda, the 626 began {{manufacturing}} overseas in the US at Flat Rock, Michigan on 1 September 1992 for the 1993 model year. The car was originally known as the [...] "626 Cronos" [...] in Canada, but dropped the Cronos for the 1996 model year. Mazda's 2.5-liter V6 engine debuted to rave reviews. Though the 626's manual transmission was highly regarded, Four-cylinder 626s from 1994 onwards used the Ford CD4E automatic transmission (designated by Mazda as LA4A-EL), which was an attempt to solve some of the 1993 model's transmission related issues. The CD4E was manufactured by Ford at their Batavia, Ohio facility. The CD4E was manufactured in Batavia, Ohio under the partnership name of ZF Batavia; a joint venture between Ford and ZF Friedrichshafen AG. It wasn't until a few years after the fourth generation of the Mazda 626 was produced that it became known for its extremely high failure rate, thus making the change in 1994 to the CD4E an irrelevant one. It is widely known to transmission specialists that the CD4E overheats due to a poorly designed valve body and torque converter. Mazda issued a couple of Technical Service Bulletins (0400502, 01598, 003/97K, 006/95) regarding the transmission and torque converter. Dealerships were briefly instructed to install an external transmission cooler, but at cost to the owner and only if requested. The CD4E was produced until 2008 at Batavia. No recall was ever issued for a single year of the CD4E, causing a loss of confidence from the general public in years to come. In 1994, a passenger side airbag was added, whilst some models of the 1994 and 1995 Mazda 626 2.0L automatics were outfitted with Ford's EEC-IV diagnostic system. In North America, the V6 spread to the LX trim in addition to the leather ES trim. New for 1996 and 1997 models were a redesigned hood (raised center portion), chrome grille fairing (attached to the hood), and the introduction of the <b>on</b> <b>Board</b> <b>Diagnostics</b> II revision (OBD-II).|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{engine oil}} {{technology}} and increased combustion efficiency {{has resulted in}} the longer oil intervals in vehicles. Current oil change interval practice only takes into account the mileage a vehicle has driven and does not consider other vehicle operations that affect oil life like extended idle. Routine oil sampling is one way to ensure optimal oil intervals, but the price continuous analysis can be prohibitive. It is possible to use <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> (OBD) data to correlate oil degradation to engine usage in order to develop an algorithm that is applicable to many vehicles. While much research has been conducted for light duty vehicles, little has been completed for heavy duty vehicles, in particular vehicles that idle a majority of their time. This study uses multiple heavy duty vehicles that are monitored by monthly routine oil analysis and logging of <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> data to determine the effects extended idle has on the wear rate of oil. The vehicles were used in their normal operation; this resulted in an average idle run time of 60 % of run time and no less than 50 % in a single vehicle. At each sample the quality of the oil and the operation of the engines were assessed. The results of the oil analysis showed very little degradation of oil. As expected, a negative correlation was seen in viscosity and total base number (TBN) but not abnormal when compared to base oil. Significant degradation was not seen even after using the vehicle passed the manufacturer recommended oil intervals. Analysis of engine operation showed that the temperature of the oil was optimal for 85 % of idle operation. In addition, oil pressures at idle were sufficiently higher than the minimum pressure recommended by the manufacturer, but was {{less than half of the}} average in use oil pressure. The combination of low pressure and optimal temperature has resulted in little oil degradation. The results from the study have shown that extended idling in the study vehicles can be treated similar to long trip interval service for oil degradation. Additionally, extended idling did not result in abnormal engine wear or excessive contamination...|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnostics}} {{and monitoring}} of the running condition of a car engine is very important and smart way to enhance the efficiency and maintenance of the engine. In the modern era almost all modern vehicles include an <b>On</b> <b>Board</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> (OBD) system. The OBD system can always monitor the running condition of engine. When the OBD system detects a malfunction in any of sensors or engine parameters, OBD regulations require the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) of the vehicle to save a standardized Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) about the information of malfunction in the memory.

40|$|The {{engine failure}} {{consisting}} in {{a lack of}} combustion in particular cylinders, commonly called as an engine misfire, is defined in the Directive 98 / 69 of the European Parliament which states that,,engine misfire means lack of combustion in the cylinder of a spark-ignition engine caused {{by a lack of}} an ignition spark, poor mixture, too low compression ratio value, or any other reason”. The engine misfire always leads to an increase in the engine exhaust system emission and it can result in an irreversible damage of the catalytic converter resulting from exceeding its admissible operating temperature. The vehicle with the damaged catalytic converter becomes an origin of an intensive emission from the engine exhaust system. Therefore the primary requirement of all OBD standards is an obligation to provide constant monitoring of the engine misfire events for the spark-ignition engines (SI) and to identify the cylinder number of the engine in which a lack of combustion occurs.

40|$|We {{study the}} PM 2. 5 and {{ultrafine}} exhaust emissions {{from a new}} natural gas-fired turbine power facility to better understand air pollution in California. To characterize the emissions from new natural gas turbines, {{a series of tests}} were performed on a GE LMS 100 gas turbine. These tests included PM 2. 5 and wet chemical tests for SO 2 /SO 3 and NH 3, as well as ultrafine (less than 100 nm in diameter) particulate matter measurements. The turbine exhaust had an average particle number concentration that was 2. 3 x 103 times higher than ambient air. The majority of these particles were nanoparticles; at the 100 nm size, stack particle concentrations were about 20 times higher than ambient, and increased to 3. 9 x 104 times higher on average in the 2. 5 - 3 nm particle size range. This study also found that ammonia emissions were higher than expected, but in compliance with permit conditions. This was possibly due to an ammonia imbalance entering the catalyst, some flue gas bypassing the catalyst, or not enough catalyst volume. SO 3 accounted for an average of 23 % of the total sulfur oxides emissions measured. Some of the SO 3 is formed in the combustion process, {{it is likely that the}} majority formed as the SO 2 in the combustion products passed across the oxidizing CO catalyst and SCR catalyst. The 100 MW turbine sampled in this study emitted particle loadings similar to those previously measured from turbines in the SCAQMD area, however, the turbine exhaust contained far more particles than ambient air. The power consumed by an air conditioner accounts for a significant fraction of the total power used by hybrid and electric vehicles especially during summer. This study examined the effect of recirculation of cabin air on power consumption of mobile air conditioners both in-lab and on-road. Real time power consumption and vehicle mileage were recorded by an <b>On</b> <b>Board</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> monitor and carbon balance method.

For this purpose have been considered the driving style influence, the traffic level, the path slope and the comfort level requested inside the vehicle by the driver. In particular the influence of auxiliary systems consumption on the total consumption of the vehicle has been evaluated. Attention has been paid to assess the effect of auxiliary systems consumption on the autonomy of the vehicle on electric mode. The data were collected under real driving cycles in the city of Rome. The importance and innovation of this work consist of two principal concepts: (i) the auxiliary systems consumption and its influences on total consumption and (ii) the acquisition analysis under real driving cycle.
